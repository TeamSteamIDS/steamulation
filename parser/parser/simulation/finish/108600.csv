								""This is the story of how you died""Project Zomboid is one of the few Zombie survival games that actually tries to have everything loved from the genre. Crafting, cooking and farming. Barricade windows and doors, build a safe house and scavenge supplies to stay alive.  Using the skills to build and cook or fight will allow you to become better at them, so there is some character progression.Also let's not forget the awesome music in this game. Highly reccomended!If I had to compare it to any games I would say it is like the sims+ Don't starve+ night of the living dead.Future plans are in place to add npc's other than zombies and polish to the engine and graphics. It really is quite addicting and a great early access title to get your hands on. Especially if you liked state of decay and wanted a little more. Also word going around that a story campaign will be put in as well.With amazing details like food degradation and injury/ illness/ exposure to cold and heat/ mood debuffs/ weapon durability/ character encumberance/ sound and light attraction of the zombies this game can be a nice challenge on the nice open maps. It isn't an FPS but it plays great and has similar controls to an FPS.Just remember this is Early Access and there are some bugs and such. As it stands the game is very much in a good playable state and well worth the money.  Hearing about the coming changes to this title, I am even more stoked about this particular purchase.

								One or two years ago, I'm not sure why, I bought this game, probably thinking ""that's a team of devs whose project I want to get behind!""a month later I dropped the game, thinking it was unplayable and would most likely never be finished....I was wrong as poultry with dentures!!in-depth doesn't even start to describe it, the gameplay might scare you away but it's efficient once you grasp the goals at hand. just act with your best judgmentfirst game in a year:- me and a friend meet up near muldraugh, when I get there he tells me he's got attacked, he's wounded.- fleeing the undead, he got lost and bumped into an abbandoned lumber mill with solid metal doors.- he gives me directions. I see where he is. while I struggle to get drugs, bandages and disinfectant, he discovers the joys of stitching oneself.- we join and, while he recovers from his wounds, I board the place up and gather all the wood and tools I can. we sleep in the break room. they're 5 feets away, clawing at the boards. they never break in.- after a few days we start scavenging the suburbs, just what we need, we have projects.- a few weeks later, we're settled, the crops we planted on the roof after transporting some dirt there is flourishing. days passed by, peacefully. the place is clear and we start to feel in control. he picks up cooking.- one night, I hear moans and cracks, the building's on fire. whole groups of them came to see it. my friend passed out while cooking and canning food for the winter.- he almost dies in the fire to save the seeds and tools we couldn't survive without.- once set up in a smaller building, we heal and consume all our reserves, the meds are gone and the water shuts off. we peek outside.- the Z's have massed, we can't reclaim enough terrain for a field or rain collectors. after making an inventory of what's left we decide to loot the gun store, one town away. we'll have to get out anyway and at least, if we go there, we could clean our home afterwards.- the way there is easy, we're well rested, fed and hydrated. we run there, only stopping for the night in a gas station half way- just before we arrive, we're starving. we ate all our food, drank all our water.... we see a supermarket!- we drink soda and eat meat for the first time in a month. we're safe in the offices, the stairs are broken. we can rest peacefully and the shop is within a stone throw.-the next morning we silently climb down the roof with a rope made of bloody clothes.- the score is easy. I distract them, shooting our few last bullets and run into the woods while he brings down the metal roll-up door of the gunshop as fast as he can with a sledgehammer.- we've got 'em! we're armed to the teeth and we paint our way out of town red.- I already aim better by the time we reach the gas station. it's a tough fight to reclaim it and I get scrached. a cold gives me fever and I freak out at the idea I might be infected. I drink and smoke all night to forget the worries.- by the morning I'm all better (besides the hangover but who cares, I live!) but my friend is nauseous. he didn't rest and looks sickly. he tells me he thought we were above use-by dates. after surviving what we did. he couldn't just die from bad cabbage... could he?- a few miles later, he can't run anymore. I run my lungs out, straight to the city. he'll die if I can't get him supplies.- before he stops answering he says this:  ""I can't run anymore. I'm exhausted, sick, wounded. they'll catch me soon"" I have to go back.- I put the gun bags down, raid the first house I find for basic pharmacy goods and just run his way.- I battled to find his bright orange shirt in what's left of his last stand and found him.  brought him peace, losing some flesh on the way.-I was now the one wounded, exhausted, sick and lost. alone on a country road with a dead friend, his murderers and three sports bags full of guns and bullets...we had played 13 hrs straight at that point. no rage or regrets. just ideas for next time... seriously, buy it. now.

								I've lived entire lives in this game.  Braved bitter winters.  Sorted and labeled crates of canned food, wondering how long it would last me.  Tended crops and cursed the misfortune of plant disease.  Fractured my leg and holed up in the corner of some dilapidated warehouse dying of thirst since I lacked the speed to get home safely.  I've lived a thousand lives and felt the touch of death so many times, now I'm only surprised when it doesn't come swiftly.What I've learned is that death isn't failure, no, it's a sweet release.  Make no mistake, I've survived for a long time, built impregnable safehouses with self-sustaining crops, high above where any zombie could reach.  But that is simply a different kind of death, death in the form of boredom, but it is a death all the same.  It makes sense though, doesn't it?  You are the last person on Earth, the world is filled with endless zombies, there is no happy ending to all of this.But the point isn't to survive, the point is to create your own tale, make a snapshot of experiences that are memorable.  This game is really just an analogy for life and death, compressed into a few hours at a time, and how you choose to spend your time reflects on your personality.  How will you keep death at bay?  Will you build walls, will you hide, will you run as far away as you can, or will you pick up an axe and try to fight it?  It doesn't matter, death will find you in the end, but it will be a hell of a journey.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Okay so here goes.  I am a State Level Emergency Manager, and I saw this game when I was recovering after a hospital stay.  What they say they deliver not only is it a great game one of the only truly open ended games I have ever seen.   It also follows pretty much what would happen theoretically during a wide scale Emergency Event. The Vanilla game is good, drop some Mods onto it and the entire game gets a depth that I have not seen in other franchises.  I have well over 2000 hours played on this game, but it needs to be said if you like a thought provoking game, where you will pay dearly for complaceny then this is the game for you.  If you want a mindless game set in the zombie world then this is not the game for you.I have to say this game will be one I play for years and with the mods and multi aspect of it it can be immersive as you want it.  I played it with my kids (there is an option to lift the zombies out) and tought them some fundamental survival skills though a game normal survival concepts work and pay off.I have also found the team at Indie Stone to be highly responsive to their gaming community and their pride in product shows.  I recently showed this product to several state level emergency managers and they were impressed at the implications and concepts that could be taught, ala the Oregon Traill game in the early 90s.I have not lived that long with any of my characters:   top one year - however I understood how I died and in this game you learn from your mistakes, dont make them again and you live longer.In closing thank you Indie Stone and thank you to all the Mod Developers and people that make this game so good and give it a depth that is almost never reachedPS as a SWAT guy the building clearing dynamics work well. . . .eventhough you would not prefer to do this alone			",9,0,0,3,4,0,11

								You should play this game. It's definitely not Resident Evil. And that is a good thing. Seriously. You even have a demo available. Play it.Why is this man, who has only a few hours invested in the game ordering you around? Well...Even though my hour count states that i've just bought my game, that is not exactly true. I played this game a lot a while back when it was still on Desura and I think I really can give you guys an objective opinion here.The fact that the game is flawed is true, yet i always thought this is the game that zombie fans deserved. It's not some cheerful ""sit with your friends and giggle while blowing zombie heads off"" game like Left 4 Dead series were. I mean, i like L4D, but it never got right what i really wanted off an zombie game. It's also not wannabe ""scary and atmospheric horror game"" like Resident Evil that's in the end just funny, especially with the addition of co-op in RE5 which has broken every last bit of atmosphere that Resident Evil 1 and 2 had. (Seriously if you haven't play the old Resident Evils, they are good)This game can be easily compared to DayZ to some degree, in the aspect that both of them make you feel like a masochist and that both of them consist of learning by trial and error. By fire. The games differ in the fact that DayZ is action filled and most of your playthroughs are ended by an infamous axe-guy that doesn't want to cooperate, and zombies (even with their fixed and upgraded AI's) feel more like an annoyance then a threat, while in Project Zomboid many times i died just because some zombie slowly shambled 30 meters behind me and i forgot to dispatch it before it came to my house. It broke my window and in the middle of the night hell broke loose.This game is a game where every one of your playthroughs will learn you a new thing, where you will evolve from a guy that runs around with a butter knife and tries to kill as much zombies as possible before dying a slow and painful death, to a guy that silently scavenges whole blocks of buildings, and knows how not to take unnecessary risks.If you take into consideration the fact that this game now also HAS MULTIPLAYER. So if you feel like shooting some zombies with your friends, that is just one more reason to try this game out. Also, keep in mind that multiplayer is also in its early stages, but for me it worked like a charm.The cons are that the control system is kinda weird to get used to, and that the game doesn't really instruct you that much about all the dangers of the world, and believe me, they are many.Many times you will find yourself dying of just one lucky bite or of the cold that you ignored for too long. There are many many little things that make this game a true zombie apocalypse simulator, not just another action game that includes zombies. But, also i have to mention a really friendly and awesome community over at game forums that will answer most of your questions and help you in any way possible.TL;DR VERSION: The game has a steep learning curve and is really not your ""everyday zombie game"". If you are, on the other hand, looking for a closest thing to an zombie apocalypse simulator, you have to at least download the demo and try the game. It's a wonderful game with many details that make it really atmospheric and easy to immerse yourself into.EDITED 21.06.2014. - Yay! They added multiplayer			",154,18,2,28,10,1,35

								Hey nasKo, this is for you: 🖕🏻WARNING: Don't buy this game, read first. Important notice: I was banned off their forums and project zomboids general discussion on steam for saying stuff they disagreed with. They didn't give me a turn to speak in response to what they've said, so I'm not going to give them one either. As in the wise words of nasKo himself: ""... we don't have to host you being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥."". Neither do I, so say goodbye to any comments made by the PZ Team or their moderators. Progress is a funny word; it seems like it changes on a daily basis for the Project Zomboid team.I've been a member since 2012, developer of the first would-be project zomboid overhaul mod, and an overall fair rater.  they were making really great progress all the way up until they started to lie. For the last 2 1/2 years, the community of this game has been manipulated into thinking that things are going to get done. These things include (but are not limited to): Cars, NPC's, moving/roaming/interactable animals, and most importantly, animations. There is a lot I want to say. Me and my brother are private modders who play with our own version of Zomboid and we get fed up with these lies the team makes every Mondoid and game update. It's about time they start listening to the other half of their community if they wish to still have what they call ""supporters"" in the future.Animations, oh ♥♥♥♥ lol, I remember back in 2015 when they mentioned they had started working on them. Of course, it was a time when Jeb made the model loader and things were going smooth in the project zomboid community. The forums had frequent mod updates, posts, and requests for help or making other mods. Everything seemed as planned, they weren't really breaking any promises. However, mid-2015 was when they started to do less, and less. Think about this, 6 years in development, and it isnt really that hard to develop this within 6 years. Hell, there is already 1 guy who made working cars, survivors, and a chainsaw.Now lets go to 2016: A year of lies, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttery, and removal of a very good modder. If any of you used ModelLoader in the past, be thankful to Jeb, he created it. He was accused of his model config files being used to hack RedBoid (a popular project zomboid server), and thus caught♥♥♥♥♥♥from the project zomboid administration. However, the administration team and redboid had little to no evidence of this, and went off a limp leg. The project zomboid's team's comments were very childish (except for a few) and gave no ground for Jeb to disprove them. I've talked to Jeb, and there is no way his files could of been used for such a purpose. Lets move on to the animations, shall we? As I've stated before, they started in 2015 working on them. There was pretty good progress (or so it seemed), up until they just kept making excuses in 2016. They kept saying, we got bugs, we got problems, balblalbalblablablalb. It was understandable at first, but they had a new 365+ days to work on them. If it takes you that long to make animations with a development team like yours, that is just pathetic. Still in March 2017, it seems like they left that idea in the gutter, just like they did with NPC's. They have the same problem I've noticed with DayZ: Start working on it constantly, respond to the community early on. Next, wait 2 years, bait community and start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the game by making excuses and lies. If anyone complains, say that your team is working hard and its early access, while in reality you just sit on your♥♥♥♥♥with the money you made from people who bought this game. Then the next year, you just ignore the community and barely even work on the game.Stop being lazy project zomboid devs, you are better than this. I remember when you worked your asses off to provide us a game with meaning and it wasn't the same thing everytime! I'm sick of running around by myself in empty houses, and seeing that OUR community are the ones developing the main things that you promised! You DIDN'T develop working cars first! A STEAM workshop community member did! You DIDN'T develop working NPC's that are very interactive! A STEAM workshop community member did! You DIDN'T make the source code to the movable objects! A community member did! It makes me sad seeing this game and its team digging itself a grave right now. I trusted you guys, instead you just took a♥♥♥♥♥♥on my face like you've done to so many others. Some of them still have the♥♥♥♥♥♥on their face and are brainwashed into thinking the project zomboid team is actually working on these things for real.EDIT:Wait a minute! -clears throat-, i forgot to include a few other things! You know the person who wanted to create fully working animals? Oh my bad, he got banned off the forums for being ""wrong""! If you ever create something and have a discussion/argument with the development team because they started♥♥♥♥♥♥with you first, you end up getting blamed and harassed for it. I've gotten sick of their hypocrisy on the forums; everything the admin does is right, but if the member catches the admin breaking the rules or stepping out of line, they get punished for saying the right things. I'm very unhappy to see Jeb and the creator of the animal mod depart from this once great game.Also, an extra thing about animations: Ever notice they say, ""We just have to fix it up!"", or, ""Just some minor changes to be made before its released!, or even better, ""They will be out next build, we just have to add a few more things and tweak it a little!"". Gives me a good ol' slap on the knee because I know it isn't true.I want to also mention sound replacements; currently, there is no way to replace zombie or ambient sounds because, the dumb♥♥♥♥♥Dev's put them in .bank files to prevent theft. If someone really wanted to steal your sounds all they would need is audacity and patience. Besides, your game isn't really coded to prevent piracy, people can still use the old executable from previous builds to execute your game and play it.Multiplayer character saving, oh yes, everyones favorite. It wasn't really the intention of the developers to leave this lying around, but it is something that needs to be addressed. Players can die, but have their old multiplayer character files saved on their computer, then just copy + paste right in the Zomboid/Saves/Multiplayer folder like it was nothing. It's always bothered me knowing that everyone is unkillable, unless they get caught by a professional anti-exploit script/tool, or a very aware admin and/or community. I get sick of have seeing people with level 10 sprinting running at unhuman speeds. Just because you've jogged for 1 month doesn't mean you're a god damn Bugati. I rest my case, and zomboid rests in its coffin currently. Hope some grave robber, or even the people who gave birth to zomboid come back and revive it. My guess is that the community will end up leading this game instead of the original developers. Its a sad ending, but at least we will have someone to rest our hope on.			",37,1,0,6,2,0,1

								A fantastic zombie apocalypse simulator, helmed by one of the nicest and most determined developers I've ever seen in the industry.The game starts by spawning you at a random location in a massive world map filled with flesh-craving zombies (Which you can fully customize... want a shambler? Runner? No problem, the game allows you to change almost every aspect of your undead foes.) after which, you must then search for supplies and an adequate safehouse for survival. The game is very hardcore, with permadeath as well as essentially an insta-kill system, if you get attacked by a zombie, you either get bitten or scratched, being scratched has a small chance of you becoming infected, while being bitten is pretty much always going to infect you (95% chance I believe). Infection leads to a slow, unavoidable death.The game also has multiplayer, however it lags a good deal for me to the point where it just isn't fun, but I do have extremely poor internet, so it probably will be a lot of fun for those with proper internet.The developers are also currently working on an amazing NPC system that could very much rocket this game into one of my favorites of all time, it's supposed to be able to generate events that are similar to situations from the walking dead, but randomly!Of course... being early access does mean that the game has bugs, it is however fairly stable from what I've played so far. But it does have a fair share of annoying bugs and issues, particularly with the UI.Overall... I can't recommend this game enough, it's just amazing so far, and they're planning on adding a huge amount of stuff that'll make the game even more worth the purchase! If you like zombie games, and extremely nice and helpful development teams and communites centered around your games, then you should get this game.I would recommend if you wish to research the game, that you watch recent let's plays, while you can read the wiki, it seems to be outdated in cetain aspects, and probably will remain so until the developers stop updating the game so regularly.Here's the wiki link: http://pzwiki.net/wiki/Survival_GuideNote: this was the first review I've ever made. I also kind of suck with my paragraphs, so give me a little slack :PAnother Note: I had a section here where I said what things had been added since I first made this review, but decided to delete it since I wasn't updating the section, and I don't think that would give justice to how much stuff they actually have added into the game since this review was published.

Project Zomboid  Field Rating Review   Graphics 7.5 Zomboid chose an art style and stuck with it, and it worked out great. Animations are fitting, and satisfying. Though there are still several glitches, I have no doubt they will be worked out and fixed.   Gameplay 8.5 A uniquely fun twist on the giant list of Zombie games, Project Zomboid actually brings back the feeling of surviving the zombie outbreak, not just simply gunning your way through it. Has a classic RPG skill picker, with several crafting elements. Brutally merciless, Zomboid doesn't want you to live to see the next morning. With a unique take on your characters field of view and LoS, Zomboid challenges you to stay alert and aware of everything going on around you. There are still several kinks they need to work out for combat and some actions, and it take a long, long time to level up your skills, but the updates steadily roll in and it gets better with each update!   Story N/A Not much of a story currently in the game, though there is one in the works.   Multiplayer 10 An absolute blast with your friends. Gather as many as you want, host your own server (or join an online one) and figure out how to survive together. Or watch as your ragtag group crumbles into some twisted Walking Dead equivalant society. Work together to build a fort and prepare to live as long as you can. Set out on expeditions into town to gather supplies, and watch in horror as your friend is mauled to death, and there's nothing you can do but run.   Replayability 10 You can keep coming back to Zomboid for more and more. Currently the end-game is a bit easy, but they are still pushing out plenty of updates for the game, and are working on making it even more difficult. An absolute blast to play over and over with your friends.   Overall 9/10 The most refreshing take on Zombies you will have yet. So many Zombie games anymore are simply shooters, and the survival element is lost. However, in Zomboid, every movement, and every moment, count. Didn't check that dark corner before you rummaged through the house? That zombie just jumped you and bit you, and now you might turn. Do you tell your group, or press on and hope it blows over? Made the mistake of running to fast? The zombies have heard you, and the horde is coming. It's not a matter of if you'll die, simply a matter of when. How quickly that happens is entirely up to you. A must buy for zombie-survival fanatics.

								One of my absolute favorite games of all time; however it still needs a lot of work.No other game has ever captured the true essence of zombie apocalypse as Project Zomboid has.In Zomboid you have to be smart, resourceful and careful. In many cases, not scouting out and planning your approach could very easily mean your death. Zombies are a real threat here; the smallest scratch can be fatal. Despite the graphics and the camera style (which personally I love), there have been some situations that have had my heart racing and my hair left standing up. The smallest event can have great consequences if incorrectly handled. Don’t like your slow, one-bite-kill zombies? Customise them the way you like in the sandbox mode! Live in the zombie apocalypse you want, with the world rules you want! Don’t like that the water and electricity shut off after a few weeks? Change it! Don’t like the way the zombie virus is spread? Change it! Maybe you’re a fast runner Left 4 Dead type zombie lover (good luck you crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) or maybe you like the slow but intelligent zombies that open doors and like to watch you sleep… All up to you!Zomboid is the zombie game for the strategic man, the man that thinks before he does and the man that cries himself to sleep at night. If you are any of those things… This game is a thrill to play! I have yet to try out the multiplayer, but I’m sure it’ll be a blast.  ",186,52,1,18,12,3,17

Let me sum up the bad reviews:- Game had a great demo back in 2011. looked great.- Game goes on preorder.- Game goes on early access.- Devs take out half the features, promise to put them in later.- Devs keep updating the game more or less.- Years pass.- Devs realize they already got paid, basically abandon the game.- 2017, the most wanted features are still missing. NPCs. Physics.- Game still in Early Access.R.I.P.VERDICT:For Newcomers: For 13,99 still a fun game, still above average compared to the usual indie survival crap. Gets boring quickly though. But still nice.For Supporters: A slap in the face. A disappointment. A damn shame.From my perspective: I'm torn. But ultimately a thumbs down, for the empty promises and Early Access BS. :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I woke up one morning cold and dreary. To find the monsters outside my window bold and eerie.I grasped my lucky baseball bat and swung hard into the black.

								I've never played a better game than Project Zomboid. I play this regularly, both single player and on a 360 controller coop with my girlfriend. Its an amazing experience to try and survive together, even more so against people online on our own locally hosted server!The Pro's?- Amazing Dev team that really care about the end product, even with the setbacks they've faced in the past they kept going!- Good replayability and customization!- There's a lot to do!- One day we will have AI, Vehicles and hookers. In fact, forget the hookers. - Big community who keep modding the game, and the developers are using some parts of this to advance the games development!- Multiplayer!- Updates that really add to the game each time! (plus its actually updated unlike some other titles!) - News via their website every Monday that lets you know what they're doing to the game, (can also sign up to the news letter) usually quite a nice read!Cons- It can get repetitive building and killing zombies, haha who am I kidding it never gets old!- The only objective is to survive, so you do need to either have an obsessive hoarding disorder (lol) or simply enjoy surviving to get the most out of this gameEDIT: Bit of advice, if playing co-op, always check the oven!

								If you've ever watched/read a Zombie Thriller and thought that you yourself could do better than its characters at surviving a Zambo Apocanips, here's your chance. P. Zomboid offers what seems to be the most complete ""Zombie Survival"" experience (with graphics) there is by providing a huge amount of elements that range from putting yourself together on Day 0 and scavenging for supplies to stabilishing a fortified farm house months later, everything in between included. A sandbox mode allows you to create your own Apocalypse-to-Survive by permitting you to edit the Zombie Lore and behavior along with map conditions.Despite being far from finished, the game is very much enjoyable in its current state and has a fair amount of big features yet to be impletemented - such as Online Multiplayer, NPC survivors & interactivity along with many more crafting options. Having been in production for years along with getting an engine reboot, the development has been picking up a faster pace in the last few months and doesn't seem to be halting anytime soon; with its ample modding support, Project Zomboid just might end up being the next big thing, one that is definitely worth picking up at its currently discounted dev price ($15). There is also a demo of the current build available which is worth checking out.special thanks to gangan for being such a charitable brassknuckles wielding monk			",242,31,4,22,22,1,22

								OK, review time. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. It's one hell of a fun game that just keeps getting better with each new build. It's not perfect, there are still a few rough edges, but the Devs are busting their butts to get everything working properly. The gameplay is surprisingly addicting, sometimes I look at the clock and wonder where the last 4 hours went, but looking at my fort shows me where they went.There are some great elements of the game still being worked on (NPC's, Map Expansion) that will certainly alter the current games play style. No longer will we be ""limited"" to just raiding Muldraugh, West Point, or the ""New(ish)"" Mall area/recent expansion......which to be perfectly honest is quite a bit of looting to begin with. It honestly necessitates a new Safehouse/Fortress for each area as carrying all the stuff you find between forts would be kind of pointless...as the current map is that big....(map link) http://pzmap.crash-override.net/ and the planned additions of Louisville, Fort Knox and whatever lies in between them will make this a HUGE map.My play style is a little Kamikaze(ish), i love to get a Nailed Baseball Bat or an Axe and take on a horde or two, just swinging away till either the zombies are dead, my weapon breaks, or i have to run and get bandaged up.....maybe have my character drink some bleach if the zombies made me bleed. Consequently, i rarely have a character last much beyond a month in the game. But that's the fun of the game, it lulls you into thinking that you are ""Too Good"" for the mere zombies to hurt....until they get you surrounded and you remember that you swore to yourself last time, that you would not let that happen again.But don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself and see how well you do. Just remember the words on the screen at the beginning of the game ""This is how you died""EDIT on November 30, 2014As i write this we have just had a recent hotfix of Build 30, which brought in a Medical Overhaul. I have fallen out of windows and broken feet and legs, requiring me to bandage and splint the injuries then just wait for it to heal. I have cut my hands climbing in thru broken windows, had to get some tweezers and pry out the lodged glass before bandaging, possibly having to stitch the wound. Been scratched and bitten by zombies, requiring me to disinfect, stitch/bandage the wound and hope i did not get infected.Of course, before i can do any of this, i had to locate the needed medical equipment at various locations on the map. With the new overhaul, it's even possible to bleed out from a bad wound if i cannot locate some band aids, bandages, or even some sheets or clothing to rip up for use as a low grade bandage. One nice thing is the ability to clean a bandage for reuse.I swear, every new build the Devs come up with just continues to draw you in and add more game immersion, and they have plans to ""adjust"" the game to make it harder for you to survive a lengthy amount of time. The MP has continued to improve, with more and more Game Server companies starting to add PZ to their inventory.  And i just realized i did not mention some of the other new things in the latest Build (30.3) We have more Sandbox options available when starting a new game, including adjusting how often Zombies respawn, whether or not you want random loot respawn and it's frequency.OH yeah, the incredible Erosion mod has been integrated into the base game which literally is Mother Nature taking over the map...vines growing up buildings, cracks in pavement, trees losing their leaves as fall approaches then regrowing as spring comes, bushes and trees growing in places where we Humans would remove them, SNOW, and so much more that i just cannot think of right now.OK, I don't want this to be a 10,000 word review so i'll stop here. but as before, if you would like to see some gameplay there are plety of videos on youtube from guys like MatthasGames and Eckyman. Or, check on Twitch or Hitbox and catch a live stream. Either way, I hope you enjoy what you see and you too join the Zomboid community.			",2,0,0,1,9,0,0

Early Access Review
								After 290 hours of game-play I feel like I can finally give a full review of the game.Let's start with the good:The game-play is fantastic. I have never had such a realistic zombie experience with an in-depth (But limited) world. The player really gets a sense of being alone, with zombies around every corner. You have to carefully ration food and manage your noise levels. Also, be aware of having a proper nutritious meal every now and then or you might still starve! This game can EASILY take 10 hours of your time if you let it. Not to mention the fun and engaging leveling system in which you can customize your character. I also REALLY enjoyed the food/cooking system. If you get this game for free, or for 10 dollars - hell yes.Let's get to the point though.After 290 hours of game-play, over ~4-5 years of development, the game has changed very little. Besides a graphical overhaul/engine overhaul the gameplay remains the same. ""Why is this a problem?"" - you may ask. Well I have to respectfully say that the gameplay becomes dull and repetitive once you reach the 'end game'. Once you learn the lack-luster combat mechanics (Which was promised an overhaul over 2 years ago?) zombies are no longer a challenge. That's right. The games BIGGEST BADDIE is no longer a challenge once you get a nice baseball bat. If you decide to turn up the zombie count...well...you are still faced with the eventual same problem except with the exception of a single helicopter bringing hundreds of zombies to your location, and the only REAL way to deal with them is by lighting the horde on fire or using those nice OP bombs. And forget being able to see the majority of this amazing map they created - there is no way to travel except by foot. Which becomes dull very fast if you want to go check out the mall on the other end of the world. And while exploring the world is initially exciting there is not much to find besides an empty world full of zeds. No other AI survivors. No vehicles. Just woods and a few buildings.  The world feels empty and lifeless, and besides nature slowly taking over the world it, the environment does not change with any interesting or challenging mechanics.So that's my biggest complaint.Now for the 2nd challenge this game has.The multiplayer.The multiplayer makes the game so much more enjoyable...except for the fact that it makes the above problems WORSE. And if you have too many zombies on the screen they begin to warp around and teleport (MAGICAL ZOMBIES!!). I have seen this on several dedicated servers.Sigh...that's not all. Because my friends and I LOVE this game. We thought ""HEY! The game has SPRINTING zombies!!! Those are good because they are DIFFICULT and make the game SCARY and a small group of zombies is VERY FUN to fight against!""Well. Sprinting zombies work good in singleplayer. But DO NOT work in multiplayer as they warp around terribly and teleport every which way. This has been a bug for YEARS. Which leads to the 3rd challenge this game has:The development team. The development team moves slower than any other team I have seen. If you do not watch the news of the game you would believe the game was abandoned. Sure, they have frequent updates. But no true new game mechanics that actually create new challenges for the game. Enemy AI have been promised for ~2 years and they are using valves ""It's done when it's done"" as an excuse.When reporting the teleporting sprinting zombie bug for nearly 2 years the dev's eventual response was exactly this:""The option will be removed from MP at later date."" - EngimaGreyNo explanation as to why. Just simply saying ""It would be too hard to do"". Come on.After nearly 2000 hours in development for ArmA mods and talking to many other developers I know that ""It would be too hard"" = ""We don't want to tackle that challenge because we are lazy."" (Or as others say ""Too busy"", because prioritization is NOT a thing with this team).It simply comes down to the developers struggling to put the work into their game that it desperately needs. It is difficult to compare apples to oranges, but when looking at many other EA games their work pales. I can do without the additional food recipes, please give me AI to interact with. Please give me a difficult zombie curve. Please add more gameplay options for the late-game. Please add a purpose or goal for this world. Why am I surviving? What obstacle is there to overcome once you have that nice baseball bat and enough food?I will change this review as updates come along but I am significantly dissapointed with the direction of development.To wrap it all upThis game offers a VERY FUN experience for the initial few run throughs and I recommend it for free to 10 dollars (Which is subjective, I know)I would wait to purchase this game if you are waiting for more meaningful mechanics to come into play. Because you might be waiting another 2-3 years for the first introduction of anything really impactful to gameplay.Frequent Responses:1) It is difficult to include feature X! You can't expect them to include feature X because of that.Coding and working on a game takes massive time, dedication, patience, and skill. Just because something is difficult does not exempt it from examination. Having a proper working government is difficult to do, however that difficulty does not exempt it from criticism. Still, it is the developers right to NOT do something and I can not fault them for taking the game a direction they want. However, this does nothing to lessen the dissapointment of NOT having sprinting zombies just because of a percieved difficulty. It was one, of several promising mechanics to keep the game fresh which was removed before it ever really worked.2)You played it for 290 hours...How could you not give it a good review?Hours played have no bearing of my final satisfaction of the game. After 290 hours of gameplay I feel very dissapointed in the state of this game and very doubtful of the future of this game. Compare this to other games in my library: (Only 2 due to space issues)7 Days to Die : 906 Hours - Still love this game to death. I don't play it as much but would still recommend it heavily.Doom: 49 Hours - I do not play this anymore, but would still heavily recommend this to people. Not dissapointed with the purchase.At the end of the day I can look back at MANY other games with over 50+ hours and not feel regret. Project Zomboid, for many reasons, has left me with no urge to return to the game as the development team continues to abuse the early access system and continue to pat themselves on the back for next-to-nothing updates.

Project Zomboid is one of those rare zombie survival games that actually encourages you to survive in stead of facing wave after wave of the undead. It's truely unique with a visual style that may sadly not attract anyone, but its deep surviving system makes Project Zomboid one of the best zombie survival games in recent memory.The Good:· Zombies aren't the only threat: you'll have to eat, drink, rest, calm down and avoid sickness among others in order to survive.· A simple yet clear looting system: there's your basic inventory and additional backpacks to carry more stuff around.· Retreat and recreate:  you could go outside and risk your life for some fresh water, or you can find a well-placed house your new home. Once you have what you need you can cover up the windows with sheets, stack your food and other recourses in fridges, closets and many others, relying on the water from the tap and the vegetables you plant. · Be the survivor you want to be for as long as you can: it's almost certain that you will die within the first half hour of playing Project Zomboid. Hell, I still die every half hour. But that teaches you that your approach to a certain situation was wrong. Did you kill al the zombies but died from a cold? Or did you try to stay inside and were forced out when all the food ran out? You can scavenge all houses (if you can make it that far, that is), you can choose a certain location and hold your ground, you can try to kill countless infected in order to scavenge in peace and so on. Options are almost limitless.· A true zombie survival experience: forget games like Resident Evil or Left 4 Dead that have you mowing down zombie after zombie in order to survive and progress. In Project Zomboid zombies can be the least of your worries when you play your cards right.The Bad:· It's still in pre alpha, so some of the mechanics could use some extra polishing. The devs have been very active and do their very best to fix even the smallest of issues however, so I put my faith in them one hundred percent. This is the zombie game you'll want to play none the less, pre alpha or not.· The style of the game may not appeal to anyone. It feels pretty retro and yet uniquely innovative at the same time, so slapping a certain style on it isn't as easy as you'd think.The Ugly:· Project Zomboid is gorgeous for what it aims to be. Obviously triple-A quality isn't expected (once again, depends on the style you like) but it manages to be pretty enough in terms of animations and effects to be immersive none the less.Final Verdict:I have played unfortunately little games like Project Zomboid and I'm very glad the devs managed to create a one-of-a-kind zombie survival experience like this. It's thrilling, it's atmospheric, and it's everything you'll love from the zombie-genre. 8.5/10			",390,58,3,28,19,1,29

								Day 1: Started out with my friend. We spawned in different locations. I made a safehouse and gathered stuff, while he did the same.Day 2: Friend died from horde. He made a new character and started over. I barricaded my safehouse and gathered more stuff.Day 3: We tried finding each other, and through the helpful use of a map, no thanks to the game, we found each other.Day 4: We explored around the area and looted everything we found.Day 5: I went to another place, while he tried to find a good 2nd safehouse. Gunshots around him with the horde following, so he retreated back to the safehouse. I looted stuff at the motel.Day 6: We both went around looking for a good safehouse, and finally found one. After putting sheets on the windows and gathering food and weapons, a chopper passed through.It was the most intense situation I've seen, with more than 15 zombies coming right at us. We fought the horde, and through some exploitation of AI we were able to kill them.Day 7: Looting around the 2nd safehouse. Unfortunately, I got bitten by a bathroom zombie. I had an injury, wrapped it with Ripped Sheets and took painkillers. A few in-game hours later I started feeling nauseousDay 8: We were looting around and found another horde of zombies. Killed it and looted some more. After getting back to the 2nd safehouse I started feeling Sick. Looked it up on Zomboid Wiki and we arrived to the conclusion that I'm infected.Night 8: Me and my friend ran around the safehouse naked. He was trying to kill me because I might turn into a zombie. We both tried hitting each other. Then he had this great idea. ""Why don't you try jumping off the windows?""I said ""Sure, why not."" and thought ""I'm gonna die anyway.""So I jumped out the window. I fell, naked, only with boxers. My friend was watching right outside the house. As I landed, we laughed heartily as my character did a non-fitting death animation and died.10/10 would jump againPlaythroughs aside, this game is absolutely great. Bunch of complex mechanics, fun on both singleplayer and multiplayer. Mondoids(regular Monday reports) keep the community updated about the game's development. The great thing is, the progress is fast, and definitely has the quality. The devs listen to the community's suggestions.I suggest getting this even on Early Access. This is probably on the top 10 most progressive Early Access games on Steam. Get it, you will not regret your purchase.			",141,11,5,26,8,0,21

								While Zomboid is a great game for anyone who likes hardcore survival games, one aspect I'd like to talk about is the multiplayer. This game has something that I've never seen before in other zombie survival games. This game encourages you to team up with others and support eachother. Sure, there are people who will kill you for your stuff, but I have never met any. I think that this is because of how realistic the game is. Keep in mind that this is a game where broken bones and injuries take a pretty long time to heal, and you don't just bounce back. Additionally, food and weapons are not readily available in multiplayer. It gets to the point where the game is so hard that teaming up with others is an obviously wise move, compared to murdering them for the rare chance that they have a weapon or food. What I'm saying is that this game often makes you think like you're in an actual zombie apocalypse situation, where people are worth more than just what items they have.Once I fell out of a two story building's window and ended up breaking a leg. Remember, Project Zomboid is not a game where mending broken bones and injuries just means slapping on a bandage. Broken bones are supposed to take weeks to heal in this game. And to add insult to literal injury, broken bones make you slower than a sloth. Luckily, I was with other people, but without them, I would have been easily a meal for zombies.My point is that if you enjoy realistic and difficult zombie survival games, where the emphasis is on surviving, and not killing other survivors, then by all means, do get this game.

								Enjoying this game a lot. For an Early Access game the experience has been pretty darn good (not too many bugs). My only gripe is that at some point you may realize there's really no point to playing the game other than to see if you could survive a little longer. Still the gameplay is intense enough to keep you coming back to see if you could survive just one more day!			",135,15,0,12,8,0,12

								This is a very good game. Latest Edit: June 29, 2015Pros:Zombies don't 'spawn' in.All the zombies in the town spawn at the start. Zombies can't spawn inside the safe area you set up. Realistic, and also an issue a lot of games get wrong. This also makes it technically possible to kill ALL the zombies in the game - good luck with that though.Edit: Zombies do now spawn in, but not in areas you are in - aka no 'magic zombies' like I mentioned above. Sandbox options allow this to be tweaked.The isometric style works well for the genre. The more 'old school' method of graphics actually enhances gameplay - especially if you are playing on a lower spec PC. You can have hundreds of zombies comming at you - and its not going to crash or lag. This simply cannot be accomplished realistically and effectively in a full 3d first person high-res format.You aren't a super man.You can't carry 6000 cubic feet of dirt, or wood, or potato chips. You are forced to make realistic decisions as you would in a real zombie apocalypse. Simply running through and clicking a 'loot all' button is not how this game functions. Also, don't expect to jump 6 feet into the air, or run 35 miles per hour either (Edit, a very fast character is currently possible, but with severe drawbacks). You also have realistic amounts of ammunition, which has weight - so even a well-off survivor isn't going to be spamming bullets.When you die, you're dead - or undead.Regardless of if you like this or not - you can't deny: Things just got real.General RealismFood can spoil. Planned sickness and and infection (non zombie) system with medical system to combat such issues (Implemented Now). You can scavenge for food (bugs and berries). Fishing. Trapping. Hunting (Planned). Fatigue (Needs Tweaks). Mood system (Patiaally implemented).Good CommunityIts in the early stages of developement - and it already has a modding community thats doing some pretty good work - in fact, the developers are aware of this and support this, even working with a modder to incorporate their mod into the base game. (This has happened more than once now) Indie developing at its finest.Good MultiplayerYou can survive the end times with friends, or duke it out with them in the zombie apocolypse (Pvp needs tweaks, and those tweaks are planned) (Some tweaks already implented, I have not yet tested them.Planned Singleplayer and multiplayer NPCsHigh quality NPC's planned, with the same functionality and needs as players. They eat the same, they kill them same. etc.Very good sandbox customization. Almost everything you could think of can be tweaked for your own personal optimal experience. Growth rates of plants, abundance of food, stregth of zombies and how often they spawn, or if they 'respawn'. Level of experience progression. All of these things can be tweaked to a players preferences.Several character profession options with more being worked on and added.Cons:You cannot rotate the camera.You cannot and you won't ever be able to. It doesn't break the game in any way, but its a drag, we just have to deal with it.Needs more hotkey options.Item binding buttons for switching to various items while still moving. Craft X options. Cook X options. (Upon release I'd like to play with a group, and it will just be easier for the guys cooking and whatnot.) Quality of life improvements mostly. There should be a hotkey to drop bags in a pinch if you need to abandon weight and run. There isn'tWould like to see some minor automation. (Some of this has been implemented, much to my delight.)Ex. You can build using wood at your feet currently, but if its a space over, you have to move it, or hold it to use it - all entered as separate commands. I would like a 'use nearby' option to be toggleable, for example. If I tell a guy to build a wall, I would like for him to walk (or run if toggled) back and forth to the wood pile and wall and build the wall/ floor, etc. if its reasonably close. It should also be toggleable to prevent this if unwanted. I would also like to see this with the cook or craft X options. Streamlining repetitive menial tasks improves the experience.Realism. and Lategame Tweaks. (This has been largely fixed with new zombie migration patterns and respawn behaviors. Only experienced players will be able to outplay zombies consistently with the difficulty turned up. This is a very very good thing for this game.)The realism is good, but with realism comes even more expectations. I would like to see food preservation options. I would like to see societal rebuilding in the lategame (especially with NPCs) However due to the lategame currently being somewhat easy, I suggest that new challenges are thrown into the mix. Horde Migrations (Planned). Bandit/ Raider group - From another town? Vehicles and weapons to combat you with - that you can get if you win perhaps? Restore power (In minor ways). Restore running water (Partially). The idea is that eventually you must die, but farming made it possible to live indefinitely. I think surviving forever should be possible - but should be made difficult. Dudes attacking with machine guns and zombie hordes will always be a real threat.Waiting.Lots of planned features. Good features, but features that take time, and as the indie market and development process is a somewhat new phenomenon, and it goes against the modern world's fast-life culture, it can be difficult at times. Movable funiture, Portable Storage (Wheelie bins, Wheelbarrows), Vehicles. NPC's. NPC's.  . . . . NPC's. All things we're waiting for.Minor ConcernsTweaks NeededThere are various things that don't quite work that well yet, and need to be solved, like sleep/no sleep options in multiplayer - as well as how some moodles function (moodles are buffs/debuffs/warnings that describe various status effects on your character) - but the game is early release, so it gets a pass on those things for the time being.The map is huge, but there is no 'random' map - and your map options are limited.The only map options are what region/town on the map in which you spawn. The base map is fantastic, and features a good mix of environments, and they do continually expand the map. (If map expansion continues - especially beyond release - then one map only will make a lot more sense and this will go into the 'pro' category -  Especially if the map becomes ALL of kentucky like some rumors have suggested) [Even if its DLC, or if modders have to do this - DO IT. lol] - More maps are being made by modders as well.The biggest issue for me currently is multiplayer sleeping. Currently, sleeping is simply removed from multiplayer, but I would like to see the option for a 'minecraft style' sleeping arrangement that is not default, but can be enabled for private servers. Removing a very integral requirement/need from characters in multiplayer really hurts the multiplayer experience. I know this will be resolved before final release, but in the interim I would like to see some options so we can at least pick our 'downside' to multiplayer sleep rather than have that experience choice made for us.

								So when I learned this game supports splitscreen co-op, I ran out to gamestop and grabbed 3 usb controllers for my brother, my girlfriend and I to play this over the weekend. Here's how that went.We spend the first 30 minutes figuring out how the controls work. Zombies everywhere in custom difficulty. Brother and I run, girlfriend somehow gets bit. We bunker down overnight and the bite wound kills her. She raises as a zombie and I have to put her down.We try a few more custom difficulties until we decide to just go with the first bite. We spawn in a decent house with a white picket fence and a grill in back. Not too many zombies in sight. Until we see the horde down the road. Girlfriend thinks it's like left 4 dead and goes in swinging her bat, gets bitten again. We don't change the bandage out often enough and it kills her. She raises again as a zombie and I have to put her down again.Her THIRD character gets a small scratch from a zombie. By now, I have it down on how to treat the wound. I fully heal her. Then I notice her status goes to Zombified and I sigh, taking her out back with my spiked baseball bat and await the inevitable. I put her down for the third time.Her fourth character does better, though now she avoids any zombie. My brother, our scavenger, accidentally jumps from a second story building and fractures his leg. He waddles back to base and my girlfriend treats him, since she's supposed to be the medic while I'm the carpenter. It took an in-game week for his leg to heal enough for him to run with the splint on. It heals while he's out...and he accidentally falls out a second story window, breaking his leg again. I talk him out of drinking bleach while I gather corpses in the middle of the street to burn. I start the campfire and my pants leg catches on fire. I panic, running about and then into a building to grab water to throw on it. I die and my burning pants set the building on fire, making me glad I didn't walk into our base.			",77,11,0,10,6,2,6

Early Access Review
								(4/22/2017 Rewritten for clarity and focus)I praised the heck out of this game back on it's steam release, I was a daily member of it's forums, and I was in the twitch stream with the devs and hundreds of people during the steam launch. I stuck around before it was on Steam and the devs seemingly disappeared, playing the hell out of 1.5d. This game was amazing to me.But here we are 4+ years of development and the game is well, the same. I know technically a lot of changes have happened, and a lot of improvements have been made, but fundamentally it really hasn't changed much at all.But this review is more set for people unsure of the games Early Access tag, and honestly I really suggest steering clear until they knock some of those planned features off the list because they are taking immense amount of time to seemingly accomplish little, and they aren't the type to wait a long time and have some huge friggin patch come out either. So instead we have to wait day after day, months after months and years at this point for them to release NPCs or a campaign, the big stuff always being asked. You aren't allowed to complain either or they just ban you from the forums, take a gander itself, you'll get banned just because you are getting frustrated. I have never laughed so hard watching the moderators appear so personally offended by every negative thing to the point they are constantly defending the game in every post with long responses about how we are the ones wrong, you don't see this in AAA games, or even most indie games.Anyway it's not as if the game can't be fun, but the map is still very very much unfinished with furniture and room layouts that make 0 sense, you will find bedrooms and living rooms being merged into being the same room, bathrooms blocking doors, some houses have rooms missing, they just ruin immersion completely and look terrible. I could never get how people would live in it or all have the same decorator and furniture, or that some windows in a house have curtains but others don't.NPCs have no ETA STILL (as of 2017). We still don't have the friggin new animations that I remember being mentioned well over a year ago, and some weapons still don't even have actual sprites in the game. I mean♥♥♥♥♥♥they are still talking about vehicles and animations and I am sitting here wondering what year it is, are they seriously not out?? Seriously check the mondoid posts from 2015 and you will see this stuff being ""worked on"" I can't tell what the hell these people are doing when they work on this full time with all the funds they amassed. The general gameplay itself all works nicely for what it is, it really can be a fun experience, but it seems like most deaths will not be from you doing something stupid, but because i get bored and start playing riskier just to make things exciting. It just loses momentum once you get a basic grasp of the gameplay. I really don't know how anyone that couldn't pick up everything in a couple hours.If we had NPCs and they lived up to half the promises then the gameplay would improve massively, things would feel tense as you'd approach a lot of situations differently, like will they attack or join you? Do they have a quest? The other AI would make zombies move about the map, and you'd have a lot of interesting encounters and a more ironically lively world.But here is the thing, the game prides itself on keeping things to the George Romero lore established from his movies, but fails to bring the other elements that made his movies good, and that's the characters and environments. The zombies alone aren't entertaining, nothing is fun about dumb slow shamblers that make no effort to find you or change anything up. 7 Days to Die did this perfectly by having horde nights and zombies running at night, keeping you always working against the clock and prepping for the next horde. Gameplay mechanics it follows the same issue a lot of these games have, it's repetitive and once you fall into a routine the game just loses everything. The character progression feels very stupidly thought out, requiring the more fun aspects like construction and wiring requiring your character have a profession in these areas. Or else you have to grind a lot to get anywhere. So following up on the gameplay, you will basically only ever just loot the same old houses over and over again, since nothing will change and I highly doubt many people have the patience to wait until the water and electricity in town go out. Not like growing food and putting up rain barrels is the least bit difficult anyway so what's the point? Otherwise nothing else will happen, you will hit the normal routine of hording materials at a location and you won't be compelled to do much else because nothing else is required. Throw a sheet over the windows and you're safe forever. I wish it actually tried to be a bit more arcadey and sandboxy and make it easier to build up large forts and take over sections of towns or overhaul a building. But gathering and moving loot is insanely time consuming and annoying with how heavy wood is to carry. And if you are only a level 1 carpenter you get these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ walls to build with until you grind a long long time to level it up to 3 where they aren't garbage anymore.It's actually pretty comical how easy the game is when I am purposely playing wreckles to make this more fun. Zombies are easy to navigate around, food isn't really that scarce or difficult to grow, and I can take on a horde of 20+ zombies with a friggin hammer if I wanted to walk backwards and lunge forward to smack them. It all feels stale.The UI and performance front seem shoddy, my RX 480 struggles to reach 60FPS at 1080p without experiencing drops or stuttering. The game actually suggests 720p and 30FPS funnily. The UI is one that requires a lot of clicking, and is just bad. Sometimes I need to click a few pixels over to select things properly, sometimes the window is stuck to my cursor, it looks dumb.They mentioned wanting to overhaul it (3rd time) but we all know how long it takes for stuff like that to be finished..There are more things wrong with the game, but these are the massive issues that need to be addressed within this year, Yall start releasing your♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't care if the NPCs come out in a basic way and progressively get improved over time but just change something, rock the foundation of the game a bit, I really want to love this game like I did in the early days but at this point it's abundantly clear a lot of the popularity is about what everyone is waiting for the game to be and not what the game is currently.(My hours are across 4+ years and 90% of it was at it's release on steam)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								After almost two and-a-half days of my life invested into playing this game, and it now being one of my favourite games of all time, I feel it was only fair that I spent a little time writing a proper review for it. So, here goes.This game, is actually the greatest of the great, to say the least, in the whole 'Zombie Sandbox-Survival' and now 'PVP/PVE Multiplayer Survival' genres.The gameplay, to begin with is intense, fast-paced and complex to the greatest extent of these phrases I use to begin to even attempt to describe my feelings. The Indie-Stone, a small, multicultural dev-team have now spent day-in, day-out on this... Masterpiece, the first word to come to mind, since 2013. And boy, has it come far. Each patch, brings more and more depth and accompanying excitement, time and time again. And with the full-release 1.0 Update on the horizon, being in full manufacture by the small, yet just so detrimental and capable Indie-Stone most likely at this very moment.I am excited, to say the least. Off-topic, but back on track - Gameplay.This isn't just your run-of-the-mill, chop-zombies-heads-off kind of game - Deep systems of mechanics, player development through skill points and experience, micro-management to the extent that we're keeping our own little person alive, in the same ways we keep ourselves alive today. You will need to deal with fatigue, sickness, poisoning, infection, dehydration, malnutrition, exertion, broken bones, burns and our favourite; boredom. All fueled by decline in living standards accompanied by surviving successfully - Or in most cases, unsuccessfully, in a Zombie-Infested Knox County, Kentucky.- Combat is superb, with all the basic stuff; damage increase with skill levels, defense increase with skill levels. But then you throw in the fact that an average fire-axe used by Fire Departments in the United States weighs up to ten pounds, and your character only got five hours sleep because he got home from that loot run the night before far too late, you're gonna have a bad time - Damage decrease with exertion, damage decrease with ill-effects on the body, damage decrease if you just jumped from a second-story window to escape near-death.- Mechanics and Micro-management, eat, drink, farm, rest, stockpile, make a run to town, get scratched on your left arm trying to face one-too-many zombies with only a spoon for a means of self-defense, run home, open your first aid kit, tip everything out, clean your wound with whiskey, stitch the wound, disinfect a bandage with the same bottle of whiskey, apply the bandage, take some freakin' pain killers like Max Payne, sleep it off, bandage is dirty when you wake up, repeat steps 700-9,000,000. This game, will make you stress, more than you do, in real life - Especially if you are running a 5 month character, and your character is a hypochondriac. (One of the many customizable traits offered to you upon creating a character.) Farming is a huge thing, especially late game, depending on the fruit/vegetable you are growing, your harvest can take weeks of careful nurturing before you are able to reap your 230 Fresh Potatoes, and not be able to eat them, tortured by the fact you have to watch them go rotten, because you were simply unable to eat them all before the lack of refrigeration got to them. (Which may not be a problem, as alternate means of electricity generation are speculated/planned for the game's future! But that doesn't mean everyone will be able to wrap their thick mind around operating a 2,200-Watt Ryobi Generator! Professions, in their linear current state, are planned for a huge overhaul, in which certain lines of work, will restrict certain commodities to a particular person with the appropriate experience.)This is enough for now I feel, I've spent about twenty minutes typing this, sharing my opinions and what-not.If I think of anything else to add, I'll be sure to edit this and make additions where appropriate, setting aside this is already a massive wall of blabbering text to begin with.Saying that I 'recommend' this game, is an understatement, in all honesty.If there was a way to donate, without purchasing the game over and over, I probably would have by now. There just isn't any words that begin to describe how exceptional Project Zomboid is, nor are there ways I can begin to thank the Indie-Stone for providing me with *days* of entertainment, at such a low cost, and with such an up-to-date forum and blog, providing your weekly Mondoids every Tuesday (Monday for America, I'm an Australian :P ) , there are no words other than : ""You are one of the most amazing Development Teams to ever exist in the Indie Game content-base, and this is one of the greatest games ever created to date.""Well done.

								This game has been in early access for years, and it will never leave it. The developers are perhaps, the worst aspect of this game. They have proven time and time again that they refuse to listen to feedback, or criticism, instead opting to ban those who don't agree with them. Ever since the ""Stolen Laptop"" incident.The big reason for saying the devs are generally just bad people is the fact that they don't update their game in any meaningful way, and instead constantly speak about all the work they do. Which forces the customer to interact with them only based on their words, and not actions.The game itself is only solid not outstanding, however still has issues that have persisted for many years, from lighting to even simple performance problems on rigs that should be more than capable of running PZ. No meaningful content other than multiplayer(Which has its own long list of issues) have been added in nearly two and a half years. You're buying the game as it is NOW, with direct quotes from the devs being ""with future prospects of possible updates to the game"". Don't ever expect this game to be finished. The game is acceptable(sometimes) with overhaul mods.I was also banned as of 11/29/2016 from all PZ discussions due to saying that the developers have poor public relations. Keep in mind, this was while one of their officers was arguing with someone about their development practices in their second most recent update news.			",127,25,4,45,36,2,50

								The Development of this game is slower than a shambling zombie. The truth is i used to love this game but the lack of progress over the years and the condescending attitude of the forum moderators have ruined it for me. Week after week we listen to the cheerleaders chanting for the Dev's but those of us who have been here a long time know the truth. The Dev's announced Animations were ""coming soon"" and ""Close""but...here we are over half a year later and still waiting.  They refuse to commit to any Eta's because frankly they've never been able to meet a deadline so they just leave us in the dark waiting and waiting. The Dev's get side tracked working on features no one really wants or asked for like the nutrition system, Metal Working  and TV shows. They haven't focused on finishing and implemanting the features that everyone actually wants like NPC's, Animations, Vehicles and even something as simple as being able to see a back pack on your character's back.. It's like they have some form of development ADD.I can't recommend this game... I've been following it's progress for several years and what I've seen is that people are getting sick and tired of an unreasonably slow rate of progress. Combine that with endless excuses and a cult like follwing ready to rush to the defense with ""the Dev's are awesome and you all just need more patience"" mantra.  People have shown an unbelievable amount of patience and i respect that but i feel sorry for the fans that are waiting monday after monday for months even years for any sign of the promised features.  How long does it take before patience becomes Resentment.. . for me it was way to long.2/10			",129,8,0,22,10,0,9

								I have bought Project Zomboid multiple times over the years, on multiple platforms. I was there in the beginning. I have spent countless hours losing myself in the game... But right now, even though I love the game, I cannot recommend it at this time. Prepare for a PZ Fanboy turned realist's opinion on the current state of Project Zomboid. *FINAL WARNING, BIT OF A RANT AHEAD, SKIP TO SUMMARY IF UNWILLING TO READ THE WALL OF TEXT.*And before you read on, it is not because of the slow development time that I am disappointed, at least, not entirely. You see, the developers have said time and time again that they need to, and will, take their *sweet ol' time* with the development of the game. However, what I find comepletely unexcusable is that lack of information being provided by the developers, who were once the best Indie company I had ever known.Every monday, the Indie Stone, developers of Project Zomboid, release a ""Mondoid,"" which is an informative blog post detailing development that had taken place over the week since the last Mondoid. Well, informative they are no longer.In the beginning, I looked forward to seeing a Mondoid every Monday. Unfortunately, for the past six months or so, the Mondoids have become little more than bland, generic blurbs that the Indie Stone don't seem to feel the need to put much effort into. If I'm wrong, it'd be hard to prove it; look at some of the recent posts on their website. Actually, the content in recent Mondoids is so similar that I can basically summarize every one you might read.Intro of the Mondoid:-Begins by saying that it's a ""Short, sweet Mondoid this week,"" or, ""Not much to write in this Mondoid,"" etc.Meat of the Mondoid:-Proceeds to blurb about how a lot of ""good work"" has been done on the coding aspect of the game, but doesn't go into much detail.-Talks about some ""secret exciting project"" they have coming up for the game, that almost always is way overhyped.-If lucky to get a post larger than a few paragraphs, you might get lucky and see a picture or thirty second video of features that were said to be, and should have been, added years ago.Ending of Mondoid:-Usually just a copy-paste message talking about the thumbnail of the Mondoid, or how you can subscribe with your email to get notifications on every Mondoid that comes out, as soon as it comes out. (Although, from the way thing have been, you won't need this feature, as you won't likely be missing much.)Their Mondoids rarely provide any new, noteworthy information, creating a film of dishonesty and distrust between the player and the Developer. Now I know what those Project Zomboid Fanboys are going to say; ""The Devs need their time, Tyler! You can't rush them! Be patient!""I have been patient... For almost seven years, I believe. Since then I have seen little change after the first four years or so. I have been told to sit tightly, and have been promised a new, interesting Mondoid where all my concerns will be adressed; yet each time I am very disappointed. And I know I said that the slow development wasn't the reason I gave this game a negative review, but it did have a hand in the decision. NPC's were said to be released in 2016 at the latest. Were not even close to seeing them, if we ever will. We have been promised proper animations, and although there has supposedly been some work towards adding them into the game, they are quickly taking the NPC direction. This game is slowly becoming vaporware. The updates are getting fewer and farther between, and are adding fewer and fewer features with each one. Most of the time we are told of ""AWESOME FIXES"" to the code and game, but I have seen nothing change. Oh, and the Indie Stone often says that the reason why it takes so long to add things to the game is because the features are in need of polishing... Well, I agree with that, but your game is in Early Access. Everything doesn't have to be ♥♥♥♥ing perfect to be added in, just workable. That way you can get better feedback on issues and suggestions, which is sorta why Early Access became a thing in the first place. Just give us all something, ANYTHING that you have promised; show us that you have actually been working on the game, that you haven't given up on it, because right now, that's what it looks like. There is a bubble surrounding the Indie Stone community that filters out a lot of criticism; I know, because I was in that bubble. But my eyes have been opened by the repetitive Mondoids, and obvious lack of content being added over the years.In fact, let me think of the most notable additions that I've seen in the past six months...-A TV and Radio system, consisting of Meta content and text-based broadcasts that add little more than lore to the game.-A nutrition system, I think. (I'm not even sure it's been released.)-Multiplayer. (Quite broken, from my experience.)-What else... Oh, what every ♥♥♥♥ing game ever says. Numerous *fixes* and *changes*.If there is anything else I missed, well, I'm sorry. But the features I missed are probably so uninteresting and overdue that my brain has literally rejected it.*SUMMARY*I love you Indie Stone, you're a great company, at least, you used to be. But you need to give us something to go on. Right now were getting little more than your ""word"" that content is being added and will arrive ""shortly."" You need to quit being so generic with your Mondoids and actually put some effort into them again. And you need to get some help with developing your game, as I've seen much more impressive work done in a much shorter time. And don't say it's because you're a ""small indie team,"" I've seen a hell of a lot more come from two person teams, sometimes even one-man projects. That's no excuse, and there's no excuse for the lack of information you have provided in recent times.I will gladly recommend this game when some actual content is added, but that may be quite a long time. So for now, bookmark this game, write it down somewhere. Then come back maybe five years or so. You *might* see a weapon or two. If you're lucky, and are an extra good boy or girl this year. Maybe. Probably not though.			",27,0,0,7,1,0,1

								I wish the developers would spend more time working on content and promised features for this game instead of writing those bullcrap essay blogs they call mondoids.I bought this game 3 years ago and it still feels exactly the same as it did back then. It's okay for the first few hours but then you just get bored because nothing exciting happens.I reinstall this game every 6 months lured by the prospect of new features and content but I've been left disappointed every time... nothing worthwhile has improved and those promised features from years back such as NPC's and Animations have made no progress at all. Has this game hit a brick wall or something?EDIT:To give you guys an idea of what the gameplay is like...There's no storyline to this game, your only goal is to survive for as long as possible. You'll start off in a random tiny 1-storey house in one of the major cities and will spend the majority of first few hours going from house to house collecting food, water, tools/weapons and other supplies and eventually securing a building to serve as a safehouse.You'll encounter zombies everywhere, especially in big open areas such as parking lots and on major highways. Occasionally, you'll get spooked by a zombie in a building as you go from room to room looting it in dark, often cramped rooms.After a while (depending on your difficulty settings), water and electricity will shut off forcing you to build rain collection barrels for water and boiling it to sterilise before drinking. Restoring electricity is pretty useless as petrol for the generator is scarce and the noise attracts zombies.Every so often, random meta-events will occur such as screams and distant gunshots which will draw zombies in the direction it came from, often making them pass by or overwhelm your safehouse.Once you've looted all nearby buildings and built up a decent safehouse, you'll either migrate to a different area for supplies or begin farming (which takes a long time to yield crops).That's about it... as I mentioned above, the game is fun for a little while but then once you're set up and fully self-sufficient... the game gets incredibly boring and unrewarding.

								I have now played this game more than any other game on Steam.  Basically, I LOVE it.  It is absolutely addicting.  As a basic warning:You will die.You will die a LOT.Until you can find a weapon and set up a basic safe house, you're in Constant danger.The Maps are HUGE.The Zombie herds are Massive.This was the map when i started:  http://pzmap.crash-override.netIt might help when trying to figure out where to make a ""safe"" house.IF you find the game too easy or too hard, you can play in sandbox mode.  This will allow you to make it very easy or insanely difficult.  If you have any questions,  just ask on the forums.  You'll usually get an answer Very quickly (either from the developers or another player).  Plus the developers release weekly email updates on what they've accomplished to improve the game.  (I've read reviews complaining about the developers and I just don't understand - it seems like they're in CONSTANT contact with the players).Unfortunately, this game is still in early release.  I can't imagine how much better its going to be when officially released cause it's Amazing now.  Things to look forward to:  radio broadcasts, NPCs, etc etc etc.  Personally, I'm looking forward to the offical release so I can play Multiplayer on a private server with all my friends.  That will be SO much fun.  Basically, this is one of the best Zombie game I've played so far.  Yes, i'm putting it right up there with Left For Dead 2.  Give this game a shot.  It really is wonderful...10/10EDITED REVIEW - 11/27/16I recently restarted the game under the current build.  While the game is STILL considered an Early Release game, it has changed quite a bit since my original review.  No, NPCs are still not finished, but they've added the radio broadcasts at the start of the game.  You now have radio & tv broadcasts at the start of the apocalypse.  They've also made the night music So much creepier.  There are also much larger groups of Zeds all over the place and quite a few houses are already burned out.  As before, the game is totally addictive.  Give it a try, it's an amazing game!Still 10/10			",168,50,4,28,10,0,20

								The development team of this game is an absolute joke. They've had animation updates ready for 6 months and bait their fanbase along while not releasing any new content to the game what so ever. An independent modder was able to create and release a working vehicle mod in less than 4 months while this dev team couldn't do it in 5 years.I've owned the game for almost 2 years now and have followed it extensively. During the animation update promisses my little brother expressed his frustration with the team on the indy stone forums. He never insulted anyone, just simply asked questions such as, ""Where is the money going?"" ""Why haven't you relelased a product that has been finished for basically 6 months."" Through all of this the moderators of the development team threw false dichotomies in his face and were very passive aggressive with their answers. Eventually they simply banned him and deleted all of his posts from the forum, which was indeed shady and shocking.From here I expressed confusion and disbelief as to why he was banned and asked for solid answers for their reasoning. I was answered with my own banfrom theforum stating, ""It's embarrasing to create another account to pretend to be someone else.""I recieved an email warning from the forum, which I responded to explaining that I was indeed a different person. This moderator who I spoke with in email was different than the one who banned me from the forum, but explained to me that with 95% certainty that we were the same person. This blew my mind considering I am 6 years older than my brother, he lives across town, and I am more than this pathetic 95% sure that we are indeed different people. It also stated that if we fell through some 5% unsure window, he would only apologize. Further more, it was said to me that neither account, mine or my brothers would be unbanned ever. Mind you we have separate IP addresses that were seperately banned... How can we be the same person.I responded as such,""I am a different person. The first ban was my little brother. This certainly falls under your 5% window, considering I am a completely different person with a different computer who lives at a different address.Your analysis couldn't be that careful if you came to that conclusion. Simply look up the IP addresses and you will find that 2 completely different computers were on these 2 completely different accounts. Our grammar is different, our arguments are different, and I certainly do not have the colorful vocabulary my little brother has.This is really sad considering your ""careful analysis"" wasn't very careful""The moderator responded,""Your language is similar enough, added to the tracking and tracing tools we have. As I say, if you're in the 5%, I can only apologise.However, at the end of the day, you, or your little brother, broke the rules, fairly spectacularly. That cannot be ignored, and when our tools are telling us what they are, we must act on them.""Our language is similar enough? That is the basis of your unrelenting ban on my account in these forums? And what rules did we break? We broke no rules. We never threatened anyone, harrased anyone, or did anything past ask questions.I responded one final time,""I broke no rules, I simply asked questions and expressed disbelief. The language is similar enough because we are brothers and spend a lot of time together, though honestly his vocabulary is far better than my own.How can you only apologize? You have the power to unban my account since I did nothing wrong. So it is against the rules to question motive? It is against the rules to express disbelief? This is some sort of dictatorship where simple questions go unanswered and bans are handed out without simple research as to who people are?This is sickening. I will make sure to leave a wonderful review on the steam forums as to how this games development team chooses to ignore fact and simple questions that come nowhere close to breaking rules. I'll make sure to copy and paste each of these emails and feature these shenanigans on my team's blog.If you hope to be successful with the development of this game, I suggest your team takes a look in the mirror, and people's IPs before banning, and asks themselves, ""Are we really treating our fans and PAYING CUSTOMERS right?""Sincerely,Someone who will find a way to get their money backP.S. I am a registered CNA in the state of Oregon, and on top of that with some simple searching you could find some of my brother's information. Maybe you should take the tiniest amount of effort to not be so utterly wrong""Now this whole thing is so frustrating because without the forums to research, it is near impossible to keep up with latest updates and development of the game itself. This team is just trying to take your money and they don't want to have to explain a single thing. Careful what kinds of questions you ask, because team Stalin here will prevent you from accurately following the production of a game you paid for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Project Zomboid  I Drank a Bottle of Bleach to Relieve My Thirst   Genre Isometric Post Apocalyptic Zombie Survival   Plays Like DayZ, Don't Starve   Positive   Well realised, oppressive zombie apocalypse. Well balanced survival elements properly reward scavenging.    Negative   UI needs work. You'll likely want a wiki companion.    Recommendation Yes. Finished or not, it's one of the best survival games to date. Project Zomboid is a hardcore survival game with the works. You have to manage the usual things like hunger and thirst, but also new considerations like sleep, overheating, freezing, fear, sickness and infection. It's a balancing act that has lasting appeal with an ever growing variety of ways to deal with your situation. Which brings me to Early Access.I personally don't find the distinction between a finished game and an unfinished one to be all that useful. The feeling of fun that I have while playing a game doesn't care if it's ""finished"" or not. If your game is functional and enjoyable before it is officially released, then I'll happily give you money to continue creating a product that I would have probably bought anyway. After all, this same method is how we have come to enjoy many games that likely wouldn't have been made. Some games, perhaps most famously Minecraft, will likely never be finished, with new content being added on a regular basis. Project Zomboid is possibly in the same situation. If being in Early Access is one of your considerations against buying a game, then I hope this review is at the very least informative for you.Zombie survival often turns into dumb action, so it's nice to see a game that is more The Walking Dead than Dawn of the Dead. The Zombies themselves aren't that threatening in small clusters, but the real danger comes in numbers. I had an experience where I had boarded up a house with a small vegetable garden, only to wake up in the middle of the night to a horde migration on its way to the city. I escaped, but my stash became inaccessible. After the initial frustration, I looked back and thought, ""that's a really cool feature"". Coming across an event as catastrophic as a migration or even something mildly hazardous like finding a zombie behind a door that you weren't expecting add excitement to the gameplay. Once your character is dead, you have to start a new game, so even being scratched by an unnoticed zombie can be devastating, and in more than one case, lethal. I love this. You approach scavenging cautiously. You pick your targets and pass over ones that you think would end badly. It's an elegantly designed difficulty curve that while not unique to Project Zomboid, has been well implemented.A large part of the game is character progression. You create your character with a basic background and positive and negative traits, customise the games difficulty settings to your preference and then are dropped into rural America to fend for yourself. There are a selection of skills available to you. The way they improve is simple. The more you use a skill, the better you get at it. Thats it. This encourages variety in the way you play your game as new options open up the better you get at a skill. Currently there are 20 skills. Most are related to different physical abilities, but there are ones that affect how well you can farm, build, cook, trap, fish etc. While the system itself works mostly without player interaction, it's still nice to see something going on under the hood in a genre where most games are just content with a hunter-gatherer style of gameplay.So what actually is the scope of the game? Well, when you start you literally just have the clothes on your back. Among your first concerns are food, water and a safe shelter to sleep through your first night. You will scavenge for anything of use and try to carry as much as you can without making you a slow, easy target for nearby zombies. Once you've found a nice place, preferable close but not actually in a town, you'll probably want to go about barricading it to reduce the risk of zombies breaking your windows or even worse, just wandering through the back door you forgot to close. Once you have found your new home, you'll go about nicking as much as you can and dropping it off for later use. Eventually, the utilities will be shut off, so you'll have to find alternatives to using refrigerators to keep food fresh and taps for easy access to water. Long before this, you'll need to consider actually growing and catching food yourself, a task made difficult by roaming walkers. This status quo balancing act can go on for months until you finally run out of bandages or meds to keep you going. I found the variety of things to manage to be really immersive, thanks in no small part to the attention to detail. If zombies are banging on your door, your character will become anxious so you need to give him sedatives or risk him being less effective when it comes time to run. I really liked Project Zomboid. It has a wealth of content in its current state and still has new things added to it each time I play. It is everything that I want from a survival game in a package that clearly has had a lot of care and attention put into it. Again, being an Early Access title, you'll have to decide for yourself whether you'll find value in this purchase. I certainly feel like I got my money's worth.			",323,77,9,78,57,5,111

								Project Zomboid is probably the best zombie survival out there. If you are not into graphics and special effects and you want to play a sandbox survival game. Then this is a must for you.The game has payed a lot of attention to survival detail. Your health is not only a bar that fills with red colour. You have to deal with stress, boredom, deseases and exoustion. You have to be prepared for situations, take a breath after fighting, probably smoke a bud and drink some whiskey before you continue looting or your character may become too stressed, have a nervous crysis breakdown or become insomniac and never get good rest. When hit by a zombie except the chance of infection your wound will start getting infected if you don't change and sanitise your bandages. Your inventar is not just a bunch of square containing things. It is complex and you have be aware of your speed and your overall stamina because you will have to cope with wearing a bagpack and sport bag in one hand, and probably a gun or something to defent yourself with in the other.The electricity and water will stop. There will be no endless supplies of food and water. You will eventually want to start gardening, building and fishing because sooner or later you will run out of it and you will die or get a desease.The game is really slow, don't expect forever runnig and forever killing.Cons - the graphics are really bad, looks like the first Sims game. I was expecting when I zoom in for the game to scale the textures but instead everything gets really pixelated. It could go as ""art"" but if the game could have mroe HD feel would be better.Pros - best survival game I have ever played and I have played a lot (resent are The Forest, DayZ SA, 7d2d and How to survive). The way you interact with the world is really easy and intuitive. You have to really mind all the small details.And for the end of my reviw just one thing - never - ever - ever - EVER forget your oven ON in your main HQ ...			",212,26,2,21,12,2,8

You start off as a survivor in the apocalypse with nothing but your shirt, trousers and shoes. Luckily you spawn in a house which appears to be zombie free, giving you a chance to search for some food and a weapon. You wander around checking each draw, shelf, cupboard finding nothing but a pen, can of dog food, load of clothes and some nails! You've been in the apocalypse for a few months now but luckily electricity and water are still on. You check the fridge for supplies and find some uncooked chicken and watermelon. This won't last you very long but it is better than nothing. You decide you have to go out and look for more supplies if you plan on surviving any longer in this world. As you go outside you spot one zombie looking away from you, the only thing you have is a pen but it will have to do. You sneak up behind the zombie and jab the pen in its head, instantly killing it. Searching the body you find a diamond ring. In the previous world this might have been worth something but in this one it is worthless. You walk towards the opposite house and peer into the window. Seems clear. You open the window and climb in. Scavenging the entire house you find some supplies and a baseball bat, your first real weapon, sweet! But it looks like you had your back turned away for too long, a zombie sneaked up on you, luckily you turned around just in time and pushed it on to the floor and smash its head. Seeing it is getting dark you decide to close all the doors, get a bite to eat and then go upstairs to bed.

You wake up to the sound of gunshot in the distance. You look outside and see a horde of zombies walking towards your house! It just isn't your day. Looks like some of them spotted you and they are now banging their faces on the door, you rush downstairs and open the back door only to see more zombies, you turn around and run back upstairs, ripping your shirt and trousers off, turning them into a rope. You slam the bedroom door closed and throw the rope out the window. You quickly climb down the rope and run off down the road in nothing but your boxers and shoes. Since you are sprinting you're making  a lot of noise, causing even more zombies to start running towards you. You smash a window of a nearby house only to have the burglar alarm go off, bringing even more zombies to your location. You can't go back now! You jump into the house dive into the corner. They start pouring through the windows and doors. No escape. No hope. You take out a pencil and notated, writing your final words onto it. You have one last meal, a sip of whisky and whip out your bat for one last stand. They burst down the last door and charge straight at you. You whack at them but it is no use. They grab and surround you, pinning you down. You open the health tab to see everything flashing. Left arm being eaten, right leg gone. Then finally, you pass. I initially dismissed this zombie game as I thought it was going to be a 2D version of Dayz. How wrong I was, Project Zomboid exceeds my expectations, having everything I desire in an Indie game. Unlike Dayz, PZ is much easier to understand, a LOT less buggy and more vast in the zombie apocalypse.While the ingame map isn't randomly generated, it is large enough to keep you wandering for days (but there is an  online map	 [pzmap.crash-override.net] which helps you to pinpoint your location quickly). What you get in the game however is randomly generated. Anything you find in one play through may not be there in the next. But as one would expect, certain items will be found in certain places. By this I mean if you find a food shop, you will be more likely to find a load of food. If you find a construction site you are more likely to find a bucket full of concrete and a sledgehammer etc. I've only had it for a few days but I'm loving every bit of it. Some of the best things in the game currently are:Health system - You get shot in the shoulder, you're going to need to pull the bullet out, disinfect the wound, stitch up the wound and bandage it. (pull out the stitches too soon and it will reopen).Viewpoint - You see from your characters view point, not yours. If there is something behind your character you won't see it until it is right on top of you. You may hear a groan though, giving you a chance to retaliate.Traits - You character can be altered to survive different situations. One trait will make your character stronger, giving you extra damage, carry weight and knockback. While another might make you less prone to getting sick. This will cost points which you gain by picking negative traits, which give you more points depending on how severe it is so the total is 0 or more.Jobs - You can pick a job you had before the apocalypse. Currently you can pick to be a police officer, fire officer, construction worker, night guard, ranger or unemployed. All but unemployed give bonuses corresponding to the job. For example, A night guard will need less sleep than everyone else. Police officers are better with guns. Currently they have plans to add even more jobs. UPDATE:   More jobs are coming next build [projectzomboid.com]Time - Over time things will change. The power and water may be on for the first few months but after that will shut off, leaving fridges, ovens, microwaves, taps and lights all useless. This means you'll either have to start making camp fires to cook and containers to collect rain water or finding non-perishable food and bottled water. Over time everything will also decay. The first month in the apocalypse will look quite tidy but a year later everything will be overgrown, cracking etc.Shelter - When you need to rest you can't just go in a house and jump in a bed. Zombies may see you and start crawling in your house while your asleep. Unless you are in a zone with no zombies, you'll have to hang up sheets by the windows to stop zombies from spotting you in your house (this also stops you from looking out while they are closed so you'll have to rely on hearing). To be extra secure you could barricade all the windows and doors.Safety - Once you got a nice house, barricade the windows and the doors you might think you can stay in there for a few months. The game however might throw random noises in some direction like a helicopter flying over by or a gun shot, causing zombies to go towards the direction it came from. This may be towards your house, threatening your safety. Although they haven't seen you, you haven't seen them either. It could be 3 zombies outside moaning or 50. They may be on the other side or right in front of your doorstep. The only way to check is to look out, but if you look out you might be seen.Skills - You can level up as you use items or do certain things. These include how fast you can climb, how fast you can run, how well you can give first aid, how well you can cook, how good your aim is, how well you can barricade etc. This can create roles in a multiplayer server (one player might be the cook while another the doctor).If you love zombie games, I definitely recommend you buy this. Beware this is still in early access so you won't have the full game and there will be bugs (although haven't found any at all yet). Compared to some other Indie games, this advances quickly (Previous update was on the 8th of September, current one was released unstable on 3rd of November and properly released late December). I am quite pleased with it. This game was gifted to me by a very kind stranger but if I knew it was this good, I wouldn't have spent all my money on other games and I would've spent it on this. While I can see it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly one hell of an indie game!			",76,10,0,12,13,0,2

Early Access Review
								My first experience with this was short lived.I ran outside of my front door and wielding a trusty baseball bat, attacked a group of zombies. I was 'scratched and bleeding' on the foot and I couldn't find, or figure out how to bandage myself. So I died.From a cut on the foot.Second character starts to freeze to death within just a couple of minutes of playing, so I get together some materials for a camp fire and make it in the safety of my bathroom. 30 seconds later my character is running around the garden being chased by zombies with his legs on fire, watching his house burn to the ground.Third character survived for a long time. I found a warehouse and wanted to look for axes or sledgehammers but there were too many zombies around. So I lured them all to follow me, planning to trap them inside a house and then run out the back door. An excellent plan!!I opened a house door, ran inside and the zombies started pouring in, an excellent plan I thought!! Wait, where's the back ♥♥♥♥ing door???? There is no back door. Cue Laurel and Hardy music as I sprint circles around the living room as more and more pour in the door. By the time I'd remembered that I could climb out of a window it was too late.My first multiplayer experience with this was like an episode of The Walking Dead.I created my character, an illiterate clumsy oaf with incredible strength and tough skin, and then spent the next 6 hours trying to get the server to work. (if you've tried everything but still can't get it to work- on the router settings make sure the device the game is connected with is your IP, not your local machine IP, or your router's IP, but your IP. Not your public IP. Damn it's complicated. For me it starts with 192.... but there are two of those, one with 256 at the end, the other with 140 at the end. The 140 one is the one I connected the game to and then it worked.)But nevermind that.My character's name is Rick Grimes. I ran out of my door taking a bunch of food with me and sprinted down the main road, leaving a bread crumb trail so I don't get lost. I find a huge warehouse where I scavenged a few planks and hammers, a buttload of nails and duct tape, and also somehow managed to FALL DOWN THE STAIRS, breaking my leg.I ripped up my vest into sheets and tied a wooden plank to my leg as a makeshift splint. Sorted!My friend at this moment managed to log in. We cheer! But then sigh as he has spawned in a house filled with zombies and the doors and windows are barricaded shut. WTF??? He screams. He sends me a voice message telling me he's already getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off with the game and that he's about to log out.Hold on!!! I tell him.... just hold on!!I go online, load up the map of the area and tell him to take a picture of his house zoomed out. I manage to match up this quirky looking road out front of the house to where it is on the map and..... holy♥♥♥♥♥♥balls. It's miles away.Nevermind the distance, I thought! I'm going to rescue my friend!! Hang tight, I tell him, I'll be there soon!As soon as I start sprinting I realise that a broken leg in this game actually means something.So 45 minutes later, I arrive at his house. To my astonishment, he's actually managed to take down the 5 zombies in his house with his bare hands and he's just been waiting there starving to death.The feeling of seeing him stood there, through the crack in the barricades on the window, was pretty amazing. My friend called it a Golden Gaming Moment.I looked through my inventory and♥♥♥♥♥♥myself. I don't have a hammer... I can't take down the barricades. So I start wailing on them with a golf club. Bonk. Bonk. Bonk. Nothing.... panicking that he's going to have to wait another 20 minutes for me to find a hammer, I remember my schoolbag. I open it and.... ah yeah there's my hammer.I take the barricades down and I know for a fact if there was a BROHUG emote in the game we would be spamming the hell out of it.We survived for a good hour and a half before we started to get cocky trying to take down small hordes of zombies around our safe house. I got scratched and cut on my leg and arm. Bandaged up no problem. But my friend got bitten on his chest and it was deep and needed rebandaging every 2 minutes or so. He was losing health.Instead of continuing to back away from this horde, we stupidly decided to carry on trying to exterminate it one zombie at a time.I got scratched on the foot again and decided to just back off and give up, but due to miscommunication, my friend decided to balls out try and kill them all by himself. He got swarmed!! I managed to push them all away and I went rampant as they swarmed him, managing to knock down or kill the last of them.My friend's waddling around leaving a trail of blood.HOLD STILL I yell to him as I frantically begin the medical check.He has 4 injuries and is already half dead. I bind one wound- OK. Another wound- OK. I bind the third wound..♥♥♥♥♥♥! That wasn't a wound, I just took off a dirty bandage!!! At that moment, he dies. If I had bound the last wound instead of unbinding the old wound, he would have lived, but in the heat of the moment I couldn't focus and I got him killed.There's silence. I head back to his safe house with the barricades and I take all of the best food we have scavenged so far from the fridge, with a plan to rendevous with him at his new spawn location.His new character spawns, incredibly luckily, in MY safehouse. Barricaded windows. Two story for look outs. Sheets over everything to stop any zombies peeking inside. TONS OF FOOD IN THE FRIDGE.... oh and a bunch of turd weapons and backpacks. Sorted.I run back to meet him and we begin our plan of scavenging the streets for food and stockpiling it all over again. But this time, his character looks like Patrick Stewart.And my legs still broken.Next time we play, the plan is to get a small farm going, build a wall around the house to further protect it, and head out to try and find some assault rifles or axes.I honestly can't wait until they add cars and NPCs into the game. It's going to be incredible!!!My friend came up with an awesome idea also, that there should be little missions that happen randomly like the power can just randomly cut off in a large area. Meaning that you have to go to a power plant or something to essentially fix it yourself. I added that without good electronics skills, you would have to just flip the switch, which would turn the power back on but it would set off a loud alarm which would make escaping and getting home difficult.The hints that the military are going to be implemented and ideas about being able to sit in the back of pick up trucks shooting zombies while your friend drives around are the reasons why I've given up on all farming / survival games in favour of this one for the foreseeable future.Check it out guys you won't be disappointed.

								This game is one of the best zombie survival games out there. It's not a DayZ clone, it's full-out survival, a thing this genre needed done right. REAL survival. Not a Free-For-All PVP Walking Simulator.Getting into a fight with even a single zombie can be dangerous, as a bite nearly guarantees that you will be infected. Scratches can also infect you, but it's not as likely as being bitten will. Always travel with a weapon ready, but be careful with what you use. A gun can bring in a MASSIVE amount of zombies from EVERY direction.On top of that, weather and temperatures will affect your health as well. Out in the rain too long and got sick? Stay in your shelter and take it easy for a few in-game days. Too hot out? You'd better have something to drink.If you survive all of the above, your life will get much, much harder. Eventually, water and electricity shut off for good, so you'll need to farm your own food and drink from wells or rain collecting barrels which you can build.There's a lot more to the game, but I don't want to make this review too long. I'm going to have to give Project Zomboid an 8/10. It already feels like a finished game, and they keep coming out with updates that make the game bigger and better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I don't want to get in depth, i'll just say that this game has incredible ammounts of potential.Unfortunately it's being developed very slowly, I would love to give it a thumbs up but 6 years in an early access is a joke for me. With this kind of pacing i don't see it being finished in the near future.It's a shame really, this is one of a kind game that can give you that creepy vibe so desperately needed for a zombie - survival game.

								Honestly not sure what to believe anymore. Once you reach a threshold of time and keep hearing the same ""It will be ready when it's ready"" chant for years now you tend to listen to your gut a lot more. My gut is telling me the devs have lost most of their interest in continuing development of their game from the time factor alone. Don't care if a theft happened (or not) as development even at that particular point was extremely slow to non-existant even then. The fact that they didn't have cloud storage backup (or any off site backup) tells me that they lost interest in their own project a long time ago. Sure PZ had it's day when it was new up to the first couple years after but unfortunatley this game needs to just be released ""as is"". The important part is that the devs need to put this into ""complete"" status to lift a huge weight off their shoulders. Then, if they decide to do anything further, go for it, or not.

								I had high hopes for the game, but it's (permanently) stuck in the development hell. I believe I bought the game in 2012 or 2013 from Desura and I regret it. Even back then they promised NPC, story mode and all the cool stuff, but those are still in development. I'm not sure, if they are even developing the game anymore, because the progress is so slow.

								My favorite zombie game to date. This game combines a zombie-survival gamemode with intentional pixelated graphics which makes the game one of my favorites. It has slow moving zombies that respond to the player's actions, such as firing a gun, or breaking a window. The game consists of many actions that the player may control, such as cooking, putting a sheet over a window so zombies/players cannot see in the house, boarding up windows/doors, and much more. Once you start playing it is hard to stop. 10/10 from me.			",82,16,0,19,11,0,5

								So I bought this game when it was on sale and decided to write a review about it.I need to say that the devs did a great job on PZ. This game is for people who really want to survive, not just to shoot some zombies in the head.What I really like from this game:- Survival is very hard- Every thing you do has consequences- It gets better every update- You really need to take some time with what you do- The world is very interactive-  Everything CAN go wrongWhat I think that could have been better:- More options in the sandbox mode, since it really just stays survival but easier or harder- The multiplayer really still needs some work ( But they are working on it) So if you like really hard survival games and realism, pick this game up			",149,15,0,7,15,0,18

								Proof: For those who just want proof and don't want to read, follow the link at the bottom of this review to show how slow the game development is and give you an idea. Mind you, some of those videos were posted 2 years ago:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------About the development:Approximately 5 years ago, I purchased Project Zomboid on Desura when I heard of a youtuber who I enjoy, played it himself and recomended it to me. I played it to death, and guys believe it or not there actually was NPCs at the time. Granted they were basic and had simple emotions and function, but they worked. Although, they did away with these basic NPCs because they were too simple. Now development back then was active. Honestly, I think about updates were weekly if not bi-weekly. Right now, months go by without content.      I knew development can and will be slow and I wasn't going to let that be my deciding factor how I felt about a game, but a couple months ago I felt like they at least had some sense of direction. I felt like they were actually trying to pump out NPCs and vehicles and animations, and actually knew that they were on track and going to work at it that is untill they released a TV and radio system not to mention a ""caloric intake"" addition which these features; no one asked for at all. Their Mondoids, are a weekly Monday blog about what to expect from future updates as well as development information and how it's going. These phrases are what you can see in every Mondoid since almost the beginning of this year, ""NPCs are coming"", and ""NPCs are always being worked on and animations too"". You hear them talk development, but they have little to actually show. Speaking of which...        A youtube channel by the name of ""Chris Simpson"" that I was subscribed to, posted videos of Project Zomboid development. Four of these videos had sneak peaks at the NPCs and their functions even going as far as watching an NPC preform complex tasks on its own. Check these out for yourself, I'll put a link at the end of review. Also bear in mind that this was two years ago at the posting date. It's been too long with too little.For the Project Zomboid Youtube channel:https://www.youtube.com/user/lemmy103 ",35,4,0,5,12,0,3

								Ah, Project Zomboid; it's been so many years since I saw your early build with green zombies and Kate & BobSo, what, it's been like 12 months since you started working on the anims or more?Yeah, maybe even more.If this title gets released within the next decade I'll be very pleasantly surprised, but as it stands 2074 is the closest we're gonna get to a solid date for a 1.0 version with all the promised features (NPCs, the most important part) and a HUD that doesn't make me want to claw out my eyes.Seriously, they haven't been touching the UI at all and it's ugly beyond human comprehension while being extremely clunky to use.Sorry, I've been with this game for years, even when your old work computers got stolen, but this is just a joke at this point.""It's ready when it'll be ready"" is just what you keep saying so nobody thinks the game is abandoned, but it's taking so long that everyone is losing hope.The combat is terrible, cooking is buggy, the map is big but there's just nothing to do and everything loses its flavor extremely quick.Stop adding idiotic and trivial features that nobody cares about like ""calories"" (seriously, who spends development time on that instead of things that actually matter) or overhauled animations or garbage like that...We've got the bones but there just isn't any meat, and there's not gonna be any within the foreseable future.If you want some fun for around 10-12 hours, this is your game...but anything past that? No. Even No Man's Sky is less boring.Not recommended.			",258,42,8,36,27,2,68

								Project Zomboid is that game I can't stop coming back to. I have dozens and dozens of games on steam but after a while I always start to get an itch to head back to the zombie infested worlds that I've spent hundreds of hours in already. PZ is not messing around and it will mercilessly end your existance. And again. And again. Then eventually you'll get some food, shelter, weapons, etc. and start feeling good about yourself. You might think you've ""beaten"" the game because there's no way you can die now. Then with no warning your power goes out, the water stops running, and all your food goes rotten. Yup. Such is life in the zombie apocolypse.Project Zomboid is a hardcore retro-style take on the zombie survival and Minecraft-esque games that have become so popular over the last several years. While there are games that do similar things to PZ, none do them quite as well. This is a hard game and it doesn't pretend to be easy. It demands both focus and patience. You're not going to just pick up a gun and start cleaning out the streets, you're going to be sneaking house to house terrified that you'll get seen and praising the heavens when you find a can of beans. Easily the best part of this game is the community that's built up around it. There are hundreds of mods available for the game in the workshop that add so much impressive content and whole new areas. The developers have done a great job of both adding their own content and working with the modding community to ensure that the game never gets stale. The multiplayer servers are also great. This is a game that will absolutely consume you if you give it enough of a chance. Pun intended.			",72,10,1,19,11,0,18

								(I only played solo, so my rant is about my solo experience, I don't know how good the multiplayer experience is)This game showed a lot of promise back when I bought it but after coming back to this product now that it has been in EA for 3 years I gotta let others know about the issues I have with this game.There is no point.I'm not even going to get into the whole lack of meaningful updates and promises that they've yet to fulfill in detail, I'm not all too savvy about it. The problem I have with this game back when I bought it which hasn't changed at all is that there is no long-term point to anything. You create a character with its pro's and con's from the use of a profession and negative/positive traits and then the game lets you out into the gameworld (which is massive). The game doesn't really inform you well about how things work so you'd do best to look up stuff on google but whatever, you find a neat weapon, a good bag to carry loot in and then set off to find a house to claim for yourself. After you've found a nice little house that seems appropriate for defense and accessability(?) to the rest of the city so you can gather supplies you start the old crafting formula of building a base. Well, I found an axe by using a online map to find a hardware store and cut down trees and started crafting walls so I could keep my house as safe as possible, cutting off access to a lot of windows and putting sheets up on the doors which had glass windows on them so zombies couldn't see inside. In the process I've been scavenging nearby buildings for supplies and I have a revolting amount of preservable food and access to a nearby pharmacy that has any healing items I could possibly need. My house is safe. I'm well stocked. ...Now what?That's the problem I've faced in other survival games before and Project Zomboid is no different. You've caught the carrot that has been dangling in front of you, pushing you forward and now there is no carrot, so you look around and see nothing of interest. Why keep going? Why not just go home(stop playing the game)?The problem with PZ in its current state (and considering I haven't seen much changes in its gameplay formula for years I doubt this is going to change, regardless of how much the devs are promising things) is that there is no point to it. There is no end-game. In fact there is no early-end game, middle-late game, middle game or early middle game either. If the point of PZ is to survive for a very long time then the problem is that there isn't anything to hold your attention for such a long time. I had everything I needed within one day (I played yesterday offline on another computer) and once I had secured my future... Then what? What do I do to pass the time? Explore? And find what exactly? More loot so I can horde even more excess? There aren't any diaries or anything around that gives depth to the games world. There are no NPC's or quests. There aren't much unique stuff to find either. It's just more of the same. So what else is there to do? Craft more stuff? Sure, you could do that I suppose. But I've learned my lesson from other games and I know that I will just reach that point of ""now what?"" again  when I run out of stuff to craft. So why bother? I'm not crafting anything unless I need to. I don't find it enjoyable to gather resources and craft things when there is no reward that feels like a saving grace.You could go around killing zombies. But the problem there is that they respawn. So if your goal is to cleanse the world of undead filth then that's not possible. Besides, it's not really that much fun in the first place. The game was hardly ever difficult and you don't want too much difficulty when out ♥♥♥♥ing around killing deadheads either. Why? Cause the game uses a one-save system and if you die then you stay dead.So I can't recommend this game.It showed promise back in the day but at this point it is laughable how little progress has been made on the game and how many excuses they are pulling as to why nothing of substance has been added. The game is a big sandbox of nothing. No matter what you do to try and pass the time it is inevitable that you will reach the point of ""now what?"" and would you rather feel like you've wasted a couple of hours or that you've wasted dozens of hours on a game with no conclusion? Maybe the multiplayer is better since you can always♥♥♥♥♥♥around with a comrade, wouldn't know. Don't care to know. The solo experience of the game is severely lacking.Save your money and wait, if they update the game so that it finally has a damn point to playing it then great! Buy it then. And if it never reaches beyond a ""now what?"" then hey, at least you won't have to feel like you've wasted money on a product that never amounted to anything.			",203,45,0,52,17,0,10

								I actually Live in Kentucky. :) PZ doesn't kill you, bad decisions do. ;)Pros------------------------------------ The Map? HUGE, the devs are going to add Louisville(So I've heard) as well. The map itself already sports four small towns, two of which are like mini cities in game, they are so big. The other two are like small towns(Still pretty big) Tons of woodland, farmhouses, hunting cabins and lakehouses. Gunstores, clothestores, supermarkets, trailer parks, and the Dreaded ""The Mall."" The Mall has every item you could possibly want, But don't go there. Saying ""The Mall"" to a PZ player is like saying ""Voldemort"" to Harry Potter.*Everybody Shudders* (o.o)The map is so big, you will probably never explore all of it in a week. I still haven't done it with all the hours I clocked in, I've barely scratched the surface.You are currently only allowed to spawn in places like West Point and Muldraugh (the two mini cities) but there are two smaller towns as well. One being called ""Dixie"" and the other Bedford (I think)- Realism (You will find no other game like this, it is incredibly challenging and makes you feel like you're actually surviving a zombie apocalypse.) The water and power gets shut off, Nature overgrowth after a period of time, roads crack, food rots, seasons change affecting survival dramatically. You could live off berries and trapping in the summer, but expect to survive solely on traps in the winter, as food is scarce.- Zombies (Because who doesnt love getting eaten at 3AM when you peek out of your safehouse)-Zombies beat down doors, smash windows and follow you out of two story windows, albeit jumping.They Also Horde up, so dont be suprised. :P- Survival (Build traps, farm, build rain collectors, build your own house, walls, fish, forage, etc.)- Live practically anywhere (Its definately a game about decisions, tactics, and overall using your head. If you try to be A Rambo, you generally wind up dead within about 2 game days at the least (Standard Survival mode time, about 1 whole hour) Though I have been killed in just mere 16 in game hours. That being said, You can live anywhere you want, in any house, or just live in the woods.-Ridiculously challenging (Expect 1 zombie to do nothing to a door, but set off a house alarm and fail to leave the house in time, massive hordes will be beating down the front door in 20 seconds or less. Its realism in the game also makes it incredibly difficult as one bite and you're done. Zombies are everywhere, and one jump from a window, one untreated wound, eating a rotten bird or rabbit or just dehydration and you're done. Just like in real life, death is everywhere in this game; and it finds you eventually. It's not really combat based, the gameplay is more centered towards survival, so it makes you think. -It has Several mini games about trying to defend a house with randomly spawned items from hordes that increase in number. Great for Ingame strategy practice.Hide behind that Bar with your ol' Twelve gauge and make a final stand, or barricade the windows and doors and ready that kitchen knife.There was also a mini game where you wake up drunk in a burning house, but that brings back bad memories. I don't like to talk about it. ._.-Sandbox Mode, which is probably the most played game mode in PZ. Customise everything about your game, from Make zombies Sprinters (Like 28 Days later) or make them Shamblers like ""Night of the living dead"". You can customize their senses, i.e. how well they can smell fresh blood(Dont cut yourself on broken glass from those windows. :P), how well they detect sound, how well they can see...You can increase the Zombie amount, Loot amount, season, time, The abundance of farming, foraging etc.You can basically set the scenario how you want.But Survival mode is the challenge, the default play of the game. Few make it past 3 months, even fewer live to see winter. There are those who have survived over a Year in game, and they are what our little PZ community like to call ""Gods"" because if you bought the game an knew the situation we PZ players face, you too would call them ""Gods"" :P-Weapons: Whether you like it or not, sooner or later, you're going to have to fight. How you do that depends on what you prefer in real life. If you wanna kick open your safehouse and send the Undead back to hell with your sawnoff shotgun that you made, Go for it. If you don't like guns and don't like the thought of stabbing with a knife, then nothing says ""I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; like flailing a claw hammer or some other blunt instrument in an attempt to fight the undead.If you like Sticking to the shadows or Sniping from the rooftops with your hunting rifle, they got Sniper rifles with Scopes.If you're passive aggressive they got pistols, meaning whilst you're trying to get out of that Gun store you're looting alive, you pop a couple zombies that are in your way and flee into the night with your 9mm as the Undead hordes chase after you.Keep to the shadows and live a quiet life with just your Club or blade, or be a tactical warrior who always looks to weigh any situation to their advantage, even if that means a couple boxes of 00 buckshot. (But Nothing says I'm pro like wiping out an undead horde with a camp fire.) :3-Guns: they got em. Shotguns, pistols and hunting rifles(Pretty accurate for Kentucky) with Customizations from long range scopes, ammo straps and using a Hacksaw to really polish your scattergun, if you know what I mean. ;) Lasers for the pistols, red dot sights, etc.Ammo is pretty abundant if you know where to look. There are places to find guns all over the map, and zombies tend to drop pistols and ammo often (With the Lucky trait)-Fortify your base: Just like in real life, you can desperately kick in doors and make planks to barricade windows if you think that a zombie eating you alive whilst you sleep is gonna be a problem.Though nothing will save you if a horde comes and you chose to live in a one story house. D:-Jobs: Your character will be who you want them to be. If you choose the police officer as the job you had before the outbreak, then you will be calm in panicky situations and good with a gun.Lots of Jobs to choose from though. - The Devs themselves are really loving, down to earth folks and respond to their customers and even ask for suggestions to add to the game. (Sometimes they even add it if they think its a good Idea) Which makes them unique. :) Of course I could go on and on (Which I already have done) :P But you get the idea.Its a really good game in that spectrum it offers far more than I mentioned, and I know its in Early access, so it isn't complete.Cons------------------------------------------------------------------I live in Kentucky as I have stated, and the biggest problem I have seen that take away from realism in this game (Since it is based in Muldraugh) is that Kentucky is like most other states, except the people here, almost everyone and their grandmother owns guns, and hunting equipment. It rarely snows, and the summer heat is extremely intense, and it barely ever rains. They got the extremely rural part right though. :P-It rains too often in game (Kentucky rarely gets rain, so our crops die alot. And the snow thing, we get a good snow about every 3 years, so ingame it should probably be rarer. It's usually just rainy and cold.)-Hunting and kitchen knives are rare in game, but in reality, Kentuckians own more knives than baseball bats, and golf clubs.-Guns are extremely Rare,  in reality as I have stated, every other household has a Gun here. I would expect it to be different in Project Zomboid.Shoot, I watched my little 60 year old granny cut tree branches down with a Scattergun. Wait, what are we talkin about again? :P Yall take it easy and be sure an give this review a like or two.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Its like the Sim's in a Zombie apocalypse except it's just you, your the last person alive (that hasn't turned), no friends or family to be with (unless you play multiplayer). There will be NPC's added in future patches but the interactivity with these is still unknown, they will most likely be hostile.In the early game your first challenge is finding a decent weapon, as a Spoon just doesn't cut it. However, breaking into peoples houses can set off security alarms, which attracts nearby Zombies that will chase you down unless your quiet and stay out of eyeline. During the first couple of weeks the Electricity is working so you can use household appliances like Ovens to cook food. It's not long before it turns off and you have to resort to eating canned food (if you have a can opener) or other dry products. Most food in the fridges will go off quickly as it is no longer chilled. You can cook your own meals by building a Campfire though I found this unnecessary as it's easy to stock pile large amounts of none perishables. Eventually the stored food will run out as well as the Water supply. You will have to come up with other ways of survival like Farming, Fishing and collecting Rainwater in Barrels. Learning Carpentry skills is essential as you can then use collected Wood to make all kinds of structures like Wall's, Box's, Furniture, even Barricades for your Doors and Windows to stop the Zombies getting in your safe House. BTW you can cut down Tree's with most weapons it just takes much longer than an Axe.The game really is a survival sandbox with no real story except the one you make for yourself. Overall I enjoyed this game more so than games like DayZ. I like the isometric 3rd person viewpoint as opposed to 1st person as you can see if someone is sneaking up on you.The developers have announced that future patches will contain NPC's and Vehicles which will add another dimension to the game.I give this game a solid 8/10 and can recommend it to people who like sandbox style survival games.TIPS: Always carry Beta Blockers with you as it reduces your panic level when around hordes of Zombies. Carry bandages & Painkillers as if you get bitten/scratched your less likely to turn if you attend to the wound immediately. Always carry a spare weapon as low durability can cause them to break. Take Drinks & none perishable Food with you as you may be away from your safe House for a long time. Find a ""Large Hiking Bag"" as it can carry the most items. When exploring buildings, whack Doors before you enter. This will let you know if there is a Zombie on the other side as they will start banging on the Door. Give yourself escape routes, when I enter a building I open all the Doors as you can quite easily get pinned down by charging Zombies. Take spare clothes with you (unless your already fully clothed) as you can die from Hyperthermia / Hypothermia if there is a sudden temperature change. Attack crawling Zombies from behind, they are slow to turn around and much less dangerous.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
This is the story about how I diedJuly 23rd 2015I don't know how I got into this. Not long ago, I was an aspiring cinematographer that just finished his work on a movie soon to be released; had a party with my wonderful friends to celebrate the wrap. Was about to propose to my girlfriend, Liz.But now, I am all alone. It's a weird, terrible feeling to know you are alone in this world. It reminds me of the moment when I got lost at a mall, separated from my mom when I was a little child.Noone's there to give me a hug, to cheer me up, to dry my tears.All my friends, my family, my colleagues turned into these terrible, mindless creatures that run after me and just have one thing in their minds: to disembowel me. Why am I still alive at all? It just doesn't make any sense to me.I need to leave our...I mean my house, all windows are broken and these monsters are just awaiting the moment I fall asleep to get me.July 24rd 2015I just found out that my neighbors fled to the north as I'm reading their note directed to their daughter who was expected to come home from college. I found her, in pieces on the floor and wallpaper. What a tragedy, she was so beautiful and smart.I knew her dad likes to drink so I took his whiskey and a few blankets. Maybe they get handy one day. I found a house to live in; but I don't feel safe- I need more blankets to disguise the windows. Luckily, the former owner had a good storage of food.Ok, I will f***ing leave... just needed to kill five zombies- this area is polluted with these rats an I was wounded on my right hand.Used the whisky to disinfect and blankets to bandage. Hopefully, it will help.... hopefully? Or isn't it better to die? I feel the urge to make a rope out of the blankets I found...July 25rd 2015I finally found a small, secure house. In the surrounding houses I found enough stuff to close the windows. I expected it would be difficult but in each house I found their owners turned to monsters. I don't know how many people I killed. Men, woman and even kids. Although I have a rather safe place to sleep, I feel like if each minute a small part of me dies.While accessing a house I cut both of my forearms on broken glas, I aches like hell. And finally, I accidentally triggered an alarm and there are hundreds of zombies around. I can't hear that sirene anymore. Hopefully, its battery dies soon. I feel like a  kid when I press my face into the pillow just not to hear that terrible noise of zombies scratching on the outside of my shelter.I'd like to drink the whisky to raise my mood but I need to keep it to clean my wounds. July 26rd 2015I spotted a zombie waiting on my front door. I thought it would be the best to kill it, but I didn't recognize another one just around the corner.I killed both but I'm heavily wounded. I don't think I will make it.If this is the last record you read- I'm Dan, 34. Liz, I'm coming back to you.			",103,30,7,12,23,2,11

								Review posted on 7/8/2015 Build 32.To give you a little bit of insight as to the type of person this review is coming from.I have played a good number of Zombie Apocolypse games with and without the survival element and am a big fan of the genre/concept.One of my favorite story(s), accounts, or portrayals of this genre would have to be World War Z (the book by Max Brooks, the movie is rubbish in comparision).No it is not perfect I would not try to tell you otherwise, I see people on the forums who are having issues installing or running the game for various reasons. Personally I had no trouble at all, it runs great except for occasionally closes out of the game completely upon exiting out of the current game, which should have brought me to the main menu. It is often easy to forget that this game is still in early access. While there are many exciting items and features planned for the future, the game feels and plays almost like a finished game.Here are some features in the game at the time of this review that I like and/or appreciate and feel add a substantial amount to the immersion of Project Zomboid.-Crafting & Barricading.-*Combining.-Day & Night cycle.-Logical loot distribution.  In other words you will find loot in places that make sense in the world.-Hunger & Thirst system.-character creation process.  Play as a male or femle, name them, choose a pre apocolypse profession (each profession comes with bonuses) or unemployed, plus give them merits and flaws. (I am paraphrasing here, I forget what they are called in game).-Weather (rain, snow) and yes, seasons!-Temperature system.-The ability to create your own ""custom sandbox"" zombie apocolypse-Upgrading and repairing. Bat+hammer+nails=Spiked Baseball bat, then use tools to repair it when needed.-Item conditions. Weapons get damaged and then eventually break.-Functional L.O.S. (Line of Sight) for both players and Zombies.   In other words you can only see the zombies in the direction your character is facing.-Multiplayer. Lots of Servers to join.-Skill system where if you want to improve a skill, you have to keep using it...and live long enough to improve it! Also you can read books related to skills for a xp boost when said skill is used.*Combining. Example A: I already have a kitchen knife and a jar of peanut butter. Find some bread, use the knife to cut the bread, knife+sliced bread+peanut butter=peanut butter sandwiches.Example B: Enter a house that still has power. Already have a frying pan equipped. Look in the refrigerator. Frying pan+chicken+peas (perhaps with a dash of salt and/or pepper, optional) = chicken and vegetable stir fry. Turn on the stove, place the stir fry in the pan on the stove, cook, and yum!Honestly I am glad I paid full price. Yeah I know it might sound crazy, it was just on sale not long ago but honestly the devs deserve every cent.I would easily give this game in its current state a 9/10. *Important* Just keep one thing in mind, this game is hard. Actually for those who may not know, you CANNOT win. There is no cure for the zombie virus and I am not sure if that will ever change. Playing Project Zomboid is playing out the story of a character, the story of how they died. This may be a deal breaker for some, which is why I bring it up. There is no way to 'WIN"" the game, you just survive as long as you can.			",80,24,0,34,16,1,10

								The Sims meets the end of the world - simply put! - This game has the most hours played in all my steam collection (with the possible except of DayZ where i have spent DAYS running from town to town) - If you love zombies this game is the best one on steam - First off Its indie developers are a lovely bunch of people who care passionately about their game, Modders have been taken into the fold - Don't let the early access put you off - its got one of the best communities of any game ever!Day 1 you start in a random location with nothing - and basically you have to survive, you won't though, no matter how good you are - eventually you will die - if its from rotten food, a small cut climbing through a broken window - or a helicopter flying over and bringing the zombie hoard to your door - you WILL die.The tension in the game is incredible, looking at the graphics you won't believe how invested you can get in your base/Equipment/character but you do - The tension when you're scouting a house and a zombie comes at you from nowhere and you have to beat him down with a frying pan - its just so intense!I have nearly 200 hours in this game, and it cost me less than £10 - I have converted about 5 people to the game, bought it for 3 other people WITH MY OWN MONEY because i would like to support the development.With NPCs coming - All new animations and running system (which looks amazing) - Split screen Co-op - Multiplayer this game is going from strength to strength - My go to survival game, and the most fun you can have with your shirt off!

								NPCs have been in development for years now.The animation update that was supposed to come out several major builds ago has been in development for years now.There's still an absolute dearth of content other than smacking zombies and looting houses. None of the story progression stuff, or any of the more interesting gameplay mechanics like mental states actually being important have been implemented. I remember, back when the devs suffered a loss of much of the game's data due to a burglary (I think?) and lacking an offsite backup, and one of the devs went on a drunken rant on twitter- I remember defending them, saying that sure, it was stupid to have only one backup, but this game was shaping up to be the zombie survival RPG thing that we all wanted at the time. Several years down the line, no meaningful progress has been made.			",138,22,4,25,39,1,28

								Best Zombie Survival Game Available.  If you havent played it...its like never having tried Sex, Drugs or Rock N Roll.  You'll be telling your friends OMG its AMAZING...DayZ is great for the ""First two weeks, close up experience""   7D2D is great for the building, fun and zombie killing action.Project Zomboid however is the best at giving you a simulation that captures the REAL fear, the melancholy, and the grim seriousness of being a survivor in a zombie apocalypse.The level of detail, depth and design of the game is sheer brilliance, and the Development team is a case study of how to do things right, you cant say enough great about them.Many different settings to tailor the game to your own taste, Fast or Slow Zombies?  Strong or Weak? Is a bite something that just needs a bandage or should you start making funeral arrangements ( AKA Drunken Bleach Fueled Suicide Run Going Down Guns Blazing ).You decide.

								Attempt 1. I spawned in an office inside a construction site where I Found a pencil and a piece of paper. I Went outside and got attacked by zombies. I managed to kill a few with my pencil but got quite scratched up. I hopped the fence and got attacked again, My Pencil broke in a zombie skull and I got bitten on the arm. I managed to get away but was moving slowly due to my injuries. I found a house, ripped up a shirt and bandaged up my wounds. I went to the bathroom to look for some pain killers but found a zombie and got hurt again. I stumbled from the house and got attacked again, I headed towards some trees to try to lose the pursuing zombies but died just as I made it to cover.Time survived 6 hours. 4 zombies killed.Attempt 2.I spawned in a trailer park where I found a school bag which I filled with a selection of food from the fridge and a bottle of water.  I went trailer to trailer gathering more food until I found a baseball bat. I left heading north and found a house to stay the night. The house across the street looked like a good place for a base with a high fence around 3 sides. I went through neighbouring houses, sheds and garages for supply’s during the days and read some beginners books for carpentry and cooking by night. Zombies kept wandering into my garden over night and I had to clear a few out each day with my trusty baseball bat.  I found a warehouse while exploring and found a hammer, nails, saw and axe. After a day of chopping trees and sawing logs I closed off the entrance to my garden to a narrow opening and that seemed to keep the zombies out. I got good at killing zombies with my new axe while on supply runs, Things were going well. I got over confident and managed to scratch myself on a broken window. I bandaged it but after a two days of replacing bandages I had an infection. I pushed forward my plans to raid a medical centre I had seen a long way south. I travelled the train tracks and entered the medical centre. The alarm went off as I made my way through but I carried on stocking up on supplies even as I heard zombies entering the building from the front. I planned to hop out the back window when I was done but they came through there too, trapping me. I battled my way out of the building but was scratched and bitten and in a bad way. I headed to a nearby house I knew I was going to die. So I stashed my bags of gear in a cupboard and went outside to die.Time survived 8 days and 14 hours. 147 zombies killed.Attempt 3. I don’t know where I am but I've got a rolling pin and I’m gonna find my house and then go and get my stuff back!I would definitely recommend this game. I’m only interested in playing single player mode so I feel it really needs the planned NCP characters to add more interest to the game. Also looking forward to the addition of vehicles. The new animations in the weekly blog look like they will improve the look too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is an absolute blast. It's hard to effectively convey how much fun this game is, because it doesn't seem like it would be fun and the trailers and screenshots do not do it justice, at all. But believe me when I say; if you're looking for a truely intense zombie apocalypse survival experience that is as realistic as it gets, where almost every moment incites true butterfly-inducing terror that resonates with your innermost being, while giving you all of this glistening, pant-soiling brilliance in a slightly retro, top-down, isometric view. This is your game. I mean, for pete's sakes, you have to change your bandages at least twice a day or you run the risk of making your wounds infected, which will slowly kill you, unless you disinfect them with alcohol and a sterilized bandage. You have to cover up windows with blankets, otherwise zombies will see you/lights inside houses and they absolutely, definitely, positively will check and break a window. When you get bitten? It slowly gets worse as you succumb to the zombie virus, you don't die instantly. You get paranoid of anything, you become fatigued and, after about a day, you die. Slowly, but surely. This game is cool as all hell.The controls are easy to grasp and the game runs smoothly, even if you're running the server software the game comes with and hosting at the same time, which is something I do frequently, to play with friends. It's also very easy to set up and comes with it's own server options.Speaking of options. Holy hell, the custom options for starting a new game are phenominal. You get to customize what your character is like, down to their personality as well as how often weapons spawn, how often things decay and what type of zombies you're dealing with. You could opt for a 28 Days Later feel, making them fast, strong and generally a massive pain in the backside, or if you're more into your Romero lore, you could set them up to be classic, brittle shamblers that seem to spot you from 700 lightyears away.Oh yeah, it's hard as hell as well. Don't expect to live forever, like other zombie games seem to allow you to do. This game is very realistic and eventually, you'll most likely run out of food and water. If you do manage to ensure your indefinite survival, then congratulations. You'd probably end up surviving a real zombie apocalypse.This game. Is awesome. 11/10. Best indie effort in ages.

								SINGLE PLAYER REVIEWProject Zomboid is like a crescendo that leaves you hanging forever.  Imagine climbing up a sheer cliff and then jumping off onto a giant comfy pillow.  That describes this game's difficulty curve.In the beginning you will be unarmed, unskilled and uncertain of what to do.  After a few trial-and-error deaths you'll get the hang of combat, how to move around safely, and what sorts of items you need to bring back.  You'll learn that some skills, namely carpentry, are far more important than others.  At that point you'll be faced with a choice of building a carpenter character or grinding your existing character into a carpenter through endless repetitive tasks.Why a carpenter?  One of the ultimate goals in this game is to build a safehouse that is impervious to zombie attacks.  You won't succeed without the carpentry skill, which lets you build walls, doors, storage devices and so on.  If you can build a wall around a water source and some dirt, you can eat and drink forever without risk of zombie attack.  This reveals the issue I have with Project Zomboid.  Once you have a nice stockpile and once you have a secure base, there is nothing else to do.  The zombies will never, ever be able to touch you unless you actively seek them out.  Even then, it's very easy to clear out the neighbourhood with an axe or gun to the point where you won't even see zombies anymore unless you set them to respawn in the world generation options.  In your safehouse you'll never run out of food or water so long as your sources are maintained behind safe walls.  Without the need to scavenge you'll have nothing to do except work on additional carpentry projects until you get bored, run outside with a shotgun and bag of shells, and court death in the middle of some giant horde.Project Zomboid says it is the story of how you died.  When you first start out, this will be absolutely true.  It's quite fun to sneak around town looking for bags of chips and planks of wood, although if you spend any time fighting you'll quickly learn how to lure zombies into chokepoints and kill them with impunity.  This game has been in Early Access for years.  I first played when you had to download versions from the Indie Stone forums, but I can't say that the game has really changed all that much.  It has a bit of a graphical overhaul, some additional features and types of loot, but also subtractions.  There used to be NPCs who would raid your house and hole up around town, but they've been removed and pending re-addition for ages.  All in all, it doesn't feel like the game has progressed significantly in spite of the years of development.  Likely, by the time a final release hits Steam 90% of the player base will have moved on to something else.This is a single player review, but it also extends to multiplayer with friends.  It's even easier with a couple of friends to build an invulnerable safe house and wind up with nothing left to challenge you.Final verdict:  It's quite fun for a few days, but once you get the hang of survival there will be no challenge.  Wait until if and when the game is finally done before you buy it, unless you love crafting games so much that you are desperate for a new one.  In that case, this game will tide you over.  If you have a lot of friends or want to play on a public server you can enjoy chaos, raiding and even warfare.  In that case the game may indeed be worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's not that bad of a game... BUT... It has promised quite a lot for a while now that it just hasn't given. We are only just getting cars and what not. The weapon system is rather flawed at the moment. The career options are rather limited and don't have much of an impact on the game. There is no story at all, so there isn't anything that really keeps you playing after like an hour or so. The crafting can be confusing to those that have never played this kind of game before. If we in the future get the NPC characters we have been promised for so long as well as some kind of story to follow then this will be a great game. I would hate this to turn into DayZ and be a derad title in the next year or so due to people giving up on the developers.			",37,6,1,11,0,0,0

								Been checking in on this game for years and it never changes. I used to be a devoted supporter, but have been seriously turned off by the development team's approach and lack of progress. Frankly, I don't believe that this game will ever be finished. I expect that the developers will eventually just get bored with programming an in-depth can opening simulator, release a half-finished version of the game, and move on.But seriously, I am disappointed. This one seemed like it had a lot of promise back in... Dammit, I was still in my twenties then!! *facepalm*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Maybe I will bite my tongue (or should I say my fingers) and take my words back at some point. But for now I must say that this game is no more than a joke. Updates just doesn't make any sense. No vehicles, no npcs, no navigation - absolutely nothing that is really important. And things has been this way for few years now. Those """"""""updates"""""""" they're releasing reminds me horse armor dlc for Oblivion. It is R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S. Just read the news feed for this game (and pay attention to the feature itself, not the way they tell about it) and you will kinda understand it on your own. Re-texrure, re-animation, re-sound and a new super feature ... CALORIES. Sounds fun, eh?They ""forbid"" to talk about that in their community forum, you see. They gone ""silence mode for our own sake"" (or some b*llsh*t like that) and don't give any feed about progress on serious stuff they promised long time ago. My guess - it's 0 and it's not going to be above anyway. Pretty sure they kinda mad they can't as well delete reviews here, in Steam store. Well, bad for you Indiestone, I will complain all I want here. Because I can. Because this is not your personal forum with only your loyal zombie-funboys army. After all, I paid my money for it. And I hope that at least one person will read my review and will not make this same mistake.			",18,4,0,8,8,0,10

								I've been a fan/follower of this gamer almost since it first released, and enjoyed it then; it was a niche game at the time, and still sort of is, and quite fun (to me) if you have the patience for that. However;I haven't played this game (for more than 5 minutes) in over 2 years now, and development in that time has been close to zero - in fact it WAS zero, until a small update about a month ago. I stopped following the newsletter because there simply wasn't anything substantial going on - this game is just taking far too long to work on. Features that have been promised for years are still in development, mainly the holy grail of AI survivors, but Workshop support can help flesh out the game a little more, and multiplayer will add in other survivors, but still...It's definitely a good game, at least a solid 6 in my opinion, but with the constant promises of, and still lack of, certain features like MUCH needed vehicles, NPC's etc., it feels like the game has been let down - this would be a positive review if news hadn't been promising these features for years now. If you're happy with the game as it is now, as though it wouldn't ever change, then go for it I guess, but I can't recommend it right now			",119,22,1,16,44,0,23

								Hi, I'm from the year 5527.NPCs and transportation are still 'coming soon'It's a good game for a while, and probably the best zombie survival game out there. It's just that the developers are so slow now that it's hard to actually recommend this game. They continually put out mundane updates and claim they are working on NPCs, but it's just so slow. This November it will be 3 years on Steam Early Access, and apparently it was out on their site for a while before then.Right now it suffers from the problem that every other survival game has - the world feels lifeless. Sure, there are zombies, but you end up feeling like the Omega Man.I'll come back to the review once NPCs have been added, should that ever actually happen.			",430,77,16,38,89,3,58

								I love the idea behind this game.  I love the direction that this game takes you.  I love the style of this game play.  Even the simplicity of the graphics are charming.  But I absolutely hate the pace of development by the devs.  This game is stuck in perpetual development limbo and seems it will NEVER be finished.  There are so many unfinished features (transportation, NPCs, etc) at this time that I cannot recommend this right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Game will never be finished, don't buy unless you want a solid 90s walking simulator without content. If you want to be bored and run around senseless and enjoy an empty world without opportunities (but with hordes of zombies at least), this game absolutely is  for you. Don't be fooled by the earlier positive reviews. The game once started promissing  but, as often, it's in Early Access since 6+ years now; in other words: the game will never be finished, it's just another eternal project of rookie coders. Too bad because the concept itself was quite good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I remember when they said the game was going to be 'finished' in 2016...here we are in 2017 still undone with little added since. There's been no talk of NPCs for damn long while and honestly whats a zombie game without interaction with a 'human' faction? A good zombie narrative isn't about the zombies, its how the humans survive. Yet they're focusing on cars(which was brought up well after npcs) and other 'new' stuff that doesn't change the game much. At this point, if you're looking for a good zombie game your best bet is playing a FREE roguelike(Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead)  or waiting until State of Decay 2 is released.			",36,9,0,14,2,0,1

								I have supported this game for a long time, have been patient, have given it the benefit of the doubt, and have done my time waiting.NPCs are never coming. They are not even being looked at. They were promised two, maybe even three years ago. It's never going to happen.I play the game every now and again to see what has changed, and all I keep seeing is the map getting bigger and more pointless items and clutter being added. This game is in dev hell. I bought it, because I believed it could be something great. And I still believe it could be, one day. Unfortunately that day may be sometime in the winter of 2050. You know, right after three hundred zombie survival games have been made from the ground up in the time it took them to implement NPCs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Never has drinking bleach been this much fun. Bleach is always realisticaly placed where it should be under most kitchen cabinents under the sink. I never have a hard time finding any, meaning, I can drink a lot of bleach and quite often as I please giving the game a lot of replayability value. Each game I start up I challenge myself to see, just how much bleach I can actually drink before falling over dead. 10/10 game can't wait to see the finished product.Bleach Drinking Simulator 2012			",243,25,1,33,24,1,37

								Project Zombiod is a cool game.I had looked at it a couple of times, but always veered away toward something else because of the graphics.When I look at titles described as ""rogue like"" or ""old school pixel graphics"", I make a little tsk-tsk-tsk and think to myself, ""c'mon it's 2015, make a great game AND give it modern, polished graphics"".I've never understood why a developer would create a game with retro graphics or why a gamer would choose a game like that.So yeah, I never would have purchased Project Zomboid, and it would have been my utter and absolute loss.The game really is great fun.  It's got depth, it's immersive, and when you are succeeding in your struggle to survive, it makes you feel like one man standing alone in the middle of the zombie apocalypse.You can do all kinds of things in this game, fighting and avoiding zombies, obviously, but when you loot common-place items, you can use them in all kinds of ways.  Barricade yourself, create sheet rope to have an escape from a top storey window, cut down trees, create planks, build all kinds of defenses, structures and utility items.  (And as you get better at your carpentry, the things you build look less rickety!)Heaps of ways to die, heaps of ways to survive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
First of all I would like to give a special thanks to an anonymous friend who purchased Project Zomboid for me some time ago. To be honest, I do not believe anything I say can bring justice to how fantastic this game is to me. Though I will attempt to keep this review as professional as possible, I do apologize if there are outbursts of bias within the contest. Project Zomboid is a top-down zombie survival game in which the player must create a character destined to die in the world with the goal of determining exactly how long they survived during the grueling face of an overrun population, with plagued populations of undead serving as the opposing force. Since this game is currently in Early Access at the time of this review’s posting, it does not yet contain all of the features that are planned for the full release. However, in its current build, I would recommend it at its current sale price.Here are just a few of the things that make Project Zomboid such an amusing title:The Developers - I realize that this point is not a core component while playing the game itself, but I feel as though I must give recognition to the development team of Project Zomboid. I personally have never witnessed such a respectful cast of individuals when it comes to interacting with players and the game itself. As a primary mention, these individuals send notifications to subscribers consistently every Monday, termed Mondoid Monday by the Indie Stone, which provides readers with updates as to what ideas are to be implemented, answering questions from contributors, and informing players of the current build’s status. Though the game is currently in Early Access at the time of this review’s writing, these constant updates presented by the developers have the potential to comfort players such as myself as to the condition of the completed product. Project Zomboid may be considered by some to be concluded as it stands; this is much more satisfying in strict comparison to other Early Access titles that stereotype the build and tend to break promises.Pre-Game Setup - In the general disarray that encompasses the world regarding defeating and surviving against an endless undead hoard, there are certainties in the abundance of pre-game editing that tailor the experience as one that is unique to the individual player. ///  I would first like to speak about the initial world composition, which allows simple attributes while playing through modes such as Sandbox to be altered. With these features, the player creates how the apocalypse occurs by selecting a premade map, modifying certain functions such as how long a typical in-game day lasts-ranging from five minutes to a realistic twenty-four hours out of game-, and the period of time in which electricity and water will remain operational throughout the selected world. These attributes can be set to be more random while in Sandbox mode, but add so much to customization that they should not be overlooked; of course, the game was updated many times since my last online play-time so I may be missing out on some features as it stands.///  Character creation appears to be very simplistic but its intricate nature is revealed while the players flesh out their individual during play. The player selects a basic set of clothing as well as a profession, traits, and look; a character’s profession outline starting equipment and statistics while the character’s appearance is merely cosmetic. Character traits are where the game excels, though, as these allow the player to outline how they will possibly play. For example, a character with claustrophobia will be plagued with fear while indoors, but may have a trait which counteracts this. As players select possible traits, negatives must also be selected to even things out, so there is decent balance to this system.Undead Artificial Intelligence (AI) - The enemy AI react to players as you would expect them to: merciless, in a one-directional path with the intent of slaughtering the player’s created character to produce the end-game indication. As simple as this may sound, the undead AI in Project Zomboid is actually quite brilliant, as they can track your movements only if you are in a presented location-such as on the other side of an open window; a hoard crowds a character if a gunshot is heard. Interaction with these enemies intensifies the atmosphere of lay, and has likely been improved with more recent updates. Though neutral non-player characters are not yet present in Project Zomboid in the time of this review’s writing, tests by the developers suggest a promising finished product.Gameplay and Mechanics - Your character has much more depth in-game then what is in their biography and statistics sheet. There are multiple conditions which must be monitored by the player-including thirst, hunger, fear, mood, and physical strain. Given status effects may afflict the player such as fatigue, and determine the player’s tactics, with enough openness to allow the use of multiple approaches; with a world infested by the undead this is highly necessary as the game’s open-world style should permit such an approach. Unlike other top-down zombie survival titles, Project Zomboid features an impression of realism few others can accomplish: line of sight is paramount for your character, which enhances the survival aspect perfectly; be sure to watch your back! Apart from the conditions and base statistics associated with your character, they can also learn new skills such as farming, carpentry, and cooking to perform unique and useful tasks by taking time in-game to read related books. This system permits the player to specialize in specific skills that may enhance play.TL:DR - I regretfully can say that there are some features such as the Steam Workshop and Creative mode that I have not yet experienced, however the base game is so fantastic that I would like to vouch for it being worthy of its current retail price of fifteen dollars. If you enjoy more realistic survival games and combatting or running from hordes of undead while scavenging a rather large world, then this game is most definitely for you. This title is also recommended for players who enjoy roleplaying as characters in an open-world adventure; I prefer to write journals for my characters to enhance this aspect. Please give this game a go even in its current Early Access state. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews	.			",223,50,2,28,18,2,28

								Project Zomboid is a game I own since 2011, back when it was still only available on Desura and The Indie Stone's website. The hardships the developers have faced during the years of development and the passion they've shown for the game and it's community is extraordinary. Aside from that, Project Zomboid is also damn fun to play and this is what earns it my recommendation.Update 23-11-2016: Nominated for the “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award!

								dont get me wrong i love this game.. well at least i did, here is why im starting to get annoyed.. having played this almost since the beggining of its gaming life i am finding its additions rather lacking... i jump on every 6 months hoping that NPCs would be introduced.. still not in the game? no worries i can wait, but at least bring back a random survivor, i miss kate so much... even if her dialogue ended after a few lines it still gave that sence that your finding resouces and needed to be brought back home... every house now is just a storage containment unit... but i can wait... I jump on and see that there adding a food calories section.. ok im starting to worry, why in gods name in a zombie survival game must i worry about my calories? Food quality i understand but am i going to have to start washing hands before i eat? Am i going to start brushing my hair... ok.i get some like that nonsence... but the last straw is seeing i now have to wash my clothes due to blood splatter WTF... this is a zombie survival game and every passing day its just turning into the Sims. If you havent played it yet, i strongly reccommend you do, but for those of us whom supported this game from the start its becoming a bit of a joke now. What exactly is your aim here lads? are you tring to create true Artificial intelligence before releasing NPCS, and thats what worries me the most, its almost like there vision is bigger than what it should be for this game. I honestly hope they succeed and i will change my downvote when the time comes, but this vote is just to show some displeasure at its direction. Come on guys i have faith in you, add a dog or cat that i can take home .. anything.Remember the guy in the supermarket with a shotgun.. found a survivor, starts shooting at ya, you panic knowing he is just bringing the horde closer and closer, take him down, loot what you can, run to safety.. that was exciting.. washing my clothes isnt.This Review was posted a while ago, but due to the nature of morons seemingly not being able to understand that i do love playing this game, it seemed to deviate from what i had wanted it to be.. a positively negative protest review that still urged people to play it, or at least get the demo and give it a go.. so im reposting it without the comment section that could only be described as cancerous.. Jesus Chuck Norris Christ, watch out for there fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I was alive. Now I'm not.I started in my house. It was a small little cottage, in a suburb close to the city.But there was a couple of pieces of food in the fridge, so I knew I needed to go out and actually scavenge. I did not know things were this bad though. Right when I stepped outside, one of them spotted me.Not wanting to lead it inside, I ran around the outside of my house. Little did I know that an entire group of them waited around the other side. I panicked and they spotted me. As they slowly shambled towards me, I ran back into my house into the bathroom. I frantically shut the door behind me. As soon as I did that I heard my windows shatter, along with pounding on my door and many low groans. I knew I couldn't stay there.I, as quietly as possible, snuck out my bathroom window while the horde pounded down my doors. I snuck past them and made my way to another small house down the road.On my way I had to take down one of them with my fists. I frantically beat the infected woman down until each my blows were responded with a crunch. I searched her body to find a pistol and six bullets.With that I felt invincible! Finally I had a weapon to use against them. Now when I got there I was exhausted. My house was destroyed and I had nowhere to go and no one to even talk to. I didn't even bother to check the house or close the curtains. I just immediately sunk into the closest bed I could find. I quickly fell into a deep slumber...Suddenly, I sprung up. I heard a window smash, and two figures were climbing through it, into my room. Terrified, I grab my pistol and fired at them, only landing about two shots.That was my mistake. I heard hundreds of more groans outside. The sound was deafening. I sprinted through the house to escape. But just as I opened the door, another one of them was right behind it! I fell back, only to have one of the ones from earlier grab and bite my hand. I jerked it away, leaving my left hand cut and bleeding bad. I scrambled past them to the nearest room I could find. As soon as I got in I slammed the door behind me. I was in another bathroom. But this one had no windows, no other doors, no ways to escape. As I turned back the way I came there was a loud 'thunk' on the door. It was quickly followed by another one.Scared for my life, I sunk back into the corner. I was still bleeding badly and was starting to hurt real bad. I had no meds, so I took of my sweater and tore it up to form a makeshift bandage. Hours pass. The banging on the door had continued relentlessly. I was still bleeding real bad and hurting even worse now. It felt like my bones would break with each move. I was now starting to think I was infected. That sudden thought of dying sparked something in me. I suddenly felt brave. I could take on whatever was outside. It didn't matter that I was half awake and starving. I could do it.I powerfully swung the door open, only to knock back one of them onto the floor. It seems as if the rest of them just straight up and left after their meal ""got away"". I bravely stomped it down, and opened the door to take on the world.I ran straight to the city in my fit of bravery. But the city quickly ended my fit of bravery. There were a lot of them in the city. It seemed like tons were waiting around every corner. Feeling defeated, I sheepishly slinked down an alley to go back. Only to have one of them at the end spot me. As I prepared to fight it, all the pain, hunger and tiredness from earlier flooded my body again. I tried to fight, but was powerless against the creature. I pulled out my gun, but was in no condition to shoot, much less aim. I obviously missed.That made it worse. The crowds funneled into the alley to feast on me as my body quickly was torn up. I drifted out of consciousness, into dark oblivion...Also you can garden. ",84,10,0,14,13,1,3

Early Access Review
								August 29th, 2016- The Developers showed us a working preview of the animation update in March. It is now about to be September and animations are still TBA. The past 8 weeks of Mondoid newsletters have been a constant stream of excuses and problems getting the animations together. Animations were slated to be added back in build 34 but were delayed. We are now in build 35.11 on the beta branch with still no animations. Week before last they were trying to get the Females working right so they could get them into the beta branch. The next week they had it working, but had to 'iron things out' (again) before releasing them into the beta branch. Now this weeks mondoid they are at a convention and no work is being done(again). As someone that keeps up with this game and religiously reads the Mondoid Newsletters every Monday over lunch, I'm entirely expecting at least 4 more weeks before we get any access to the animations that were shown back in MARCH. I really want to like this game, I've been keeping with it for 2 years now. But we still dont have any NPC's, animations, vehicles, or anything to do past setting up a base and grinding food for all eternity. Some things have been added over the past year(tv's and radios that do nothing but add story fluff and attract zombies). They've been re balancing nutrition now for months and its still not done. Lone modders have developed more content for this game in the past year than the dev team has. As of now i cannot recommend this game, maybe 2 years from now when it gets 'rushed' into 1.0, but certainly not right now.Update-September 5th- Still no animations. More problems getting them ready. Finally got a 'transfer all items button' programmed though(after years), and now you can dry a towel...September 12th- Still nothing. ""The new animations system is the first step in our internal plan to feed all our remaining 1.0 features into the game, something we’ll expand on once we’ve kicked the anims out of the door."" This is the same song we keep getting in the Mondoids. If this is the 'first step', and its taking this long, I expect it to be a several year plan.September 19th- Animations still not out. Another rehash of the ""Once we’ve got the Incidentals out of the way we can release and get motoring with the pipeline that leads to all of our other 1.0 features"" statement we've been getting for a few months now. They were a little more forthcoming with info this week on whats going on though. Evidentially after these months of working on the animations they still are full of 'gaps' and ""You can’t turn on a dime with the new animations, so it can feel a little clunky when you’re indoors"". They did get a few new things done this week, such as lumberjacks walking through trees faster, and the ability to find jars in packs for improved pickling mechanics.  Devoting team resources to pickling is more pertinent in a zombie survival game than the ability to move properly...September 29th- It has now been a month since I wrote this review and (surprise!) the animations still have not been delivered. I'm getting to the point now that I'm not even reading the Mondoids the day of anymore, because I know that the animations still won't be out and it'll just be another disappointing read. I feel like General Arcade is doing more work on this game than the actual dev team at this point...Here's to another month of fruitless patience!October 3rd- Month 2 begins with more delays in the animations as now the faces needed to be redone. Fortunately they gave the anims the ability to blow their own brains out this week too, so they dont have to suffer the incompetence of these devs anymore.October 10th- No update at all this week. They are too busy 'banging away'. Starting to take bets on how many more weeks... months, it's gonna take for the anims. My guess is sometime in 2017.October 24th- Gave an extra week to continue this review, thinking maybe that would give a little more time for some progress.... nothing has been done. Its now almost been 2 months since I started this, and the game is in the same exact state. Everything is still ""coming soon"" just like it was a year ago. Fortunately the devs have picked up on the fact that its fan base is turning against them, and made half the Mondoid last week about pleading for people to be patient. Maybe if we're patient for another year the animations will 'come out soon'... or (if the devs history repeats itself) won't.November 1st- After another lovely month of nothing we finally get some form of update! Now the map has more areas! You can continue to play the same outdated content in the same buildings with slightly different layouts! Never-mind that the animations still aren't done and are being talked about less and less in the Mondoids. As another month has now passed, Im once again reassured by the same ""we're busy banging away"" quote I've received on a weekly basis now for a year...December 5th- Another month gone by, still no animations in sight. Still 'banging away' indefinitely with not a single hint at release, the team is now working on testing the VOIP work General Arcade did for them. It has now been over 9 months since the animations preview was shown in a video demo. I could have conceived, grown, and birthed a human child in the time its taken, and TIS still don't have any clue of an ETA on animations.January 10th, 2017- Still no info or eta on animations. Devs are now preparing to outsource development on vehicles to General Arcade(they were actually able to do some work and get the VOIP done). Guess they are starting to feel less confident about their capability to code. Two more months of this and it will have been a year since the devs showed us that 'working' preview of the animations. STILL NO ETA IN SIGHTApril 4th, 2017- We are on Build 37.5 now and there are still no animations(they were said to be Build 34). As of now the animations have completely fallen off of the radar and are no longer being talked about. You get a nod to them existing at best. Vehicles are still being worked on, are the new big feature we are being teased with now(they seem to have forgot the last 4 big things they were working on for us), and will be out 'soon' once they are done 'banging under the hood' some more. In more tangible news: this weeks mondoid states that the new build will be in beta branch this week. Its been 4 months since the last build was released and in a 3rd of a years time they have managed to get a microwave ui and a lootable maps system done. Fortunately the devs are talking about hiring on outside AAA and indie devs to help them(probably since outsourcing work from GA is the only thing thats gotten anything substantial done recently). Can't wait to see how long until the vehicles fall off the radar and some new feature that will never come out is teased.  ITS BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE THE WORKING PREVIEW OF THE ANIMATIONS WAS SHOWN.			",103,19,1,10,3,0,20

								This game interested me for a while before I finally bought it.  I have to say it's well worth the 15 bucks I spent.  The atmosphere is amazing.  When I play I usually turn off all lights, and then use a headset for a full immersion experience.  I love the fact that you make the story as you go along.  I haven't played for very long, but with that said I will be playing this game a ton from here on out.  In my last play through I lived 16 days.  I found a huge warehouse surrounded by loads of zombies.  I cleared them out for a full in game day.  Finally when I was done I searched the warehouse.  The power was off by this time in the game.  I was stumbling around in the dark as I forgot my flashlight.  I went to the 2nd floor trying to find a bed or couch to sleep as I was exausted.  I thought I saw a door......well was no door was a railing.  Fell to first floor and got stuck behind crates with a broken leg.  Eventually I died as I couldn't move.  I killed over 200 zombies, secured my safehouse area, gathered enough food and water to last me a month in game time, and the thing that kills me is that.  This game is amazing! 10/10			",59,16,1,13,17,0,19

								Amazing depth for an Early Access Release (although, going on 3 years now), so many things to find already, crafting and building seem endless and the zombies are classic Romero style...the Devs are very active on and off the forums with regular feedback and game updates / fixes...Explore, scavenge, build, kill, craft and more...with a story mode and NPC's down the road (way down the road), there is multiplayer, a day/night cycle, migrating zombie hordes, an ever growing map, modding support plus Survival / Sandbox / and Last Stand game modes along with a metaverse system that tracks off-screen survival...this will be a must have for anyone looking to play not only a great zombie survival game, but a great survival game period!How will you die?

TL;DRThis is as real as the apocalypse gets for video games.I've played lots of zombie games, like the Rebuild series, State of decay, the last stand, you name it, and this is the most realistic out of all of them.This is a great game whether or not you have friends to back you up and every playthrough is different especially if you choose different traits in game.Although this has a few minor items that make the game feel less real (like lack of clothing options or lack of cars) this is still a great game that you should try at least once.Pros+Constant updates (If you are using IWBUMS that is)+Huge map+Lots of player-made content+Very realistic+Mod friendly+Good community+Huge selection of items found in every day situations+Good crafting system+Good graphics+Very dynamic character upgrades+Players can get sick, injured, sad+Zombie speeds can be changed from walker, to jogger, to runner in settings+Still has room for a lot of improvementCons-For character torso, you either have a vest or sweater.-For character bottom, you can only have pants and shoes. (Or take it off)-No NPC's (Yet- I'm not counting this against the review)-No Cars (Yet- Again, not counting against.)RatingWithout a doubt a 10/10This gives other zombie games a run for their money in terms of realism, and I am scared and excited for this game's full release.This review will be updated upon playing the full release ",136,31,0,21,12,1,8

								When somebody sees this game, they might think it's just another early access zombie survival game, most of which being awful. However, this game is not another game where you play as ""the Rambo of the apocalypse,"" shooting every zombie in sight, crafting better and better weapons. Instead, you play as the average Joe, who somehow managed to not become one of the hundereds of zombies occupying Knox County. Instead of having some crafting table where you can build a castle right off the bat, you need to find everything needed to build the walls just to protect your garden. The loot system works pretty well, you find stuff where you would normally find it. Houses have average loot, including food, bats, golf clubs, and the occasional gun or case of bullets. Warehouses will generally have crafting supplies, police stations will have guns and ammo, and so on. You will find the occasional out-of-place item, like a gun or bullets in the elementary school. You need to debate doing anything in the game, since one slip-up could spell certain death. There have been way too many times where I decide to go loot a building by the highway and am ingulfed in zombies. The dev team, The Indie Stone have done a superb job at creating this game, and every update makes the game much more fun, realistic, and, of course, difficult. You will not find a better zombie survival game out there, and I more than reccomend it.			",355,91,1,38,34,5,61

								The steam release date is so misleading. This game has actually been in developement for more like 5 years. I totally sympathize with the studio, what with their building being robbed of its computers and code at one point in developement. But its at a situation now where they should just bite the bullet and hire on more programmers. We've been waiting on NPC's for years now.I definitely recommend this game, but only once the NPC metagame is added and truly justifies base building.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sad to see this one dieNow... I've never felt extreamly sad about a game dieing before, but this one is just a massive heartbreaker. So much potental... waisted.It is a Good game, honestly one of the best zombie apocolyse survivor sims out there, but if you are looking for a game that will finish in your lifetime then dont even bother. The only things that add any extreamly immersive content to the game are the mods that you can download off the steam workshop.A few years ago the devs were active, but now they're just not. Puny ""updates"" that add the most minor and trivial features to the game, with apsolutly no mention of the MAIN FEATURES they were talking about several years ago! The modding communty is more friken active, and involved then the devs are.I'll change this review when they actualy DO somthing with this game.			",36,5,0,11,10,0,12

								The only true zombie survival game out there probably. Seriously, this game is worth the 15 dollars, especially if you have a friend. It may be early access, and the devs might be a bit slow at releasing FULL new builds, but you can play the new builds in play testing pretty much every month. There is alot of polish on this game, which is probably why it takes so long to come out with new builds. This game is a SIMULATOR pretty much. Not a joke, you gotta eat, sleep, watch your wounds, not panic, not get tired....it's a tense experience all around. If you get bit, you might as well drink bleach or chug sleeping pills and wait for it to end, or go out in a blaze of glory. You can do whatever you want in this game, build a base at a motel, live in the forest by farming and collecting rain water, or just be a nomad. Just be prepared for when winter rolls around...... ANYWAY! This game gets a solid 9/10, completely reccommend. Only reason it isn't 10/10 is because, while it has enough content to justify even a 25 dollar price tag, it IS in early access. That comes with the full early access package of: Bugs, glitches, unfinished content, etc. But like i said before, these devs are trustworthy. And EVEN IF THEY DID run away with the money, it's still a game worth checking out considering it is comlpete enough to justify the price tag.			",180,24,0,17,18,1,29

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: Zomboid is an immensely intricate, challenging, rewarding game supported by a dedicated team of indie developers, and is a must-play for anyone interested in the zombie survival genre.Many people choose to turn to the FPS genre for their zombie apocalyptic survival games, but with Project Zomboid, I feel that the developers at The Indie Stone scratch that itch perfectly.For starters (and I feel that this is sorely mentioned in reviews), The Indie Stone has been CONSISTENTLY developing this game since it was released on Steam. They continue to show their passion for this project with regular updates, developer blogs, videos explaining new features, and much, much more. They have provided a strong example of how Early Access is supposed to be done, and I fully anticipate that they will have a full release of this game at some point (though, as far as I'm concerned, the game in its ‘early access’ state is worth far more than the $15.00 asking price).As for the game, mechanics can be read about here in other reviews, found online (particularly in the Zomboid Wiki), or learned as you play – they aren’t that difficult to grasp, and their simplicity makes the game that much more charming.HOWEVER, do not be deceived by the surface simplicity – this game is incredibly challenging, and as a good game should, it rewards those who ‘get it’ with a truly unique gaming experience. Every time I start up a new character, I get further than I did on the last. Let that be a testament to the game’s consistency – you’re not going to die constantly from zombie bites if you know how to evade/fight them; you’re not going to bleed to death if you know not to climb through a broken window OR how to patch yourself up if you do.Virtually any building can be made into a shelter. Doors and windows can be barricaded. Ropes can attach to upper story windows for security. Furniture can be moved, taken from other buildings and brought to yours, or built. And with tools like the sledgehammer, virtually anything can be destroyed. You can even build entirely new structures once your carpentry skill is high enough and you have the supplies to do so.How do you get the supplies? Looting. This game’s inventory system is simple and repetitive at times, but it gets the job done. Backpacks and hiking bags help you deal with the large amounts of weight you’re going to be carrying. Looting houses, diners, warehouses, and even banks requires thought and skill to decide what you need and what you don’t. Supplies are finite, so there’s always the constant thought of, “well, maybe I’ll need this box of paperclips sometime! Better grab it now while I’m here!”When looting, be careful of your surroundings. Zombies are almost always present, and while at times the game can feel like more of a general survival simulator rather than a zombie game, they’re always lurking around the next corner.I could go on and on about the intricacies of this marvelously crafted game, but suffice it to say that, if you’re looking for a zombie game that surpasses the norm and want to support fantastic indie developers, look no further than Project Zomboid.

								SECOND EDIT: Another two months have passed and they've made no progress whatsoever on animations, let alone NPCs (don't ask about them on the forums, anyone who isn't a moderator will jump on you in an instant). They seem to be focused on making food realistic instead. This will be my last edit as I'm officially done with this game and it's devs. Goodbye Project Zomboid, it was fun.EDIT: It's been about five months since I wrote my original review. Literally nothing has happened development wise, and I do mean literally. This last mondoid was what prompted me to write this, seeing as the last year has been ""animations right around the corner, coming soon"". As far as I'm concerned this game is dead in the water and won't be finished. Don't waste your money.I've had this game for a very long time (Around 3 years) and many others have had it for even longer (Around 5 years). The general consensus among non-fanboys is that the development time is overly slow and the Dev's ""It's finished when it's finished"" policy is detrimental to their standing. Anyone asking about NPCS, vehicles, etc has their thread locked and are sometimes banned. However, the game is still very good. One of the best Zombie Survival Games out there. The problem is that without NPCS single player gets extremely lonely and tedious, and in multiplayer some features can't be properly used because you can't time skip (IE Farming). Once you get farther into the game you pretty much just sit in your fort and eat/sleep, or in multiplayer you do the same but without sleeping. When the game is finished (2 years from now at least), I'll give this game a wholehearted recommendation. Until then I'll not support TIS until they deliver on years old promises.Pros:+Large maps to explore+Good crafting system+Good injury system (Simple, but still)+Good graphics for a top down gameCons:-Boring combat-Shallow end game content (Sit in an invincible safehouse with unlimited food/water)-Lack of weapons and clothing-Guns are completely worthless-NO NPCS-No ETAs whatsoever, any questions regarding undelivered content is met with ""It's done when it's done"" and a lock. EDIT: This is no longer the case, the mods are much more lenient about this now. Fanboys will attack you however.			",42,2,0,6,9,0,8

								ShakyShawn8151's Review: I played this game in the past, and just recently picked it up on steam. I played it when it was not very well developed. Then today I picked up a copy and I will share with you all my experiance.Started out by clicking beginer. I am no noob to survivial games, so I started out in a nice house. It was a 1 bedorom flat with a open living/dining room. there were curtains on all the windows so I took the chance to close them after taking a glance out them to check my suroundings [It was all clear]. I then had a small sence of security that I knew would not last for long, as all it takes is for my poorly spec'd char to make a noise and attract walkers (thankfully I did not see any runners). I then made my way to the kitchen and saw that there was 2 windows, one with no curtain and one by the door, which was really good as I did not want to open the door and be rushed by zombies. I grabbed a sheet I found and covered it over the other window.  The house was now poorly secured and would provide a temporary shelter. I then went though the house and looked for all things that i could put to use. Sadl all I found was some food, which I ate then decieded I had to journey out to the unknown or I would not survive an attack or defend my shelter, I looked out the windows and tried to get an idea of what was around me, I saw another house to the east of my location, so I had to get there and hope it was empty.After I left out the back door all sence of security left me, and I felt like a small part of a huge world. I looked around a bit and slowly made my way to the backdoor of the house, I then did not feel safe to just walk right in, so I snuck around to each window and peaked in and saw every room was empty, besides the one that did not have a window. I then entered the house via the backdoor, and started looking the house, I found a skill book (cannot remember which book it was) I then took a bat, some sheets, and some food, I then snuck back to the house I started in. After stuffing my face my character started feeling like a fat misserable person (depression kicked in). I then found a magaziene in the bookshelf and gave it a read hoping this might take the players mind of the depression, after a good 5 minutes of messing around I went to gets some sleep after going out and checking to see if the perimiter was safe and secure. I slept for 7 hours.I awoke with one thought; ""How long can I survive like this""I searched and looted, and fought my way day by day, every day being harded than the last, food running shorter and shorter. I ended up getting caught while transvering the forest in the night (Which I still feel like an idiot for) I was panicing out in the rain in the dark, and was trying to get back to my shelter. I had not known that I had a pack of zombies on me, and I ran back into my shelter. within 2 minutes that had me surrounded so I knew I had no way out, I was a sitting duck, I managed to use up the ammo I did have and had to run upstair to fend off what I could before I met my maker, I was backed into a corner and fought to keep 15 zombies at bay with a hurt leg and bleeding for 3 minutes before I died... 9/10 would die again and enjo my experiance anyday. was a good buy.

								The best most realistic zombie survial game ever made.Forget AAA graphics, this game has EVERYTHING else.Cannot recommend this enough. Get to a house to want to hole up in, start covering the windows with sheets, miss one or you miss a zombie that followed you. The next thing he's beating down the window, attracting everything around, you panic. You go outside split him with a hammer. Go back inside, you're safe - for the night...10/10 would die again.

								If only they spent as much time trying to finish the game as they do writing essays.Zomboid isn't as much of a mess as most other EA games I've bought into or seen, but the bar for EA games has fallen very very low. If you play zomboid you'll probably have a good time. That good time will last a few days depending on how many hours you can get in, but once you figure out how to survive and build your first safehouse, you'll lose intrest quickly.I can't recommend the game at this point while it's missing so much content, and while I'd like to say I'll come back and change my review when it's done, somehow I feel it'll still be unfinished years from now.

								Amazing, just amazing. +Deep survival simulator, that will only get better with more updates. (hunger, sicknes, depression, fear, temperature, etc) +Logical crafting system that goes way beyond other games and is very, very extensive. +HUGE map http://pzmap.crash-override.net/   EVERY house, building, complex can be entered and can be turned in to your homebase/fort. You can even wall in the entire downtown area and be a self proclaimed mayor. Imagination is the only limit. +Realistic zombies with tons of options to customize them to your liking in sandbox mode. Only want shamblers, with bad hearing, excellent eyesight, average smell, dont respawn after being killed and is urban focused? YOU GOT IT! PLUS a TON more options. +Looting and scavenging for survival. Break in to every house and see what goodies you can find, maybe it is a former survivor house with tons of food stashed away or maybe the house alarm will trigger and draw massive zombies to you location, LEG IT!I mean, I just scratched the surface here, I could go on and on about this game. it is fantastic! AND it will get better. With a mature community and a developer that listen to its players, thing can only go in one direction. ",16,4,0,5,6,0,11

								Alright. First of all, I do not know why I am writing this. It won't probably get noticed, but if you are reading this, and are thinking of buying it, listen up.Do you like left 4 dead? If you do, this game isn't similar to that, at all. This is a game where you create a story. Create a character and try your best to live his last days or weeks (or even months, if you're skilled enough). This is a game of patience. You have to slowly experience your character to his limits. You have to teach him how to fish. YOU have to teach him how to build a fort, and you have to teach him how to fight the greater evil. Be careful though. This isn't a story about how you suddenly met 100 zombies and went full rambo on them and now you're the old man telling your grandkids these tales. It is a story, a tale on how you survived against the dozens of hordses what came around when the mankind fell. This game, THIS GAME is the one where you can prove your point with your friends in the argument of ""Who is the one of us to die first?"" or ""Who will last longest?"". This is the suitable game for that. They are even going to add advanced NPC's soon that are going to function just like a normal player. Spooky, aint it? Now, back from the character. The music is extremely good. Let me give you an example of an interactive music demo from ingame music. Click on the link, and read the text and try to live the story. You don't have to listen to the whole song.Imagine the violins playing when you've fought your last battle, and got bitten. You know you have a few hours left and decide to take your stuff and leave. You wander off to the city. The city is quiet, but suddenly zombies appear around every corner. You ready your shotgun.Your panic increases when you put the bullets in the barrel and you become slower every second. You dropped a bullet accidentally out of panic. There's no time for more reloading. You equip your shotgun and stand still for a few seconds to aim correctly into the horde. A few zombies fall, but it doesn't hinder the movement of the undead. You take a few steps back and you fall. You get up as fast as you can. You can hear the zombies growling a hundred feet away.You arrive home. Your last moments are near. You open the drawer and find a picture of your family, dead a long time ago. Your tears drop down the picture, and it gets wet. After 30 minutes of crying, the tears start fueling your rage. You are after revenge.You return to the horde. You walk slowly and wait until the zombies hunker near you. You have your trusty machete in your hand. As the zombies come you slice them up and roar like a predator from every slaughter. As you work your way through all of the zombies, they start to increase in numbers. Suddenly, when youre swinging the blade into the skull of the last nearby zombie, the color of your sight starts to disappear. You now see only in the colors of white and black. You try to retreat but eventually pass out.THIS IS HOW YOU DIED.The game will become even more masterful when the seasons, the medical overhaul, and the other survivors arrive. Just wait. I love this game. You should try out the demo if youre still considering, but I have a few things to tell you. Enter houses through windows, holding E when you are trying to access them. The doors are rarely open. You also have limited time, because the character youre playing as has got bitten. It gives some taste what the game is like. I have no idea how outdated it is what-so-ever.Oh, its an early access game? The devs are the most active devs I've ever seen. They are very systematic, every monday there is an update of what they are doing, was it big or small, its still there every week. They are also open for suggestions, as they added a brilliant mod to the develop scheme a few weeks ago, what introduces seasons. I would reccommend this game to anyone, and soon you can still play it alone with no friends because of the NPC's. You can literally team up with them and arrange them to loot for food and such.

Early Access Review
								Dawn of the Zed - Lively Community :DFor a top down survival game I was pleasantly surprised. You spawn in random house in one of three small american towns (connected by roads) and are tasked with surviving as long as possible.In the PvE servers I found this very fun. Zombies aren't very dangerous individually but when a zombie hits you it applies a 1 second invisible debuff that halves your movement speed. If multiple zombies are hitting you then it stacks to the point where you can barely move at all. What's more if you are wielding anything other than a knife then your character can only shove and grapple with zombies when they are pressed up against you meaning that if 4-5 zombies grab you then you are doomed, you will only be able to keep shoving them away but they close in again before you have pushed them all away from you.With good timing you can still melee groups of 10 zombies, swinging just as they are about to enter range but this is absurdly dangerous and you will need to attempt to divide the groups by luring the slightly faster ones away or running around the group picking off stragglers. Or even just play is safe and avoid them, you get little loot from zombies and are encouraged to kill them only if ignoring them is even more dangerous.Guns are powerful but take skill to use with the exception of the shotgun which is almost as effective at low skill as high skill. However they make a lot of noise and draw zombies from VERY far to your location so you will mostly want to use melee weapons and only fire a gun if you have 100+ shotgun shells and intend to clear the entire areaThe game uses a profession, trait and skill system. Different professions offer different skill boosts and even unique bonuses that cant be gained other ways like desensitization for a military veteran or high fitness for a fitness instructor. They also give positive or negative trait points which brings me to the traits. Positive traits cost trait points and negative traits give trait points. You cannot complete your character unless your trait points are 0 or higher. This encourages the player to pick positive and negative traits to reflect their intended role in the gameFor instance a homemaker character might be a carpenter who has the traits that provide a starting skill boost and exp multiplier for carpentry, cooking, first aid, farming, fast learner and foraging, but to balance this they took the negative traits of cowardice, asthma, thin skinned, disorganisation, clumsy (loud) and poor healingOn the other hand a scavenger might be organised, aware, graceful (quiet), stealthy, athletic, a sprinter and lucky (high chance of good items in loot containers), but also illiterate, stupid, hemophobia and cowardlyThen again a dedicated zombie slayer to accompany scavengers might be a fireman with brave, strong, fit, self-defense and thick skinned but illiterate, deaf and disorganizedSadly there is a little balance in skills and some are more effective than others. Carpentry is amazing as the skill, as are the combat skills and sprinting, but farming, cooking, foraging and fishing are pretty useless, and first aid is pretty useless outside pvp too.On the servers I played on there were plenty of resources when you know where to look, and once you get good at avoiding zombies or dividing groups to pick them off one by one the zombies aren't much of a threat either. The building materials (nails, axes) and ammo are usually hotly contested and a lot of players steal from each other. As a result the other thieving players become the greatest threat on pve servers and you will either have to hide your stash well such as in dense woods, or place traps throughout your house, and by that I mean removing floor tiles and covering them with zombie corpses that float over them so they can't see the hole. A fall means a guaranteed broken leg which leaves you moving at half speed and takes 3 weeks (21 hours) in-game to heal with the fast healer perk. Not impossible to heal I've managed it myself, but most players would just stash their items, commit suicide and make a new character than limp around for most of a real day. Unfortunately there are also griefers who put holes in public buildings to break the legs of other players and in a game with perma death it really is harshI really wouldn't recommend pvp. The range of the screen is not that high and if you are running down a street the opposite direction to another player they will be in firing range by the time you realize it. Players can take a lot of bullets from guns before they die, but a single lodged bullet will cause a player to bleed out unless treated with rare medical tools. If you have 3+ lodged bullets you will bleed out before you can remove the bullet, stitch the wood and bandage all 3 woods even with high first aid and the dextrous trait. What's more the gunshots will draw zombies to your location forcing you to quickly vacate the area before you can even stop to treat the wounds. The only exception to this is if you chose to play a police officer and gun down about 3000 zombies to get to level 10 aiming. At 10 aiming a players fires a handgun like it's an uzi and each shot had about a 25% chance of killing instantly with a headshot. This means you will likely kill a player armed with a shotgun before they out more than 2 lodged bullets in you and if you creep up on them will likely kill them before they shoot you at all. But with a shotgun I'm not kidding here someone crept up on me and fired 6 shotgun shells point blank into my back and I still had time to turn around and shoot him twice before I died, causing him to die as well a minute later from blood loss. For pvp to work gunshots would have to be far more instantly deadly to players and the range of the screen would have to be extended or every player encounter results in mutual destruction regardless of the time each player has spent in-gameThat said the community is the best I have ever seen, even on the pvp servers. Everyone is really helpful and friendly and quick to answer any question! There are a few bad apples and thieves but nowhere near to the extent of survival games like Rust and Reign of Kings.Another interesting addition is challenge modes. Really CD DA day has the player start in a burning house, naked, wet (imminent cold that causes sneezing and attracting zombies like gunshots), drunk and with lodged glass shards in their crotch (equivalent to a lodged bullet). What's more the map is winter with sparse resources and maximum numbers of zombies, which I assure you is a lot. The player must escape the burning house, find clothes, sober up, find tweezers, bandages and a needle and thread to remove the glass, stitch the wound and bandage it, all while sneezing to attract the hordes, then find somewhere safe to rest and recover without starving to death or being killed!3 more interesting challenges have just been released, one where the player is in a small town with few zombies but after 1 day zombies appear at the edge of the map in a massive horde and head straight after the player, death isn't a question of if but when! In another map the player has 1 day before a frigid winter begins and before this the player must scavenge resources, and find a warm shelter to survive the winter if they can. In the third one the player is in a mall which is surrounded by thick masses of the dead, and in 3 hours the doors will open!All in all I highly recommend this game. Even for an early access game there are plenty of features, the game is updated frequently, it's very intuitive and easy to get into and the amazing community is great fun to play with!Final verdict: 9/10			",59,10,0,19,6,0,17

								Okay this game is one of the best examples of how a indie-game company should make their games. there are so many reasons why this game is so fun. It Truly captures the feeling how it would be out there if a zombie apacolypse ever broke out. The game doesnt even suggest survival. I't simply asks the question ""how long can you survive?"" This is one of those games that just seem impossible, but as you figure it out and you die and you die, you notice that each time you survive a little longer. you learn from the mistakes you make and the feeling you get from that is really rewarding.As for the game machanics itself, when i was playing it I almost forgot it was still in Early Acces. 10/10			",143,15,3,23,27,1,22

								This game survived (pun intended), grew and prospered despite contunual setbacks and misfortune that The Indie Stone faced throughout the last few years - and I tip my digital hat to them for not abandoning their title when they could. Whether it was sheer bad luck or stupidity on their end, or a combination of both - it doesn't matter, because they still manage to get back on their feet. Every. Time. I've patiently watched this game's development since its early development stage back when it was available exclusively through Desura. It's come a loooong way since then and it's an amazing feat.The game's currently in Alpha stage, so be aware that there WILL be some bugs, but nothing so bad as to be gamebreaking. There's only one goal in the game - to build, fight, scavenge, and thus SURVIVE, for as long as you possibly can. Death is inevitable... It's just being prolonged.The game features dark, eerie and spine-chilling music by young and talented Zach Beever[www.zachbeever.com], there are quite a few new features[pzwiki.net] planned, plus PZ has a very healthy and devoted modding community. Thus, it's pretty safe to assume that this just might be the next ""Minecraft"" hit. We shall wait and see.If you enjoy harsh roguelike survival games of the likes of Don't Starve (another title I very highly recommend), then you'll most likely appreciate what this game has to offer, even in its unfinished state.

								I wrote this review a while back, well over 2 months ago now and we still have no major update. If you go to the PZ forums, hordes of PZ SJW's will attack you for giving criticism toward the devs and game itself, making any criticism fall silent. You legit cannot say anything bad about this game, its ridiculous, especially when its a product people PAY FOR. I've played around 83 hours of this game but after around 20 hours you will most probably get bored due to a lack of content and updates. To put the games development time into perspective: The new animation work was mentioned and was being worked on in late 2014, we still do not have the animations in the game and PZ has remained the same since around this time last year, nothing has changed. The devs release weekly updates but they have become so shallow and pointless that its a joke.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First off let me just say that the screenshots on the store page are old, the graphics have been improved slighlty and thus, the game looks a lot better.I will try and keep this review short.PZ is probably the best zombie survival game there is right now. I can't think of another zombie game that nails the whole ""survival"" and ""zombie apocalypse"" aspect that many zombie games try to do, but ultimatley fail. PZ is fantastic, but.....The world is dead, literally. The only lifeform in this game is you. It's just you against thousands of zombies. Whilst fun at first, dont get me wrong, it gets boring the longer you play. Every playthrough is the same, find supplies, get a decent weapon, build a safehouse, find more supplies. And before everyone attacks me ""But it's a survival game, thats what you need to do to survive"" I understand, but please hear me out.I, along with 99% of other players want this world to feel more alive, or was once alive. There are no driveable vehicles not even destroyed vehicles litter the barren streets. There are no NPC's, no notes or old radio broadcasts, no overrun safehouses that have been built by previous survivors, nothing. This, to me anyway, makes it feel like this world has always been infested with the undead and that no one has ever lived here, its boring. Dead.I want to be able to do some sort of quests and trade with other survivors or recruit survivors so we can rebuild.The devs have promised NPC's to arrive at an unconfirmed date using their ever so popular catchphrase of ""soon"" but they have been promising NPC's for over a year now, just like they have done with the new animations, which were promised over a year ago but are STILL in development and the team are ""ironing out bugs"" in the new animation system every ♥♥♥♥ing week.Who knows where the damn vehicles are, thankfully there is a mod that adds vehicles in the workshop though, but it's not perfect.Indie Stone, we want NPC's, new animations, new clothes for our characters and the ability to see the damn backpack we have equipped, we want other modes of transport apart from walking. Stop jerking yourselves off every week and add the stuff us players ACTUALLY WANT.TL;DR, buy this game WHEN NPC's have been added.			",66,6,0,8,17,0,18

								I've owned the game for a few years now and haven't played it much.  I bought the game when they had NPCs.  Then they removed NPCs and decided to work on things to make it more ""realistic.""  I feel as that the developers can't see the forest through the trees anymore.  People have been clamoring for NPC's and the devs continue  to work on other things which the majority of users don't care about.  Now they're looking at ""caloric intake"" as a factor to consider during the zombie apocalypse.  Is it a good idea.  Yes.  But is it more important than what the majority of users want?  No.  The devs were so focused on having a realistic ""radio"" system.  They spent months working on radio broadcasts.  Then they spend months working on radios for the player in multiplayer.  They have to create walkie talkies. It's it a good idea. Yes.  Should it take priority over what the majority of users want (NPCs).  No. The fanbase wanted cars.  Developers don't think it's a priority.  It was ignored.  So modders created cars.   The fan base wanted more firearms.  Developers didn't thin it was a priority.  It was ignored.  So modders created firearms.  I could go on and on about how the developers just ignore what the majority of the fans want.Did I mention there is still no in game map available?  No map of the area since the game was created.  Some guy had to create a map of both play areas so you can have a vague idea of where you are.  You have to alt tab to the map website and figure out where you are.  Oh, it's realistic.  But is it fun?  Nope.  If they wanted to be ""realistic"" they could allow GPS technology with google maps for the first few months of the zombie apocalypse and then have it shut off . . .Also, the zomboid fanbase is rabid.  You say anything against the developers they pounce on you like a bunch of . . . zombies.  I'm sure I'll get a good amount of flame from the zomboid acolytes from my review as it is forbidden to be critical unless you are punished. Other problems - my game is constantly stuck on ""updating workshop content"" in an endless loop.  Uninstalled the game, deleted the folder.  Verified game cache before I did this.  Nothing works.  By the way, the game is super boring without mods.Now on the plus side - The developers give weekly regular updates as to what is happening with the game.  Not actual software updates. They just tell you what they are working on.  They are more active with their fans (i.e. they actually interact with them) more than the developers of the Fun Dumps, Seven Days to Payout game.  And team zomboid releases more updates to the game than those knuckleheads, even though team zomboid has a development team which is only a fraction of the Fun Dumps.  The graphics are decent and proof of concept ideas are great.  Looking forward to seeing them implementing the new running and side strafing system.  The new 3d models will be good. But nothing has happened yet.  Multiplayer is okay fun.  But it's ridiculous trying to find anyone.  No way to find them with the games build in map.  You have to say, ""oh I'm near the quickie mart in muldrah.""  Which one?  The partially burned out one.  I don't know where that is.  Well, good luck survivor.  If you do know where it's you'll have to go on foot because you started on the other map. So, as it is I wouldn't recommend the game in its' present state.  They need to listen to their fans and include the NPCs.  It's been years now  developers.  If you don't care about income then just keep going this route and doing your own thing.  And probably a few things will happen.  You'll close your doors because you can't support development on the game because nobody will buy it.  Or another developer will make a similar game with the features the fans want.			",128,8,4,21,16,2,17

								Not abandonware, but I bought this in early 2014.   3 years later (2017), still in early access, with no sign of completeness in sight.   Keep that in mind when you consider purchasing this.  I enjoyed the game when I played it, but the development process seems to be suffering a lack of direction and a solid plan.  I would recommend buying a more complete title and waiting for signs that the project will finish or at least reach a solid state.			",120,36,0,51,28,2,44

								tl;dr - The devs said that they would add lots of stuff, but we never got it. After a while, the community made a few of those features as mods. Don't get me wrong, I love(d) playing this game. It's very realistic and fun to play. In short, it's a 2D DayZ. But that's not what I want to talk about right now. Project Zombiod has been in development hell for several years. Back in 2014 or 15' (and maybe even late 2013), the developers said stuff about NPCs, a map editor, moving furniture, and vehicles, just to name some. It's 2017 now, and the Steam community are doing a better job at updating the game then the devs. Over the past few years, people made vehicles, NPCs, and movable furniture mods after months and months of absolutely nothing. The COMMUNITY should be getting the credit. Project Zombiod is a textbook example of what can become of Steam Early Access games. In conclusion, I like this game a lot. But it feels as if the devs have been lying to us. I find it really disappointing that the community of people who love this game contribute more to PZ than the developers. If you don't care about the promised features, then try the demo. Buyer beware.			",93,15,3,10,18,0,2

								Yes, this is the hardest zombie survival game out there. No, there is no winning. You only win when you die. Were you expecting a ""and he/she lived happily ever after""?No, there isn't a vaccine or magic potion to heal a zombie bite. You ♥♥♥♥ed up, live with the consequences. Do you want your mama to kiss your boo boo as well?Yeah, loud noises DO attract the zombies. If you fire a gun, prepare to fire at the entire towns population, because they heard it, and are coming for you.Oh yes, electricity and water works for now... but if you somehow manage to miraculously survive after 2 months without becoming a human happy meal, that is all shut down now. You better have stockpiled on water. If you haven't, well... let's hope it rains?Do you have windows in your home? Ahhhhhh, isn't the view great?No. It ♥♥♥♥ing isn't. cover that♥♥♥♥♥♥up with sheets, unless you want corpses eating your corpse.Like I was saying, you don't get a second chance. Sure, the dead are definitely pretty dumb. The only problem is that there are a lot of them. How many zombies would it take to take over your base?10?50?100?1,000?I gues we'll see.

								I love Project Zomboid, it is my favourite zombie survival game so far on the market.I've played it both in single and multiplayer, more so in multiplayer.Troughout playing I've encountered little bugs, and one huge one that is game breaking and makes me feel I cannot play this game anymore until devs take it seriously.It's about the server creation and access. Lately I cannot even create a server for MP.Or if I try to access the one I've played on for 50+ hours and developed immensely, it keeps saying my files do not match those of the server (note that I AM the server, and nothing has changed on my PC since the day before when I've played PZ, and poof in the morning after I cannot access it anymore!).This made me abandon a lot of my servers and huge progresses I've made, and made me really unsatisfied with this game and it's developers.This game has a lot of potential and a faithful crowd of followers that keep giving it zillion chances over and over again just to be dissapointed time and time again.

								This is zombie survival, but it couldn't be more different from the other games on the market in the same genre! For starters, its top down view, not first person. This doesn't take anything away from the experience though! I've been made to jump a couple of times from walking into a room that I didn't know had a zombie inside!What I love most about PZ, is that it's truly a survival game, even without the zombies. Society has crashed which means you have to scavenge to survive, searching through houses, caravans, schools, apartments etc. to find food, water and supplies. But it's not just hunger you have to contend with, your character can get bored, stressed, scared, angry, even too hot or cold depending on the conditions.For those who survive the first days, you can craft items like walls and doors, even grow plants!Multiplayer is in the game but in my personal experience it needs work. Every server I found was picked clean of everything, all the zombies were dead and the lag often made it unplayable.The graphics aren't anything special, but they grow on you more and more over time. The devs have used lighting as a great way to make you feel uneasy, walking the streets at night can be a death trap when you can barely see whats around you! ",105,22,0,12,10,1,8

								The HUD and inventory system, more specifically transferring contents of containers and backpacks to be useable is very clunky and unorganized.The rest of the game is pretty cool yet this one thing really makes it a painful experience and not even in a challenging way.When your only way of interfacing and interacting with the game is this disorganized and user unfriendly it makes the whole experience a negative.Despite my appreciation for how this game tries to have a more original and challenging take on the zombie genre I simply could not and would not reccomend it to someone with only two human hands given this glaring issue.Were this issue not the case however, I would most definitely hop back onto the game and consider a 180 degree spin on this review, but as it stands any time I tried playing I ended up stopping, not because I died, but because the inventory system, hud, and bag system made me want to drink bleach.

								Fans of serious zombie survival games that is mainly focused on slow, shambling corpses and barricading/defending style of gameplay have to check this game out. It has collected all of the great things that I've been wishing to see in a zombie game, but never found executed in the correct way.Even in Early Access state, developers have pushed themselves to make it as stable as possible, so anyone who buys into it wouldn't feel like beta testers but actual consumers. There is nothing you can hate in Indie Stone. The Passion these developers have about their game is enormous. At it's stage the game already has a huge list of languages you can play with, completely translated by the community.Mod tools, Last Stand, Sandbox, Survival, Story - Combine all of that, and you'd get carried away for longer than you might expect. If you love zombies and survival elements - you MUST purchase this game. ________________________________Очень давно ждал игру, которая по настоящему передавала атмосферу выживания в зомби апокалипсисе. DayZ подошел очень близко моим ожиданиям, но быстро был перехвачен людьми, которые убивали без всякого повода. Наткнулся на Project Zomboid несколько лет назад, и сразу влюбился в команду разработчиков. Они, как оказалось, на равне со мной рады выпустить игру как эта. Не смотря на то, что игра в Early Access, разработчики вложили все свои силы чтобы сделать игру незабываемой, и чтобы баги отвлекали насколько можно меньше от игрового процесса. Естественно - баги будут присутствовать, но по сравнению с остальными играми про зомби что я здесь видел (иногда даже полностью выпущенные, как WarZ) Zomboid стабильнее, чем вы ожидаете. Они даже умудрились внедрить целый лист языков, на котором вы сможете играть в эту игру, полностью переведено их комьюнити. Я вложил свои силы чтобы перевести игру на русский. Буду и дальше работать, надеюсь старания не пропадут даром)Поддержка модов, Последний Рубеж (Битва), Песочница, Выживание, Истории - все это вы сможете увидеть в будущем, и если вы огромный фанат серьезных игр про зомби - вы просто ДОЛЖНЫ приобрести эту игру.

								This game is brutal. I returned after a long period of not playing and am very satisfied with the changes that are currently in the beta build. The addition of more occupations for your character + perks/debuffs make for some very interesting character builds.With almost no hand holding, you're plonked into a random house in the middle of a map that you'll have no idea how to navigate. With nothing but the clothes on your back and food in your fridge ""plus anything else you're lucky to find"" You set off on your adventure! Looting shops, houses, warehouses, farms, petrol stations all in the hopes you'll find a little more loot to help you survive that extra day.All the while you're battling the hordes of the undead. The sandbox mod allows you to tweak the nasty biters any way you like. Want old school zombies? Sure! Want to try and survive in a scenario like 28 days later? Go for it! ""although not recommended"" You'll fight with whatever you can find. Kitchen knives, bats, axes, planks of wood. There are also firearms, but remember! the zombies react to sounds and a gunshot will likely make all your problems worse. Hordes of zombies migrate at random events that happen in game so don't ever think that large group won't think twice about seeing what tasty morsel hides in your home when a chopper goes overhead.Along with the copious amounts of brains you'll be ejecting from skulls you will also have to contend with the isolation that is the zombie apocalypse. You'll be holed up in a house for days on end, fortifying, all whilst your character becomes bored, lonely and depressed at the thought they're the only one left.If I could give a few tips to anyone new playing, It'd be invest in the future. Read the books and learn how to farm, fish and build. The power shuts off and any fresh food will go mouldy. The water will go and you will have to find other ways to sustain your thirst. So spend time learning how you're going to extend your life without the comforts we all take for granted.Good luck! You're going to need it.			",264,47,5,49,34,3,46

								Project Zomboid is a survival game first, and a zombie game second. Surviving requires resource management and good decision making. Food and water are both important, and within the first month the water supply is cut off and power is gone. One day is an hour of play on default settings for reference. Water sources such as sinks will still hold a bit of water after the water supply is gone, but for the most part it's up to the player to provide for themselves at this point. Most food expires, and this requires planning of when to eat what. There are many interesting mechanics that make surviving fun, such as the ability to freeze foods so they last longer, or growing crops and canning them in summer so they can be used in winter.Yet, there is still plenty of fun to be had in this game by rushing hordes of zombies while trying to loot a warehouse with powerful weapons and rare construction materials early on. There is a perk system in place that requires players to give themselves negative traits in order to obtain positive ones. This allows for a variety of playstyles. You can create a loud character that has poor senses and is more likely to be seen by zombies, but is incredibly strong and can tackle large amounts of them at once, or create a weaker character that can sneak around easily and survive in the shadows. The immense character options are coupled with the fact that there is a sandbox mode with a healthy amount of options.Want more zombies? Set the population to very high and watch as they overwhelm you even on the outskirts of town. Don't like how zombies tend to spawn within urban centers? Make them spawn uniformly and you'll find random ones lurking in the woods. The settings also include whether or not to begin with basic supplies, how long it has been since the outbreak began, and how long it will take for the power and water to shut off. There are many more and I encourage anyone who enjoys survival games to pick this one up for themselves and take a look.All of that being said, it is important to note that Project Zomboid is still in early access. There are some bugs around, and in my opinion the interface is still relatively clunky to use. The game takes some getting used to, but has a big payoff in the long run. The developers have improved the interface in recent builds, and have weekly ""Mondoids"" where they keep the community up to date on what's what. Development on the game can feel pretty slow at times, we've been periodically promised NPCs that are fellow survivors for several years but they are still not implemented, for example. If you can handle all of this, then by all means I recommend picking up this game, it's worth the price and more.			",88,11,0,22,14,1,16

								I used to dream about a zombie survival game that was based on the rules of the world we live and breath in. A game where ransacking houses felt real and natural, where locating fresh water was as important as bashing zombie heads, where finding an axe was cause for celebration, and where facing zombies was something that was scary, and never stopped being scary. A game that trusted you to be smart enough to stockpile food to avoid starving to death, and that had the balls to make getting bitten by a zombie something that actually followed well known zombie lore. (IE; you're going to turn into a zombie. No, there is not some magical cure, you're going to die. May I suggest avoid getting bitten by zombies in the first place. What's that you say? That makes the game tense and unpredicatble, because dying means you lose all your character XP? Indeed. Now you're getting it. Surviving a zombie apocolypse in the real world would be tense and unpredictable....)I always knew this imaginary zombie survival game of my dreams would be independently produced. Why? Because AAA game developers are so terrified the average modern gamer will get distracted by something shiny, their version of the game would grant you a ""fish from heaven"" magical spell, simply to balance out the requirment of finding food and having to satisfy a hunger stat. Or they would simply make the hunger stat regenrate if you sat in a corner for a few seconds, making one wonder why its there in the first place...For those not keeping up, (I'm looking at you mainstream console gamer for whom the regenrating hunger stat was created), Project Zomboid is that zombie survival game of my dreams. At least as close as one can possibly get. I absolutely love the fact that the game more or less simulates how well I think I would do in a real zombie apocolypse. That is to say, I one hudnred percent believe I'd die backed into a corner, flailing about with a hammer in a mad panic, and eventually getting too fatigued to fend off the hordes and landing up a zombie snack. (No, you would not chainsaw them into bits and flick-flack out the window into the arms of a hottie with enormous breasts, mainstream console gamer, and no, I don't care how much you try and convince me otherwise. Get a job.) In conclusion; yes I recommend Project Zomboid. And as a final thought; you have not known desperation until you've tried to stab a zombie to death with a spoon, simply for complete lack of other options. Another reason I love this game. I commend the developers, and deeply hope this game sees much success. I'm eager to see how it progresses.			",66,8,0,6,6,0,4

								After a horrendous and frightening experience of an overnight zombie raid, my house was in ruins. All food was consumed, crops destroyed, ammo non existent. My weapons damaged, my body aching, my mind lost. I was wounded and in desperate need of medical attention. After rummaging through piles of bodies, I managed to find a dirty bandage. ""I can't use this..."" I said to myself, and after long contemplation and painful thinking I decided against it. ""If I can clean it, I can use it"" I dragged my broken body across half of town, exploring every inch of land in order to find cleaning materials. My last sip of water felt like days ago. I came across a shanty area,  a settlement of plywood, corrugated metal, sheets of plastic, and cardboard boxes. Wildly scavenging through heaps of sh#t, yes! A half empty bottle of bleach.I moved my way to a quiet and not known location, where I was able to sit and gather my breath. Frantically scouting to make sure I was ok, still sat down. I looked up into the sky and dreamed of what life used to be. ""I need this bandage cleaned"", opening up my bag to take out both the bandage and the bleach. ""There is no threat here, take your time"" I wish I had a mouse! I must of double tapped my track pad. With the bandage in my left hand, and the open bottle of bleach in my right, the double tap of the trackpad forced me to consume the bleach. Every last drop.Stories were told of my valiant display of british grit, fighting off the barrage of zombies and ultimately falling to my death through a 16 hour massacre. At least, thats what the stories told. If only they knew the truth of my stupidity. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A thoroughly enjoyable isometric survival game, set in a zombie apocalypse. As a player, you'll need to hunt for supplies and weapons, to last as long as you can without reprieve.Shops can be broken into and looted, but watch out for burglar alarms.Travel between two towns, visiting interesting locations in the wilderness.Cut down trees for lumber, to build new walls, tools and furniture. Make your own home in the wilds!Walls can be smashed down with sledgehammers.Grow your own crops, or loot what you need from the abandoned stores.Cook food, but don't leave the oven on by mistake!Water supply and electricity cut out after a few days, so make sure you've built rain barrels for water, and scavenged batteries for your torch.Zombies will follow you, sometimes over long distances. They're not afraid to tear down doors and smash windows to get to you.At the moment, NPCs are not yet in the game, but indications from the developer are that they will come soon, and will behave with intelligence and survival instinct.The developers are releasing plenty of updates, despite some very huge setbacks during the development of the project. A truly wonderful effort!			",659,202,37,91,151,11,117

								I bought this game nearly 2 years ago. There has been absolutely no progress in that that time. And since the demo back in 2011, and the Early Access release back in 2013 (YES YOU READ THAT CORRECTLY! EARLY ACCESS SINCE 2013!). They've actually removed content. They continually talk about adding animations and such, but for more than one calendar year there has not been any sort of substantial update. Look at the stable logs if you don't believe me. This game has a few hours of entertainment, and then it's done. And the developer has not shown themselves to be capable of producing a finished game. Don't buy it yet. Make them earn the money. Let's stop falling for this garbage siren song and giving up our money for sugar coated hot garbage that never gets finished.			",33,5,0,11,12,0,4

								How will you die?Mostly of lag spikes or hilarious bugs. Have you ever tried to run away from an invincible zombie during a lag spike of more than 1,600 ms? Have you ever entered an empty street just to realize that hundreds of zombies will suddenly appear out of nowhere due to the horrendous performance of this game? Have you ever played on a dead server, the only survivor out there? At some point, you'll start to wonder what will happen when you walk into a burning fire or how many storeys you have to jump down to drop dead immediately. If you're really lucky, you'll meet some hacker who insta-kills you. This is how you will die.This game can be great fun, but it's badly optimized. The offline sandbox campaign is boring as hell due to the fact that more than five years after the game went early access there are still no NPCs to interact with. There were NPCs in the beginning, but the developers decided to remove them until they'd come up with a better AI. Damn, that was years ago, and since then your character is the only survivor out there. You will die of boredom - this is how you will die. Some years ago the developers still had the myth of their stolen laptops which they referred to whenever someone pointed at these shortcoming, but now, years after this event, they should have come up with something substantial. Nope! They've come up with useless radios and nutritional information. That's all. Prepare yourself for some serious ""I am Legend"" one-man-show. How can someone really expect to publish a game without any NPCs and score a hit?What to say about the graphics? They do their job, but they haven't aged very well, given that the game is by all standards pretty old by now. But I can live with that. Funny thing is that someone compared the game's graphics to those of ""Ultima Online"". Well, just think a moment about that.To be honest, the most annoying bugs, such as the invincible zombies, have been dealt with. I've played on several servers, and I haven't met a single one of them, so there are at least some signs that the developers still work on that title. There's also improvement when it comes to hosting games. However, apart from the ongoing changelog that tells us about myriads of tiny changes, there has hardly changed anything over the last years and I've the feeling that there are more negative than positiv things to say about the game.THE ONLINE GAME AKA PLAYING ON DEAD, BUG-RIDDEN SERVERSWhat to say about the online experience? It can be great fun, but have I told you about the extreme lag spikes, the black borders that prevent you from enterring new areas, the constant server problems caused by this game being a total mess? The moment the virtual zombies begin to travel to another zone is sometimes enough to kill a server. One moment you hear a helicopter, see the zombies crawl through town, the next the server is gone forever. I've seen this happen more than once. Optimization is the key, and the developers haven't found it yet. However, despite all these problems, the game can be great fun. But you've to be prepared to face a messy, constantly crashing game and servers that experience severe problems due to bad programming and conflicts.Once I got involved in setting up a public server for the game, and it took us quite some time to get around the worst issues caused by the game, not the server. One of the main problems is the handling of virtual zombies. Most admins haven't even heard of that - at least that was the case when I still played on public servers. It's just a huge mess. In most cases, you probably encounter servers with such extremely noobish server settings that it's definitely no fun playing on them. Have you ever tried playing on a server with no respawn that has been running for more than a year? Try to forage a stone and a piece of wood to craft a spear or an axe that will last for three or four hits before it gets useless. Have you seen those burned down towns on maps that haven't turned off spreading fire? Have you ever tried to reach Giga Mart, the hardware store or the weapon shop in Westpoint just to see that someone had claimed them for a safehouse or built in or round them,which prevents the containers from respawning? Then just say goodbye to the most important places because they're gone forever.Let's face the sad truth. There won't be any NPCs in this game. This game will never run stable. The few servers that are still alive will continue to face severe problems. The only thing that is certain are the lag spikes, the bugs, an entire list of empty servers, and the myriad tiny problems that will finally drive you off.MY RECENT GAMING EXPERIENCEAfter almost a year of absence I gave this game another chance. After all, it can be great fun, as I said. Admittedly, most servers are dead by now. I decided to play on a server called ""Logens World"", simply because I liked the harsh server settings. I had a great time playing alone on this one. There were hardly any other players, so I could concentrate on PvE. With me mostly playing alone, the ping was usually around 54, with only occasional short lags during extensive zombie movements. I met another guy from Switzerland, and we teamed up for some time. In seven hours of gaming we met only one other player on this server, a Korean who was online for approximately five minutes before he left again. Two days later, I met two Russians and helped them as far as I could. I settled next to the docks in Westpoint, built a nice three-storey house near the shore, destroyed the stairs with a sledgehammer and placed two sheet ropes to the enter my floating house. I caught fish and started farming on my roof. Life in the zombie apocalypse was beautiful. A few hours later, I met a hacker/griefer who spawned next to me, took a look at the house I'd been building for the last 8 hours, said, ""Nice house"", set it aflame and burned it down using cheats and spawned a series of wooden palisades to block my entrances. Yeah, great move.Well, I decided to start over on my own game server. The guy from Switzerland came over and we played a bit, but then joining our hosted servers didn't work anymore. By now, we all know that the developers just need some time to deal with those problems: in two or three years this issue will be dealt with, and we'll be able to play again on each other's servers. But right now this means playing alone again, and this is so terribly boring, even if you try to give this game a huge chance.DO I RECOMMEND IT?I've played this game quite a lot. Some of it was fun, much of it got more and more boring, much of it was highly frustrating, and some of it was utterly bad. Was it at least quality gaming time? No. A lot of the time was about checking settings, getting rid of problems or finding a way around the more notorious ones. Some time was about checking the new mods: some of them are really interesting, some of them are good, but the majority of them isn't my cup of tea. In addition, a lot of the gaming experience revolves around repetition: you'll end up checking the selfsame houses over and over again. There'll be parts of the maps, such as the Mall or the Shooting Range, that most players won't ever see. If Steam gave me the option of voting UNDECIDED, I would do so. But faced with only the options to recommend it or not, I've to say that I don't recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I bought this game when it first came out, almost exactly three years ago to the day.  While it had its bugs back then, it was a fun game.  Then they added 3d content, and I was amazed at how much better it was.  After that, well, pretty much zero changes.  I'm sure the developers dabble with the code now and then, but overall, don't do much else.  The game updates are few and far between now, and when updates are released, they are very minor.  After three years, this game should have been approaching a finished status.I'd love to see the NPCs that were discussed last year, or two years ago?  I don't even remember now.  In fact, a lot of content was discussed and said to be added soon, but never happened.It's still a fun game to burn a few hours, but if you've played it extensively like myself, it will become repetitive and you won't go back to playing it much.EDIT:  I was just reading that the developers are doing a major overhaul to the game code, which would explain the slow update releases.  If they release a decent update, I will definitely revise my review to reflect that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The devs seem incapable of focusing on one task.A year ago we were promised Creative Mode. Attention then shifted to nutrition systems. A while after that, attention shifted once again to blacksmithing. Then, suddenly attention shifted over to animations. After that, attention shifted to two new maps that nobody asked for.Keep in mind that, with the exception of the two maps, none of those have been added yet as of the time of writing.As of right now, the game itself is lacking. There is virtually no end game. For god knows what reason, the developers added in RNG events that cause hundreds of zombies to swarm to your base to """"fix"""" this issue, meaning that the two winning methods of surviving are A: building a floating base and then quit when you get bored or B: wander around, stay in the shadows, scavenge supplies and then quit when you get bored.I bought this game a year ago. No meaningful additions to the game have been added. Features are promised, highlighted in several Mondoids (the developer's weekly development log), and then dropped entirely.			",38,2,1,5,6,0,5

								this is a fun game. I sometimes get stressed out if there's sounds of zombies nearby... worried they'll get me and I won't fight them off fast enough... I love playing this online. I love gathering food and stuff to my shelter. I sledgehammered the stairs away and use a sheet rope to get up and down. That way it's safe from Zombies. I love this game. I had played it about a year ago and then I got hooked on another game but came back to it recently and it's just as addictive. I love that you can build stuff and increase your skills like carpentry or cooking or whatever. Just an over all great game and playing online is great. There are a lot of nice people to play with (and as always some, not so nice) But over all my online gaming on this game has been overwhelmingly positive. If you have not tried this game, it has a demo so you can check it out.Since my initial review above, I've built part of one base and then build a completely separate base basically by myself. I figured out my new favorite part of this game is building bases. I'm having a blast! By the way if you just start this game, you might want to know you can usually outrun the zombies. (at least on Terminus server). Also the makers of the game are constantly improving  it and there are wonderful Mods for this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								People always want to know 1) should I buy this game?  and 2) will I like it?1) Yes.2) Yes.A few things to know before you do though.1) This game is DIFFICULT - some would call it HARDCORE. The reason is that your life is very fragile and everything you're up against isn't. It's like a watermelon against a sledgehammer. Surviving in this game is like real life - one screw up and it's over.2) Whatever 'skill' you choose know that no matter how proficient you get at it - if you level it from skill level 2 up to skill level 7 and you get bit. You can kiss all that progress goodbye.3) When you die, you're dead. It literally makes you start a brand new character so don't get too attached.4) You will die... like a lot5) First several times you play you'll know very little and feel like it. Its easy to get frusturated but stick with it. If you're one to easily give up this game is not for you.6) Multiplayer can be super fun if you can have your own server like we do7) Single player is a totally unique experience to multiplayer but man does it feel good to survive alone building your own shelter and growing your ownfood/catching your own food. It's so satisfying because you know you're on your A game if you make it.Pros-----------------+ Excellent survival engine+ Zombie AI is very impressive but not perfect+ Zombies are kind of creepy but need a few more styles+ Wide array of items+ Excellent character creation (traits mostly)+ Feeling of hopelessness, stress, heart thumping action+ Realistic feeling town and just the right dab of guns/weapons/food/etc.+ Base building is very good and on a grid system - masterful+ Multiplayer with a server is amazing+ Singleplayer very fun and challengingCons--------- Could use NPC's and vehicles because damn some of these trips are LONG- Sometimes zombie AI is TOO good like how do they always know to knock on the doors and not the walls?- Trapping is kind of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥(Ive had minimal success)- Cooking and farming can be kind of tedious but very helpful- Should have a server save state option so we dont get corrupted files from things like a power outage- Items sometimes vanish into the void (mostly when harvesting crops which is SUPER annoying)- Sometimes you get a cheap death like I one time looked in a window and didn't see any zomie so I hopped in and was instantly bitten as the animation to land inside was still going - wtf- When you forage it doesnt show on the screen what you picked up (if anything) can we at least get a quick little pop up that fades away after 2 seconds?Overall this game is excellent and I was pleasantly suprised how good it actually is. I didn't even realize it's in EA it's that polished and good. Impressive. Good work devs! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What I liked:  The most hard, fun survival game I've ever seen so far  The virtual fear and threat of a horde of zombies  Has a great modding community  The scarity and realistic placement of loot  The fact that this game could stop support now and I would still love the game ( It's feature complete to me, everything else is extra)  The health and inventory system  The immersion this game gives me  An great isometric open world survival with style( when the trend is poor art style and lighting and first person)  I didn't expect me to love this game as much as I did ( love that feeling)What You Need to Know:  Don't let the isometric and pixel graphics fool you, (this game is great, hard, tense and fun)  I've been looking for a complete survival game since DayZ started the trend  I didn't like Don't Starve , or any other survival game up till this game  This game is brutal, you will die, from sickness, broken bones, infection. (You get bit, you are infected)  You have stats which you level up skyrim style ( you can't be good at everything in this game)  You lose your stats and items when you die ( find or kill your dead body to loot the items back)  Geting a server setup is hard and so I can never get a game going with friends ( makes them never wanna play the game)  The fact that this game doesn't promise everything, or is buggy, broken or a clone of every other open world survival game   I play this game mostly solo, can't convince friends to play this game  Crafting is very basic so far, and going to other cities takes a long time  No ingame map, ( you won't know where you are until you learn your surroundings)  I hate the whole trend of early access ( I could write an essay on this topic)  Only other early access game I feel it good right now is Prison Architect ( again it is feature complete to me)  Most early access game suck, but the promise of a great game is what people look forward too ( just look at all the upset people when a dev stops supporting the game)My Score:A++Paid: $15 None of my friends play this game :( Games similar:   Don't Starve ",224,25,1,13,29,1,28

								I've owned this game for close to three years now.  I've kept up with mondoid updates with baited breath.  I'm always disappointed.  Things that could easily be added post release and are in no way, shape or form a priority for the fans are the ONLY thing they seem to work on.  Meanwhile, something that has been begged for (and promised) since the very beginning is still nowhere in sight.  I still love the base game, but at this point I'd recommend staying clear until the devs actually decide to do some REAL work on it...  Rather than adding calories to potatoe chips.

								Devs will never end this game's early access. They are milking it to the maximum. Update few minor changes, milk profit for a while as it becomes on the top of the ""recently updated"" steam front page. Then when player base decrease and sales number goes down, they update another very minor change, often from community mod, to repeat their process. By the way, the way they post the changes, it's ridiculous. Other game devs will literally laugh at them how the Indiestone devs try to stretch simple patchnote into freaking 5 page essay.Game has a lot of good potential, but no ETA policy and ""Indie Project takes long time"" excuse they use for 4 YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT TIME makes me question the morality of the devs. Stay away. At least until they finish it. It's probably going to take about same time as Duke Nukem Forever dev time. Difference is, this devs are milking the game to the max while DNF bankrupted 3D Realm.

Early Access Review
								[Note: Believe it or not. My hours played are much higher and I'd say are in high hundreds if not above a thousand as I have played the game mostly off steam]Review Build - Build 33I recommend this game but I will start my review with the cons and not the pros.Cons:- InDev for at least 5 years as of writing this review.I suspect a mayor feature creep being the problem, having read all ""Mondoids"" (Developer Updates) I've seen some features make it in without being mentioned before while the ones that are promised ""soon"" are constantly being delayed. While the explanation is always given I can't help but say that The Developer team has a policy of not promising anything with a release date that they failed to keep that on numerous occasions.Pros:- No DRMA huge pro for me as I hate DRM in all of it's forms, steamworks and having to keep steam client on included, you can play the game without steam client if you so wish. (I bought it before InDev Launched on GOG)- Single Player Zombie SurvivalAnother huge one for me as I'm a very single player oriented gamer. Probably the only zombie survival game in which Single Player is actually enjoyable. Why that is, later. There is multiplayer of course but I can't say much about it as I didn't play it.- ModdingThe game is extremely modable with plenty of great mods that expand the game available already. A huge pro from a gamer like me who likes to mod and play with other mods.- Sandbox ModeI will say, I am not a fan of preset difficulty modes, the game allows you to customize just about all aspects of your game in it's Sandbox mode, zombie lore included (How the infection spreads, zombie intelligence and whether or not they can run is up to you)- Survival ItselfI believe that over the past few builds the game has really became a heaven for those who enjoy survival. All of the options are valid. You can do risky loot runs and live off canned dog food, have a farm, set up traps for small animals or forage for mushrooms and berries. Believe me when I say it, no matter what you like, you'll get it, whether you're an action oriented gamer who likes to bash Z brains in like me or one who prefers to keep in the shadows. Mechanics are there and they work.- GraphicsA game from an isometric perspective that mixes 2D and 3D. It looks a tad worse than Fallout Tactics to be honest (I love that game) but I have found it's style to be the perfect thing for someone like me. I admit that this is very subjective though. If you like isometric graphics games like Fallout 1,2 or Tactics, you'll like this, if you expect CryEngine type of stuff and can't live without it, consider this a BIG con as I know that not liking graphics can seriously kill the enjoyment.- Audio/SoundtrackPZ has recently integrated the FMOD system, the sound quality is good, you can tell where they are coming from and there is plenty of ambient sounds to make the world feel alive. The soundtrack is a masterpiece of zombie genre, I want to buy it now, the guy who composed it really knows his stuff and I believe he designed some of the best music you will hear in a zombie game. Different music will play in-game depending on what is currently happening and it works very well.- CommunityNever saw a better one to be honest and that is all I'll say.- Active DevelopersThe developers provide the community with regular updates* (*read cons) they frequently reply to criticism with well founded arguments and are, in general, very helpful to the community whenether we have any questions.All In All. I truly recommend this game to all fans of Zombie Survival Genre. ESPECIALLY if you're sick of all the FPS/TPS zombie games. This is something fresh for you despite being older than DayZ itself. It is a game crafted by people who wanted a Zombie game before Zombie games were a thing and it shows.Note: Everything I mentioned in this review is In the game as of Build 33. I might update it if something big changes and I will update it after release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								6 survivors. We built a safe house....no, a safe base near the river in West Point. 3 months of scavenging, killing zombies, farming, fishing, building....it was all very impressive. 24 pistols and 1 shotgun with endless stashed up ammo. All the melee weapons you could want. Raided a pharmacy. We would never need to worry about infections from scratches, or shards of glass stuck in our limbs. The river supplied us with fish galore, the farms with fresh veggies and fruits. Chef Gordon Ramsey cooked great meals.One 4 story tower with a fully loaded bar, a loft and 3rd story fire pit made by carpenter Jesus Christ. It was glorious.Then one slip up. One tiny mistake. Chef Gordon Ramsey causes a small fire in the driveway. Burns down one section of our wall. Jesus is blamed by all for his poor planning. He doesnt take it well. Most of us go on a run. Normal every day sorta run. Jesus stays behind. We get back to find camp fires burning in every bedroom in the house. Jesus laughs. Jesus runs out, on fire, at Chef Gordon Ramsey, whom he blames for the fire and sets him aflame through contact. Chef dies.Jesus runs at me screaming, Detective Harry D'Amour (lvl 5 farming), but I blow off Jesus' head with a shotgun. The base is a total loss. Walls gone. EVERYTHING. Gone. 10/10			",38,7,0,16,8,0,16

Dont buy from a developer that is too afraid to face the truth and banns people for pointng that truth out.Hate to jump on the thumbs down bandwagon for this game. It was released into early acess over three years ago now and like EVERY other review says, little to no work has been done on it. Just seems some random dude always spamming ""happy mondoid"" like the same regurgitated posts weekly makes up for glacial development on a sub par title. Dont buy this game untill it is finished.

Early Access Review
								FIRST and perhaps MOST important, TIS is a diamond in the rough and their game is truly a shining example of how early access development should be done. since introducing their project to the steam community they have been extremely productive and informative, posting a weekly devblog to the news feed and offering a public unstable branch that actually shows the progress of said devblogs. just go look for yourself.this is an excellent zombie-survival game with a gritty, nostolgic feel to it. this isnt a heroic blockbuster where you wade through waves of starved zed, gleefully caving in skulls and emptying full mags of ammunition. death itself has an even more insatiable appetite than the undead and you will spend the beginning hours of every playthrough desperately clawing yourself away from its hungry jaws. even when you have become wise to the wasteland it will still easily find ways to commission you into the hordes. several large towns with fully exporable, fully lootable buildings spread out across a (still growing)country-side stuffed to the brim with true-to-the-name, proper zombies will keep you in an inevitably ending struggle to see another day. every element of gameplay is creative, original and skillfully implemented. the inventory is governed by a weight system sprinkled with various containers for your items. zombies are lovingly coded and realized and are a constant danger whether alone in a public restroom or in a ravenous horde in the urban streets or forest. a ""meta-game"" system ensures they dont simply congregate in one area, instead following en-masse random sounds that keep the population shambling all ends of the map. as usual with survival games, essentials such as building, crafting, cooking and hunting/fishing are skills that can be mastered by gaining experience. to top it off, all of this can be done with friends with up to four players on one screen via drop-in/out style, as well as LAN and internet play. and yes, those up to four friends can drop-in/out during LAN and internet play.as with any early access project, its still very much in progress. a few key promised features including NPC survivors and a story/campaign have yet to be realized but this small indie studio has shown they can deliver. it has taken them a long time to get PZ to where it is now and it will probably be quite some time before it will be called complete, but i wholeheartedly recommend you buy this game. keep it in your steam pocket. watch it become a classic.this is how you died 10/10			",52,2,0,3,6,0,10

Early Access Review
								[To preface this review, I'd like to start off by saying I've never reviewed a game on Steam nor ever really had the inclination to do so. And I've been playing games on steam (and PC games in general) for a long time. So this game had quite an effect on me for me to write this review in the first place. I should also note that I'm extremely inclined to love anything zombie related, so of course a game like this is going to stand out to me]As much as I absolutely love this game, it isn't for everybody, so I'm going to get the ""bad"" out of the way before my glowing praise, because like most other games it does have it's flaws.THE BAD---------------------------It's still being developed, so it comes with it's own share of bugs and incomplete content. With that being said, none of the bugs that I've run into are really gamebreaking by any means, just minor annoyances or visual stuff. The missing content is also fairly negligable, because it's usually small things. Most of the major content is pretty fleshed out.-A little bit clunky (at first). It will probably feel a little awkward at first, and combat will take a lot of getting used to. But as long as you don't ragequit, and take some time to figure out what works and what doesn't, what used to feel clunky will actually begin to feel fairly smooth.-Lack of a real ""objective"" (other than simply surviving of course, which I suppose in a zombie apocalypse is as good an objective as any. But you know what I mean). As it stands right now, the game is completely sandbox mode, so you have to make your own fun. But the tools provided to you are top notch, so most of the time fun will end up finding you.THE GOOD----------------------   Simply put, this game will make you feel like you're in an episode of the Walking Dead, or playing out your own version of a Romero Movie (you do have the option to customize the zombies' speed and power in sandbox mode). I've been hosting a LAN Hamachi server for my friend and I to play together, and it may possibly be the most fun we've had in any LAN game. The atmosphere is top notch.    This is a game that is filled with incredible moments; say for example, your friend accidently leaving the oven on with salmon cooking inside it and burning down your safehouse, or; huddling in a dark kitchen with only the glow of a lighter to see and sheets covering the windows hoping zombies don't see you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself inside, then the sound of shattering glass and seeing them pour through a window across the room.   The combat is fun and nerve wracking once you get used to the controls, and looting your way through buildings has never been more satisfying. Managing your character's ""moodles"" (think ""The Sims"", little icons that let you know when your character needs something) allows lots of levels of realism, and the unforgiving and brutal combat/medical system makes stealth and zombie avoidance a neccesity; trust me, you do not want to get bitten or scratched. The RPG elements are fairly simple and straightforward, but work well within the game's design. Levelling up your skills is fluid and intuitive.    There's too much to go into, really, you might as well read the wiki page at this point. But let me just say, if you want to play the best Zombie Apocolypse simulator, than look no further than Project Zomboid. ",118,15,0,11,12,0,9

								THESE ARE THE END TIMES. THERE WAS NO HOPE OF SURVIVAL.THIS IS HOW YOU DIED.These are the first words you see before you're thrust into the world of Project Zomboid, so it would only be fair to tell you the story of how I died. I suppose I'm dying as I tell you this? If so, shut up and read. It'd be rude not to.I woke one morning, in the bathroom, and drank from the shower. Not really sure why, I just felt compelled to. I considered slurping some toilet water, but decided against it and left my bathroom. Not sure why I slept in there, either, but I was still alive. So f**k it, doesn't matter.I looked around my kitchen and decided I could no longer stay. Supplies were limited, and my dwindling resources would only get worse. So, after a quick raid of the cabinets, I was on my way. Armed with only pickles and beef jerky, I crept through the wooded plains of Kansas. Oh yeah, it was in Kansas. I'm going to f**king die in Kansas. Hooray.Every so often I would see herds of zombies (zomboids?) shuffling through the woods or on the city streets, and while one or two would attempt to give chase, they were slow shuffling meatbags that I quickly outpaced. I assume they got bored or just ran into trees, but when I arrived at the Country Market convienience store, I stopped to check the path I had taken. No zombies had followed.F**k it. Time to raid the store.There was nothing in the store except a jar of mayonnaise. It was half eaten.As I stared in confusion at the jar, I heard a voice from outside. ""Hey!"" it called, ""Over here!"" it continued. I looked, surprised to see another human. Hey, the text said this was how -I- died, didn't expect I'd have to share my dying spotlight with some other jerk. He climbed through the broken window of the store and cut his hand open on the glass.I laughed at him, and then shouted in surprise as he'd led a zombie directly into the store, shambling through the window after him. We both fled out of a window opposite the entrance it arrived, where I proceeded to cut my hand on escape. Why did karma always screw me? When we had cleared the zombies, we exchanged. . . something akin to pleasantries. He was a lumberjack, though his name isn't important. This is my story, screw you.We decided to stick together, to find tweezers. You wouldn't believe how difficult it was to find tweezers. Instead of tweezers, sick of that word yet?, we found a third person to join our parade of misfortune; Billy Mays.  At least, he kept saying ""BILLY MAYS HERE! WITH..."" before any actual sentence.Good to know the zombie apocalypse happened circa 2008.A short time later, he'd found a home to call our safehouse. It was secluded, mostly free of zombies, and all the windows were boarded; meaning the dead couldn't see in. We'd found our new home. Alas, tragedy struck mere minutes after we settled in.Dexter the Lumberjack wasn't happy. He demanded to know why I would put my food in my bedside cabinet instead of in the fridge. ""It spoils that way!"" he said, ""All this is rotten now!""I munched on a stick of butter while glaring daggers into him. And then I ate a second. He wouldn't stop mouthing off, so while shirtless (oh yeah, Billy Mays had taken his shirt off at some point and was rushing around the town showing off his self-described 'beautiful chest hair') Billy Mays was out. . . I attacked Dexter.Being a lumberjack he was pretty fit, but my sneak attack gave me the upper hand, helping me win the duel in the end. I stood over his dead body, satisfied, as I looted his corpse.I mean this literally. I looted his corpse. I put his body in our fridge, on the top shelf. I didn't want it to rot. He laid right next to my jar of pickles, when I noticed a rotting, dead mouse in his shirt pocket.Waste not, want not, right?I flipped the oven on and tossed the rotting carcass in.  Shirtless Billy Mays returned around this time, and I asked him to get a Leek from the fridge to help with the meal. For some reason he screamed and called me ""disgusting"" as he stormed out of the house. He left the fridge door open.Seriously, what'd I do?The smell of the cooked rat meat was delicious, I can't describe anything like it. By the time I pulled the baking tray out of the oven, I was salivating at the taste. Without hesitation, I bit into the charred fur. And then I took another bite. I ate it all in one sitting; organs, spine, fur and all, though I feel this angered a passerby who happened to barge in, shouting obscenities at me. His name was. . . eh. . . I don't know. I think he was Dexter's brother.We broke out in a fight, where neither of us would give in. This was my land, he'd have to earn it. We both died.Choking and sputtering as I bled out, I wasn't sure if I was laying in my blood or his. Shirtless Billy Mays must have heard the cries of battle, as he returned one final time to ease me in to the next life.""You guys are both f**king idiots.""			",414,51,10,41,14,5,26

								This review is based off of Version 34.28 of Project Zomboid.Project Zomboid is my favorite zombie survival game of all time. No other game combines the tense struggle for survival with immersive zombie mechanics the way Project Zomboid does!Strengths* Crafting is intuitive and useful. * Character creation is extremely deep and flexible, follows a Whitewolf perk/weakness system. Many skills and abilities allow for a great deal of replayability.* Zombies just don’t spawn on top of you like most zombie games. They move around based off of what they hear, see, smell, and they group up in an immersive way that no other game does.* Zombification - Losing is fun! Every time you step outside your safehouse, there is a chance you will die. Making every moment of the game extremely tense and enjoyable.Weaknesses* The inventory and crafting interface can be a bit clunky at times, especially when cooking larger meals.I've been playing Project Zomboid for years now, and it is a game I always come back to. Every additional content patch keeps making this game better and better!

Get it. Stop what you're doing and throw money at it.Project Zomboid ticks all the boxes for a complex but enjoyable apocalypse survival game. Beating up hordes of your reanimated neighbours barely scratches the surface.There's no ending so to speak, which gives it limitless replayability - you dictate the story of how your character dies. You might survive three days or six months, you might starve to death, your safehouse might be demolished by a horde, or you might venture into a cupboard and never return. The game does progressively get harder and admittedly has a fairly steep learning curve, but manages to stay enjoyable throughout. You'll quickly find a balance between hoarding all the items that you find and scavenging too little, or relying too heavily on supplies that won't last forever such as an electricity and water supply.A complex system of emotions (moodles) influenced constantly and in realtime by your immediate environment and character's wellbeing govern all aspects of your survival, like stress, boredom, stamina, pain and panic. Magazines and books are just as essential to your wellbeing as food and water. Moreover even something as mundane as maintaining a proper sleeping pattern during the apocalypse to make sure you aren't caught out after sundown on your journey home, or keeping your character warm or cool during the varying seasons to make sure they don't become ill - should this be the case though, you'll find getting lots of sleep along with a stockpile of food, books and magazines comes in handy while your character stays at home to recover.It's not uncommon to have to abandon safehouses and retreat to a backup location due to gunshots and helicopters attracting too many zombies to deal with, quickly grabbing as many essential supplies as you can in the hope they'll last long enough for you to fortify your backup safehouse on the other side of town. The key skill is being prepared for whatever the game may throw at you.It's all well and good having stockpiles of essentials and a fortified house to live, but in the end all it takes is one bite or scratch to become infected.

								This is a real zombie apocalypse simulation game and you or a admin of a server can make the zombies real slow or fast so you wont have to complain about the zombies being too slow or too fast and they decay over time and there is just sooo much to this game and more is always being added, online can sometimes be a little dull if you cant find loot but i like to play on roleplay servers and its almost like being in the walking dead, and now they added a feature to view a server list and if you can find the right servers it could be a blast with a group and its even fun if you know what your doing if you play alone since loot will be way more common than online so you could build some cool♥♥♥♥♥♥from scratch or off another building and pitch up a tent to sleep and i read the top negetive review and on that reguard you can find everything for constuction you would ever need at warehouses and mccoy logging company and the asylum in bedford which at the state of the game you would have to download, but if you like zombie apocalypse games and maybe even roleplay for online its a great game that doesent  have many flaws the only thing i would add immediately would be to be able to lock your base so people cant just break in or something so your base is protected because online you could get ♥♥♥♥ed over by raiders. which is why i would also reccomend playing single player which i only just recently started playing but i got my 400+ hours off of multiplayer. and if you do get the game there is no map in game but all you have to do is shift tab and either google search project zomboid map or just go to this link http://pzmap.crash-override.net/ West Point is the one to the right and muldraugh is the one to the left Good luck if anyone gets it and wants to play online you can also add me! Ps. this game will eventually have a even bigger huge open world with big servers and cars and npc's and and its going to ba a amazing game. which it already is. the multiplayer just needs a little bti of patching but eventually when this game is complete it will most certainly be the most realistic zombie apocalypse simulator.

								It's a great game, for a while. You really feel the tenseness of going out on scavenging runs, the fear that you'll go to sleep and wake up with someone eating you, the struggle to maintain both mental/emotional needs just as much as the physical ones, and you'll have the♥♥♥♥♥♥scared out of you when you stumble across zombie hordes (Or vice versa). But seriously guys, I bought this game waaaay back since before it was on Steam (Something like 2010? It's also why I have very few hours on Steam), and I remember that the development promises  were the exact same things . Like, NPC's and trading were a big thing, and other than a different inventory management system, nothing notable has changed about the game since then. I really wanted to give this a thumbs up, but I'd not reccommend hopping on this ghost ship.			",20,6,0,5,3,0,4

								I have to agree with the other negative reviews, this game has been early access and unfinished for way too long.  I love the idea behind it, I really love the simplistic graphics, but I've been waiting way longer than what I consider acceptable for a reasonably polished experience. I used to recommend this game to all of my friends.  Now I recommend you pass this up as a new purchase until (or if) it becomes an actual complete game and they live up to any of the promises and features they've been advertising for years now. P.S.  My play time isn't an accurate representation of how much time I've spent in this game.  I think I've bought it twice, once outside of steam long ago where my time wasn't counted here.

								Project Zomboid is an intersting production. You become a lone survivour, in zombie-dominated world. Your duty? Stay alive as long as you can. Sounds simple, but in-game you will see it is not. At the beggining you have to create yourself a survivour. Game offers a few customisation options, such as name, hair, and skin colour - not much, but game is still in early acces. Then you pick a profession, with a few aviable at the moment. Each of them have bonus or two, like fireman has bonus to axe usage, policeman better shooting ect. Then you can get some more traits, but each of them comes with a value, with starting value of 0. So you need to pick some bad traits as unlucky or fat, to get some good ones. When you finally end up on the map, you will find yourself in some building, picked randomly from all around the map (there are 2 maps to choose at the moment). Its a good idea to avoid fighting, as even the smalles scratch can be deadly. The best idea to start? Find yourself a house. It will be your safe place. When you find one big enough, secure it - put sheets in the windows, make sure there are no zombies inside, and then... then you can live there. Then you will need to look for food in other houses - non persistant such as chips and canned soups are a great find, while persistant ones are good at the beggining - because electricity will be turned off after some time. With electricyty you lose fridge, so your pesistant food can be gone anytime. Same with water - water bottles are great thing to store, because water can be turned off anytime. Then - survive. You can't win - even the loading screen shows: This is how you died.While starting a game you can change a lot of things - from amount and strength of zombies to frequency of finding food and weapons. Which means - you can have difficulity as you want - from walk in the park to necessity to fight for barest scrap of progress.As for me, even though it's an early acces game, Project Zomboid can give a lot of entertainment. Finding a first gun, figuring out how to drink and so on can be really satisfying. Although price can seem to be a bit high, its a solid piece of work. ",386,69,10,32,53,2,64

Early Access Review
								DISCLAIMER: Game is in Early Access. I'm sure every single one of my concerns will be addressed in time. This Review was posted June 6th, 2016. This review is based upon a version of the game without user generated content such as mods or maps.I do not regret buying this game at all. I like it for what it is. But I do feel there's a bit too much left to add before I'd really give it a proper recommendation. While my experience is mostly positive, I still need to give it a ""Not Recommended"" for reasons I'll outline below. But I'll also discuss the game's strengths, so please keep reading my unbiased assessment, since maybe you'll walk away with a positive impression. Please be aware that ""not recommended"" does not mean it's bad, I'm just not able to go ""Yes, buy it right now!""For starters, what IS there is good. My concerns stem completely from what isn't there. The maps are decently sized with plenty of danger to avoid (I once got lost in the woods for a whole day since I was desperately trying to avoid a horde that was tailing me) and I really like the fact that Water and Electricity are finite; they are either cut off after a period of time, or begin cut off, depending on your game mode of choice. The controls, while awkward at first (I was playing without a proper mouse for a bit, using my Laptop's little touch pad, which made things like holding Right Click while tapping Left click and still moving the mouse around problematic) are functional, and any complaints I'd have about them (such as wishing there was an option to be able to keep continuously walking in a chosen direction without holding the key down for those awkward hand cramp moments while you have a horde to escape) are merely nitpicks.There's plenty of variety in character creation that add a wildly varying experience every time. There's a wide array of perks and penalties to choose from, on a point-based system. To take more benefits, you need more setbacks, allowing a truly customizeable character. Do you want to be able to carry more, but get hungry faster? Do you want to move more slowly in exchange for making less noise? It's impossible to make a character who's simply ""too good"" since every benefit needs to be balanced out by a drawback, and it just makes every character you play that much more unique.There's also a ton of options in gameplay. Do you use your nails to make a weapon deadlier, or to barricade doors to a safe house? Do you risk sleeping when there's visibly zombies outside, or do you try to thin them out despite being exhausted and suffering reduced awareness? Do you run away from a group of 6 zombies and risk attracting even more, or do you stand and fight, despite the fact that it looks bad for you? Every passing moment is another calculated risk. And that is a good thing.My issues largely come from things that seem like common sense, but are lacking. For example, I had a character lost in the middle of nowhere since he was chased by a horde and got lost. He was suffering from high levels of exertion (can lead to a heart attack, he was no longer able to run at all, can be helped by taking a break at a chair or bed) and exhaustion (again, can be helped by sleeping at a chair or bed.) There was no zombies around at all (I went over 10 RL minutes without encountering one) yet there was no option to rest since there was no chair or bed present. Why can't you just sit down or even sneak in a nap on the grass, for example? My only option was to find my way back into a defensible house somewhere, kill any zombies already inside it, and use their bed. Similarly, my first character met their end due to a small scratch, since I didn't realize small scratches don't clot and require bandages, or else you eventually bleed out. That just seems like something they'll change later.I also doubt I'd have been able to learn much about the game if not for a friend I was able to ask questions. The tutorial, while clever and effective at teaching the absolute basics (and had a sense of humor,) doesn't even tackle the absolute basics of things like barricading windows (I'm almost ashamed it took me so long to figure out) or moving furniture. It's entirely possible (and even probable) that these were features added later after the tutorial was finalized, but it may have still been a good idea to teach the player how to do these things, either via a second, ""Advanced"" tutorial, or even simple tooltips.All in all, Project Zomboid provides the groundwork of a good game. I'm sure it will be great once it is done. I do enjoy it as it is, for what it is. But in it's current state, I can't give it a glowing recommendation. If what I said sounds appealing, then by all means, get it. But be advised that it's not done, and the areas that need work can be a little frustrating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Project Zomboid. This game is about surviving in a zombie apocalypse in rural Kentucky, and you are tasked with doing it alone, or with a friend in the very rare PC local multiplayer. I would mention the online multiplayer, but this game requires fast reactions in order to stay alive, and I can't find a server with a decent ping to ""save my life"" as it were. This game has many realistic elements about it, such as exertion, injury that halts ALL progress, panic as a game mechanic, zombies hearing your footsteps and following noise, sight, and smell, and perhaps my favourite touch of realism, the inability to see all around you at once. You need to rely solely on your senses in order to gauge the number of zombies currently breaking down your door, and surrounding your base, there's no minimap with radar, you just need to run out and hope for the best. Another great element of this game is that it is permadeath, which in case you are a dunce, means that when you die, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. In sandbox (Which I heartily recommend over survival, as you can tweak the settings), after you die, you respawn in another random location in your spawn town, and have to work your isometric♥♥♥♥♥off to get back to your base, and rebuild your skills. One large issue with the game right now (which will in fact be fixed), is that the world is rather lonely. There are currently no other NPC's to hang about with. The biggest flaw of the game is that once you have nailed the perfect farming cycle, got all the guns, and fortified yourself to the point that a nuke couldn't dislodge you, there's nothing left to do! You're done at that point! I mean, if you set the zombies to never respawn, I guess you could clear out all of the zombies in the game, but that accomplishes nothing at the end of the day! Some might say that you could explore the vast map, and look for all the best items, but you don't really need to. If you use the PZ crash map like I did, finding your way around is no longer a challenge! Now I know that I shouldn't have used the map, but I thought it made the game more realistic, I mean, I know my city very well, I know where things are, and even if I didn't I could simply raid a gas station and get a map! So, overall, this game is worth dumping your time into. It's a great zombie survival game, and I personally think that it is underrated. I am still super amped to have vehicles and NPC's but that's not happening for a while.GET THIS GAME!-8.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Firstly, a tl;dr review:Get it, and play it. Your first couple of runs might not feel very fun or make much sense, and you may feel this game is lacking content. But keep playing, and you'll understand what this game is all about. If you're one of those people who can't appreciate a good soundtrack, an immersive experience, and patient gameplay, stick to your H1Z1/CoD.9/10 overall. Brilliant, not overpriced, with active developers, mod support, and there's even local/online multiplayer. Can't go wrong with this. It's just sheer good-ness.Anyway. Onto a REAL review.Project Zomboid is one of the few games that actually makes me feel on edge whilst I'm playing. The game expresses how you ARE going to die, no matter what. And it's true. You WILL die. One scratch from a zombie can get infected, killing you irreversibly. 'Surely that's too powerful', you may be thinking, but no. This game stresses for you to skillfully outmanouver and sneak past zombies instead of killing them just because you can, or for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty 'XP'. Weapons are effective, and zombies are easy to kill, true... but one misclick is all it takes for your life to be over.And you know why it's not even frustrating when you die? Because the game told you that you were going to die. You knew this moment would come. I like to randomly generate a character, and 'live their story' if you like, trying to guide them through this unforgiving world as long as you can.When it comes to crafting, it takes effort to get the knowledge to actually craft things. As it should be. The building systems in other Early Access games are fun, aye, but they don't make much sense. Let's take 7 Days to Die, for example. 7dtd is a brilliant game, don't get me wrong - but Project Zomboid is more fun in terms of IMMERSION and REALISM.And there's one small feature in the game that I really love. In one of the soundtrack songs, there's the sound of a clock ticking in the background. That clock ticking signifies your time left to live before you die. Such a simple feature keeps you on edge, and keeps you as alert as a meerkat as you stroll around with your trusty butter knife.The only gripe I have is that I'd like to see some more/better animations on the player model. The combat system could be a little better too, as I often find myself 'charging' attacks, but I'm not even sure if charging my attacks matters or not most of the time.Regardless of those, this game is brilliance, created by innovative, clever, and active developers. It's fun, engaging, and a wonderful way to pass a few hours by. Mods are awesome with it, too.A must buy for zombie game lovers. 9/10.			",107,15,0,10,17,0,8

								First of all, I also own the DRM-free non-steam version so don't mind the meagre 9h.This game is good, it's one of the rare survival game where you're actually tense when everything is going down the drain.It doesn't take good graphics to feel the desperation of a person with no food left and a broken weapon, who hear the moaning of the dead outside their barricaded windows increasing in quantity and loudness. It doesn't take text-boxes to feel the loneliness of a survivor who hasn't seen any living being for days/weeks/months.Why no thumbs up then?Because it's not enough to get a taste of the most promising meal of the year if the cooks abandon their ingredients on the table never to finish said meal, slowly getting stale somewhere near the turned-off oven.Seriously, with size and frequency between updates makes me wonder if there is more than one intern working on this game, it's basically abandoned or at least one man away from that.This game will never leaver Early Access I'm afraid.So yeah, thumbs down.Keep in mind that I like this game though, it was worth my money and I had plenty of fun, but I simply cannot give a thumbs up in all good faith to unprofessional devs who stop developing an unfinished game because they already got our money.I will modify my review if they ever resurrect themselves and finally start doing they job again of course.

								Project Zomboid, for me, is the indie survival game success story. In a genre crowded by cheap money grabs and abandoned failures, Project Zomboid has come through as one of my all time favourite games. The Dev's post a weekly blog listing updates in progress and other useful info and the modding community is very much alive. This game has an amazing visual style, a beautiful soundtrack and brilliant sounds. All combine to create a fantastic, immersive and downright depressing atmosphere. I'd say it's 100% worth your money, it's challenging yet fun and manages to really make you care for the little guy you've created who is eventually going to die here. Edit: Highly recommend you nominate this for the ""I thought this game was cool before it won an award"" Catagory in the steam awards.			",84,8,0,9,10,0,3

								Great atmosphere and excellent soundtrack.  The feeling of creeping dread (should that be the creeping dead) as you do your best to stay alive is amazing.  The commonplace town setting and ordinariness of the world is surreal when being chased by 100 zombies.  Highly recommended ** Sadly this has turned out to be  yet another 'Perpetual Alpha' game.    I remember 3 years ago thinking how great this game will be when features such as vehicles, a creative/sandbox mode, fellow AI controlled survivors etc are added.  The game is still without any of these features. I've been checking the updates here for the past 2 years and have not seen any compelling new gameplay feature to make me want to play the game again. Instead the developers have spent ages on adding things such as 'better animations' and 'VOIP'.  To Indie Stone (PZ Developers): The animations were good enough  3 years ago.  I don't play PZ for the visuals, I play it for gameplay depth, simulation aspects and atmosphere.   VOIP  just seems to be a quick and easy way to try to reduce the complaints of emptiness/isolation in the game world.   The real way to solve the feeling of emptiness would, of course, be to add multiplayer and/or non-player-characters.So focus on the strengths of your game.  If I want visuals, animations and multiplayer, there are plenty of full 3D zombie games that do this far better than PZ ever will.  However none (very few) of them offer anywhere near the world detail, simulation and atmosphere that PZ does.    Oh, and finally, please take the game out of Early Access.  It's getting embarrassing after 5 years.  Since when does releasing a game mean that development cannot continue? Terraria, for example, shows how happy players are when new features are added for free to a 'released' game., even if they come 2 years later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								This is my first review on Steam, even though I've been a member for 7 years... THAT'S why you should give this game a try. ;-)I'm a fan of builder games and zombies, so when I saw a zombie game where I can build, I had to have it. I wasn't sure I would care as much for the gameplay, but it definitely gets addicting. I spent my first few tries in an easymode sandbox and still managed to die. The graphics actually suit me great, since I'm an old-school gamer and prefer it more simpler than newer games today have. The action is pretty much the same no matter what you do, but the way it goes down differs. You could lose your focus and walk into a bathroom without paying attention and a zombie will lunge at you from behind the door. You could turn a corner and walk right into a herd. You could be bashing a zombie in the head with a shovel and think you're winning, but a zombie out of your line of sight comes up from behind and you're now infected. I once survived for 3 months and had stocked up on everything to outlive a lifespan, and then fell from a roof I was building and died anyways. Why do I keep restarting after such heartbreak? It must be a good game!I am excited for more updates on this game. We definitely could use more to build, more items throughout, and my most requested is different maps to explore. I'd love to not only have more maps to choose from, but maps that edge to another map.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game will not blow your mind with it's graphics or it's awesome multiplayer, that's for sure.HOWEVER...When it comes to survival, Project Zomboid is the BEST you can get. In no other game is survival so meticulous and so well thought out. You've seen hunger and thirst meters before you say? Sleep depravation is nothing new? Sickness? Exposure? Well, you've never seen it done RIGHT until you play Project Zomboid.PZ lets you try to survive in a Zombie Apocalypse and is even so kind as to let you choose the rules for your game. How do you get infected? Do zombies run, shamble or walk? How much do they see or smell? How long will you have power and water? How common is loot? And many other quirks that allow you to play how YOU want to play.The map is HUGE and since the game is so mod friendly, you'll never have to worry about growing tired of it. While now there aren't many other maps out there, there are a few and there will be more. Crafting, professions, day and night, seasons, building... all there to help you survive.Vehicles and NPCs... on the works. Soonish.This is the story of how you bought the best Zombie game ever made.			",59,9,0,13,4,0,8

								It's pretty complicated game, guys. Like some real hardcore zombie survival stuff right here.You get bitten or just scraped the arm, while getting though a broken glass? Well, too bad. You are probably going to bleed to death. Good thing that you can rip your shirt off and make an improvised bandage. Bad thing, though... It's that it's not sterile and you are probably going to get it infected and die anyway. You are used to gun down every zombies you see? Well... Not here. As, weapons are rare and ammo is scarse. So, you'll probably be playing most part of the game with a plank sparkled with some nails most time of the game, peeking zombies one by one and keeping distance... Or dying to a horde, failing to peek zombies one by one. So yeah... You'll be dying. A lot. For all kinds of reasons. From zombie bite, to desperate player, killing you over some pills to get rid of common cold. If you are looking for hardcore zombies survival game, you are looking at one. 8/10.

								[Build 36 commentary, Feb. 9 - 2017]So... It's time to update this review I reckon. Six builds and two years after my first comment on this game, I return to it again. So... What's changed?Well, since my last visit, there's come a few new skillsets, electricity for those interested in making and breaking radio devices, as well as metalworking, which is currently nothing more than a fancier way to build/fortify your base, but opens up a great potential for future updates.There's also been a few traps developed that are meant to kill or distract zombies rather than catch wildlife, mostly bombs. The zombies have also been tampered with so that they don't simply stand idly by wherever they happen to turn; but congregate into small clusters which move around from time to time, which makes running around in the streets more hazardous than before.Some mod support has also been added, for those of you who prefer to improve this game yourselves with more or less realistic additions....I'm not gonna lie, not very much has changed as far as gameplay goes. Respawning zombies means that there's always going to be some manner of threat if you go outside, but in the end... most of the changes seem to only try and hold off on that boredom moodlet affecting both the character and the player.I realise that in my last review, which you can read below if you like, I was being very generous with the developers and praising them like they were the next Notch. I still have a lot of respect for them and their ambitions, but... I'll have to admit that their standing with me isn't quite as high anymore, simply because any significant changes they've made are not great enough to make this game as entertaining as it could and should be. They've introduced a few good changes, like more realistic zombie behavior, but most of it is just too subtle to make a difference in what is essencially the same problem this game has had from the start: Hoarding and waiting.And just to get it out of the way: NPCs are really hyped and would likely make a huge impact on gameplay. But while everyone wants it to happen as quickly as possible, remember this: The only thing worse than no NPCs are broken NPCs. Left for Dead, anyone?But make no mistake! I wouldn't have put in almost 1000 hours (as I'm writing this review) into this game if it was bad. This is a good game, although many will agree with me that it suffers from a dragged out development process filled with a lot of redundancies, and gameplay that can get stale quicker than your unconserved vegetables if you're not playing multiplayer. It's the big problem with any game that focus too much on realism: They forget that they're meant to be games, not outright simulators.With all that said... I still recommend this game. Yes, it's likely not gonna be finished by the next year, and yes it can wear itself out once you know what you're doing. But for all its flaws, there's a lot to see and do in Project Zomboid and there's gonna be even more in the future. So whether you're like me and prefer to play these things on your own, or you wanna play around with friends or even strangers (you masochist) in multiplayer, I think you're gonna find a lot of enjoyment in this.And as always, remember: Don't drink the bleach![Build 30 commentary, Feb. 18 - 2015]Ahh, this game... So many complex feelings, so little time! Well, for starters: This certainly isn't currently a game for everyone.Yes, it's quite playable and the amount of bugs is kept at a minimum, the developers are dedicated and keep in constant touch and the community is quite excellent at snapping up the details as they keep pouring out. So yes, this game IS going to be finished, one way or another. And as far as I'm concerned, it's going to be grand!This game is dedicated to creating realistic gameplay, so you'll have to contend with much more than zombies to survive. There are currently no human NPCs, but just trying to keep yourself alive is a challenge as you have to manage hunger, thirst, disease, fear, various kinds of wounds, (damn you broken glass!) and even boredom if you can get that far.I'm afraid, however, that boredom isn't simply a modlet, it can also affect the player. The main problem with this game is poor pacing.It's quite nerve-tingling, trying to sneak around without being overwhelmed by the undead horde and get bitten, resulting in slow, unavoidable permadeath. You look for tools, supplies and weapons to stay alive and defend yourself. How you do this is up to you, though some strategies are more likely to succeed than others. With some careful scavenging you can even cut down trees to barricade your house, or even build your own if that's more your style. You can grow crops, fish, trap small animals and generally get by well in the apocalypse. You can even learn to build rain catchers. And if everything else fails: Flee to the woods and forage for nuts and berries, sticks and stones. There's always an option for survival, but there's no zombrex...And from what I've heard (and experienced) all of this means that players usually end up barricading themselves, stockpiling a huge amount of resources, set up some water catchers, start a farm and just rest into infinity... or get bored really quickly and go out hunting zombies, get overwhelmed and/or bitten, end of story. So yes, the pacing herein is far from perfect...But the developers are very aware of this flaw, and are working on it with about the same vigour as with their human NPCs. So worry not dear gamers. This game is far from complete, yet it already presents you with a surprisingly engaging survival scenario. And if you're a survivalistic hoarder like myself, then I think you'll understand exactly what makes me hopeful for the future of both this game, and anything else these brilliant developers will create in the future.Also, I don't care how desperate you get: Don't drink that bleach! Just don't do it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								This game is insanely well designed content-wise. Do not let the ""Early Access"" fool you; this game is so immense in features that it actually feels finished.This game is like a storyless Fallout with its intense depth, woo-hooless Sims with its building and crafting, tacticless Jagged Alliance with its coop gameplay, and missionless Syndicate with its art style.What is awesome:- Well, first of all, it gave one of the best Co-Op experiences till now. The glasses breaking, zombies walking in, the sense of pitch black when it's midnight, the desperation to get to safety, the ""omg the glass just broke"" feeling, the ""this door is locked man, we have to find another exit, I lure them into this room and close the door from behind, you find another door"" type of conversations... It's fun.- The content! So much to do. So much to craft. So many things to use as weapons. Every item you find that is lootlable is somehow usable. Every single thing can be used somewhere somehow. There is no ""garbage loot"" (except for a few stuff which don't have functionality attached to them yet, such as some pieces of clothing).- The ""apocalypse"" feel: Yes, they nailed it. You walk into a motel, just to find some doors open, blood everywhere, with two zombies shuffling in the bathroom when you open the door. The hoard of zombies that shuffle around the streets. The hordes filling the room at midnight when accidently a gun goes off.What the game needs:- Currently the only things that I've seen missing are the sprites (backpacks on the back or carried as secondary), unique art for some hand-held items (rolling pin looks like and is handled like a baseball bat), some animations (water drinking animations) and character-related stuff to add variation (more hairstyles) and so forth.- Instead of basic texturized lawns and such, the developers could go for rather more sophisticated ""environment design sprites"" for some locations, which would be static, hand-drawn images for backgrounds. The way it's done in the Fallout games, Wasteland 1-2 and the new Torment game (Tides of Numenera). Sure, mapmaking is dead easy right now probably using an incredibly easy-to-use tool that adds blocks, paints roads, etc., but still...- The game could also benefit more from character creation and customization options. Sure; the trait system is fine, but somewhat lacking in content. There are only 5 pre-selectable professions, and about 12 or so traits, half of them being negative and the other positive. So it doesn't always give a unique combination for each character created.- Better UI overall. The in-game inventory UI is fine, interactivity is good, but may need ""quick switch"" buttons so that we don't have to sift through the huge inventory to find the damn rolling pin.Last thoughts:Considering that driving, vehicles and more cities/towns will be added to the game in the future, the current level of depth in such a short period of time (despite everything the developers have gone through), I can positively believe that any promised feature will be delivered by the developers.It will definitely not be for people who like isometric games, but if you can get past that prejudice, you can unlock the full potential of Project Zomboid.

								Very great game. Perfect simulation of how they would act(as if I would know). I am writing this review right after losing.So I decide to tell you ""how I died"".I woke up in a house. The house i would later die in, the house was a two story,empty house probably for sale.knowing that there will be no food, water, or weapons/supplies I left the house to find somewhere to get my supplies.  I am walking,very slowly, to the next door house. Me being stupid i tripped over my foot and attracted the attention of the near by zombie. I ran faster than ever to the house next door. Running in the house i had went through my whole list of what i should and shouldn't keep to be most efficient... I still picked up everything.  I had found a knife, a fork, canned food, and a bottle of bleach. Me being depressed and paranoid i was compensating on wether i take the bleach and drink it, or use it to clean my water. A zombie had walked in and scratched me while i was thinking about that. I stopped thinking, got out my knife, and stabbed it until it was dead. It fell over, so i stomped its head until it had no head. I had scratch but not a big scratch, so i tore a piece of my clothes and wrapped it around me wound.  I went to another house, without attracting attention, it was a two story, clean, house the family must have been alive longer than the others. luckily i found all the supplies i needed. I found 2 aid kits, an axe, and some planks. I got all the materials out of it to sanitise my wound so i don't get infected or feel pain at the worst moments. there had been left over food in the house. For a few days i had been making plans, organizing, and living like i would before the apocolypse.  I went back to the house I had woke up in to start building walls, and more space to keep future supplies organized. My arm had went numb and I wasn't acting normal. Seeing anything that looked like a person made me want to attack them.That is when i realized... I am turning into a zombie. I had learned that even a scratch will get me infected, and that I didnt get cloth on my arm in time to stop it. the first aid kit wouldn't have helped due to the amount of time without the sanitary circumstances. That is how i died... and it was a nice life, but i could've...done better.8/10 IGN too little water			",45,10,0,5,3,0,4

								If you're looking for the zombie game that focuses on surviving and not going in guns blazing this is the perfect game for you. The game is very blunt and lets you know right when you start up a game that you WILL eventually die. There is no cure waiting for you, no military evac post taking you to some cruise ship. It's just you and the undead.  Right now NPC's aren't implemented which makes you feel like the last person on earth, but the game is still a blast. Recently they added an overhaul to healing and instead of just slapping on a medkit or the likes you have to disinfect and bandage wounds (or remove bullets or glass). In my opinion this is the most realistic zombie game to date. The sounds are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. With the coming features promised the game will get even better. Multiplayer is implemented so hop on and have fun with others.I'd give it an 8.5/10 Easily a 10/10 when the game is finished.			",118,18,6,16,22,0,12

								After reinstalling this game after more than a year of not playing and seeing zero significant changes (AGAIN), I gotta write this as a warning. This game is dead in the water as far as I'm concerned. 3 possibilities. 1. Develpment continues at this pace. In which case this game may be done in 10 years...2. Development stops completely. I've seen this pattern before, and this seems most likely. Probably culminating in the release of an unfinished product and a lot of angry people that have been holding their breath for 6 years. 3. Development suddenly surges, the game gets everything it promised in a reasonable time frame. Now, why would anyone assume this is likely given the mountain of evedence and history to the contrary?

								Great game! in Beta and there is a ton of great content. Yes, it has bugs and issues, but again it's in Beta. Probably the best zombie survival game I have ever played. Hunger and thirst play a major part in the game as well many other factors. Zombies are fun to kill and very challenging at times. Crafting is fairly in depth and should get better with time. There is no multiplyer as of yet but that is something that is planning on being released. When raiding houses or any building for supplies you never know what to expect with is awesome. The place could be clear or you could hop through a window, meet 3 zombies get bit and die.Overall great game with loads of potential.			",179,25,2,21,9,0,14

								Find a nice home. Close the curtains, cook some bacon and enjoy some fine whisky. Get bored, read a few magazines and head upper floor to sleep. Open the door to bedroom. Get ambushed by two zombies who apparently were there the whole time. Die horribly.10/10 would play again.			",84,19,0,16,13,0,21

								Well 1st off. This is the 1st game review I have ever written. I own over 160 games on steam, and this is my 1st review!!!  So why review Project Zomboid? Well you could say im a little bit of a graphics Wh@#%... That I thought there is no way in hell I would play this game. To old school!!! There's just no way... Well the story goes like this.     My alienware 18x had to be sent off for a repair and I had to break out my old laptop. Was looking for a game that was'nt as graphics intensive. So my search began. Looked at tons of games, but I have really been into survival games the last year or so. The pickings are slim as I own most of them. All of them disappointments by the way ( in more than one way for most ).I seen Project Zomboid and just kept passing it over. There's no way I would enjoy Zomboid. So was kinda eyeing Miscreated which had just come out, but while it looks ok . Seems like it just released way to early with not enough to offer. I could'nt bring myself to buy it though. To many others are stuck in this same state ( that I own) for me to commit to purchasing.     Well then I clicked on Project Zomboid (negative thoughts running through my mind). Read about the game. Scrolled down to reviews and started reading some( almost 6k positive and under 400 negative ).. Well hell that says alot right there. Most zombie survival games are about 1/2 and 1/2 with pos/neg reviews. So I wnt to youtube and started watching reviews on PZ. Took me about 2hrs to commit to buying PZ. Mind you I was still pretty darn sure I would'nt like it, but with so many positive reviews and positive community behind it. I figured I would give it a try.    I must say boy was I wrong. Just like minecraft this game proves graphics aren't everything. This game has really blown me away. Most complete and satisfying zombie survival to date for me ( hands down ). I can't say enough about PZ. Im still shocked that Im enjoying this game this much..If your on the fence just buy it. If your like me and thought no way? Just buy it... But wait there'ssssss Moooooore!!!!!!! This games not done yet. They still have alot to add, and the direction they are going sounds amazing. This game is only going to get better people. Long story short. Just Buy The D@%$ Game.....P.S: to those 370 Negative Reviewers WTH did you play the same game I did =p			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've been very interested in this game for a long while. It was shaping up to be the zombie survival game I've always wanted. After playing it for the first time, I fell in love. It had the right amount of depth and realism needed to really make it special. You had to deal with all the struggles of surviving in a zombie outbreak, from not getting eaten alive by the zombies themselves to depression. The game also has a good amount of difficulty, even if the game is easy to learn and master after multiple playthroughs. Surviving for a skilled player becomes trivial. That's where the NPCs come in though, to spice up the playthrough. And that's the reason why I am not able to recommend this game, unfortunately. I understand the NPCs the devs had planned were very ambitious (probably too ambitious for a small team) and need time to get right. I also understand that the devs have went through development hell, and that's also part of the reason for NPCs not being close to finished. However, it's been about 6 years since I started following this game, and I'm beginning to give up hope of ever seeing NPCs in this game anytime in the near future. For me, NPCs are a big component of this game, and not having them just makes the game seem hollow. Sure, you have all this depth to this survival experience, but it's really hard to have the motivation to survive if you have nothing to survive for. I feel like NPCs are what would take this game and really turn it into something special. Unfortunately, the devs have decided not to reveal anything about NPCs until they are in their final phases of development. While I understand why they are doing this, it is causing many people who follow this game (me included) to lose hope of ever seeing NPCs in the game. However, there is multiplayer. If you are the type of player who loves multiplayer survival games, then go ahead and pick this game up. It works very well from what I've played of it. However, I personally am a singleplayer fan, and so NPCs are what makes or breaks this game for me. Unfortunately, until NPCs are added (or we get any news about it in the upcoming months) I cannot recommend this game for anyone who isn't wanting to play multiplayer. While it is fun for a bit, the singleplayer will get old rather quickly. My biggest fear is that they will start to focus exclusively on multiplayer rather than NPCs. I really hope this is not the case, as I've always wanted a good singleplayer zombie survival experience.			",265,47,8,34,30,4,35

								Awesome zombie survival indie game. It's early release now but already oozes potential and will no doubt get much better as time goes on. It's a permadeath survival game with many mechanics such as weather, exposure, moodlets, cooking, scavenging, infection, positive/negative trait tradeoffs, enormous map to explore, electricity/water supplies, crafting and a bunch of other stuff. It's also pitched at the ideal price point for this game imo.			",237,104,17,64,66,8,49

								I got into playing this game because my dad did, and when ever he would talk about it i thought that ""man that game sounds bad, how could my dad possibly play it all day, every day?"" Finally I grew a pair and watched my dad play Project Zomboid. I got hooked and I asked my dad ""yo dad can I play with you?"" and he said ""HELLS YEAH!"" and It took me a few minutes to get used to the controles and I was hooked. I wanted the game my self, But I have absolutely no money so my dad did this amazing thing that lets me play his version of it on my computer and now almost like clockwork I get on Steam and play Project Zomboid right after i get done with my homework and after my cat nap. and i play it until it is time for me to go to bed. With only bathroom breaks and breaks for dinner or snacks.I would highly recommend this game to anyone I mean ANYONE who like Sims, because it is basecly Sims but you have to survive, kill zombies (or walkers what ever you want to call the walking dead) and try to survive as long as you possibly can. There are lots of places to explore, they have Malls, 7-11 (but of cource they aren't called that in the game because thats copyright), houses (LOTS and LOTS of houses, you got two story houses one story houses also you have trailer parks ((Now you can call the zombies, trailer trash Zombies, they even act like trailer trash and are pains in the butt.))) The one thing you have to be careful about is the Alarms on the houses or stores because they sometimes attract a few zombies and sometimes they attract a whole hoard of zombies (It is really Freaking hard to kill zombies when you are surrounded and are trying to kill 30 of them because unlike trying to kill just 4 or 5 of them which you can just attack and run a few feet away and attack again, you cannot do that with 30 of them because they are all coming at you and if they bite you, you're dead because the bite could get infected if left unattended (the bad thing is that when you die and turn into a zombie you cannot play as the zombie.) another fun thing to do is to get drunk. (its as if you were to get drunk in real life, you cant walk straight. you have terrible aim, and any other thing that you know about getting drunk they got it (except the part where some people who get drunk can't shut up, your person doesn't say anything, Its like if you were to get your friend drunk and duck tape there mouth so they cant say anything.) Before you even start the game you can pick traits that you would like to have (Good and Bad) a really good trait that I always get is Claustraphobic because it is amazing. If you want to kill zombies all the time I would recommend that you get thick skinned. You get to name your character and even get to sorta choose what he or she is wearing and pick a hair style that you like.So if you want to play a game that is Like the Sims and you like killing zombies you need to get and play this game (because I know some of you will get the game and not play it ((it would be a Waist of a perfectly good game))			",36,11,1,4,2,0,0

								Project Zomboid is interesting, and I recommend it, but I'm not sure I can recommend it to everyone.The basic idea of the game is that it's a simulator that tries to accurately simulate surviving the zombie apocalypse. In this regard it is uncomprimising, going as far as prioritizing realistic(As realistic as you can be with a zombie apocalypse scenario, anyway) and immersive mechanics over stuff that is actually, y'know, strictly about making the game fun to play. This results in a lot of features that are pretty cool in concept, but can end up being frustrating in the context of the game itself, with its sort of clunky strategic top-down gameplay. Here are some examples of this:-Enemy variety, currently there's just human zombies. No special zombies, no animal zombies, just human zombies with varying degrees of speed and strength. This can get dull and, coupled with the next feature mentioned in this list, makes guns kind of not worth using since melee weapons deal with everything pretty well.-Anything that makes loud noise attracts zombies, as does any kind of noise in general. No using the gun you spent ages looking for, it's more dangerous than useful.-The game has a large featureset for building but building also means hauling around heavy objects that put you at max encumbrance, meaning a lot of trips to and from the trees you're harvesting for wood.-Skills level slowly, progression can take what could be called a ""Realistic"" amount of simulated time with it being possible to survive for months and years worth of ingame time.-Zombie infection. This is the big one, being infected slowly but surely kills you and can result from one bite.Now, all this isn't to say that the game isn't fun to play - it is, but it's the sort of game that appeals more to people who like slow, strategic survival gameplay and anyone who wants a zombie apocalypse sim that prioritizes attention to detail over all else and features possibly the most comprehensive persistent open world used in a zombie or survival game to date. Anyone expecting an actiony/arcadey zombie survival game will end up disappointed.The only thing I can objectively count as a negative is that melee targeting on corpses will occasionally not work, and I've had a lot of characters ended by having a zombie I'm trying to stomp on stand up inside them and instantly deliver a bite that has something like a 90% infection rate. Be wary of that!I rate this game 3.5 out of 5 in its current state.			",236,18,1,13,15,0,22

								I think I will finally give this game a review, I have been playing this game for a long time now, I cannot give it a thumbs up yet do to the fact it has taken so long in development, I understand that it is a small team, but for real, the lack of adding content should not be this slow even for those that take part in IWBUMS. I read an article yesterday where the devs said ""We’re starting to plan out our final march toward 1.0, which we’re hoping will be within the late first quarter of 2015, possibly creeping into Q2,” and we are nowhere near that in any way shape or form this was from 680 DAY'S AGO. Screw the Naysayers who say this game is not worth it, because it is , the game play, the idea, the graphics are all great, the game is fun, but it is unfinished. The DEV's have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of people that are assisting finding bugs with the whole IWBUMS, so I ask why nip pick at the content you have and try and make it perfect, the whole point of early access is to push the content, let people find the bugs, and you fix them and assist with development.   Every Monday I am disappointed I want content because I really love playing this game, I have a game where I have lived on my own for almost a year now, but it is getting boring, even with the tiny bit of updates they have added. At some point you need to listen to the masses and give them what they want, and sorry to say it but people want NPC's, transportation, and quest just to name a few. I mean it a game, push what you have and let us break it, let us play it. When there is a massive update to the game and you have goals and NPC's I will change review to thumbs up. Until then I would say do not expect anything to change any time soon.			",26,5,0,9,1,0,5

								What can I say?  This game's interface looks so simplistic by today's standards, and yet the Indie Stone team has managed to possibly create one of the best post-apocalyptic zombie survival games in existence to date.In a sea of games set in the rapidly-becoming-trite-and-humdrum End Of The World By Way Of Zombies scenarios, this one outshines them all.  Yes, even in its alpha stage.In the sandbox game, you create your character and are greeted with the cheery messages telling you, basically, that you're *going* to die.  There's no rescue coming, the end isn't just nigh, it's done come and gone.  You're on your own.  Your goal is basically just to survive as long as you can.  And die you will.  Many, many times, at least unti you get the hang of the game's mechanics and how to avoid becoming some poor deceased fast food worker's lunch.  Barricade windows and doors, erect walls, keep yourself fed and watered, and don't let your character get bored and depressed.  Flee town and start a farm to live off the land, or hole up in an abandoned warehouse and periodically raid the surrounding buildings for supplies, all while avoiding the relentless horde which believably reacts to sight, sound, and smell.For those of you used to games like Left 4 Dead, taking on a horde of fifty zombies with a shotgun is one of the worst things you can do in this game.  The noise brings every zombie in a five mile radius bearing down on you, and your ammo supply is typically very limited.  Even one zombie hiding in that corner you forgot to check is a threat.  Whoa, there was one in the tall grass you didn't see, and he wasn't dead.  Now he's gnawing on your ankle.  Whoops, is that a bite?  Welp.  You're infected.  Expect to live another couple of days in game before turning.  Or you could just chug that bottle of bleach you found in the bathroom earlier to end it now...In short, this game delivers one of the most intense and gripping presentations of the zombie apocalypse I've seen in a video game yet.  Pessimistic and gritty, and incredibly addicting, even without the option of mowing down hundreds of cannon fodder corpses.  I've probably logged more than 150 hours in this game in total, and I still can't get enough.The best part is that the development team is still working hard, cranking out more and more updates, polishing features, ironing out the bugs, and keeping their players informed about what's to come.  This game is well, WELL worth the $15 they're asking for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I believe Steam Early Access ruined this game.Why?Because it has been 5+ years, and the game is still unfinished, if anything, EA has made the developers work on the game slower.""Ayyy look at all dis money we gettin', let us continue to promise♥♥♥♥♥♥to keep interest up.""I'm not a game developer, I don't know jack♥♥♥♥♥♥when it comes to coding, but seriously guys, you're not working on a Ultra 3D environments AAA game here.I have heard some bad♥♥♥♥♥♥about Indie Stone too, I ain't gonna mention much about it, because I might get banned for even talking about it..oh I already did, oh well.They are not good at taking critizism, just one thing.Do what you guys want, the game was fun about 7-8 years ago or whatever when it were in Alpha, I honestly don't remember when I bought it, I just remember that is was ages ago.My most sincere recommendation, wait for the game to get finished.Now once it is, wait another few years, because I just KNOW that they will bring the game out of EA, and then pretend that the game is done, while adding ""bug fixes"" and ""content updates"".Yes, I AM telling you to stay away from this game.But I am also saying do what you want.Just don't buy it.Do whatever you want.Except buy it.This is not the Zombie Survival game you are looking for. *magic hand motion*			",135,11,1,14,17,1,23

In its current state it is playable and it is enjoyable it is in such an early stage, new features are being added all the time and every monday the DEVS release a ""mondoid"" where they tell everyone whats happening with the game, meaning you are never left in the dark. Having problems? start a disscusion in the community and I GUARENTEE they will help you (unless you need help with that really weird thing, what do you call it? life? reality? something like that xD). so this is a amazing game AND a bargain.

Early Access Review
								Project Zomboid is a refreshing gem in the survival game genre.When I bought this game in 2011, long before steam greenlight, I stumbled upon this game on YouTube.It was far from what you have seen before, the closest thing to it at the time was minecraft.The developers humble about their little project.Back then the map was tiny, weapons did not exist in the quantity they do now, the food system we have now did not exist, multiplayer was a massive requested feature but was thought to never happen, there was no progression system the graphics were odd, you get the idea it was not a big game.Now, after 5 years a lot has changed, it has become quite a survival game.Since the steam review section consists mainly out of overused memes, people complaining about their PC not being able to handle the games and people ranting with 1000 hours that the game sucks I will post more of an introduction than a review. I will of course say what is good and what is missing but I will focus on it more in detail than a short review would.At the bottom I will sum everything up with a TL;DRWhat makes the game good?Its combat system:Overall the combat system is satisfying.You don't feel too strong or too weak. Your character feels like he is hitting bodies made out of bone and flesh, not bodies made out of papiermâché or not rocks like in other games.There are three different types of combat:BluntBladeRagedBlunt consists out of bats, spiked bats and sledgehammersBlade consists out of Knives and AxesRanged consists out of Pistols, Shotguns and RiflesIf enemies get too close (hugging close) an axe won't do much damage a knife however will. A blunt weapon is efficient as long as the enemy is in reach however, it won't do as much damage as a close ranged knife or an axe.Guns do good amount of damage if the enemy is at the right distance. If the enemy gets in melee range it won't be nearly as accurate as if he is a few meters away.Axes have a sweet spot where the blade contacts with the enemy where they will be the most efficient. If you swing too much your character won't hit as hard.Mood and Needs:Your character of course does not stroll through the zombie apocalypse like it's nothing, under all those pixels he also had emotions and needs which this game wants to deliver to you. Your character can feel a variety of things which affect his combat and health.Your character can feel pain, sadness, nausea, panic, sadness, boredom, hunger and thirst, exhaustion, tiredness and temperature.All these affect you somehow, pain and panic for example can reduce your accuracy with weapons, if you are in great pain you won't be able to sleep.Hunger and thirst obviously will kill you if they get to great.Boredom and Sadness don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥but change the appearance of the world (it becomes darker), in the future however they will play a bigger role.Nausea makes you recover less if injured or if you get really sick by eating that month old lasagne then you may die.Exhaustion makes you a slow weakling.Tiredness reduces your awareness and ultimately makes you collapse on the street if it gets too bad.Your character can defeat zombies, that means he is also able to overcome his emotions. here are some examples.If you are in great pain you can take pain killers.If you are bored you can go outside, mom will be proud or get drunk dad will be proud . He can also read or something.If you are tired you can drink a coffee, you can also use the ancient chinese trading secret method of sleeping.If you are thirsty you can drink out of the toilet bowel, and so on.Your character also adapts over time, he is less prone to panic the longer he is around zombies and is not so emotionally impacted after seeing corpses all day.What about progression and stats?Project Zomboid lets your character develope over his lifetime and you get to already influence your character's skills and talents while you are creating him.While creating your character, you can chose his pre-apocalypse profession and his traits, the higher the benefits of these professions the less points you can spend on other traits.There are many traits and professions so I will only give one example.You want your character to be able to build objects that can actually stand? Then you can pick carpender, this gives your character more experience in carpentry allowing him to build more complex objects right off the bat.If your character does something often, he will gain more experience and gain level, this can improve how efficient your character with the knife on the field, or in the kitchen and much more.How much can you control in the environment? Your character can farm, build, and scavenge.If you don't want to starve then you need to plant food, if you don't want to get killed by a horde then you need to be able to build sturdy houses and if you want tools you need to scavenge for rocks to build tools.There are many differnt crops that you get to plant, you need to plow the soil, water them regularly and make sure no one steps on them.For building there are many different structures to chose from, the things you build become more sturdy the more expereience you have. This can been seen not just by their hitpoints but also visually.Challenge:Project Zomboid is a game that is challenging for new players but once you get the hang of it, it gets pretty easy. After a month of playing the electricity and water supply will turn off because the power plant will get over run. This forces the player to find a well in the middle of nowhere to obtain more water or to drink out of every toilet bowel in the city. Since there is no power you can not refrigerate anymore, meaning you will have plant food yourself. There is no greater goal to accomplish but not dying which truly makes this game a survival game, this can get boring over time.There are things to still be added:A much requested feature are NPC, they once were in the game (around 2012) however the developers found that they simply were not smart enough, so they removed them. Since then they have been working on them and other projects so they won't blow♥♥♥♥♥once they are in the game, people simply have to be patient.Other things like generators a nutricion system is coming too, so don't you dare think that the developers have become lazy. The fact that these guys are still dedicated to this game after such a long time (this being their first project) is very comforting to know. They are also remaking the visuals and combat system for the third time to make it even better, you can check their YouTube channel for some footage of that. They always have new ideas and mods can also improve on the experience. (Here is my favorit one as an example)There are things I can not mention because of the character limit on steam, like the map editor for example.TL;DR:Project Zomboid is a game with a great atmosphere. With a satisfying combat system, needs and moods, alongside a trait and experience system and a great soundtrack, it succeeds at delivering an entertaining experience.The game still has not reached full replay value since you are all alone but if you buy a copy with a friend it will definitely last you a lot of hours, don't let that shy you away however since even alone this game will deliver.Since patches come regularly with the developers listening and interacting with the community on their forum I can only recommend this as an early access.

Early Access Review
								Day 1 My first in-game day was spent wandering around and trying to figure out the controls. I picked up some food and a baseball bat and ran around smashing windows, climbing inside people's houses and looting. After caving in a few Z-heads I was told I was thirsty. I drank some water from a toilet and all was well. I was then told I was hungry. Searching in a house I found a ""TV Dinner"", which sounded perfect. I walked over and put it in the oven. While I was waiting for it to cook I read a book. A short time later I came over to the oven only to find I had burnt my TV dinner. The game told me I would get depressed and unhappy should I eat it. I did. I was instantly overwhelmed with depression and told I was tired. I went to sleep on the couch. Day 2 The next morning I awoke in an unhappy mood. I was playing about with the controls and somehow managed to accelerate time at an alarming rate. After smashing some keys I finally got it back to normal. My character was hungry, thirsty, bored, depressed and tired now. O goodie. I found a steak and slung it in the oven to cook. I was not going to let this meal burn, so I stood there watching it cook. The instant it was finished I grabbed it and scoffed the whole thing. As is tradition, I washed it down with some toilet water. I was told my character was going to collapse (presumably because he had been awake for about 2 days solid due to the time accelerating-issue). I curled up on the sofa and went to sleep. Day 4? I woke up in the middle of the night and could not see a thing. I thought it best I continue with my book in the pitch black, so began reading for a bit. Morning came and I was hungry and thirsty. I searched around the neighbourhood for supplies and came across a packet of cigarettes and some peanut butter. I ate the cigarettes and the peanut butter and sipped some more toilet water. I also found a backpack and various other supplies. I went on a journey north. My mood seemed to change as I smashed Z after Z' head in. My depression lifted and I found new vigour. As the day went on I looted a liquor shop for crisps and ice-cream and broke into a farm house to steal a hammer and nails. ....that's pretty much how my game went so far.Jimbo Rating: 7/10			",134,5,5,9,5,0,4

								I love this game. It's a fantastic idea and it's being executed in a great way, but very very very very slowly. I'm pretty sure the Devs of this game have extreme ADHD.....Also, in its current state, it is not worth $10 or the original $15 i paid for it (shouldn't of done it tbh) This is more like one of those 6.99 games you see popping around sometimes. They have great content, but get stale quickly.I don't recommend this game in its current state. However, in ten or fifteen years, once it's finally finished, I probably will.			",34,2,0,6,1,0,1

								I wish I could recommend this game as it was and still is a good concept and the execution isn't done that bad at all. Combat is a little clunky at times but the survival aspects are well done in my opinion and are fairly in-depth. With a slew of status effects derived from environemtal conditions to emotional factors such as anxiety, fear and depression, just to name a few, there is quite a varried platter of outcomes for each players death and it makes for a pretty neat replayability factor since the survival is intended to be very difficult. However through all the many years I've had this title development has been slugish at best and now it seems as though the developers have lost motivation to get a finished product to the many backers that enjoyed their concept. Seriously around 7 years in early access and this is all you have to offer? I could accept the lack of progess if there were low amounts of sales but honestly this game has sold quite decently, at least well enough to warrant hiring a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ employees to get your product FINISHED. These guys are so unprofessional they are just now starting to deliver on features they promised all the way back in 2015! If that doesn't scream incompitence I don't know what does. Save your money and don't invest in this concept, because that's all it is at this point. There is not enough gameplay elements to keep you interested for very long and even with multiplayer the lack of activities to carry out make for a bland experience. I hope to see this game make some sort of progress towards a final release. Maybe I'll check back in another 7 years to see if it's done yet :)			",115,6,1,13,10,0,13

Early Access Review
								When I decided to look at the store page for this game, I was genuinely surprised to see a seemingly unending cascade of negative reviews. On one hand, I can see things from their perspective, and I can see why these people ultimately do not recommend this game. However, I'd like to address claims made by these people, validating some and disproving others. This review is aimed at people on the fence about purchasing this game.In its current state, this game is great fun. I've had experiences on this game that one could not get anywhere else. Granted, these experiences were only possible due to the multiplayer experience. Experiences such as building whole communities that were genuinely life-like, and on the other hand, watching them inevitably collapse. This game has far more depth than most games of this genre. It is not without its problems, but I will touch on those later.A lot of people are claiming this game has not changed in the last 4-5 years. This is the most myopic claim I see people make, so I'd like to address this one first. This game has indeed changed a lot. Some of these changes seem quite small, but have had large impact on the game. Some examples of how this game has changed are as follows:Revamped medical/health system.Revamped skills, traits, and character progression.Addition of skills such as foraging, trapping, fishing, metalworking, etc.Addition of skills such as aiming, accuracy, etc. All of which increase as your character survives.Addition of a nutrition system.Addition of player-made traps such as nail traps, bombs, etc. (Significant impact in multiplayer.)Added professions such as engineer, electrician, metalworker, etc. (In tandem with added skills.)Greatly improved horde migration and zombie spawning.Revamped UI and inventory system.Multiplayer optimization and voice support. (Significant impact in multiplayer.)Improved cooking system. (Ability to bake bread and learn recipes.)World building through radio and TV broadcasts. (Players are able to broadcast through radio in multiplayer.)UX improvements pulled from the forum suggestions thread. (Such as highlighted containers when looting them.)Added world decay and seasons. (Vines creep up the walls of housing, road decay, nature slowly taking over, etc.)Modding support.Greatly improved sound engine and ambienceSandbox options that allow the player to customize their apocalypse experience.All of these changes have made the game feel more complete and wholesome. The singleplayer audience would understandably leave this game to age in their library. Without the diversity of human interaction, as frustrating as it may be at times, I do not think this game would live. The experiences you can have that will make this game worth far more than its asking price are simply not possible without multiplayer, and to be honest, not even with the inclusion of promised NPCs. The NPCs many are asking for would be considered wonderfully ahead of their time, provided they make release. To call the devs lazy is another narrowminded insult, as the devs share their progress with the community on a weekly basis. I see many call these mondoids ""useless,"" and then these same people will accuse the devs of being too lazy to work on the game, even though what the devs are working on and what their progress is has just been disclosed.However, these negative reviews are not all entirely wrong. Development progress is rather slow. However, you have to understand that this game started off as a one-man project. It is impressive for how far it has come, though it has a way to go before meeting its rather large ambitions.It is important to keep in mind that the updates The Indie Stone releases are very polished and go through weeks of playtesting to ensure highest quality once it hits the main branch. Even bugfixes go through this playtesting stage to ensure fixes do not create more problems. It is evident the devs do genuinely care about their game because of the amount of polish each update goes through.The heavy amount of negative reviews is worrying because not only are they rather hasty in their analysis, but in addition, they lead the would-be player to assume the game is in a failing, bug-ridden, and unenjoyable state.In its current state, the game is far from unenjoyable. If you pick this game up, especially if on sale, and hop onto a server, whether it be your own or a larger public one, you will find that this game meets expectations for its asking price of a mere $15.I've been a radio host, a member of a rebellion in a community, been surrounded in a building by a de-facto police force, been a lone wolf, a bartender, a member of a cannibalistic faction, a double-agent, taken part in defending a player-made town from a horde, been kidnapped and forced to fight to the death with planks and frying pans, been robbed, robbed others, hid in a closet while a serial killer murdered men just outside my door, overheard conversations not meant for my ears, been spied on, found bases hidden in the woods, ran trade routes, etc.I do recommend purchasing this game. At the very least, keep your eye on this one for when it releases animations and other updates.			",47,3,0,5,3,0,5

								I'm a huge fan of true survival games, like don't starve. where it's hard to survive and, if possible at all, even harder to thrive. During the winter sale I was looking for a new survival game to play, and this always proves to be a difficult task because there are so many fake survival games, games that with enough grinding you can easily thrive.So I decided to give project zomboid a try, and the game positively surprised me.It is a really hard game where if you be careful enough, you'll be able to survive, but a minor screw up can and will kill you. Wasn't prepared for that zombie in the bathroom of a house you thought was empty? He can scratch you or bite you, giving you a high chance of zombification, an illness with no cure in the game. Yes, you a zombie manages to scratch or bite you, there's a big chance that the game over timer will start ticking.And even if you isolate yourself from the huge amounts of zombie in the forested areas of the huge (HUGE) map, you'll still will have to deal with food and water. Food can be preserved for more time in fridges, but guess what? After a random amount of days, the power will be cut out. You can drink water from sinks and toilets, but just like the power, water will also be cut out after a random amount of days.The character creation is fantastic as well, and the trait system reminds me of old fallout games. You have good and bad traits that give you negative and positive points, respectively. You can only start the game if you have 0 or more points so you'll need to balance your character accordingly.And it has multiplayer! I had loads of fun playing with two people, scavenging the city for supplies, reinforcing a place to call home...And finally, another thing that really surprised me was the amount of zombies in the game. Depending on your luck and area in the game, you can stumble upon hordes and hordes of zombies. This feels just like the walking dead, and in fact it's one of the games that feels most like the series, apart from the telltale's ones, of course.This game is still in early access and it's loads of fun. I can't even think of how it will look and play when it's done.			",74,13,0,9,14,0,7

								I quickly discovered something important about Project Zomboid - I'm not very good.  Spinning to face a zombie, I recalled my son's reaction when I beat a guy one-on-one in a shootout in WolfET.  He looked at my dead opponent and said ""thank you for sucking"".I bring this up because I can set Sandbox Mode to ease me into harder and harder levels.  Nobody's gona watch me on YouTube if I'd been recording my playthroughs (I haven't been)(you're welcome), but poor little Joey Fatone has a pretty good base set up, and his much tougher brother Fred Fatone is working on his own.  I'm learning the system, and having a ball.Most guys will play PZ like it's Dwarf Fortress (""Losing is Fun!"") which is great, but it's your call.  There's a deep and satisfying skill system, but that's poorly suited to die-in-a-week scenarios.  So you make an important choice when you start the game, entirely apart from which Fatone brother to play and what skills he has.  Sandbox can be adjusted to encourage learning a lot, Survival, well, not so much unless you're adept.  I've seen enough playthroughs to convince me that very, very few guys, and I don't mean old ones like me, will bother much with most skills if they know that living a month is unlikely.   The game has not yet reached a point, however, where an effective base will be fun for very long, at least not your second or third one.  If you make yourself safe and reasonably self-sustaining, you've won, and it's probably time for a new Fatone.But, the game lets you pick what style you want.  Anyone remotely interested in the genre, basically anyone interested enough to be reading this, should enjoy the game.  Just don't expect to live forever, you're Joey Fatone, not Justin Timberlake.

								I am not usually a big fan of zombie survival games but this game is awesome! There is a heavy focus on not just surviving against the zombies, but against hunger/depression/disease/etc as well. And don't let the graphics dissuade you. This games is addictive. If you are into fancy HD graphics and stuff, go somewhere else. But you won't find a game that has that and is this immersive and strategic in managing your resources while still fighting to survive. Great game!			",21,14,0,15,18,0,16

								I played a lot of zombieslasher/ survival games ( Left 4 dead, Resident Evil, 7 days to die, dying light, ...) so Project Zomboid seemed to be a good choice. It is supposed to fill the gap between crafting games and survival games but (in my opinion) fails in some important aspects.After a fun character creation (profession, many ridicolous attributes to choose from: deaf, obese ...) and a difficulty choice you spawn in your apartment in an undead infested world. You explore a giant world with towns and forrests all the while defending yourself against zombies and the elements of nature. There is no hope of survival! (and thats the problem)This is one of those games you think should be great but once you actually try it out, its just lackluster and a waste of time. Here is why: Fighting System You kill endless hordes of undead which all behave the same (some slower or faster but thats it) and look pretty similar after some time. This might be ""classic zombie behaviour"" but has to be counteracted by engaging and fun combat mechanics. Its simply not fun to right click, then hold the attack until the zombie is in reach and release the mouse button. The zombie either stumbles and falls over or you have to walk backwards and repeat. Once its down simply stomp it to death.This is fun  for like a hundred zombies and becomes a chore afterwards.I dont mind killing zombie hordes after hordes in any other zombie game but somehow this game sucked the fun out of it. Even worse that the whole map is crawling with zombies and you have to waste many real life hours to clear an area. But then you wont meet a damn zombie there for a loong time since they only respawn when you leave area for a longer period of time.Not even the guns can salvage the complete lack of zombie-slaying fun since they are hard to come by (good) but utterly useless since they alarm every zombie around. They are also clunky and require a high shooting skill to hit anything even in close proximity. You also have no real way of aiming with a crosshair, only general pointing and praying for a hit. Variation There are multiple weapons in this game: Pencils, knifes, axes, baseball bats, shotguns, pistol and lots more.BUT they mostly look literally the same (a lot of melee weapons look like the baseball bat) and handle pretty similar in combat. Crafting seems exciting since you have they choice between hundreds of recipes (even generators which can power lamps or a fridge). But the amount of stuff you have to find until you can craft these things is huge and can take a long time of wandering around the map searching for random loot. The result is simply not worth the grind. The UI makes handling you inventory quite annoying and needs a serious overhaul.Long term goal/ motivationThe main reason i cant recommend this is the complete lack of motivation to actually survive. You gonna die anyway so why even hoard supplies or farm endlessly? L4d has saferooms and some kind of escape in the unknown. 7 days to die has huge building projects to undertake (also kind of pointless but still). Resident Evil, Dying Light and many other zombie games use a story line to keep the player engaged.Project Zomboid has nothing but building youself a poor mans fort and play farmer till you get bored to death. Of course you can still have a lot of fun but simply imagining a story in your head but why take this from the devs shoulders? There is mainly one thing which would boost the stale gameplay: NPCs combined with some long term goal ( cure, Escape or whatever). This brings us to: Development PaceThis game is in development for about 5 years and gets updates every few weeks but doesnt progress anymore. The recently addet TVs and radios dont even have sound! They just repeat the same written lines like in retro games (sounds in fallout 2 for example).The developer essays are interesting to read at first but get annoying very soon. If there happens a major update which actually implements some kind of content apart from wandering the map, killing samey zombies and looting endless containers i will gladly update my review.Until then i cannot recommend this game at all.

								Hands down the best zombie survival game i have ever seen.The map is still under progress, but it's already huge with two major towns , and many factories / hidden places.The zombies are really well coded, and everything is taken into account : the noise you make, if you are visible through a window, if they see light inside a building, ect...Also, your character can only see what's in front of him, you thought you'd have a nice, aerial view of every danger around ? Nope.The variety of items that can be found is huge, it makes the game very realistic, and scavenging all the more interesting.The weapon system is made in a way that you can't kill many zombies easily, so it's vital to establish strategies like catching the attention of zombies to get them away from your shelter, and loose them by running between trees.The graphics are great, the game is light and will run on most computers.This game is everything DayZ (and many other similar games) should have been, and it keeps getting better with every update, thanks to the awesome Devs.Did i forget to mention it ? This game is very hard. You're going to die. Quickly.			",61,4,1,9,8,1,3

								The only thing I can say is stupid or lame about this game is that it has ""Project"" in the official title. However, this game is a masterpiece in the open world survival genre, pitting you against mankind's greatest foe. Care to take a guess? The answer is not zombies. It's your own bodily functions. The easy to avoid zombies start to look a little more dangerous with each bit of your health slowly disappearing over time, whether you're spiraling into insanity, or catching the common cold, or growing bored and wet. And you thought hunger and thirst were bad enough.To further add onto the awesome, Zomboid has a functioning split-screen mode as well as a working online mutliplayer that came as quite a shock to a number of players who never expected it to see the light of day. Among that, it features a micromanageable difficulty in which you can alter anything from playing with a mass of zombies or completely alone (which is oddly terrifying), to altering how much loot you have, what kind of weather you'll see, infection conditions, and even modify zombie AI. And then you get a lot of mod functionality from allowing gameplay changes to custom professions. Even at Early Access, Project Zomboid is already working on a solid (and a little buggy) foundation, and is definitely worth checking out.			",239,11,1,16,4,1,13

								TL:DR for people who just want the quick and silly reviewsI convinced my friend to eat a roasted cockroach and then watched him succumb to disease. 10/10, would make my friends eat roaches again.Now, with that out of the way, Project Zomboid is a zombie survival game which has been in steady development for the last six or so years. It takes place in the town of Muldraugh Kentucky and the surrounding areas of Knox County. (Fun fact, the scene in which the villians  men are marching up a street with a tank towards Fort Knox in the James Bond film ""Gold Finger"" was shot in Muldraugh.) Over the course of it's development, Project Zomboid has suffered some outstanding set backs. Paypal and Google freezing Indie Stones accounts, Piracy of the game early in it's development, and the theft of a large amount of code stored on a pair of laptops. Despite all that, Project Zomboid is still here, and it has come a hell of a long way. Gameplay involves scavanging supplies from the houses belonging to your ex neighbors, fortifying a house to hold off the steadily increasing number of zombies, and generally trying to set up some kind of long term survival. Zombies have infectious bites/scratches, which is an issue I have with the game. When you get bit or scratched, you might as well just quit. No point in continuing to play a doomed character. Fortunately, the sandbox mode allows you to turn the infection off, or tweak the gameplay and zombies in many other ways. The game also features basic crafting and construction, which allow you to make a few small utility items, or build very simple structures. Cooking is a good source of fun, especially when you are playing with friends. The best part is making rat soup and making your friends eat it. The game also features a fair bit of random variable when it comes to the zombies. Noises of any kind usually attract them, including the ambient noises you hear around you as you explore. A major source of game ending noise are burgler alarms and helicopters. The burgler alarm triggers sometimes when you break into a house, the noise it makes can be heard for miles and will attract every single zombie within that area of effect. They will descend upon the house and rip it apart searching for the source of the noise, not to mention you if you are fool enough to hang around said house. The other source, helicopters, have a large range of noise and if they come by while you are outside, they will follow you around. Imagine a news helicopter trying to get footage of an unfortunate survivor, unaware that their presence is dooming him/her. Other noises such as gunshots, barking dogs, screaming people, serve the same purposes but to a lesser extent. The ambiant noises occur once, and basically just move zombies in a shortish range towards the sounds origin point. It also serves as a bit of atmosphere. Speaking of screaming people, NPC are planned. You can go to the community hub and see as everyone demands and complains ceaselessly about the lack of NPC's. Some of them even know that zomboid DID have NPC's once. They were horrifyingly buggy and were removed to be worked on at a later date. For now, the game is perfectly playable as is, if a little empty. If you want to fill that world out a bit, make it seems a bit less empty...You can play Zomboid with your friends. The new easy co-op is out as of 5/9/2016 and I am deeply thankful that it is. Hosting multiplayer with friends has gone was a horrifying hassle of opening and forewarding ports, running external server programs, and friends issues with relayed tunneling. It is now a simple, streamlined, click-and-go system. Thanks Indie stone, and thanks to General Arcade for helping them get it worked out. The new co-op multiplayer is great. You can even allocate how much ram you want for the server from inside the game. It is really easy to use, and thanks to it, I can force my friends to eat rat based meals and roasted cockroaches.

Early Access Review
								Today I got utterly ♥♥♥♥-faced on Chardonnay, fell off a roof, got trapped in a toilet by several zombies after my baseball bat broke because I was too drunk to kill them, got thirsty and had to drink toilet water and then fought my way out by stabbing them to death with a spoon. When I got home I discovered my broccoli patch had rotted. Just another day in Zomboid land.To qualify this a little; I have no real interest in zombies (either in games, film or tv) and don't much care for survival games, even less so early access. Took a punt on this after Steam threw it up randomly in my recommended list (I think because I play Alien: Isolation) and I read a few reviews. PZ manages that rare thing of being a pretty hardcore, serious game which should be quite depressing in many ways but somehow manages to also provide deeply satisfying moments of hilarity and 'how the hell did I get out of that?' gameplay. It throws you in at the deepend and resolutely refuses to offer you a hand, let alone a life vest. You will die, often and when you least expect it. You will only have yourself to blame, or the git who put a burglar alarm on their house. I'd recommend reading as little as possible by way of guides and wikis and just going at it, the sense of bewilderment and confusion and the resultant satisfaction from figuring stuff out is part of the fun. Lastly, the devs seem very active in the community and there are great looking updates on the horizon. This game is shaping up to be a bit of a cult classic.			",77,17,1,17,24,0,23

								I've owned this game for quite some time and am only now really getting in to it.  When I first played this game I was getting killed just about every day and thought 'meh'.  I started again recently and instead of playing 'gung ho' style(sing it with me) I have been taking my time, reading tutorials, tips and crafting guides when I get stuck.I've tried Survival and Sandbox and much prefer the sandbox version of the game(I don't die as quickly).  The thing I love about this game?  If I die my body becomes a zombie, I then can create a new character and can go and kill that zombie and get all my stuff back.  Any structure I created is there for that new character, hell even down to  keeping a journal, die, pick up the old journal and continue the journal as a new character has some weird satisfaction. This game is not for the 'half an hour at a time player', not to say you cant play that way, but it's best played if you have about 3 hours or more to spend at a time.  The map is large, I didn't realize just how large this map was till running from point A to B trying to find the user created maps I added.Graphics are not what this games about but they do the job.Customization before a sandbox game begins gives you just about everything you could think of to tweak it to your own liking.I have left 7DTD to play this game, and I absolutely believed that it couldn't get better than 7DTD, time will tell!

								I bought this game on Desura when it wasn't even announced on steam. Since then the only major update I've seen is multi-player (which is of course pretty awesome) and nothing more. For something around 5 years I keep hearing about ""NPC incoming"" and for like two years about new animation system. I'm just tired of waiting for it to finally become complete. I really regret spending on it. I know that I played for 42 hours, but still, I was playing because I was preparing for stuff that has come in short time. I didn't even got what I paid for. It's a shame really, because it's very unique game. Maybe I'll come back after 4 more years (if they didn't abandon it by then).			",344,70,11,50,58,2,53

								This is one of those early access games that got bogged down with the small things, which I check back in on occasionally to see if it has remembered the bigger picture. It doe not seem to have yet, though don't get me wrong since I feel as if I at one point got my value out of playing it. Progress in the game just feels as if it got slowed down reworking over and over systems that had already been completed. Then there is the issue I have that the game still shows a lot of art from when it used to be sprite based when it is now model based, which I think the most painful thing about that transition was how unappealing the user interface is now compared to the old one. If you really want to pick up this title, I would wait until it is out of devepoment because of how radically things can change from update to update.			",67,11,0,10,5,0,10

								This is how you died.The entirety of the game is how you died. There is a mystery as to why the zombie outbreak occurred, and you might even find some answers before you die. Ultimately though, Project Zomboid does not represent an against-all-odds struggle where you overcome the undead. Instead, after dying, every subsequent playthrough just lets you survive a little longer, do a little better, and  learn a little more.Death can come in many, many ways. You have to manage needs, similar to The Sims . You need to eat, sleep, and even need to rest your legs if you're running around too much . You aren't able to see meters that indicate your exact state, but moodlets will appear to let you know exactly what your character is thinking or feeling at any given time. Injuries are common, so if you're scratched or bitten by a zombie, you better tend to them quickly.The town is populated by other survivors and looters, some just as desperate as you. Everyone is  scared by the thousands of zombies roaming the city, and a looter just might find you and put a shotgun round in your chest as he takes your food and other supplies. Scripted events like this will keep you on your toes, but with every failure comes the chance to prepare a little better for next time.The zombies themselves are the slow and lumbering kind. You can fairly easily outrun them, but they are legion, and don't easily forget. They are attracted by blood and noise, and all it takes is a single mistake to advertise your location to the horde. You've never had to think in so many different directions and cover your butt in so many different ways before. As a result, every moment is exciting because you never know what lurks around the corner and whether you missed that one thing that will give away your position. Getting into a routine and locking down your safehouse will be just as important as finding food and scavenging for weapons.Crafting is also a large part of Project Zomboid. At the moment, your character already ""knows"" the recipes needed to create objects to help him: combining a can opener, a can of soup, and a pot results in a big pot of edible soup, for example. Cooking will eventually be part of the game as well, adding another layer of complexity to basic survival; after all, you don't want to be suffering from food poisoning due to eating undercooked meat if you're being chased down by zombies.Overall, well worth a buy. It's easy to see that Project Zomboid has potential and lots of merits. Recommended ",1536,601,45,246,160,15,221

Early Access Review
								I have been looking for a zombie survival game for years- a good one. Something I could play for awhile, something that wouldn't leave me feeling like there could be 'more'a. I remeber the first time I heard of H1Z1, and DayZ- they both sounded amazing. Looking at screenshots, how could I not be impressed?How naive. If you really look around for any zombie apocalypse games, those two names are bound to come up, and with them, their history of major, major disappointment. A couple days ago, I was looking through my Steam Queue, and Project Zomboid happened to pop up. Watching the video, I was intrigued. Yeah, the graphics weren't photorealistic, but then again, when did they ever have to be? When I looked towards the reviews and comments, I was estatic, and could only hope it measured up.It totally did.I've only played a few hours as of this review, but I'm absolutely hooked. In its current state, it is completely playable, and worth its $14.99 price tag. Pros- Realistic survival simulationDeath comes swift and quick for those who don't pay enough attention. From basic survival needs like food and water, the game goes beyond and even throws in challenges in other forms. Staying out in the rain might get you sick, and if you don't take care of that, you might be visiting the Grim Reaper pretty soon. You can be cold, scratched, bitten, and you can bleed, and feel nausea and so much more. Honestly, you get screwed over pretty quick- Good UINot much to say. It's got clean menus, and useful graphics. - Good PersonalizationDo you love zombie games? Do you still suck at killing them? No worries. This game has quite a few different play styles, each one taking place at a different time in the apocalypse. The Initial Infection (a non-canon play for those of us who suck at the games we love), The First Week (where things start to pick up, and those zombies really start to pay closer attention to you), Six Months Later (the name says it all, but you better know how to get water for yourself...), and the last mode, Survival, where you see how long it takes you to die. The first three modes even have more difficulty options within them, so you really get to pick what type of game you want to play.-  The fact that this is only Early AccessThis game feels full, alive (or, uh, undead?), and pretty complet minus some bugs here or there. The fact that this game will only get better is really exciting! Cons - Melee/ selection dificultiesBy no means rendering the game unplayable, but melee is always the way I go. This could just be my game, but I occasionally have issues with fighting zombies. I'll be aimed right on them, but whatever weapon I'm beating them with will move right through them. Moving around a bit usually helps this, but it can be an ocasional annoyance.-  Cooking is burdensome Not something that is super problematic, but still worth mentioning. Some players have found cooking to be a hit and miss problem without the help of the wikia or other guides. Recipes, unless you know them, can leave you confused on what you can and can't cook. Yeah, you can make soup. But, no, you can't make bowls of cereal and milk (which I know from my own tragic expirience). Conclusion or tl;dr The problems in Project Zomboid are very minimal, and are not enough to turn a player away from the game. What you get with this a really fun game that you can play for hours on end. Whether you want to build a fort, or leech off existing houses, live in a Zombie-filled city, or a blank country side, you're in charge of your own tragic and inevitable death.It's fifteen bucks of sign-me-the-♥♥♥♥-up. If you wanna see how you'd fair in the zombie apocalypse, here's your game Pluss the mascot is a raccoon. A cute raccoon. Who doesn't love trash pandas?  ",8,17,0,8,5,0,0

It's been in EA for very long but one of what should've been a very important and prioritised feature is still not implemented. When viewed in perspective of the amount of time in development, it is rather difficult to justify.Doubtlessly, it is fun in it's depressing, terrifying and lonely way, as evidenced by the number of hours I've sunk into it. But ultimately, what should've been finished, or at least, out of EA by now, still isn't.Wait for the game to finish before buying. Unless you just want to hoard loot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Find out shortly afterwards that chopping down the trees was unecessary.Revel in the wonders of modern engineering, learning to truly appreciate a fridge and a faucet.Revil in the absence of modern engineering, learning to prioritize canned goods and to farm, fish and hunt.Wander around your safe house, organizing things with your friends whilst shirtless in a homoerotic episode of hoarders.Level up your character for hours, making them faster, stronger and more versatile.Level up your patience when you forget to check a corner and get bitten, and slowly come to terms with the inevitable.Remember to remove your pants before death.

								There are many things I love and hate about this game.Allow me to start off with the things I love.New and fresh concept.interesting gameplay.sharp controls .simplicityNow the things I hate.limited features.limited items.limited weapons.lack of more advanced options.no access to the steam workshop.clipping issues.layer issuesIt is a very good game concepts but provided me with little to do. I started up the game and was greated by a mess of tabs and menus. After sorting it out I began to play the game with default features. I immediatley found the things I needed for the rest of my playthrough. 67 canned soup and beans, a plethora of weapons and ammo, all the medical supplies that I could find, a saw and hammer with 9 boxes of nails, and a large hiking bag I found on a corpse. I was all set. I found a storage warehouse and barricaded every window and a perimeter fence around the 20 block area of it. I made a large farm that provides me with more tomatoes and potatoes I can eat. I wound up forgetting about the zombies for day 22-34 and was shocked to see a shambler inside of a zippos pizzarea. I was almost longing for a  way to attract the snackers, walkers, biters, ect to my base.The over all experience was so-so. I have high hopes for this game in the future. hopefully I wont have to settle on burning houses with dead rats in the oven.			",53,6,0,2,13,0,8

								If 'Dayz in 2D' appeals to you, play this.  If it doesn't, then play DayZ.  Or don't, and save those hundreds of wasted hours to court a lovely man or woman with a good body and an excellent personality, date them for three years, slowly wean yourself off of the drinking and the anti-depressants, finally forgetting about Fallujah, marying them and having two beautiful blonde daughters with them who are difficult little rascals, but smart and loving, and enjoying your life as you slowly drift into middle age with your partner, your eldest daughter becoming addicting to drugs and becoming a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while the other gets a scholarship to Yale and comes to visit once a month, always smiling and looking happy, though you can see in the reflection of her eyes the same depraved loneliness that's slowly come back to you, as you remember, you remember the blood and the death and that girl that Frank accidentally shot into the dirt, which causes the drinking to come back and then the pills, and then your marriage falls apart, and you don't speak to your daughters anymore, and you die, alone, and unloved, just as you were born, forgotten within the decade.Anyway, it's pretty good.

								At first glance this game looks relatively simplistic, a simple art style in a sandbox zombie game. But this game has incredible depth. Managing your various states whether you are hungry or thirsty, in a state of panic or anger, wet or overheated, encumbered, sleepy, sick and much much more.This game is tough, the procedural generation makes each play through unique and can be your best friend or your worst enemy. You might load into a house with an axe and a pistol or you could be heading out armed with a spoon or fork and this is what makes this game great.Each game feels like a real survivors story, you are not a hero, you are just trying to stay alive as long as you can before meeting your untimely demise.I am excited for future development of this game and the new features promised look to improve this great game even further. As for the bad, my only current complaint is the multiplayer system. Hosting a server is a nightmare to do and a server tool or using steam would greatly improve this issue aside from that I am enjoying the game and hope they create a better multiplayer option soon.

								Found an abandoned house in the forest after marching through the rain for what seemed like hours. The warmth of the fire from the stone helped me calm my nerves as the moans of the undead could be heard not far from where I was. I checked the cabinets for food. No luck. I checked the fridge. Nothing. There had to be something in this place. If the dead didn't get to me, starvation would. Finally, after searching the entire house, I found a bag of chips underneath the couch in the living room. They were the best stale chips I've had in what felt like days. For the very first time, I felt like everything was going to be alright, until I noticed the curtains in the living room window were still open, and the undead had spotted me. Their moans attracted more of them as they began to surround the house, smashing through the windows. Me, with my trust crowbar ran into the bathroom, fearing that this was the end. I closed the door behind me and frankly searched for a way out. Panic settled in as the realization that I had no way out with the undead banging at the bathroom door sank in.I didn't survive 20 minutes after starting the game. 10 out of 10.For a game that's only in Early Access and has come this far makes me proud to play it. This is truly what an Early Access release should look like. It can only go up from here.			",33,5,3,9,11,0,21

								This game is pretty awesome.I bought this game after i've seen some gameplay of it and i got hooked right away. Don't let the not-so-good graphics fool u, because even though this game is currently an early access game, u can still do veeery, very much in this game. U can build your own house, harvest your own plants, there is always something for you to do.Sure, there are some bugs, but i have played this game for quite a while and never came across a bug that couldn't be solved with simply restarting the game.Also, this is one of the games that takes Zombies ""seriously"" in a sense that you can have awesome gear and awesome loot, it still only takes a scratch or a bite to turn you into a Zombie, which basically means that you'r gonna be game over soon.If you like difficult, but fun survival games, you should definitely give this game a try.And on another note, this game has one of the best communities you can imagine and it is easy to get ahold of the developers, as well.

								From all the zombie survival games I have ever played, this one hits most aspects I hoped for the genre. The goal of the game is simple, you must get from being a survivor to a rebuilder of a one-man society. You are on a time limit as the utilities will soon shut down within weeks, so you must quickly locate your pernament base and fortify it, then start building a garden and several rain catcher barrels to produce food and water. Melee weapons are more important than firearms, and fire can cause a little more destruction than necessary. The zombies, of course, can see, hear, and smell you, so cover up the windows and stick to the shadows and downwind to avoid detection. Remember that a single bite or scratch, even if it is disinfected and bandaged, will strike you ill and kill you no matter what, so don't be cocky and decide to take on an entire herd unless you have a stronghold to take shelter for your dramatic final stand.The goal for me is always the same. Once the game is started, I quickly go out and search for a suitable shelter or stay in the one I have spawned in. Then I shelter-in-place, you know, cover up all the windows and such. I take inventory of my food, then one everything is situated, I go out into the industrial areas of the map to locate three things: An axe, a saw, a hammer, and lots of nails. The idea is to get an axe to chop down the many confiers that grow in the game world, then use the saw to turn them into wooden planks, then use those planks to build walls, doors, and all sorts of useful furniture to hold your important gear. Once the structure of the base is established, I started fixing up a garden. Sometimes I have to move dirt around, usually up on the roof where I don't have to worry about zombies trampling on my crops. I also build my kitchen outdoors, using a campfire as a stove. With the power and water lines being finite resources, it is imperative to get your self-sufficient base established as soon as possible.If you are wondering there are vehicles in this game, then the answer is no, there is no planes, trains, and automobiles in Project Zomboid. Your own two feet is your way in moving around the map. Due to the nature of the game engine, I do not expect to find vehicles in this game anytime soon.			",10,6,0,2,8,0,2

								If you're tired of the tag ""Survival"" on Games not living up to their definition, look no more. This is a survival game in the truest definition of the word. With the settings on singleplayer you're able to hone the game exactly to your liking from zombie density to loot rarity all the way down to infection mortality time. A really deep (yet not very upfront) crafting system, a pretty solid building system with other nice features such as cooking recipes (found a frying pan? have some steak and some vegetables? how about a stirfry to raise your mood and get rid of that boredom)The character system is a nice break down as well, you can see exactly where you're injured and take action directly from there whether it be switching bandages, or applying disinfectant directly to a wound. The dev's really take into consideration what the players are suggesting and try to implement ideas the best as possible, it's truly what an early access game should be.There are flaws though, an awkward camera and movement system that takes some getting used to, there's very few tooltips to explain what items can be used for. The game is not very user friendly, you have to do quite a bit of researching either on the Wiki or by trial-and-error, but all in all... it's a real solid early access and besides The Long Dark one of the only TRUE survival games out there.UPDATE: June 2015The expiremental branch is really coming along and the devs continue to deliver on their promises, still one of (if not the) best early access games on Steam.TL:DR -- Very deep survival game, camera takes some getting used to, highly recommended.

								Brilliant zombie game. Blends survival, (real survival) action, simulation, RPG mechanics and of course, zombies. While the zombie genre has been over used to death, (just like that pun) this game really brings something fresh. The greatest aspect is the certainty that you WILL DIE. The real question is when. GraphicsThe graphics are pleasing for me, the style mixes really well and nothing ever sticks out of place except bugs in the art and lighting. The developers are costantly working on this though.MapThe map is set out realisticly and has many locations including lumber yards, farms, wilderness, houses, shops, motels, and more. It is important to mention here that the world is NOT procedurally generated. I think this is good because it makes the world feel far more real and considering how big the developers plan the world to be - it's not going to be a problem.GameplayIf you love survival games, this game will be perfect for you. You can play heaps of different ways and even allows for the ""run and gun"" tactics which will definitly lead to an untimely end. The developers do stress that if you want to survive long term, you must stay down, sneak around zombies and avoid running - for one scratch could mean zombification. You must keep healthy, scavenge supplies, eat, drink, craft, explore, barricade and heaps more. Keep in mind these are slow zombies, and is tailored for a Romero audience. While you can play sandbox mode and set the zombies to sprinters, this is extremley challenging due to all the other factors you have to survive too,PlannedThere are many planned features, including multiplayer, vehicles, an even larger map, hunting and far far more. I suggest you check the forums for planned features.GripesThe only major gripes I have with this game in its current state is the occasional graphical glitches which can really take you out of the game. Another gripe is the UI glitches. They have recently given their UI an overhaul, and while the new inventory system is amazing, some of the pop up menu's look glitchy.VerdictThis game has the potential to be incredible, even in its current state I could sink hours into it (and have), my lack of game time on my profile is due to me backing this game back in 2011 and I have played many hours of the non-steam version. So, if you love survival zombie games and have a solid zombie apocalypse plan that you want to put into action, this is the game for you.			",182,29,5,28,36,1,38

Early Access Review
								Игру заприметил еще на старте разработки. Подкупающей была тематика (ещё не заезженная на тот момент), пиксель-арт и, конечно же – изометрия. На данный момент это стильный и действительно интересный симулятор выживания на фоне зомби-апокалипсиса. И вовсе не только лишь потому, что изометрия и пиксельная графика. Игра обладает определенным шармом и без этого. Хотя бы на уровне своих возможностей. Будучи небольшой по размерам и миниатюрной в исполнении, игра оставляет за собой многие новинки из Early Access (далее по тексту EA).В большинстве игр подобной тематики вы оказываетесь в декорациях, которые служат подстилкой для массированного PVP, где, в общем и целом, кроме него заниматься нечем. Мало кто прорабатывает «изнанку мира» (англ. background). В PZ подноготная рядом. Есть два небольших городка где-то в американской глубинке, фермы, поселки и леса. Существует даже карта на манер Google-карт созданная каким-то умельцем. Она позволят оценить размах умирающего мира. Здесь умирает всё, в том числе и вы. Это история где рано или поздно будет поставлена трагическая точка. За регулярными вылазками в город в поисках медикаментов, продуктов и необходимых для выживания вещей (да-да, даже медицинскому пинцету найдется здесь дело) вы краем глаза замечаете, что и город меняется. Происходит отключение от глобальной системы энергоснабжения, постепенно прекращает свою работу трубопровод, подававший в населенные пункты воду. Еда в холодильниках портиться, и вы уже вряд ли сможете порадоваться хорошо прожаренной отбивной. Города подвергаются армейской зачистке, не сулящей вам ничего хорошего, да и ходячих с каждым днем становится всё больше. Если совместить естественное умирание города с набегами других выживших, то картинка порой становится и вовсе унылой. Вместо богатства, ожидающего мародера посетившего брошенное место, вам часто приходиться довольствоваться каким-то мелочами. Нож для масла в качестве оружия, женская блузка вместо свитера, мусорный пакет или школьный ранец вместо хорошей сумки. собранный вручную топор, что развалится после нескольких ударов. Аутентичность на этом не заканчивается - забудете выключить газ на кухне (пока он еще остался в баллонах) и ваш дом превратиться в пепелище. С тех пор как появился мультиплеер игра ещё больше расцвела. Помимо PVP серверов существуют PVE сервера и даже «ролевые». Попав туда, вы придерживаетесь канвы повествования. Вы больше не Ваня или Джон зашедшие покрошить других игроков. Теперь вы вполне реальный персонаж, переговаривающийся с другими выжившими по радио, помогающий другим выжить. Отыгрыш сбивает людей в группы, чтобы противостоять ходячим вместе. Богатство игровых ситуаций описать трудно. Ровно как и богатство способов умереть.Разбил окно, полез в закрытый дом, разодрался в кровь влезая в него, впоследствии умер от заражения. Отравился плохой едой, отлеживался в каком-то доме, оказался в осаде - умер, будучи съеденным, заживо. Попал в засаду, был ранен, убежал, нашел какой-то дом полный алкоголя. Долго пил и радовался жизни. Выздоровел. Вышел наружу и столкнулся с ордой. Долго удирал от нее, забаррикадировался в каком-то отеле, затем спрыгнул с крыши второго этажа, сломал бедро, отполз в местный туалет и там умер. Всё это проза PZ дня. А ведь есть романы, поэзия. Всё это у вас будет, и каждый ваш опыт от игровой сессии будет разным.Хотите быть фермером и уйти от этого кошмара – это возможно. Хотите быть скавенджером и войти в историю маленького мира как лучший сборщик всякой всячины – не воспрещается. Хотите стать торгашом, по прозвищу Консерва-Боб, собрав всевозможные консервы и затем устроить магазин – да пожалуйста.  Хотите прослыть самым жестоким «убийцей на западе» доступно и это. Вы можете быть кем угодно, и прожить свой конец как угодно. Какой путь вы бы не выбрали - он будет оригинальным. Вас может погубить что угодно. К примеру, осколки стекла, застрявшие в руке, когда вы разбили стекло очередного дома. Спасти вас, впрочем, тоже может что угодно. Меня спасли грибы и дождевые черви. Серьезно. Их тоже можно есть. Правда от такой пищи наступает депрессия.Определенно – маленькая жемчужина, которая со временем станет настоящим жемчужным ожерельем или колье. Не поддержать такую игру будет неверным решением. Сейчас она, до сих пор в EA, до сих пор развивается, до сих пор дарит каждой своей сессией что-то новое.			",695,212,20,120,77,3,93

								Pointlessly detailed simulation that prioritises emulating the boring minutiae of life over having fun.Got a new bag? Great! In most games you'd equip it with one click and your inventory would be expanded. In Project Zomboid you need to unequip the old bag, equip the new bag, put the old bag on the ground, loot the old bag, and have all the contents be transferred across one by one.The goal is realism, but much of the game is just frustrating rather than realistic. What exactly do game developers think tools and weapons are made of? Play-Doh? I think in real life you could poke more than five zombies with a kitchen knife before it broke. There has never been a game that weapon degradation has made better.			",124,27,0,10,8,1,11

								Sure, I've played 855 hours over the course of at least 2 years. Don't let that number sell you on the game. Every single run I've ever done always ends in some stupid random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that can't be negotiated by skill or luck. You're just infected, dead, and you get frustrated. Even with mods giving me the ability to wear armor I still run into terrible game mechanics that kill me every time. Zombies get stuck on doors even when you're yelling at them for one. Finally, this game will never have NPCs like it should have months ago. Can't recomend it like it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Once upon a time this was a wonderful game. You'd spawn in a random house in a huge map, scavenge the immediate area, spend a few in game months building a giant fortified compound before eventually getting bored, and then close out a wonderful experience with a glorious firearm rampage through the town center.The last few updates took the wind out of the sails. Carpentry skills were rebalanced in such a way that fortified compound building requires the player to grind out way more walls and barricades than any decent sized compound would need just to build up the skill to put a scavenged door in. Game difficulty is either face rollingly easy or wake up to a sea of zombies on your porch every morning annoying with no sweet spot.Firearms aren't fun and don't even function as a panic button. Accuracy sucks at low levels and takes ages to skill up, shotguns can only take out 3 zombies max and that's only likely when firing into a huge crowd, and each shot fired will bring in zombies crazy quick and from long distances. Any situation where discharging a firearm seems like a good idea is a situation already lost.Cars and NPCs will supposedly be implemented at some point (when they're done!) But for now, it just seems as if the game is being balanced for features that don't exist yet and it's not as fun as it once was.			",146,37,1,47,28,3,34

								Created a character which to me looked very good for a survival... His only flaw was that he is deaf... He was a war veteran so he lost his hearings there perhaps... He was very lucky tho...Day 1: Ive found sheets and clothing which i riped into bandages that will come in handy. Found food, water, tools and even some books and weapons to keep me safe. I thought i was safe. Day 2: Ive scavenged some houses just across the street. During my scavanging i let my guard down and got suprised by three zombies but thanks to my bat i was able to defend myself. I was bleeding but thankfuly it was just a scratch (""Tis but a scratch!"") and thanks to my preparations i was ready for this and immadiately bandaged myself and i was able to keep the injury clean.Day 3: Ive found a store! It had lots of fresh food in it!Day 4: Ive found another big house. ""why not check it out?"" i said to myself confidently. It seemed abandoned... No zombies in sight. ""great!"" i thought to myself. But it wasnt abandoned... As soon as i let my guard down i got attacked. I was able to defend myself... But it was too late... I got bitten... ""oh no please god no!""... I didnt want to get turned into one of them... I tried looking for bleach to end it but there was no luck... I remembered i have some bottles of alcohol in my fridge... On my way home i started feeling very sick... I was certain im infected. I got home and drank all the bottles of alcohol... I was very drunk and then... I died. 10/10 would turn into drunk zombie again.Here is also a video on how to survive simply because i can and i want that youtube cash

Early Access Review
								A real solid survival game that unfortunately ends up falling a bit short due to the huge and arguably broken random factor. Surviving your first couple of days is easy since food is borderline abundant in every house along with water being a common commodity at every tap, toilet and bathtub. Eventually, however, these resources will dwindle, not only by the human consumption but due to the basic services shutting down.Electricity and the Waterworks will abruptly be cut off after some time, leaving any fridge-dependant foods to be almost instantly spoiled, leaving you very dependant on rare canned foods, chips and other conserverd commodities which will run out real fast depending on your character. ""Just create a farm!"" you say? Fantastic Idea! Just one flaw: You need to find a shovel/trowel and plant seeds. While seeds are rather common, trowel/shovels are not. I have spent countless of hours, killing hundreds of zombies to clear out a big piece of farm-land just to spend even more time searching dumbly for seemingly common tools In order to have any kind of chance to survive. And even then, surviving for any seriously long amount of time won't be possible because your sources of water will run dry faster than you can say ""Kebab"" as any and all plantations require gigantic sources of water that will need to be hauled back and forth by you, consuming very large amounts of time for little to no actual food seeing how the watering of plants doesn't last for more than half a day or so.But that Isn't even your biggest issue. The method of getting these supplies of water will be unavailable eventually as the city's water works off will turn off. ""Just go to a lake!"" you say? Nope. No lakes, no rivers and no oceans. Only the very rare 1-2 wells per map which are waaaay outside the actual playing zone/spawn and the only real other way to create a sustainable, although random way of water income is to create rain collection barrels. You'll need Nails, a hammer, a garbage plastic bag and some planks for that.Doesn't sound too bad, right? Wrong. To create planks, you need wooden logs. To create wooden logs, you need to chop down trees... Which you essentially need an Axe for. An even moreso rare item than Trowels and nowhere does this get more annoying than when you search through countless workshops in hope for an axe and Instead get a Saw! ""Cut down trees with that""! You say? Nope. Can't do that. You NEED an axe to produce any significant quantities, which comedically enough, has an ingame model of a fireaxe out of all things. No common house-hold hatchets, no making your own improvised axe, no machete or other blunt cutting weapons. You need. An Axe. To produce ANY significant amount of logs. Sure, you can get a good laugh and chop down trees by using a fork If you want to humiliate the already embarassingly stupid sense of logic programmed by the devs but that will take over 200 swings (literally and figuratively slapping a wet blanket up against a tree) but If you're playing said survival game with the promise of It being realistic, it better damn iron out the assigning of item usages and a more realistic loot palette, preferrably designed by someone who doesn't live on an deserted island in the pacific.And as I also described earlier, In one of my playthroughs, I cleared out a huge farmland that had a gigantic harvest of Wheat/Corn in the middle of it, which I couldn't pick. No big deal there, would have been overpowered. Now what I did get frustrated on was another smaller piece of farm land, with fences around it and the ground already being dug up neatly. I cleared the remaining zombies before i eagerly grabbed my seeds and the dozens of water-filled Gardening Spray Cans I found earlier in Workshops/storages and ran out in the dug-up mounds of dirt, standing there like an idiot for minutes on end, trying to figure out just how the game wanted me to put my seeds into the ground before trying all possible combinations, visiting the game wiki and getting a big ""F*ck you"" finger up in my face on how you NEED a TROWEL/SHOVEL to drop seeds from your hands and into the loose dirt.Adding on a 25+ digit of the previously 40+ houses I searched before reaching the farm, I still ended up with not finding an axe. Not finding a trowel. Not finding a shovel. Nothing. Just more nails, some glue, duct tape and a saw, endlessly taunting me In the face on just what I could have done at my small farmstead in the forest at this point Instead of running around like a complete and utter jackass, struggling to find a specific bent piece of metal so I can put down some seeds on an already processed piece of soil Instead of using my hands, other tools such as hammers that have plowing capacities with the tail, a shoe, an empty soup can, a spoon or my hands. But no, that wouldn't be according to the game logic of this ""Simulator"". Simply put, If you run to a nearby Workshop and don't get a Shovel/Trowel, a Fireaxe and a Saw, your playthrough already has been signed It's death warrant by none other than the developers.And as I said, Project Zomboid is by all means, a solid game that I also happen to enjoy much personally. but If you look at the on-going 3-4+ years of development time and the current state It is in, one is fair to call it a pile of f*cking rubbish as mods made by lone people in their spare time develop features into this game so much faster than a team of 6 (discluding dozens of associates) fully paid professionals, It's downright frikking embarassing, especially considering the game Is not even 3d, so as of right now, I will unfortunately recommend everyone to avoid this title right now until the developers take the energy they do on advertising updates or explaining why they screwed up on delivering these updates in time and put that effort into making said, promised updates.I would however, recommend to buy It on a sale.UPDATE: The developers have gone out of their way to fùck the reputation of this title up even more by spending MASSIVE amounts of manpower to integrate user mods into the base game. Yes, that's right. This company that has now been slamming a hammer non-stop for 5+ years on this game has now resorted to spending company time to do less of the sorely needed actual development on the game to force-feed it user made modifications that ANYONE could use at ANY TIME with ANY VERSION of the game OUT OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL prior to this. And to make matters even worse, they have also gone out of their way to start quoting positive Steam user reviews on the store page and have the actual review be consistent of ""lol gud geym ei playd a bunhc 10/10 xd"" and rightfully so, the reviews they linked have about 25% out of 100% user approval for being retárded.And of course as I recommended to get this game on a sale following my negative review of the game, there has been next to none of them from what I can only presume is only an act of good old fashioned cócky greed at the devs end as Steam now allows any studio to instantly put their products on sale, leaving no marketing excuse as to why not.Avoid this turd like the plague.

								This game is the premier zombie simulator. You'll see a lot of people giving downvotes because of the development length. Or because of ""no cars no NPC's""... but sorry guys, those are the most complicated features, and the entire team is not capable of working on them, so they will be the last to come. The game has around 11 devs, and their content output has been consistant. Once you get used to the controls of this game, it will be the most authentic feeling zombie simulator out there. You'll do supply runs, you'll be scared as hordes get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you'll struggle to figure out how to cure all the medical problems that can arise in this game. Highly reccomeneded for those that want a deep experience.			",70,11,0,7,6,0,24

Delivers the feel of dread, isolation and urgency that should go with a zombie apocalypse survival game.

This game even in it's current state is well worth the money in my opinion. The inventory system is a little funky and hard to get used to but it has gotten better over time but that's my biggest complaint about the game ..also to add you WILL DIE IN THIS GAME so if you get mad at dying this game is not for you. But its a survival game its not suppose to be easy!			",104,9,0,13,10,0,21

								UPDATE!Well They have added so much more content since I reviewed this we even have Multiplayer! (like Minecraft with dedicated servers but none the less multiplayer!) I'd like to see NPC's soon so I'll be happy when we get other survivors... as for now though.. New Rating - 10/10 YAY! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I once said after spending so much money on Zombie Games and getting no fun that I would never buy a zombie game again, that my zombie game was not out there and no one would probably develop a full hardcore survival game based around zombies... I was wrongI first played this about 2 years ago maybe even 3 and it was on an odd little website inthe dark reaches of the internet and al lthat was available was a linear tutorial. I had to make certain choices during said tutorial to see how long I could survive... naturally I murdered my GF in cold blood as she could not fight back due to I Think a broken leg but I'm not sure... I finally died when I set house on fire cooking (yes that can happen!) After seeing this pop up on steam I decided to give it a buy.. I mean the tutorial was worth it even if I HATE Linear games and well I was pleasantly surprised. The game now has 3 modes including Sandbox where you can choose every single option including what type of zombies you want... naturally I wen't for classic.I survived for a whole hour and that's when I shut it off... I moved on to a mode that was not ulike COD zombies but built within the Project Zomboid engine... it played out very much like the horde mode on Gears of War and it was something I enjoyed most as it allowed me to paly it for 10 minutes at a time!If you are looking for a true action Zomibe survival game then buy this now! I'm giving it a 9/10 but only because its still in development...I'll be sure to upgrade that later on should they turn it into something spectacular.I'm also hoping for Multiplayer soon... Co-Op would be a nice feature and one that would work on so many levels!			",148,20,3,26,56,0,20

								Project Zomboid is one of those games that have great potential. The community of the game is great and the developers are very active. I have been following this game for a very long time now. I believe I bought this game in 2011 before it came out via Early Access on Steam. Every Monday the Developers update their blog telling us what's new in their development and sometimes showing us videos of what's new. Anyways, down to the gameplay. Now obviously, this game is in Early Access. But, some bugs are quite hard to find in the stable branch. So the game is very much playable. When you first start out playing this game you will probably die much faster than veteran players(unless you're me). But, after awhile you will learn how things work and be able to build a safehouse and even have yourself an efficient farm without having much fear of the zeds trying to kill you. There is also multiplayer! Sadly though, the multiplayer is a bit buggy in a few ways(mostly the zeds). But it is very much playable.Project Zomboid is a very good game even being Early Access. The developers are active and the community is great. There is much planned for it, and it definitely deserves the try.			",93,5,1,12,11,1,12

								Its a geat game with a brilliant community and a excellent dev team. This game is one of my favourite games of all time. But what does PZ bring to the table? PZ brings a fun yet dramatic system into the game where as if you die. You DIE. No second chances. You are dead. This in itself is pretty upsetting when you create a character who has live maybe a year in game (If you can make it that far) and dies like a hero. It has a fairly decent multiplayer which I do not recommend playing until maybe a patch but is up to you. And has a GREAT art style (I'm a sucka for pixles.)So should you get PZ? Yes. It is what other zombie games want to be and is ever improving.This is a zombie game even for the most hardcore.			",92,7,0,7,5,0,10

								NOTE: This is a review I wrote for an Australian computer and technology forum, figured I would post it on here as well, as I think extremely highly of this game. This review isn't exactly written in the style of your standard steam reviews, but it outlines some of the gameplay mechanics and other things in that game make it one of the more enjoyable titles around at the moment, due in part to the multiplayer that is now part of the game.Over the last several years, I've eagerly been watching this game grow and evolve, once in a while I would download the latest build and test it out. Everything was very promising. Here I had a game that offered a True Zombie Apocalypse ""Simulator"", a game where there is no real goal other than to survive, this was well before games like Day Z started popping up too.Project Zomboid is much different however, first of all the game uses an isometric viewing angle, secondly it tries to ""simulate"" everything. From cooking, to building to reading books. There are literally hundreds of different items in the game, majority of them have a use. Canned soup can be consumed, but only if you have a can opener, access to a fire or stove and a pot to cook it in. Books can be read to increase your skills in things like fishing, carpentry or farming. All of this takes ""time"" to do. Your character can be affected by dozens of different things, go out in the rain, you get wet, stay wet for too long, you can get sick. If you're wet, you can change your clothes or dry off with a towel. If you get sick, you can find painkillers and other meds to help you get over it. Get scared by too many zombies and cant find any survivors and your character can start to become panicky and depressed. This is just scratching the surface of what can be done in the game though. The world is persistent, this means you can barricade houses, as long as you have a hammer, nails and some planks, you can cover open windows with sheets so the Zs cant see you inside. Weapons can be repaired with things like Duct Tape or glue, weapons can be modified (not sure how many at this stage have mods) ie. getting a baseball bat and hammering some nails to make it a ""nailed baseball bat"". You can build doors, doorframes, walls, floors, stairs etc. and essentially build your own fortress, or connect several houses together with wooden walls being used as passageways, so you are safe from the Zs when going between houses. The Zs themselves are quite cool as well, if you play Sandbox or multiplayer mode, you are able to change several different things about the zombies to make them easier or harder, this allows you to customise the Zs to be similar to the ones from your favourite movies (fast, slow, blind/deaf etc) Zombies also give chase, depending on their memory settings, you can lose them just by getting a certain distance away, or you may have to lead them on a merry chase through houses and the bush to make them lose your scent and successfully escape. Combat is fairly standard, however it works great is very satisfying if you get your timing right. There are guns in the game, but majority of the time you will opt for melee weapons, guns will attract zombies, to the point where you can inadvertently attract a horde of 30+ zombies. It makes for some great gameplay and very tense moments. On top of all of this, the game now has multiplayer, at the moment it is join by IP only, so no proper server browser, but once you make/find a server to play in, you will find that the world is persistent, items don't respawn, neither do zombies, zombies will often wander around and may eventually occupying an area that you have previously cleared, but overall this means you can essentially clear out an area and be safe from Zombie Hordes, as they won't respawn once you kill them. This all comes together to create the most enjoyable Co-op experience I have had in as long as I can remember. For $15 on steam, I cannot recommend this game enough. If you still love zombie games, you may find that despite how the game is presented (look at it on the steam store, first reaction is usually that it graphically looks quite dated) it is one of the most feature rich and amazing Zombie Survival games on the market. There is far more that I could list about this great game, but I suggest if it sounds interesting enough from my explanation above, take the plunge and see how you like it. There is also a demo available  which is still quite indicative of what you can expect should you decide to purchase the full game. Seriously guys, get on it.			",420,73,32,39,48,3,30

Early Access Review
								I've bought this game back when it was in Pre-Alpha, and even back then I didn't regret buying, even though back then there was hardly anything to do. But hell, I loved the game back then, and I still do, if it comes to any zombie survival games - this is it. None other game recreates such tactical thinking, such fear of dying as this game does, every step you make you think about the consequences, you think about where you should set your base, and what to do to protect it best, but what made this game even better was for me was the addition of MP, I've waited since alpha for the game to have Multiplayer added to the game, and I always felt like it would change the game completely, and hell, it did. Multiplayer, especially with friends, added this serious survival feel I didn't feel ever before in a game, not in DayZ, nor Rust, nor any multiplayer survival game. You care for your friend in-game, you don't want them to get injured, or worse - bitten, but you also don't want them standing, doing nothing. As a good example, I'd like to share this survivor's story:We all assigned roles to what we'll do, one would take care of the food, another would secure the area of zombies, every once in a while we'd send out people to look for supplies, it was amazing, however, while we grew bigger, we needed better supplies, as well as some shotguns, so we decided to go to West Point, we left our home behind, hoping that we'd come back to it still being in shape...Well, at least most of it.  On the way there one of our friend's condition was getting worse - if we wouldn't find medication, he probably wouldn't make it. On the way there, we tactically dealt with zombies, or sneaked through them,  when the odds were too high, I'd fire a couple of rounds to distract a crowd of zombies, we'd get supplies at a drive-by diner and kept going, but unless we hurried - our friend wasn't going to make it, and sadly, he didn't, and it meant more than in any game, and that, is what I'd call a true survival experience. You cared that your friend died, with that one less man, not only do your possibilities go down, but so do your chances go down, every bullet you take, took and will take will make an impact, and a brilliant idea done poorly will cause the death of your team, and this is what I love about the game. While playing it, I felt like I was in some weird mix between The Last Of Us, The Walking Dead and something like Fallout, as amazing as it might be...However, I really think that there should be more of a 'leveling' system, since, even though you do have a bunch of skills to level, if you die, you quickly shake it off, I hope that the devs add something that would make you more attached to your character than you are now.Project Zomboid is packed with features and things to do and a lot of places to go to, there are a ton of items, and a ton of items to craft, but some currently don't have any use, as mentioned, this game is still fairly early in the development, some features that aren't in the game may be fairly important to survival, for example, a generator, that you'll need to get electricity from when the power runs out, luckily water barrels are buildable, so you won't dehydrate when you run out of water. But those are some things to keep in mind.The game is very stable right now, there are a few bugs, which is to be expected, considering the game isn't finished, but I'd recommend this game to anyway, since this game is made purely from passion and talent, and it has to be one of my favourite survival singleplayer games, and one of the best (if not the best) of survival multiplayer games, and it ain't even finished yet!

								Its a geat game with a brilliant community and a excellent dev team. This game is one of my favourite games of all time. But what does PZ bring to the table? PZ brings a fun yet dramatic system into the game where as if you die. You DIE. No second chances. You are dead. This in itself is pretty upsetting when you create a character who has live maybe a year in game (If you can make it that far) and dies like a hero. It has a fairly decent multiplayer which I do not recommend playing until maybe a patch but is up to you. And has a GREAT art style (I'm a sucka for pixles.)So should you get PZ? Yes. It is what other zombie games want to be and is ever improving.This is a zombie game even for the most hardcore.			",92,7,0,7,5,0,10

								Excellent game with tons of replayability. 10/10It has a bit of a learning curve, but after your first few deaths you should be able to make it to about 2 weeks of survival and grow from there. Once you learn how to survive you will feel pretty devastated when you inevitably die due to the amount of time and care that is invested in your character.NPCs are planned to be released in the future and that will really bring the game together.The Dev Team is the best I've had experience with. They are very active on their forums at theindiestone.com and interact with the members there. More importantly they listen to what the community has to say and make adjustments to the game based off that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Project Zomboid is more of a simulation than a game. Perhaps it's supposed to be? For me, there are far too many components and you spend half your time sorting your inventory so as not to be overburdened. The other half of your time is spent reading books, and picking items off the floor which you accidentally dropped. Picking up 50 seeds one by one from the ground is not my idea of good gameplay. And what is this obsession in new games with degrading weapons? It's never been a fun idea to have your favourite weapon stop working. I don't think the ""line of sight"" rule works when you have a 3rd person game, especially in multiplayer where your mate will disappear if behind you. Yes, you can't see what's behind you in real life, but you can be aware.This game/simulation feels like a chore, which is disappointing, given how good the premise is.Oh and it needs cars.

								Honestly, I originally found this game quite bland. My fondest memory was spawning in the house, finding and drinking bleach, walking out of the house and then falling over dead. I didn't play it too much after that.BUT, they recently unleashed online test to the public, at which point my friend immediately set up a server for us and we were away on our adventure. As I am typing this, we have been playing for a solid 3 hours, many notable moments being burning down several houses, barricaded a warehouse, and having friends go out scavenging for supplies while I cooked at home. This is the game that many zombie survival games tried to be (Such as DayZ, which contrary to popular belief was developed long after this game was started). This game gets all of the feels that a zombie survival game should. Instead of immediately searching for weapons to kill zombies with, you always have thoughts in the back of your head as to: Will we have enough food? Will we have time to cook some good food to keep everyone from getting depressed? Did I turn the stove off?While playing, our favorite thought was having a server that would be able to run 200 players at the same time. Think of the communities that would start with the fact that you can build walls and even houses from scratch, and with the proper tools you can tear down other houses for supplies. Needless to say, I have never been more excited for the future of a single game until now. I feel that anyone who likes tense survival with friends should play this game. This game is, as all 4 of us agreed, is DayZ done right.TL:DR DayZ but not rushed, with similar ideas of Fallout and The Sims.			",406,67,16,46,53,4,55

								I have played this game offline for over 100 hours. Listen, all these zombie games do something right. Zomboid, does a lot of things right, but if they aren't what you're looking for, you may not like this game.This game Is NOT a FPS death match with enough gun types to overthrow a small slavic nation. This is a game about a random, everyday Kentuckian that got caught up in the zombie appocolypse. If you like zombies and you like serious, intense survival, this game is for you.As it is right now, this game offers challenges that will frustrate you and keep you on your toes. There is the threat of Zombie Hordes, sickness, starvation and making that one freaking mistake that makes you start over. Play this game if you want a true challenge and actually feel like you accomplished something when you survive a few months. But what really makes this game worth buying is the potential it has.The map is already huge and they are going to make it even bigger. They are going to add Metro Louisville into the game map which will be incredible.The crafting system keeps getting better and they are adding more and more customization.NPCs and Cars are coming at some point and will take this game to cult-classic type levels on par with Crusader Kings 2 but for zombies. Buy this game. Be patient. Learn2Play and enjoy! Even if you buy it now and wait till NPCs come out, it will be worth it. Potentially one of the greatest games in it's niche even as it stands now.

								I very much recommend this game for anyone who:a) Likes tense, realistic zombie games;b) Wants a game that feels more like a movie (i.e. Dawn of the Dead) than dynasty warriors (i.e. Dead Rising);c) Doesn't mind a game being unpolished (e.g. currently no NPCs in the build I am playing).The game is extremely compelling, even if a little thin on the ground for content.  You must grit your teeth and carve out some space for your character to call 'home'.  Barricade the doors, shut the curtains, create a sheet rope to access the second floor window.  Then get building your perimeter wall and planting your crops.  Don't forget rain collectors.  Now you have the basics of survival, you can make forays into the dangers of the city, staying in cleared out houses along the way and making sure to attract as little attention as possible.This game has the potential to leave a huge, huge indent on future zombie games, probably the same way DayZ has already done.  When NPCs and multiplayer are added (especially LAN which would be incredible), this could become the FTL of the zombie genre.Considering I have got 30 hours of fun from this game, I would say that it's definitely worth £5.  In terms of £10, it's your choice: either wait until the game is a little more advanced and REALLY get your value, or jump in and support the developers early on and enjoy running around a town full of 4500 zombies with no NPCs.Right now I would rate this game a compelling 7/10 but it has the potential to hit 9 or 10/10.For reference here is how I rate other non-arcade zombie games:Resident Evil 4: 9/10TellTale Games The Walking Dead: 8.5/10Left 4 Dead: 8.5/10Resident Evil 2 or 1: 8.5/10Left 4 Dead 2: 7.5/10Dead Island: 7/10Dead Rising: 7/10The Last of Us: 7/10DayZ (currently): 6/10 (with the potential to be much higher)Dead Rising 2: 5/10As you can see I have left a space at the top for 9.5 and 10/10.  Reason being there has never actually been a zombie game that lives up to the tension, excitement and cloying exigency for survival that permeates the finest zombie movies.Project Zomboid does have a chance to reach that level or somewhere near it.  The fact that the merest scratch can but not necessarily will turn you eventually into a zombie is a welcome change to the superhero melee murder spree that many other zombie games offer.  The fact that you can die of hunger, thirst, regular disease and being soaked to the bone by freezing rain adds tension.  Your crops can die of diseases, a horde of zombies can shamble up to your safehouse and lay siege to it.  Firing your gun attracts three times as many zombies as you originally intended to engage.So there you have my take on this charming, albeit incomplete, little game.			",84,14,0,16,8,1,28

								What can I say about Project Zomboid ?  I love this game.It's hard to survive in the zombie apocalypse but everything starts to make sense and you start to feel comfortable.You gather food supplies and barricade a house, your skills are building up.Everything is fine, then you're checking a house and you casually open a bathroom door and go in without looking and . .  There's three zombies in there that munch or your arm before you can get away.You put a ripped sheet on it to stop the bleeding but it get's infected because the bandage wasn't disinfected.Over 2 days you get weaker and weaker and then you die.This is just one of the many deaths I've had in this game.If you buy this game, your character will die too and that's the fun !It's not about whether you die or not, it's about what you did while you were alive.

But now so many years later the whole zombie thing has been done and redone by many others. This is how it will go when u play the game and why it needs npcs.1. start the game pick a server that isnt password protected or isnt running 100s of mods.2.spend 40 mins picking your stats and gender.3.join a game.4. Say hello to server, get no response get killed.5. Repeat steps 1-4 two more times at least.6.You look at clock ****  need to sleep and you relise you have not really played the game.7.Decide to play single player but its boring as its just you.8.Go onto forums you read they are putting in npcs you get happy you think i cant wait to start my colony.9. 2 years have past and you have forgotton all about this game since u have been playing others.10. after so long you think they must have put in npcs by now, you check to find they have updated backpacks.well this is my story.

								     One of the best zombie survival games I have  ever played. The game has some major performance issues and an immense amount of bugs but keep in mind this game is still fairly new. The player must survive for as long as he can by looting houses and not being killed by zombies. After a while the electricity and the water will go out so it is up to you to solve that resource problem. If you do happen to buy this game and you get a black screen upon loading a new character right click the game in steam and go to: Properties -> set launch options -> and type ""-safemode"", or you could also try the compatibility mode option upon launching the game!

								Development? Yeah, it's slow. It's also early access. By buying, you're acknowledging that it may never be finished. I did. I like to think that I got my $15 worth, and will get more than that with every update, regardless of the time it takes the team to get the updates out. I have the utmost respect for the devs, putting up with all the crap a lot of folks are putting them through in terms of how long updates take. By now, if I were TIS, I'd go the route of, say, Interstellar Marines and just leave everyone in the dark to shut most of them up so I could work. But, instead each week they put on their gloves and get ready for the **** that gets slung their way because they choose to keep us in the loop.Now that I'm done with that, on to gameplay.Even in its current state, in the off chance of zombacaylpse, I've learned a lot from PZ. Stockpile water in anything that can hold water. Turns out the people that keep the water running stop going to work after the world ends. Keep some books and toys handy (the toys may be part of the Hydrocraft mod, I'm not sure). Boredom is nobody's friend. Stockpile food, obviously. Non-perishables don't grow on trees, unfortunately, and besides, you're gonna cut all the trees down to make walls and other things. Perishables perish shortly after the power shuts off, too. Learn how to grow food. It's a marketable skill during the end of the world.And when the animations update arrives, you're probably going to want several changes of clothes rather than wearing that one sweat shirt and that one t-shirt for the rest of your life. Blood stains and all.I think it's worthy of the ""something in my eye"" award because you will get attached to your character and all the progress you make with him or her. You'll have killed lord knows how many deadoes, and then, when you least expect it, the sound of your flesh being torn open by a rotting hand or a decayed jaw. You suddenly aren't long for the world. You spent so long trying to ride out the storm, only to become a part of it. You think back to the first one you killed, then the first building you cleared. Staring in horror at that first house you saw boarded up, filled with rotters trying to break out and devour your flesh. Fast forward to the lights going out, or the water shutting off, and wondering How will I survive now? and finding a way. And for however long you kept finding a way, beating in heads, looting the homes of the deceased, fortifying your home (whatever or where-ever it may be). And now you flash forward to just a moment ago, as Rodney Rot-Face there just took a bite out of your arm. You are not long for the world now, and with this realization, and perhaps a tear in your eye, you can decide to hole up and wait to die, or you can take revenge on the world that did this to you.Be lovely, I'm out, dropping the mic!

								Positives:-Zombies actually fell threatning.-Pretty expansive mechanics (which are constantly being updated).-Survival actually feels like survival (kinda hard to explain this one).-Status updates are well-spaced out.-No NPC's (as of yet) to further drive home the ""Lone Survivor"" feeling.-No HandholdingNegatives:-UI feels like a cluster♥♥♥♥ to newcomers.-Lack of story (it's being reworked, so this might change).-Can be overwhelming for newcomers.-No NPC's (as of yet).Overall, I'm nitpicking if nothing else. For what it says on the tin, it does it's job very well. I've yet to try the multiplayer properly. ",404,64,12,61,49,2,49

								This is a very well done zombie apocalypse game. I'll be honest, I don't normally get into these kinds of games, but this game gripped me due to the sheer reality of it all, and I would say it is a must have for anyone who enjoys zombie-type games. The really cool thing about it is, it's not even finished yet, which means there is more to come in it, and it's already great! I would highly recommend Project Zombid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								No real easy multiplayer options yet, unless you join neglected servers.  They exist, and it is possible to host a server, but awkward for a computer novice.  BUT, a very fun adventure that captures the essence of isolation, desperation, and determination inherent in a survival experience.  The fact that there are zombies just gives a backdrop.  A lot of little details that leave you with a robust and lovingly-crafted world to explore.  This game has medications such as beta-blockers, sleeping aids, painkillers, and even vitamins.  Name another game with that.Also, there seems to be a lot of active development and mod content from the community.  I'm not certain how much longer the challenge of existing will keep me occupied in a single player experience, but I can certainly envision this game's development will bring me back periodically to enjoy the new content.Would buy again.

								Project Zomboid is hands down my favourite sandbox survival simulator, primarily because you can tell the devs are just hardcore genre fans. The atmosphere of doom looming really brings out a horror game. It's like the game is telling you in advance: you will fail.Atmosphere is great.Updates are actively coming, so the game is not stagnant. Community is healthy and engaged, the devs are actively engaged with their players.The game itself really fits the old control style I personally like. Some would call it dated for not using 50 shortcut keys for everything, but I happen to like the mouse driven context menu interface.Music is superb. Setting is superb, and generic enough to craft any roleplay scenario the admin desires. What's best - the multiplayer option to run a dedicated server.Great job, Indie Stone!			",8,0,0,2,0,0,3

								It's allmost two different games one after the other - there's the first month or so (in-game time) where you can roam around all the zombie-fied districts, splatting brains, exploring & just finding what you need to survive from the wreckage. But the the water supplies stop working & all the food you find is starting to spoil... unless you start growing / catching it yourself out in the wilderness.  And the map is insanely big, like almost unbelievably big. I'd ventured so far out from the starting city that I thought it was just gonna be repeating trees & grass from now until some unpassable mountain / river  hid the end of the map, so I looked up where I was online..  and I was pretty much in the middle of the map, had only travelled about 10% of the width in total			",86,34,1,25,8,2,31

								This game looks funky, but it plays kinda FUNKY ! (Futurama referace right there !) I had this game for months on the Desrua Client and the moment I saw they ported it to Steam I had to get my copy. For only 15.00 dollars you get in my opinion one of the best zombie survial simulations you could ask for. The game only leaves you off with one statement, "" This is how you die""You see this is your story of survial. There are no arrows pointing you anywhere, or time limit, or kill objective to accomplish, it is simply you in the mist of a zombie apocalypse trying to gather supplies and build up a base. This is one ride you have to take if you truly call yourself a zombie fan.			",71,8,3,11,25,1,23

								This project has been in the works for AGES. Overall, its a fun zombie apocalypse single player survival game. It is however not without its fair share of missing features and bugs at the moment. Dont let the talk of mplay mislead you, it has been in the works forever and as someone who has been with the game since early alpha, i dont see that happening anytime soon. It is fun and imo well worth the 15$ price. Its no State of Decay and comparing the two is like comparing strawberrys and candy bars. Both are yummy, but there is a big difference.###UPDATE###Mplayer has been implemented and it is indeed a fun romp. A bit buggy at the moment, but with time all the quirks will be worked out.

								Saying this game is ""early access"" makes many released games fall into shame.This is simply put the BEST early access game out there, a lot of other developers would have already called it a day, but we still get regular updates with new features.Some bullet points why the game is awesome:- Great atmosphere, play this in your house alone at night and you will jump from your chair- A really challeging game WITHOUT being unfair, you learn after every perma death.- Multiplayer, which makes the game even better if you play it with friends.- Great communication from the devs, every monday we get a ""zomboid"", an update on the game and pending features.- I am not even a zombie-lover, but I played this game already for 250 hours, the only 2 games above this in my steam list is CIV5.Just buy it - you will love it.

								interesting enough wandering around the gameworld finding the one window to a house or shop to get in silently then loot the place.fun enough when you're finding knifes for the silent instant neckstab takedown on zombies.boring when you're kiting 10 or so zombies hitting them constantly with an axe with none of them ever dying.I've enjoyed it but really you need to invest alot of time into the game to get enjoyment out of it and even then its like a steady drip of minor fun until you get a minor scratch and become infected and the so and so amount of hours you put into that character looting shops,houses and the undead goes up in your face.if there was a middle yes/no option i'd be picking it but really i've never acutally left the game happy just sort of ......meh ok that was project zomboid			",51,2,0,7,6,0,0

Don't let the retro graphics or early access fool you - yes, it has it's bugs, it's flaws and a lot of content still to come, but you can easily pour hours into this game, especially in coop. The attention to detail around the perk system, base-building, sound travelling, etc. is a sign this developer knows what they're doing and it's a really nice example of a zombie-survival game taking a slightly different tack from the rest of the pack.

								I feel like this is one of the only zombie survival games with actual active developers. They keep the community up to date and release updates consistently. I also feel like they can do way more with the game/engine as well. As for gameplay, it's fun at first, but some things can get stale after a while. This will force you to play differently and explore your options. As of now, you can make a base, farm crops, and fish. Water and electricity will shut down after a period of time, forcing you to rely on yourself for resources. Fighting zombies is fun, yet very risky. All it takes is one scratch or bite to become infected. I thought the multiplayer had potential, but I wasn't a huge fan of the execution. Joining a server for the first time can be difficult depending on what kind of server it is. There isn't a lot of food, and chances are enough time has passed for water and electricity to be nonexistent. I think this game shines most with singleplayer and co-op, and the addition of promised npcs will make it twice as much fun. Definitely a good game for the price. If you put it down for a while, you'll probably come back to 2 or 3 updates to explore.			",100,20,0,11,13,1,23

								Ok so let's do some math here, 760k units sold. Currently the flat price is 15 dollars. At release it might have been cheaper. Just to make the numbers nicer, let's reduce the price to 10 dollars, and the units to 700k and they still made 7 MILLION DOLLARS. Even if we take out 2 million or whatever the deal is with steam, it's more than enough to hire full time worker at 80k+ a year and still have money left over? I just cannot fathom that this game has been in early release for what? 4 years soon. No animations, no NPCs and plenty of gliches to be had and missing content. I guess since the bulk of the money was already made from the people who actually wanted to play the game. People who actually wanted to help and see the game grow gave money up to buy and play it, whilst the developers run off with their money. Insane. It just feels like 2012-2013 was the game a bunch of these indie developers made these zombies survival games and released unfinished games as early access, made their money and dropped the project because how much more money would they be making if the game was finished?Just think Day-Z as an example, sold at 35 dollars  but it's l;iterally a ♥♥♥♥♥ier looking arma 2/3 with even ♥♥♥♥♥ier looking zombies and AI. lmao			",154,9,1,14,1,0,13

								The zombie survival genre. A wasteland full of FPS games that all go similar ways. it all feels like some mish-mash of minecraft and a unique idea or two. Then theres project zomboid... a stand-out title that doesn't use those crappy ""WE'RE DEAD NOW THATS WHY WE CAN RUN REALLY F*CKING FAST NOW"" mentality. this is classic, george romero style zombies, they aren't a simple annoyance, that in hordes are dangerous. One encouter with a zombie could mean the end of years of hardwork and gameplay. Even though it has a static map, every game seems diffrent. are you gonna spawn in a house with a good weapon? Do you have to tread the streets welding a measly spoon as your weapon of choice? Rember Zomboid does NOT play around, from the start the game makes sure you know it ain't screwin aroundAll I want you to take out of this review is that Zomboid is an amazing survival game that really does ask the question, will you survive the zombie apocalapse?Also these devs are f*cking awesome, I always play on the opt-in builds and I rarely notice a bug. Do note, this game is not going to be done any time soon. Though that is to be expected with a four man team.			",90,19,1,21,17,0,24

The developers are taking their sweet time to make as many problems as possible.im currently facing problem where i cant aim, if i cant aim i cant attack therefore i cant win. The bugs are great and so are the crashes and lack of players on the limited servers.and the game was quite good too.			",27,3,0,4,3,0,3

								Listen, I gave this game a try, I really did, but almost no progress has been made for so long. I mean, for christ sake, the crowbar model hasn't even been made and it's been out for over 3 years! If you want a zombie survival game, that actually has working developers, buy 7 Days to Die.

								Aside from being one of the most open-ended zombie apocalypse simulators in gaming, this masterpiece is nothing short of amazing.Right off the bat - is the game challenging? You are encouraged to use the game's tools to tailor-make your own version of the apocalypse, editing zed rules, environment weather and loot rates. Does everyone reanimate with the zed disease? Do the zombies in your apocalypse break whatever is in their way, or will they only attempt to infiltrate if they are chasing a noise? Are the zombies never ending, or is there a set population spread out across Kentucky?Once you have set your parameters you are dropped in as the stock character you have set up, choosing from a wide variety of previous jobs and traits, each with their own effect and skill boosts (this gets even juicier with multiplayer as you will be playing with people with different abilities and central skills).Your build can range from a burger flipper with an iron-gut and thick skin to a brave firefighter with additional first-aid skills to a desensitized war veteran with an eagle eye.Once you spawn in, you will be in what was presumably your home with randomly generated loot. You have the keys to the place, but are not forced to live there. What will you do? Will you take what's in the kitchen and live off of whatever meal you can throw together until you need to leave? Will you take everything you can with you as you search for a better place to live? Will you leave the stove on and burn your house down with you in it? This is Project Zomboid, and this is the story of how you died.Aside from being a fun and challenging game to play on your own or with friends, Project Zomboid is pretty good for seeing how well you could potentially take care of yourself in a situation where society's rules are out of the window. Compare your current life to how your story began in Project Zomboid. Did you always have somebody who could cook for you? Did you not bother to learn anything about basic carpentry? What skills do you have? You are only yourself, and you can't do everything great (or even good enough) off the bat. So what will you do? Either way, you will have to learn new things. But what skills do you plan on using? Do you have a friend you can work with who can help take a load off? Are you going to be on the run solo until you can predict the dangers you may run into?If you can micromanage your character to ensure that you can maintain a healthy diet with no health complications or depression months past the power dies, odds are you are doing something right in your plan. And if you are at that point and are surviving off of worms and anti-depressants, you must really hate yourself.From camping under the stars to camping on the roof, the options for staying alive are endless. Do what suits you best. You may not be a carpentry/electrical based character. Maybe you are a park ranger? Use your herbology knowledge to forage for medical herbs, and set up camp somewhere deep in the woods. Not so good with the outdoors, but are even better than most with a baseball bat and are in the shape of your life? Maybe living on the move or in a safer suburban area could do you good. Great with a hammer, but not so great at fighting zombies? Construct a perimeter and use your skills to maintain it.And again, I can not stress how much better this game gets on multiplayer. Having a group of friends with different central skills and profession benefits will create it's own dynamic and let you fully experience everything the game has to offer.			",51,7,5,7,4,0,2

Early Access Review
								TL:DR;Possibly most complex zombie survival out there, despite it's granularity I cannot recommend it without few warnings.First, it has been in Early Acces for like what? 3 years? Development come to nearly a stop. For the other reasons, read on.Review:Project Zomboid is complex zombie postapolacyptic survival game. Name 'dwarf fortress' can come to a mind for quite a few reasons. Reason one - number of small things and items and map size.Reason two - never ending development and bugsGameplay in this game is very uneven and under designed. You start as a survivor in one of the locations on a VERY large map. From there on, you have to cloth yourself, eat, drink, creaft weapons and kill zombies. Sounds good? After all who woudn't like good old zombie killing and survival combo?The problems however can break even the greatest enthusiasm.So let's name them.Starting new game - there is no real tutorial, except for very basic movement. Worse, sandbox settings are so uneven, that it beggets belief. On weak setting zombie takes 4 hits of crowbar. On normal, 12. How much it takes on strong?Numbers of zombies on survival setting is so huge, you will constantly bump into groups of 10-20 zombies.On basic perception settings they will spot you on sight. On basic speed setting they will keep following you everywhere. There is no story line to follow. Except some gibberish new feed on TV. No notes to be found (there is even a mod that adds them!). No NPCs to save and care for. Absolutelly no point in doing anything no reason for you to keep going. No achievements. Not even a sense of achievement, if you manage to put up a decent base.But lets back to ur zombies, mkay? Oh and I see that Random Event just spawned a horde after us?Now, maybe it's time to fight back? There are no real weapons to craft. What you find is usually crap, best of weapons being axe, which is also critical to crafting. And items do wear out!Guns - they miss most of the time, and draw more zombies. Swinging your axe at them will get you swarmed or will eat your stamina and get you swarmed.There are little traps, bombs, etc.Worse is that on hardcore setting you can't just shot your gun. You have to load, rack it, aim and shoot. I believe that complexity is welcome, but there are reasons why in games you do certain things by yourself automaticaly.So maybe let's build a base to put up a wall between us and zombies. Suprise - you can't. Once you level up carpentry so that you actually can, you discover that cutting trees exhausts you after 3 trees. And they overburden you. And you have to carry them to the place where you build and drop them on the ground. Only to discover, ground level has capacity limit(whaat?) to a maximum 5 wood logs per tile.And once you build the wall you suddenly discover zombies will simply swarm it and keep bashing it untill it breaks.There are no stone walls to build, no steel reinforced barricades, only wooden crap that lasts few minutes against the zombies. There is not real base building. No real sense of reward after tremendous work it takes to fortify anything. Mkay, but perhaps we can craft something otherwise usefull?No, despite having tons of crap. You can't attach a knife to the mop and make a spear. You can't upgrade your pistol with a stock to make it more accurate, put a flashlight on it to see in the dark etc. Predefined mods are very few.Top line craftable weapon is spiked baseball.Something else maybe? Like what? Radio, that doesn't reach anywhere? To add insult to injury, Inventory management is troubling, at least. There are very few slots to put anything in, two hands, chest, legs, boots, backpack slot. Nothing else. No careful arming and protecting youself. FFS damn wound system points to more slots than you can actually equip something to!Ok, so the basic game is bland and pointless. Maybe mods will help?Yes, there are certain mods that do improve the game. For example burning corpses in the fire mod. Or different book colours to help you tell them apart. Or perhaps more zombie loot - finally they carry something more than just clothes. But some mods add things that are completelly pointless. Biggest one, called Hydrocraft, allows you to establish an entire  industry. But ask yourself this:In zombie survival game, wouldn't you like to be able to craft solar panels to heat water and cook food rather than build a mine and cast tin ingots?Perhaps you would like to make a solid spear instead of bronze halebard?What about putting leather wraps around your legs and arms, rather than cast steel morning star?You see. Adding few hundred recipes that are useless unless playing with people in multiplier, which isn't working quite good, doesn't help. Knowing all the above you have to make a hard decision wheter to support a game from Early Access limbo with your money. After 55h hours of my gameplay I feel like I have achieved completely nothing. Make sure you will not make the same mistake.Edit:Also, keep in mind. Devs were seen arguing with negative reviewers in steam comment section. I sh!t you not!			",168,126,0,46,32,0,63

Early Access Review
								Don't let the outdated poisitve fool you, it's a facade of what used to be. Pretty depressing. There's only a few games out there these days that really utilize early access to strive. Starbound was a prime example, the game hits early access, the developers keep on a rampant grind, and then the game is released. Top of the line, A++ quality game.Zomboid was going to be my second on the list. The early access was amazing, I was playing with friends, having a great time, coming back every now and then when big updates would come up, but always waiting for specific promised features. I know it's early access, that's why I gave them years on years to add them, and it didn't bother me. However after a while, it became clear to me that the development team had changed.I'd say from 2 years back now, the development hit a halt. Vehicles have only been remotely announced recently, but for years were in the silent. The promised NPCs / Bandits were rarely mentioned again, and the building system was still as buggy as day one. But through all of the bugs, And then the weekly/monthly news releases and dev blogs would come out. ANIMATIONS. That's it. No feature updates, no vehicles, no multiplayer tweaks, rarely any potent bug fixes, and no AI. What was their latest update? Animations.""We redid the animation system""""New animations coming out""""We've been working on animations for months""""These new animation tweaks are golden""2 years. They had 2 years of money and development, and the only progress we were seeing - was on animations. The game, admiteddly, didn't have the smoothest animations - so I get why they would want to overhaul them in preperation for a full release. 2 Years though? Really?And then every other dev blog had an excuse for these animations.""We have a new team helping us out""""Here's our new animator""""We encountered some bugs""It was all nonsensical excuses to deliberately extend the moneygrab before they'd abandon the project. And it's clear that was the direction they were going in.The biggest factor to take in right here, is that out of all of the updates in the past 2 years - you won't notice a majority of them. The bugs never affected anyone, half of the QoL fixes weren't needed, and the interface updates were honestly worse. If you update a game over 2 years and people can't notice the changes, it is a clear sign that priority needs to change.If you are wondering why a game with ""very positive reviews"" has extremely negative reviews suddenly, it is because this is a practically ABANDONED GAME. If you like it for the stage it's in now, then by all means buy it. However if you expect vehicles, AI, or reliable multiplayer changes - DON'T BUY THIS. You will not see those updates during your play time. It will take atleast another 1-2 years to maybe see these? But by then I am convinced the team will have abandoned the project.Sadly, as much as I was rooting for this to not be ""another stereotypical abandoned early access project"", it is. It's just that. Just like every other early access money grab. And it's a shame, because it was such a good game. It was turning out to be an isometric DayZ and it was AWESOME. But now it's just a joke. A wasteland of abandoned code and failed promises.Save your money and invest it into some other completed games or upcoming projects. Find a more reliable team to put your hope into. This team will take your money and run with it. Don't trust them, or any of the developer blogs they release. They will lie to their customers - no hesitation. And if you speak out against them, they will do whatever they can to silence you, hide your posts, and mask your thoughts.Don't fall for this scam. Please.			",409,78,16,68,49,5,55

Early Access Review
								I bought this game way back in Xmas 2013. While it had potential it was a visually ugly, buggy experience.Fast forward nearly two years and I returned after reading about the new visual engine and changes to the default Survival mode. Now I think it's one of the best early access games around (since Kerbal left the EA stable).Anyway you live in Knox County (an absolutely massive map btw) which has a couple of substantial towns, out of town mega-mall (go there if you want to die) and many other out of the way locales.I really can't be bothered writing any more here. Just trust me (how could you not!) that this is a beast of a game with many levels of gameplay (medicine, crafting, cooking etc..) to keep you interested. Game can be played as pure roguelike by creating a new world each time you die, or - what I do - roguelite by having the next character spawn in the pre-existing world and recovering your old safe house and inventory.The downside to playing the same world with a new toon is that by then you will be a month or two into the apocalypse. What this means is NO ELECTRICITY, NO WATER, MANY FOODSTUFF SPOILED and an expanded Zombie population.Just try the game, or wait till it leaves early access. Either way it doesn't bother me because I don't know you and if I did, I probably wouldn't like you enough to be steam friends and travel the world in MP together. Don't be sad about that, you'll find ""FUN"" in this game even without me.			",67,8,1,4,11,0,20

								i love this game i do think you should watch some youtube videos to see if its your type of game. at first glance the graphics might turn you off, but stick with it the game and crafting and survival aspect is more then in depth enough that you dont even notice. even without mods like hydrocraft there are so many building and crafting options to survive. i also like the costum sandbox options you can even pick the zombie build ( how fast they move, how strong, even how zombification is transmitted or not transmitted, also how long you have before you turn) i love zombie games i have so many and this one is a new fav this is a true zombie SURVIVAL game, by that i mean your worst enemy in this game isnt always the zombies. its the rain making you wet and get sick, or its not having food orwater when the water and power go off. or its that cut you got breaking into a house to loot. there are many many moodlet bubbles in this gaem that add a sense of realism to the game. the maps are pre set meaning they are Not random, usually i dont like this as you get to used to the map and the game replayability is lessened but this map is so huge it would take me hours in real time to make it across this map even longer if you count having to stop to eat and drink and rest so the fixed map you will have trouble getting bored of. and if you do there are several additional maps in the workshop that just add small towns right to the existing map expanding on it. there is so much to offer with this game that from what i see anyways doesnt have alot of glitches that i have experienced. there are so many ways to play this game. stay in town and be a looter or move out to the more wooded areas and start a farm. saying that id like to say im super impressed with the farming system that offers things like different water requirments for different plants, fertilizer even making mildew or other plant cures to care for your farm. the stat and lvling system is a hard grind unless you find books to read to give you xp multipliers but i love the hunting for books or magazines that have new recipies i havent found yet. this game is a good option for those who love their zombie games but want a more realistic apocalyse then a shoot 'em up zombie game like left for dead (also awesome fyi)the building reminds me of the sims sort of the looting hmm like dead island or dying light in terms of lots of junk items or less used items but there is so much content this is really a game worth some attention even if the first glance reminded me of a game id played in the 80s or early 90s this game definatly did more then impress me as this is my first review i felt compelled to make. for an early access game this game is heading down the right path to be a very successful game. the developers appear to be attentive and care about feed back and concerns from the players. if your thinking about it try the demo you may want to play the demo a few times as you play as a bitten character so you have 2-3 in game days to play but it will give you a short idea of the rough game play though the demo doesnt really give the game justice it really helped me make my choice to buy this game. the online multiplayer function is also makes this game even better, i enjoy playing this game with others the servers make the game even more realistic. as you can go it alone or find a group or partner to survive and thrive with. on the other side on a pvp server you can do the same or just be a bandit or form a gang and kill other survivors to get their gear the choice is yours in Project ZomboidNovember, 27, 2016I have to say this game continues to improve and the relationship with the customers and the modding community is excellent there are so many mods for this game you can really make it a very personalized zombie survival experience...how will you die?

Yet here we are in build 35 that was just released, it had no major changes except for worthless radio/tv subtitles and bugfixes that no one noticed. Also, don't expect the developers to listen to your feedback. If you say anything negative about this game on the forums, expect yourself banned from all PZ discussions.

								Far too long for far too little..fancy talk every week from the devs isn't gonna make it worth a buy, as the game has been in early access for about 4 years now and, in my opinion, other than small minimal changes it has barely changed from the first year.With the devs constantly teasing new content *cough* animations *cough* and weekly blogs about what's coming up, you may think this game is still fresh and fun, but don't be fooled, as the progress is damm slow and the playerbase is nearly dead with an avarage of 500 players at max.Overall, a fun game, but it lacks of what it promises, it needs a lot more work into it, melee feels clunky as hell and the progress is far too slow, I mean, it's taking them 4 year to make a damm backpack visible on your character..The devs are still teasing with upcoming stuff soon though, I might update this review when that ""content"" finally arrives.

Only their blog is updated (and on a weekly basis at that) while the game remains stagnant.I warn you buyers, this game has been abandoned by the devs and we will never see VEHICLES/NPCS/ANIMATIONS together.

								Probably the best example of appropriate direction for a zombie apocalypse survival game.  Bleak and ominous, emphasized by the game's beautiful musical soundtrack.  Loss of character for failure helps drive a sense of permanence and weight to the world, a trait decidely lacking in most other titles.However, the environments are largely bland and uninteresting.  The basic mechanics are relatively easy to master, and the game offers no escalation in challenge.  The UI is clunky at best, often feeling needlessly cumbersome.  It attempts to employ RPG elements in the way of independently leveling skills, but then perplexingly ties them back to a master level.Fun for a bit, but quickly runs out of things to show.

								I bought this game way back when they took NPCs out, saying they would add them back in.  Yet, I have waited three years and they have given us nothing.  It has gotten to the point where they completely shut down all discussions of the topic on their forums.  The entire reason I got this game was the promise of NPC companions, and it doesn't seem like they will ever deliver.  I have waited three years, and I call that patient enough.They keep using this excuse that they won't release NPCs until they are done.  THE ENTIRE REASON YOU BUY AN ALPHA IS TO GET CONTENT IN VARIOUS STAGES!  This is insane.  I refuse to wait anymore and have requested a refund.  If you want to buy the game because of what they promise the game will be.  Don't even bother, they don't care.  This has been consistently one of the worst developers I have dealt with.

								This game is dead. I always tried to play online and i had really bad times. The constant feeling is that you are alone, even if in the server there are 20 people (never found a server with all that people)Singleplayer can be fun in the first couple of hours, when you're learning dinamics, but then it becomes too much boring and ripetitive. Simply because you don't have nothing to do, you can't go online ( because i can't call ""online""servers with high ping, without any stuff in the closets and with a couple of people).Single player is boring or impossible to play (something like 30 zombies that can destroy a door and you have 2 options: you move and die or you camp and get bored.) Developers left this game dead. I regret buying this game.			",115,13,0,13,6,1,8

								I purchased this game roughly 5 years ago at a time when there actually was NPCs; dysfunctional, unintelligible NPCs but still. This was a time before it was even on Steam and I had to get grandfathered into the Steam download.I was hooked on the potential but soon after the NPCs were yanked and have not been seen again. They had an extremely ambitious scope for what they were planning to do with NPCs; something they referred to as a meta-game which simulated thousands of NPC interactions outside the players own experience. They promised a lot. After well over 5 years of development I cant help but feel cheated.Unfortunately, the only feedback I can give at this time is that the development team, which consists of several people, is atrocious. Every now and then I re-install the game only to find a game that is nowhere near finished with an incredible amount of bloat in several areas causing a strange imbalance. The maps are huge, numerous and lifeless. The amount of objects, especially food, is extroardinary. The team has a habit of investing months of time in something arbitrary that doesnt appear to focus on finishing the project. The combat and UI are having trouble finding their identity. The game doesn't really play well with either a joystick or a keyboard/mouse as the inventory system and combat dont complement each other fluidly.Over the years, I have carefully observed the progress of the game so far and let me tell you if those years are any indication for the pace at which they work, we will be waiting another 5-10 years before they add NPCs and finish the game. Ironically, the amount of updates on their website is consistent in the form of what they call ""Mondoids"" and often times pretty lengthy despite there not being much progress. In their defense, I will say that the game is actually really fun for a minute and light years ahead of many indie projects, but the lack of any structure quickly dissolves the game into boredom. Im beginning to feel as if the team cashed out and are putting minimal effort to maintain the status quo.Im going to recommend that you dont purchase until they provide a finished product.

								I don't remember exactly when I first bought this game (long before it arrived on Steam), but it was at least 7 years ago.Very little seems to have changed since then. They spent two years working on a whole new game engine and map tools, which perhaps was of long term benefit, but what have they done in the other 5 years? Added some crafting and farming (fair enough, good), multiplayer (could have waited in favour of other stuff), redid interfaces, stats and other minor stuff.If you buy the game, you will get some enjoyment out of it for a while. You'll enjoy exploring the town, breaking in to various buildings and searching for useful stuff to help you survive, dodging or fighting off zombies along the way. You'll enjoy trying to build your zombie proof home.And then you'll get bored of it. The developers might keep you interested in how the development is going with their weekly essays on how awesome the game is going to be once they add the extra features that they've been working on for the last X years, but even that will wear thin sooner or later.If you're bored and want a distraction for a little while, then perhaps buy this and play it until you get bored again. But don't buy it based on promised content or improvements 'cos it'll be years away, if it arrives at all.Edit: For those questioning my time frame. I moved house about 5 years ago, and I played Zomboid at least a year or two before that, back when it was using Java (before the change of game code/engine, as stated above). Long before Steam EA (as stated above), so don't bother quoting that at me.Plenty of other games just as complex have been fully developed on EA and released in that time, so the argument ""development takes time"", yes it does. But for someone who has been following this game on and off for so long, this is just getting silly.Give it a couple more years, we'll see if you're still as zealous then.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is addicting, but not really any more fun than most browser games. Infact most of the game is watching the loading bar over your characters head. This game is mostly about trying to maintain your sanity while patently waiting for your character to individually move 200 between bags or towingback and fourth carrying three planks at a time. Honestly I can't even keep up with what little progress this game makes. I'm pretty sure they spend more time making the blog posts for the updates than actually working on the game.  I want to like this game and want to support it, but it has been way to long sense any sizable update. Don't worry though, everything is coming soon...			",104,11,0,17,4,1,12

								Hands down probably the best game i've ever played, and it's still in alpha! There is so much depth and life in this title. I promise there's something here for everyone. From surviving to building to farming and farming and back there is never a dull moment.... well aside from when it gets dark and your waiting out a horde that is outside ready to feast upon your delectiable face, but even then you can always enjoy one of the many good books and further progress your character. Also the multiplayer is so fun! If you like pvp or pve i guarentee there's a server for you with friendly... or not so friendly players. Ready your axes and grab those nails. Everyday should be a Zomboid day! P.S. the devs for this game are amazing and are constantly working on new ideas and updates which is always a good thing. So, with that said... who wants to hunt some people? :D			",158,12,3,22,8,2,13

Early Access Review
								I had heard a lot about this game on Reddit, and it eventuallly sparked enough of my interest to make this the very first early-access/alpha/beta game I have purchased on steam. I have stayed up until 6am playing this.If you like isometric, survival/crafting, zombie, adventure, rpg games, then you will absolutely love Project Zomboid!For an isometric game, the aesthetics are fantastic! The detail put into the environment is great, and the building/wall camera vision style will switch automatically, allowing you to always see your character (think Sims style) - unless, of course, you are being swarmed by zombies. There is also a great field of vision mechanic where you can only see in a cone radius in front of your character - so you can turn around to see a zombie standing right next to you (this game has prompted many screams from me lol). The music is perfect for the inensity of the game, of every single moment where it can be your last.The controls can take a little bit of getting used to, especially considering that you have multiple menus to deal with (ex: inventory, character stats). You have the option of keeping the menus locked open, making looting much faster if you can handle the space each menu takes up on the screen. There is a lot you can do in PZ, and it is highly recommended that you keep the unofficial map handy for quick reference. The game allows you to choose your profession, which will grant skills like higher resistance to zombie bites and scratches. You can also balance perks and negative skills, making the game more interesting. The custom mode provides a way to test out the game, allowing you to select the frequency of encountering zombies, their overall stats, how long until the electricity and water supply run out (yes, this is a critical element of the game), etc. If you want to get a good feel of the game, I recommend you start of here, just so you can better understand what you need to do without the pressure of dying at a moment's notice.The learning curve and difficulty of this game is moderate, however, I would consider survival mode (how the game is meant to be played) to be fairly hard. You will start off at in a random house, with only the clothes on your back. From here, you can loot supplies, hopefully finding some sort of bag item - which you can wear on your back, increasing your carrying capacity. Securing food and water is essential. Any container objects like bowls or bottles can be used to hold water from the sink, and this is critical to remember because the water supply will eventually run out. Perishable food will rot when not refrigerated.You increase in proficiencies as you do certain things - for example, whever you sneak around zombies you will gain points in nimblness, sneaking, etc. When you attain enough xp points, you will be able to ""master"" the first level of a ""completed"" skill. So, if I have cooked enough meals to fill my first block on the skill menu (level 1), and have a level up point, I can select the skill, mastering it and improving the quality of things that I cook. You will not be able to fill higher level skill blocks until you first master the lowest tier - this prevents you from just cooking for the entire game since you have to be mastering each level as you progress. Reading specialty books also provides a bonus multiplier to the respective skill, and there are different books for both skills, and their respective levels (ex: carpentry for begineers vs. advanced carpentry). While you play, you will have to balance your needs, eating, sleeping, and staying hydrated. You can also get bored if you are inactive, and becoming unhappy is also a possibility (leads to depression). There are items you can take to help with these needs (like beta pills, antidepressants, reading newspapers, etc), and you can also take sleeping pills to allow you to go to bed (you cannot keep sleeping unless your character is actually tired) - this is very useful for trying to settle sleeping patterns into a rhythm where you are sleeping during night time and awake in time to maximize the daylight visibility. The crafting is not too complex, you will need to find an axe and chop down trees for logs, then convert them into wood. Crafting a rain collector is a priority - with successfully finding an area to plant/farm as a close second. I have played this game a lot, and there was one time when I had spent 3 hours securing a base and building nice walls around it. I even had set up a farm and rain barrel, with pretty decent skills leveled up already. While looting a nearby house, I opened a window, but the alarm went off. Being overconfident in my abilities, I went in anyway, thinking I would be able to loot and leave before the house was stormed by zombies. While looting the upstairs rooms, I heard the door break open. I quickly run down and spot zombies rushing in through the front door. I try the back door, but zombies are piling in from a broken window next to the fridge. Panicking, I run upstairs, loot a shirt, tear it into sheet rope, and fashion a climbable rope on the second-level window. I slide down, but zombies are surrounding the house, and I have no way out. I hop over a broken window on the first floor and attempt to juke through the zombie horde. I take a scratch, and immediately see that I am about to die. I try to drop my bag, but it is too late. I have joined the dead.I stare at the screen for a good 2 minutes, sigh sadly, then load up a new game.I love this game.If you load a save where you have died, everything you have done will remain intact, so securing and transforming a safehouse will not be wasted. You can even find your corpse walking around if you are lucky. The mod support is not as extensive as say, Space Engineers or Starbound, however, there is a lot of potential for great user-made content. The developers, unlock Starbound, are also very active, releasing builds at good intervals. Be warned, however, not to invest to much in your saves, as you may not be able to transfer over your saves to newer builds when they are released.If you are interested at all, give this game a try. For an early-access game, it is quite impressive and very well-done.Highly recommend!			",250,88,0,51,38,2,49

								REALLY awesome game! Only really got into it and loved it because of the multiplayer function being added. DO NOT let the graphics steer you away! The graphics are way better in the game than the video/pics give credit for. I'm a stickler for graphics and this was way better than what I thought it would be. The whole crafting system is pretty cool and definitely really fun considering the fact that this is still an early access game. Multiplayer is super fun and the concept of farming, carpentry, and other skills like leveling up sprinting and stuff is really cool. Definitely worth the $15 tag!			",328,66,4,57,27,2,23

								Very buggy work in progress.  I find the free demo version more complete than the current build.But I still like this game and play it ocassionally.  I won't say it's better than the demo or you should buy it for the game it will be. But it is a good game and seeing it progress is part of the fun for me.I remember having trouble living for a week, and one time living for a month and just deciding to end it all in the demo.  I feel the ""endgame"" a bit lacking. It's very rougelike in that you can be smothered early on.  I haven't played long enough in the new build to learn how to survive because I don't know that I want to play a single game of PZ that last that long because a single game does get boring and I'm not sure farming is going to fix it.

Early Access Review
								Project Zomboid is one of those few gems that is released every 5-7 years, where should I begin this review? Let's start with the concept of the game. The whole idea of PZ is to survive as long as possible, there are no objectives,  no end goal, just survive. Now this may sound easy, but in a world full of zombies constantly out to get whatever they smell/hear/see this can become rather challenging. We all know what zombies are and do, they are dead corpses that were reanimated by some sort of virus or disease and now out to infect everything in sight. And if you're an avid zombie hunter, then this game may sound like just another game with zombies in it, it's not.Let's get to the actual gameplay elements;Crafting: You can literally build what ever type of base you want, now this is by far one of the coolest features, you can wall off entire city blocks if you wanted to. (that would require quite a bit of resources though, I'll get to that in a minute) You can build doors, floors, walls, bars, stairs, and light posts among other things. You can craft weapons, or repair ones you've broken, you can add modifications to said weapons too! Got a baseball bat, some nails, and a hammer? Create a spiked baseball bat that deals pretty significant damage and does it in style too. Barricading: This should probably go in the crafting section, but whatever. Barricading is something most of us zombie hunters have wanted to do for some time now, and sure some zombie games do have it, but Project Zomboid executes it brilliantly, the resources required for barricading are pretty rare depending on how lucky you are and what type of settings you selected before you started your game. (only in Sandbox mode can you select said options) You can barricade windows and doors, which not only helps keep the creeping zeds at bay, but also makes it so they can't see you through said windows, which is really cool. (you can also put sheets up to block outsiders from looking into your safehouse)Scavenging: This has been a part of modern zombie games for quite some time now, however this game does do one of the more realistic approches to it, food that you scavenge must be kept in a fridge or else it will spoil and make you sick if you attempt to eat it. Items that you need for crafting/barricading are pretty rare and thus valuable when found. You really need to pick and choose only the stuff you'll need at that moment when scavenging because you can only carry so much before becoming over encumbered, and don't forget you can always come back for whatever you can not bring with you at that time. There is another cool option about this, you can carry two bags with you at a time (this would require you to equip one bag in the secondary slot, and a big/normal, hiking/school bag equiped on your back) which gives you plenty of more space along with weight reductions applied from the bag(s) you have equiped at the time.Moodles: These are moodlets that pop up every now and then to tell you what your character is feeling/thinking, think The Sims, it's just like that. These can range anywhere from being tired, to getting cold, you'll want to keep a close eye on these. Most are not that important, however they're are some that do require your attention and you'll want to be on the lookout for such as, exhaustion, starving, getting sick, getting cold, getting wet, (when it rains) bleeding, and being in pain. A couple tips. 1) You'll want to avoid going out looting/killing during a storm because you'll get wet and will have an increased chance of becoming sick which could be the death of you if you don't take things easy. (killing zombies, running) 2) Lay down every now and then, you're not superman, your character needs sleep just as much as you do. 3) Make sure to always carry bandages/bandaids on you, in case you need to break open a window or patch up a wound, these are a necessity.Skills: This is a really fun feature in the game, you will develope skills according to how you play overtime. Do you like sneaking around avoiding the undead masses? Or do you like running in swinging hand over foot? either way will get you XP in these skills, which in time will unlock skill points that you can assign to your favorite most used abilities. Remember though, this is not carried over to multiple characters, if your character dies, all the abilities you've unlocked die with them.Farming: This is a pretty cool feature, it requires quite a few resources that may or may not be tricky to find depending on where you are and what options you've chose before starting the game. I'm not too experienced in this aspect as of the time of this review, however I do know that it is a great food source after the power/water has went out. You can grow your own crops inside your safe zone, or where ever, it really doesn't matter as long as you have the right materials you need, you can start your own little Farmville. (without being bombarded with 53,721 requests from people you barely know. I'm looking at you, Facebook)Distracting: You can distract the zombies with a few different methods, distracting a group of zombies could end up saving your life for another day. If you've got some gasoline handy and a few matches/lighter you could light up a near by house distracting the horde of undead while you easily sneak by and loot the otherwise damn near impossible house/building with ease. If you're playing with a friend(s) you can distract zombies while your friend goes in and loots the place dry by shouting at them, this will make your life a little bit harder though depending on how many of them there actually are, and Vice versa. Alams in houses can provide a quick distraction, if you're quick enough that is. Break a window or force it open in certain homes and you'll hear an alarm buzz for about 20-30 seconds, if you're quick enough to get out you can easily evade the on coming hordes making it easier to loot the outer area around the house you just sounded off, however this could very well be the end of your life if you get caught up in an oncoming group of zeds.Weapons: As with most zombie games, this game is based on melee/close quarter combat, there are guns available, however they're pretty rare, most are found in the cities and or gun stores, but of course those areas are hard to get to and loot without proper means, meaning you'll be doing most of your killing with a good ol' baseball bat/crowbar/golfclub, which is by no means a bad choice. (well except maybe the golfclub, you'd be better off fighting them with a toothbrush) The baseball bat has pretty decent durability, and is great against zombies, you can kill most zeds with a couple blows from a baseball bat, same with the crowbar, the better more rarer melee weapons such as the Axe and Sledgehammer are great too, however they're mostly located in the city areas, consider yourself lucky if you find one in the suburbs. Guns are great for clearing out areas, just make sure that you have enough ammo on you, because once you pull that trigger, it's on, that's like a dinnerbell to the infected.Be SMART: This game is heavily focused on realism, this isn't a game where you're an overpowered solider that cannot be killed, you can and probably will be killed quite a bit starting out. Only RUN when needed. Don't be a glutton and eat everything in sight, you may need that for another day. If you think it's a bad idea, then it is, and you shouldn't do it. And one last thing, STAY AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS AT ALL TIMES.Those are the main features of the game as of 4/20/2014 (Yea I know what day it is har har har)I'd like to add in that you will NEED to think before you act if you want to survive efficiently, this game is about your experience in the zombie apocalypse, what would you do in this situation if it actually happened? That's up to you, however, don't be careless, or else you will not survive for long.			",143,50,28,13,24,2,11

From killing the town's former inhabitants to building a life for your character whether single player or multiplayer, the game events keep you on the edge of your seat.Being one of the few isometric games I own, it is a definite keeper and worth the $15 is currently goes for.

Early Access Review
								In short: The most massive and accurate zombie-apocalypse simulator that i know of, but rough around the edges and not quite finished.This game features a very diverse and rich pool of mechanics and allows you to play as you like to.You'll experience very intense situations but also quiet and boring periods, where nothing really happens, but the DEVs are working on NPCs (hopefully) which will stirr the whole mix up a bit (and you can play multiplayer if singleplayer is too calm for your taste).If you like role-play-games, sims and zombies, get it!Negative Stuff:-Fighting and movement feels disconnected, you don't get quite the feedback on visibility, hits and damage, etc. which is mostly because the animations and other visuals-related-stuff isn't done yet. Feels like you're not really in control, especially with movement and concealment, your character cannot lay down, hide or peek around corners.-Lack of real gameplay content; The game has a massive map with lots of great art and a huge number of zombies, but you can only survive and build/farm. After some time everything is settled and nothing substancial happens anymore. The DEVs are trying their best to address that but i don't see any fortune there without human NPCs. And just randomly sending hordes to your savehouse is stupid too, it seems fake and unfair.			",61,4,0,2,5,0,5

								So I've gone through a few zombie games, the ones where you can update weapons like you are an engineer, where you can fight like a soldier, survive like Bear Grylls and are basically as inhumane and courageous as one of Daenerys' unsullied.  But I have always wanted to play a true zombie survival game and when I heard about Project Zomboid I decided to give it a go. Needless to say I died on my first day by stumbling in a hoard and thinking that with my flimsy butter knife I would kill them all. I died.. but I was excited. I realized that it's a different type of game, one where survival of the fittest is the phrase of the day. So like any excited person, after dying a few times I decided to check out youtube videos, improve and learn and then I gave it another go. It is an amazing game and I am proud to say I've survived 3 weeks already, I have an axe, a saw, lots of needles and a loooot of AMBITION. However, if you do decide to play this game just remember: ""This is how you're going to die!""			",54,5,0,12,7,1,6

Early Access Review
								Project Zomboid is one of the most unique zombie games ever made. It asks the question ""In the zombie apocalypse, How will you survive, and what will be the cause of your demise?"" This is a game that, if all its planned features are added, will rival other zombie survival horror games such as DayZ or 7 Days to Die. In the event you do not know the full extent of what they are looking to add, this includes an in depth survivor system that will allow you to join or start your own enclave of survivors, then supply them with the means to protect your new home. They also plan to add hostile NPC's because everyone knows in the event of the zombie apocalypse, their is nothing to stop a group of people from coming to your home and robbing everything you used to own, then shooting you and putting an end to your shortlived life in the Project Zomboid world. Did I mention that one day these muggers may not be NPC's, but entire bands of other players? No? Thats one of this games planned features as well.With all this being said, and there are still hundreds of more things to come, Project Zomboid is a game worth getting now, and a game worth the wait for later. I will recollect some of my expereinces to all who read this so you may furthur understand how this game is the zombie game we have all been waiting for.This story begins as it is my first time playing, my charactar is wearing a sweater and a little moodlet pops up on the side showing that it makes him a little warm, and so I swap the sweater with a vest and start to loot the rest of the house I had spawned in. After a long day of looting my charactar becomes hungry, thirsty and tired. After taking care of his Food and Water needs, I put him to bed. However in the middle of the night, two gunshots ring off close to the house, and while there are no NPC's yet, it still put me under the impression that someone was outside my house. The gunshots almost immediatly woke me up, and after waking up I heard a very distinct set of moans, and it is obvious to anyone that the gunshot drew a couple of the undead. However I did not grasp the danger of this situation until I stepped outside to a full on Horde. Only one of them noticed me as I bolted back inside and I hatched a plan. I would draw the horde in, then attempt to burn down the house. After coming up with this Idea I kept in mind this house had 6 exits, 4 including the windows around the house, and the 2 doors on opposite ends. I shoved a bunch of food and maybe some things not meant for the oven- into the oven, and turned it on. Over time electricity and plumbing turn off in this game but for now I was fortunate that it had not. After this I drew a large chunk of the horde into my home once the kitchen set ablaze. I didn't stop to see if it worked, I just simply ran on and on, putting as much distance between me and that horde as possible.I beleive that story to be best to show off how diverse the system of Project Zomboid is, with the appropriatly named ""Sinister Ai"" the game will generate random events such as house alarms for when you break into the window in an attempt to loot the place, or as you saw, random enviromental sounds such as jets, helicopters, gunshots and alarms that will draw or lead away hordes. Overall the pros of this game leave your screen and roll outside your house, yet the cons do as well. While this game is a great colaboration of everything any zombie fan has ever wanted in a zombie game, it still doesnt have ALL the features and it still is in Early Access, which means there will be a LOT of bugs, but if you can get past this you will get a game that will truly give you a fresh expereince every time.

								THE Zombie Survival game.From one playthough, I can already see that Project Zomboid is just unforgiving, rewarding your impatience with a group of zombies pounding on the door of a closet that you desperately tried to hide yourself in whilst you crafted a molotov cocktail on the spot so you could burn down your entire house, taking as many zombies as you could with you.Seriously, though. If you happen to accidentally take a wrong turn or make a noise too loud, you can end up being bitten, and as soon as you're bitten, you genuinely die. Being bitten will actually progress into zombification (if that's the word). You've gotta choose your own safehouse, build your own defenses and scavenge for food yourself. The game does nothing for you except choose a spawn location. After that, the world is your metaphorical oyster!Just one violent, dark, flesh-eating oyster... Let's stick with that.

								Let me start off this review by saying this; These game devs, are not like all the others. They care about their game, AND their community. They listen to what you have to say, and take it into great consideration. THAT BEING SAID; their update progress is slow. When they do update the game however, hardly anything is broken.The game as it stands, is very very enjoyable; with a great community. Gameplay can change at a moments notice, as you are sorting through your bag, a zombie could take a bite out of your neck, yikes! Project Zomboid makes you feel afraid. It doesn't hold your hand, it tells you ""This is how you die."". And they're not wrong. You will die. Exploring buildings and looting can be great fun, as you get into tight situations with the undead. When you do manage to scratch out an existance in the game, it's a great feeling. Until the undead come crashing through your door...I'd rate this game right now at a 7.5/10Only because it's still in beta, or alpha or whatever. Updates are slow, but good when they release.

Don't buy this game and feed them your $$. Wait until the game is either finished, or they start listening to the buyers and implement NPCs			",3,0,0,6,0,0,4

								Just plain badass zombie game. Forget all the others. Get past the graphics and enjoy the mechanics of this game. I've had a ton of laughs and scares with this one. I would recommend this to anyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
Project Zomboid Video Review! Project Zomboid-An isometric sandbox zombie survival game by The Indie Stone. In my humble opinion, one of the best survival games to date especially considering that there are a lot of zombie/survival games. I haven’t reviewed an early access title before, but, I wanted to do my part, however small, to help out The Indie Stone and make people aware of this amazing game, this studio has done amazing work despite all their troubles and I think that that’s really admirable, I won’t go into detail but, if you’re curious I would suggest researching on the net to find out more.  *PC*This game is only on PC. The options for the game are befitting of a PC, the game itself isn’t a major powerhouse so much older systems should have no problem running the game, and currently you can play with a controller (with split-screen co-op!) A very good PC game.  *PLOT*There is no story to speak of at the time of this review, there are however, plans to bring a story mode to the finished game, sandbox is all you’ll find. You do however have a lot of options for your sandbox game, going so far as to decided how long the apocalypse has been going on for (with gameplay changes, more on that later),the game simply starts by putting you inside a house with the crazy world outside.  *STYLE*This game is isometric (top-down view) with art style that reminds me of Commands 2 Men of Courage, it’s got great detail and a very fitting look, I like this type of realistic style because, the proportions of the character to the world makes sense and, the world itself is very realistic with buildings and houses that look more modern. I do wish there were more style differences with clothes, weapons and zombies (especially as time goes on) but, what’s here is still pretty good (plus the game is mod-able) and there is always more being added. The music in this game can be very moody and fitting, this is my own personal taste but, I personally dislike the music with the parts of the middle eastern music (seems like a lot of zombie games have it strangely enough), it’s not that I dislike the genre in general, but, the game has this music that makes it feel very somber, sometimes peaceful, sometimes depressing, and it really gets me into the game, however, when that music starts in (and the women makes the ‘chanting’ noise) I get completely ripped out of it, it’s very jarring in my opinion, I think the game would be better with a focus on atmospheric music similar to that of Fallout or Wasteland 2 even, again it’s a personal preference of mine but, the style and feel of this game just doesn’t seem fitting with that type of music. Still a great style overall, I really enjoy isometric games as I feel you can get a lot more out of it visually and that especially works well with Project Zomboid.  *GAMEPLAY* Project Zomboid is perhaps one of the most realisticgames I have ever played and I don’t use that term often in association with video games. The game rewards you for very logical thinking, more so than in most video games (not to say video games need logic to be fun, but, referring to Payday 2, logically you shouldn’t be able to answer pagers period, much less four) as such this game is all about survival. Besides taking care of the basics, you’ll need to keep your character healthy and sane, really the only thing missing is your characters don’t have to shower, or, go to the bathroom, everything else is pretty much there, the first aid system is pretty involved too, I climbed through a broken window, had to take out glass shards with tweezers, disinfect the cuts, and when the bandages got too bloody, had to replace them and clean the old ones. The other part of what adds to the realism is the length of time, you have great control over your settings of the world and can make it match up with the real world if you so wish, either way, in-game healing isn’t instant, if you break a bone you’re looking at a few weeks in-game before its healed, suffering from the negative affect all the while. Farming also takes months to yield any results, and that’s assuming your planets don’t get trampled by zombies or die of disease and you’re watering them regularly. As time progresses eventually, the running water and power that are available in the houses (or not depending on your options) will turn off, you’ll need to plan ahead for these and if you don’t it’ll be a slow painful death.  *COMBAT*Combat is pretty simple, you have your choice of melee weapons, guns and throwing weapons (like the classic Molotov-cocktail), you ready your weapon, point in a direction and swing/shoot. The longer you ready your weapon, the better the accuracy, and when zombies get close you can shove them away (some may even fall over) and either make a run for it or bash their brains in. Goes without saying that loud noises attracts more zombies and, fire spreads so be careful. You can also sneak past zombies. Combat does take its toll on your character, it’s enjoyable if simple, hopefully more weapons and toys are added to make going out with a bang more of a literal option.  *VERDICT*If you enjoy survival games or zombie games, you’ll love this game, this is the most realistic game I’ve played. Honestly, even if you don’t this is the type of game that is so good it might get you into a genre you’ve never tried before. Its co-op and local split screen, so if you’ve got a passive interest I highly encourage you to check it out, maybe get a friend to play with you, it can and is a lot of fun. And it’s priced at $14.99 USD and I see it on sale often, it’s well worth the asking price. Thank you The Indie Stone for an amazing game!  TL/DRA zombie survival game from The Indie Stone, they’ve hit some rough patches, but, have still created one of the best survival games to date which is still only in early access. There is a ton of stuff planned for the future, but, what is here is a great game, it’s rewarding in all the right ways, makes you feel awesome for being smart and playing like a real survivalist. Its co-op and local split-screen, and the regular price is $14.99 USD which is a steal for this amazing game. If you’ve ever had any interest I highly encourage you to take a hard look and really consider grabbing this game, it simply deserves to be played and I get excited for the day it finally sees a full release.  Thanks for the amazing experience  The Indie Stone!

Early Access Review
								I will echo all the prior statements: The developers are slower than hell, the moderation (censor police) will scream or outright ban you out of their forums for any sort of criticism, and the severe ADD that has infected the feature-creep invested, broken promise loving, half baked feature giving team behind this game is second to none.To give you some perspective I was playing Rogue Survivor and Survival Crisis Z, not to mention flash games, in early 2011. Someone mentioned PZ to me and I backed them before their first demo was even out -- an outrageous idea at the time, but common now. What initially came to fruition was a polished and focused tech demo with a good art style, simple animations and aesthetic, and clunky but functional inventory system.I fired Build 34b up this week and I can say with assurance that almost nothing has changed. The art style has shifted to a pseudo-realistic stop motion, with a useless zoom feature and glitchy lighting. Running from house to house, room to room, fighting back awful controls and the exact same terrible inventory/looting system was a chore. The netcode is Direct Connect IP/Serverbox, with no dedicated servers or IP to IP hosting -- which makes no use of Steamworks.Combat is downright impossible with static repeating animations (or none at all) with each subsequent hit. Weapons break too frequently and are too rare, there are still no NPC's 5 years later. To close my review do not bother supporting Indie Stone, for I truly believe that high profile robbery that transpired years ago was the death of the ""real"" project zomboid. What we have now is an expensive tech demo.			",217,47,3,33,36,0,67

								This game is fun, but it can and most likely will get really repetitive after a few hours. My biggest issue with this game is how slow it takes you to get from point A to point B. I mean god if you want to go to that mall or other town you'll actually have to spend a good hour or two maybe more irl just to get there. This game is in dire need of transportation, like cars or bikes. Seriously, I think this is the only zombie game I played that has zero broken down cars or working cars in it. If you are going to make a huge map like this, it needs a way to get around faster.			",135,33,1,20,17,1,18

								This game takes the Zombie Survival formula and takes it so many steps further, in the best of ways. I recommend this to anyone who remembers the good ol' days before the Walking Dead made everyone a zombie fan. It's about as realistic as it gets to an actual zombie apocalypse, starting you off well after the infected have largely inherited the Earth. You have tons of options, and can even customize the type of zombies that would populate your world. Even while still in Early Access its a incredible game.			",329,48,0,49,11,0,15

								Do not buy this game. Almost 3 years in development and there's nothing to show for it. It's still in early access... no NPCs or any other promises made by the team. To me, this sounds like a money grab and that's probably it. A core bare bone model tossed out which initially received a lot of positive reviews to lure in more kickstart money. There are plenty of games worth their asking price... do not buy and feed this scam.			",25,8,0,22,12,0,19

								Fun game, but it's taking way too long for the developers to push updates. What is here is remarkably fun for a survival game, but, like any survival game, it gets old quickly. If you like survival games and aren't afraid of buying a game that will probably never be finished, I'd say go for it.Wait for 1.0, which will be along shortly before the corona of the dying sun reaches earth's atmosphere.

								I always have Project Zomboid installed on my PC to remind me that this game is not yet finished, but as so many have mentioned the development is slow and unpromising. Having a small development team is not an excuse since you can always hire more developers, if the player base is wanting more out of the game and are giving negative reviews, the team should recognize the facts and speed things up whatever the cost.Also, the updates they put out are mediocure at best, nothing that actuallly changes the ALPHA gameplay and we all nod and agrees that stuff added belongs in the ALPHA gameplay. The thing is that we need actual solid updates that bring people back, not just the average ALPHA update that people look at and nods and think ""Its still not finished""You guys have a great game that has many potentials, that is why gamers are coming back to your site to check updates and progress. If it was a bad game no one would come back. Please make PROGRESS and lets bring those people back.			",27,11,0,10,5,0,5

Early Access Review
								This game.. I don't really know where to start.Do note this is a very short and straight to the point review. When i got it.	The game was enjoyable, i loved the survivalness. The maps seem very well done. At this point i was enjoying the game and would recommend it. After a while	I started to notice the developers were very slow on there updates which i had no problem with. However after some time they kept repeating the same thing.Animations over and over. I thought they were done. But that's not the only thing. They don't seem to put out a lot of content. (And yes im aware the developer team is small. And like i said i understand for the slowness. )So then i decided i wanted to make a map and which i did it is called South Wuxburg or West Wuxburg. It was pretty good to me and people seem to enjoy it. Until one day.  Bugs and how they handle it. (mini rant)I have found many bugs and glitches with this game and it's getting very annoying. And yes im aware this is a EARLY access game but it's been out for over 2 years now. However it broke my workshop item once, And now there is a bug that has completely broken my world editor i use to edit my items. i reinstalled and everything..Before that i had another issue with the editor. I put in a report and got nothing and still nothing of the date of this review.I put that bug report in  October 3rd 2016, It's November 21st. No one has bothered to look it at or even message me about it. There was also a few other bug reports that are there. No one has responsed.I'm just showing how they don't seem to pay attection to bug reports. I Don't hate this game for this it's just very annoying and frustrating and the only way to get them to see this is to make a review. OVERALLGet this game if you like zombie survival games, You will enjoy the mutiplayer (if that don't bug out like it sometimes for me). This game is pretty enjoyable even at 66.4 hours. You can build, Fight, Barrcade and do a bunch of other stuff like crafting.  However be prepared for bugs and to know that the developers might not respond to your bug report. (for a while) Co-op can be extremely fun when the port forwarding works (and it's not my issue). There's lots of modifers to change out how you want the world to be. Make it easy, make it hard, Make it extremely hard. Customize your person. Use the workshop and download many cool mods and maps. Do note  i do not hate these developers and i love there game.	Also, i thought we were getting creative mode. It has gone slient in the blog posts they do. Other then that. Have fun playing this game if you do get it and hopefully this review has helped you.I am however not recommending this game since i am very tired of being forgottion and the bad support. Also Thanks for breaking the map editor.			",80,15,4,4,17,3,6

Early Access Review
Everyone saying this game sucks or is dying or will never get completed because we don't have NPCs/Vehicles/Animations yet will always find something to complain about. Those things will get implemented and then they'll be screaming something new.I don't even remember when I picked up this game, but I figured my love for it is pretty set-in-stone so a review couldn't hurt. I am a die-hard zombie fan, so hearing zombie survival on a scale like Zomboid instantly pulled me in. Everything the Devs are trying to bring keep me here more. This game is a gem, and it should be looked at as such.The gameplay is phenomenal, but remember this is just my opinion. The experience is heightened with headphones to really pull you in to the world, but without it still remains a tense and exciting environment. The subtle fade of the smooth atmospheric music which dynamically changes with your setting really helps, be it surrounded by deadly zeds and hearing frantic violins or on a roof cooking over a campfire to a soft piano. I've found myself so immersed in the setting many times that I have to mentally step back and remember I'm playing a game.March 11th, 2017The main issue with current development is highly anticipated features are taking extra time to roll out after being teased not too long ago. Vehicles are getting good, promising attention at current time of writing. No sight of NPCs yet, but animations seem two shakes away from completion. My thought is animations and vehicles will have release dates around each other if not the same time, but that is probably best-case scenario.Pros- Immersive, well-designed world with developing storyline and random finds- Early access, so a lot can still happen (which takes time)- Complex building/crafting/cooking systems -- Build your survival base, or fortify existing structures. New metalworking has been added for increased defensive structures. Count your calories to maintain a healty diet in a dying world. (:- Character specialization -- Be a chef, lumberjack, thief, or more! Varying attribute points are given to really tweak your character's performance.Neutrals- Clunky combat -- Anything other than melee is questionable to me with low skills, and even that sometimes gets odd. (*see footnote for expansion on this)- I personally don't find the UI to be a nuisance, but I can understand players disliking it.- Early access, so a lot can still happen (which takes time)- I'll keep this one neutral as it bounces back and forth, but things can get arduous fast. Fortifying can turn into luring a horde away from base. Luring a horde away can turn into getting lost/hurt/off track. Simple things like going to get some food downstairs and now you've got a shattered shin. You'll understand when you play.Cons- Early access, so a lot can still happen (which takes time, and has). This is what holds up a lot of people from enjoying what you have, and instead focusing on what you don't have. Early development is going to be a rollercoaster, and things will get halted for reasons that won't always get explained clearly if at all. You have to understand this if you wish to assist in early development. I believe in this title, and I believe it could grow to be a massively entertaining experience for a lot of people.- There is a slight lack-of-life to the world (no pun intended). No abandoned vehicles littering the roads, not much in the way of saying ""there was an outbreak and panic ensued"" other than TV or radio broadcasts during initial infection. Devs are working on introducing more world-clutter like this, but more important features take the front seat.I could write an even longer post and say so much more but you should really just experience it for yourself.(*In all my hours of playing, I haven't played with the guns too much other than shotguns and pistols. I have no clue how the aiming and reloading skills work at high skill levels because I've never gotten there myself.)March 28th, 2017Reading over some other helpful reviews and I was reminded how old this Early Access is. Correct, but you must remember that we are not playing the same exact version we used to play. They reworked the entire system a year or so ago. Hell, they even increased the resolution of textures. If the game isn't fun to you as-is, it won't be fun to you when the damned NPCs/Anims/Vehicles get added because you won't enjoy the CORE game.We've got active updates on two of the three long-awaited mechanics and people are still flailing about, damning Zomboid to development hell. Vehicles are being polished, and Animations are pretty much complete, what else do you want? You want it on a silver platter, immediately. Don't choose Early Access if you can't wait patiently.

Early Access Review
								Early Access Review:For a game that's premise is over-saturated, Project Zomboid stands unique and fresh compared to it's peers. Project Zomboid isn't your typical zombie game nor your typical survival horror game. Project Zomboid is more of a simulator than an RPG. When playing, you'll get frustrated so many times before actually getting the hang of everything as for PZ is a roguelike, once your survivor dies, he/she is dead forever. No matter how far your progress or big your fortress. Many of which mistakes you'll make is mostly because you got too over your head, or just plain stupidity. But once you get how the game goes, you'll surely live to see another day, maybe months.To fully enjoy the game, one must stop looking at this game as a survival RPG, and more of a survival sim. With the word simulator being said, this means managing, scheduling and farming. Think of it as a mash-up of The Sims + Farmville + Old-School Zombies. You gather supplies and build a base of operations where you can store your supplies and gear or maybe start a farm for food supplies. You can also choose to be a nomad and move from place to place.Moreover on being a simulator, you have to take care of your survivors needs, hunger, boredom and health should be taken care of and maintained well regularly. You can't just sit all day and wait. As you build your base, the game adds a Farmville + Tower Defense vibe to it. Make sure though you don't go gathering supplies at night as it gets pretty dark and dangerous. With this scheduling is also important, make sure you make a to-do list for the day, patience pays in this game, some areas are so infested that you have to postpone your scheduled scanveging trip. Everything is important in this game, make sure to gather everything for maybe in the future you may need it. For an Early Access Game, Project Zomboid is already filled with hours and hours of fun gameplay, as everything in the main gameplay is there, surviving, scavenging, building. It is announced and on paper though that NPC's will be added to give the game a more immersive feel and dynamic events. I personally am looking forward for the NPC's, imagine with the amount of different kinds of gameplay all mashed together in one added with NPC's and dynamic events all together can put this game into another way crazier level.I totally recommend this game for everyone, especially for people who are up for a challenge.

								I originally had recommended this game, but I feel that I am unable to anymore. As people have pointed out, the updates have come to almost a complete halt. The devs get very angry when anyone points out that their updates are rather uncommon, and protest that they're doing their best to get everything out, which I don't doubt, but the delayed updates are pretty tiresome.As well, the game has become much more centred around multiplayer than anything else, with the latest patch being entirely based around multiplayer, save the two maps which are both multi and singleplayer.

After i ate the melons i said screw it and grabbed my kitchen knife (which seems over powered to me) and started one shot killing zeds by slicing them in the head untill it broke and i got severly gangbanged10/10 would roleplay again			",61,10,4,17,15,0,13

								So... You think to yourself... Is this game REALLY worth buying? Do I really want to invest a rough $15.00 USD on this game? Well, lets start! This game places you into the middle of a zombie apocalypse... Literally, in the middle... You're heavily outnumbered...It 1 vs. 900,000+... Or something.Its survival too! Not bashing around, practically eating away at the zombie population, with a shotgun and infinite shells... in fact, shooting a shotgun will get you CHOMPED! This game has you making decisions, that are YOUR decisions. 'Do I go into the city to find better resources, or stay in the suburbs, living off meagre supplies?'.Choices like that, really.Zombies are also a threat, guys... Not the Mamby Pamby zombies we all know... ITS THE WALKING DEAD MATE! They wanna eat'cha! And'll break into buildings to do so! They also follow sound... so when you hear a helicopter come by, happily point that one middle finger at it and scream! Your death WILL come, there's no hope... this is how YOU died! Not survived! Heh, that would defy the whole purpose of the game! DYING!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game is an excellent simulator for anybody who doesn't mind a bit of hardcore permadeath. If you die in this game, it's game over. No second chances, no revivals. Straight back to the main menu. The game does a very good job of handling the things you would feel in a zombie apocolypse. Stress, Lack of sleep, Pain, Panic, the full monty. It uses a rather unique ""Moodles"" system. It has different tiers of emotions that you go through, for instance anxiety, onto stress, onto extreme stress, onto terrified. The game has it's problems. For example they use both a number system and a moodles system and it gets confusing. I don't mind the moodles system, in fact I admire the originality but I would say make the number stats system visible too.On the whole I really appreciate the game, it has brilliant developers, posting the oh-so amazing mondoids and with a sense of humor anyone'd die for.  Keep up the good work, dev team if you're reading this, and if you're thinking of buying the game, I say go for it as long as you don't mind a bit of hardcore. It has LOADS to do to keep you busy and theres constantly new features as well as the option to go back to the previous build. The price is great too, it's nice and compact and the animation is pretty darn good. Thanks for reading, Ickleslimer.			",114,11,4,8,15,1,15

								This is possibly the best experience you will have with a post-apocalyspe genre. This game has so many features in its early version. There are hundreds of different items and foods. Tools, weapons, and materials can be used to create entire buildings up to several stories tall. There is a simple crafting system allowing you to use improvised weapons and tools as well. Carpentry, farming and cooking all of in-depth systems and recipes to get what you want and need to survive more successfully than your predecessors. You can get trapped on the second story of a building and be trapped by a ravenous horde controlling the first floor. You can choose to risk your health and life to jump out the window and make your dashing escape with or without injury...or you can rip off the curtains and tie them into a rope stable enough to lower yourself down and out of the infested building. Scavenging a local house you can open a closet to find a zombie who then rushes you and sinks his teeth into your neck. Even if you destroy him and survive you only have mere hours, possibly days before you turn. All this and more is in this game currently but don't be fooled. This is NOT a complete and perfect game. Several in-game items have no purpose even when they look useful and several items and weapons have placeholder icons or textures. Planned and promised features are aplenty such as vehicles and NPCs. This is a small developement team and will take its time making this game even greater than it already is turning out to be, be patient and you'll get a survival experience like no other.

								Zomboid is probably the first real _survival_ game I've ever played. Forget survival horror, stupid stuff like that: this is the real deal. Yes, it's yet another zombie apocalipse game, but I think it's the first I've ever loved (I hate zombies since Doom... and Resident Evil made it no less boring for me). The game attempts at mimicking reality goes a long way. Your character gets depressed, bored, sick; You have to avoid rain, can't carry a lot of weight... In fact, the only thing missing is having to use the bathroom, which, actually, is not really missed.I strongly recomment this game. It's not a real sandbox - it's a game were you test your wisdom to see how long you can survive.			",85,21,1,5,15,0,15

								In a world where zombies are a cultural norm, it is easy to get bored from all the same old zombie games that pop out everywhere.. There are those games... And then there is Project Zomboid... Project Zomboid asks you one simple question, ""When will you die?"" You must fight to survive and delay your impending doom but what sets this game apart from every other zombie game is the realistic sandbox survival tone the game gives. Although it can be frustrating in the beginning due to the steep learning curves and it's hardcore permadeath YOLO style, you will have a ton of fun surviving until your demise and can't help but start the process all over again.

								REWRITTEN 9-8-2016:(tl;dr at very end)To sum up this game in one long sentence, it is a rogue-like (look it up if you don't know) hyper-realistic (about as real as zombies get) survival (o boi) zombie apocalypse game. You have been warned.This game is not for everyone, simply because it is a rogue-like (or like one, in the major ways). You will die. You will lose everything. (then you make a new character in the same world) And that is a FREAKIN TOUGH CONCEPT for people to wrap their minds around. This game is recommended because I ♥♥♥♥ing love that concept and I know if you love it too, you'll want this game. Before I get into gameplay, I'll dedicate this chunk to the dev team. They want to have real conversations with you about the game. People talk hella mad♥♥♥♥♥♥about them because a single misunderstanding turns a normal conversation into, well, an internet one. Some bash on the game, most bash on the update speed. This game updates slow. Slower than anyone likes. You will probably take really long breaks between plays. I do. But it's perfectly okay, because the updates are never cut off (and with the game in its current state, its kinda worth the 15 bucks). Poor devs just get bashed because they're making a rogue-like zombie apoc sim. This is probably the truest zombie apoc game you can have, if you want that hardcore survival. Again, not for everyone. Not nearly for everyone. And the people that don't understand that spoil the game's name, community, and devs, when all three are actually respectable.Moving on to gameplay. I won't go too in-depth, because a rogue-like survival zombie sim sums it up. Everything you can think of in a real life zombie apocalypse is in this game, or being added, or will be added, or will be modded in. Still in alpha. Patience. Again, slow updates kill games for a lot of people (beyond understandable), but if you would really want this game, then that means ""the longer I wait, the better my cake will be."" Yet again, you have been warned.I totally missed my gameplay point, so I'll talk about the actual game now in its current state (Build 34.28):-zombies-short-term ""OH MY GOD HOW AM I GOING TO SURVIVE"" of looting runs, scrounging up a safehouse, and trying to not die-medium-term ""ok... ima build up my safehouse"" of stockpiling, trying to avoid the hordes, and building a sexy base-long term waiting for plants to grow and not having much excitement until you ultimately decide to put the game down/zombies happenfew weeks or months pass...big update boislets do it all againOR-you get bit and have to start all over (or make a new character in your world) Sounds repetitive, I know. But that's what makes it fun. There's a little more to do each time you play, making it a little more fun. Maybe spice it up with some difficulty, or some mods. Again, you haveth been warned, not a lot of people like gaming like this.Mods... PZ is a vanilla game. Not a lot to do. Really. By the time you have a safehouse, it's done. Mods add more flavor to every aspect of the game, and to be honest, they make the game. Many kudos to the devs for realizing this, and making the game so easily moddable.REVIEW NUMBER TIME: 9/10I've wanted a game like this my entire life. I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. I love Rogue, I love Nethack, I love zombies, and I love stuff with a lot of customizing (in the form of mods, in this case). This is my kind of game.BUT IS IT YOURS?If no, I'm sorry you read this much, but don't get the game, or you'll end up like one of those poor people who get caught up in a storm of misunderstanding.If yes, buy it. It will get boring and repetitive, but the game never stops growing. Cherish that.-----READ ON IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE NPC SITUATION IS (or if you don't)-----NPCs were in the game in pre alpha. They sucked. Devs knew that, it was only a test, etc. so they took it out. Now, beyond 7+ (maybe more, maybe less) years later, no NPCs. Why? The game needs to be finished first. If you can write NPC code, help the devs out. If you can't, don't complain, because it won't help anyone in any way whatsoever. They will come, even if it has to be in a mod. Don't be impatient and throw an internet tantrum over it, because it's worthless. Patience. Legit AI probably won't happen, but I want better NPCs than before, and I'm totally okay with not rushing it. Again, if you want to buy this for NPCs, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED OMGtl;dr If you're okay with knowing you're going to die in game then take a few month long irl break from the game AND know this is a roguelike hyper-realistic survival apocalypse game that gets slowly SLOWLY but surely and steadily updated, buy it. If not, move on. and the devs aren't actually total♥♥♥♥♥♥ they're just a dev team, dear god, lay off them			",35,3,0,1,3,0,3

								This is a game that really made me happy for buying it. It is a game that really makes you appreciate the little things.Like chocolate helps when you are depressed or that you can emty glasbottles to make room for water in them!This game gives a true survival experience in a very unique way. The game has these charming graphics and music which gives the game this awesome post-apocalyptic feeling. The game gets harder the longer you survive, the electricity goes out and the water does not run anymore after a few weeks. No electricity makes it harder to find prestine food and limited water makes you force to scavange for more. Over time your character gets better in certern skills from combat to gathering, depending on what you have been doing. Weapons and odds for survival run out, how long can you survive?With updates like cars and npc's coming up you should really try to get yourself a copy and feel the difference that every update has to offer. Although even if the map feels big I think this game needs a bigger one when vehicles are getting added to the game. But thats why we have a great thing called the workshop eh?!For now I give this game a 8/10 when it comes to experience, but that could change with the upcoming updates.Are you are a person that loves survival and open world, or just lurking to find unique gameplay? This is a game for you!			",99,7,2,21,9,0,4

								First, try the demo. Did you like it? If so, then I suggest you consider the following things about Project Zomboid:1. This game is an ""Early Access Game"" that is under development and is not a finished product.2. Many parts of the game (survivors, fire, parts of the map) are a part of that unfinished product.3. The game is playable, but overall, does not offer much in the way of varied play style and things to do within the PZ world.4. The devs are promising that multiplayer will one day be a factor of gameplay, but it IS NOT currently in the game.5. This is a very, very bare bones sandbox, zombie survival game, but it is still enjoyable and playable!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They want to have real conversations with you about the game. People talk hella mad♥♥♥♥♥♥about them because a single misunderstanding turns a normal conversation into, well, an internet one. Some bash on the game, most bash on the update speed. This game updates slow. Slower than anyone likes. You will probably take really long breaks between plays. I do. But it's perfectly okay, because the updates are never cut off (and with the game in its current state, its kinda worth the 15 bucks). Poor devs just get bashed because they're making a rogue-like zombie apoc sim. This is probably the truest zombie apoc game you can have, if you want that hardcore survival. Again, not for everyone. Not nearly for everyone. And the people that don't understand that spoil the game's name, community, and devs, when all three are actually respectable.Moving on to gameplay. I won't go too in-depth, because a rogue-like survival zombie sim sums it up. Everything you can think of in a real life zombie apocalypse is in this game, or being added, or will be added, or will be modded in. Still in alpha. Patience. Again, slow updates kill games for a lot of people (beyond understandable), but if you would really want this game, then that means ""the longer I wait, the better my cake will be."" Yet again, you have been warned.I totally missed my gameplay point, so I'll talk about the actual game now in its current state (Build 34.28):-zombies-short-term ""OH MY GOD HOW AM I GOING TO SURVIVE"" of looting runs, scrounging up a safehouse, and trying to not die-medium-term ""ok... ima build up my safehouse"" of stockpiling, trying to avoid the hordes, and building a sexy base-long term waiting for plants to grow and not having much excitement until you ultimately decide to put the game down/zombies happenfew weeks or months pass...big update boislets do it all againOR-you get bit and have to start all over (or make a new character in your world) Sounds repetitive, I know. But that's what makes it fun. There's a little more to do each time you play, making it a little more fun. Maybe spice it up with some difficulty, or some mods. Again, you haveth been warned, not a lot of people like gaming like this.Mods... PZ is a vanilla game. Not a lot to do. Really. By the time you have a safehouse, it's done. Mods add more flavor to every aspect of the game, and to be honest, they make the game. Many kudos to the devs for realizing this, and making the game so easily moddable.REVIEW NUMBER TIME: 9/10I've wanted a game like this my entire life. I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. I love Rogue, I love Nethack, I love zombies, and I love stuff with a lot of customizing (in the form of mods, in this case). This is my kind of game.BUT IS IT YOURS?If no, I'm sorry you read this much, but don't get the game, or you'll end up like one of those poor people who get caught up in a storm of misunderstanding.If yes, buy it. It will get boring and repetitive, but the game never stops growing. Cherish that.-----READ ON IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE NPC SITUATION IS (or if you don't)-----NPCs were in the game in pre alpha. They sucked. Devs knew that, it was only a test, etc. so they took it out. Now, beyond 7+ (maybe more, maybe less) years later, no NPCs. Why? The game needs to be finished first. If you can write NPC code, help the devs out. If you can't, don't complain, because it won't help anyone in any way whatsoever. They will come, even if it has to be in a mod. Don't be impatient and throw an internet tantrum over it, because it's worthless. Patience. Legit AI probably won't happen, but I want better NPCs than before, and I'm totally okay with not rushing it. Again, if you want to buy this for NPCs, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED OMGtl;dr If you're okay with knowing you're going to die in game then take a few month long irl break from the game AND know this is a roguelike hyper-realistic survival apocalypse game that gets slowly SLOWLY but surely and steadily updated, buy it. If not, move on. and the devs aren't actually total♥♥♥♥♥♥ they're just a dev team, dear god, lay off them			",35,3,0,1,3,0,3

								One of the best zombie games I have played.  Despite some short comings (which they are still working on) this game is just fanstastic! ProsRealism without going over the top like some zombie games.Combat is really enjoyable once you get the hang of it.Why more fun with friends and can PVP.Can play sandox and customize from rather easy zombies to ""true zombies"" as they call it.Can do cool stuff like use a rope (or make one from sheet) to climb out a window if the house gets flooded with zombies.One of the best inventory system ever. (IMO) MIght take a bit getting used to but just make sense in terms of reaslism.ConsBecoming sick from zombie bite or sratch can be OP at times (like after 25 days and like 700 zombie kills one just scratches me and its game over.)  but as I pointed out you can changed that in sandbox if you dont like it.Missing stuff like cars (imo)Lack of other things to do such as more crafting like modding weapons more then just nailed bat and sawed off. Lack of firearm types (only pistol, shutgun, and varrmint rifle at the moment) I would like to see a couple types of each and even assault rifles SMGs, sniper rifles, you know. No in game map (like I cant find a map of my local area map at every gas station or store) but you can find one online. Most of the stuff in Cons are all stuff that very well will be fixed by full release, but as of now they are cons.  All in all I give this a 8 out of 10 which is damn good considering its still ""early access"".			",147,19,2,30,11,3,13

								I don't ever write long reviews so here it goes....I've have played a few zombie sandbox games (WarZ which is now Infestation, DayZ , 7 Days to Die) and I would have to say I think this is the best one out of all of them. Im not a big fan of birds eye view but this one does at solid job at doing it. You only see whats in your view which means you are forced to turn around to check behind you, I love this. It really gives the game a sense of paranoia and will always have you on your toes. The survial aspect of game is what really sells it, you will constantly be scavenging for food, water, weapons, items to use (crafting, repairing, etc.) and even have the temp. against you (hyperthermia, hypothermia). Your character even has Moodles, which means what your person is feeling. He/she can be stressed, angry, bleeding, bored, exhausted, etc. There are ways of dealing with these like write a journal, smoke cigs, drink whiskey, read a newspaper, magazine, etc..... BUY THIS GAME!!!!!			",45,3,0,6,0,0,0

								This will be a bit long, so just bear with me.A truly great game. Rather unique and open-world. There are hardly any restrictions in the game, although you might want to keep your head clear of such reckless thoughts in this survival game, or else you'll likely get killed early-on. The longest I've survived was 11 days, which I still feel quite swell of. As others have said, PZ isn't just an average zombie game that gives you a shot-gun and has you blowing zombie brains all over with no actual back-story (Did I mention that?), it's an excellent zombie game that gives you choices and has your heart pacing to run from that monger zombie pack... That's every-where. I also have another unique thing to say.YOU CAN OPEN EVERY SINGLE DOOR IN THE GAME! VERY few games have this ability. Skyrim, Oblivion, Minecraft... And PZ are the only games I've ever seen like this. GTA 5/4/3/2/1, Watch Dogs, Brink, and a bunch of other still-cool games haven't implemented this. Not only can you open every door in the game, but you can barricade every door in the game, break down every door in the game, and look through every door in the game (As long as it has a window.)ALSO! Another unique feature! The entire damn thing is pre-loaded! While you're waiting a possibly grueling 5-10 minutes, you don't realize that you dun have to wait for any more loading! Well, except for a second or two as the map loads. No long pauses between frikkin' opening doors, no quick loads between 6-week-long ship rides, PZ never loads again (Save for the occasional quick map load.) I've never seen these two, simultaneously, oh wait Minecraft. Never mind.Now, lemme cover some of the ""features"" this game says it has.Sandbox zombie survival game. ---- No lie here. You can do a very many of things that allow this to be true. Check.Full line of sight system and real-time lighting, sound and visibility mechanics. Hide in the shadows, keep quiet and keep the lights off at night, or at least hang sheets over the windows. ---- Lol yup. They didn't just implement a quick attention system where, if you come with-in a certain range, they 'see' you. No matter what. If you're sneaking, zombies will likely not detect you if they're more than 3 meters away. If you sneak up on a zombie trying to burglarize a posh house and steal it's meaty, succulent, intelligient riches, it won't likely notice you until you're fondling it, if you have the Graceful ability. Check.Vast and growing map (loosely based on a real world location) for you to explore, loot and set up your fortress. Check out Blindcoder’s map project: http://pzmap.crash-override.net/ ---- Well, maybe. I haven't explored all coners of either map, although it didn't take long before I hit the ocean, and couldn't swim. NOOOO!!! Now I'll never earn my Blue Ribbon for Best Swimmer! Bah. No check.Use tools and items to craft weapons, barricade and cook. You can even build zombie proof forts by chopping trees, sawing wood and scavenging supplies. ---- Yes. Check, check, check, check, check, oh wait, really? Check. Scavenging for supplies is simply *Italicize*Essential with a capital ""E""*italicize* during the early part of the game. Later on, you can grow your own crops, but it'll likely take a little while before you can successfully build/find a secure, efficient, and sufficient garden/farm. If you don't, you'll die with-in the first hour. Check.Deal with depression, boredom, hunger, thirst and illness while trying to survive. ---- I have actually encountered all of these during my play time. And, I may be speaking out of my♥♥♥♥♥♥ but they seemed to have an excellent system of seeing your character's needs. Say they've been damaged. You/They don't know exactly how much damage they've taken, nerve bundle for muscle tissue (Which is ridiculous. Do you know exactly how many veins/arteries have been punctured when you're shot in the arm? Yes? Well you too.), but you have an icon that gives you a generalization of how much they have. Not too precise, not too broad. Check.Day turns to night. The electricity falters. Hordes migrate. Winter draws in. Society is in freefall. Day turns to night with-in a reasonable time allotation (You can alter this in Sandbox mode.) I haven't actually first-handedly experienced the electricity being cut off, but then again, I've only survived for eleven days at max.  Hordes migrate. I dunno, maybe. Winter draws in. Again, only eleven days. Society is in free-fall. Aye. Possibly check, not sure.Farming, trapping, fishing, carpentry, character customization, skills and perks that develop based on what you do in-game. Check. 'Nuff said.Hundreds of zombies with swarm mechanics and in-depth visual and hearing systems. Correct. They will group with each other in close packs if you accumulate enough. And if you have moderate-sized pack even, don't run. Hide. You can't run, but you can hide. (See what I did there?) Now trust me, you want a rather large sized house, break in through the window, lock your-self in the top floor, stay quiet for a good day, and hope for the best. Check.Proper zombies that don’t run. (Unless you tell them to in the sandbox menu). Check. You can alter the speed of the zombies in Sandbox mode, but normally they max their speed out at a solid jog.A ton of amazing atmospheric music tracks by the prodigy that is Zach Beever. Ohmigosh, yas. Zach made tracks that can make you scared, sad, bad♥♥♥♥♥ excited, and maybe even... Happy?(?) I dunno, but check.Instant action ‘Last Stand’ mode, on top of our Sandbox and Survival mode. I dunno, haven't played Last Stand.Full, open and powerful Lua modding support. I'll just say ""Check"" for now.Online multiplayer survival with persistent player run servers. Yes. Check. Multiple player-created servers, but they seem to be a bit of a pain to enter.Over-all, horribly great game. It's addictive, yet it's the kind of addiction that you love to hate. In the right way. Also, another thing. You can-not save in the game. Well, when you log off, your progress is saved, but if you die, you die. You have to start all over again. 'Course, you can spawn a brand-new character near your last character's death place.9/10.Although, I still do have a few suggestions.1. In Sandbox mode, you should certainly be able to modify your character far beyond just the Survival perk pick. You should be able to alter their speed, strength, biological defenses, physcial defenses, mental defenses, and their ability to survive with/with-out certain things/mental states.2. You should be able to add as many survivors as wished in Sand-box mode.3. I kind of think the perk pick in Survivl should be a bit more lenient.4. This game should become big. Like, WoW-big.

								So... You think to yourself... Is this game REALLY worth buying? Do I really want to invest a rough $15.00 USD on this game? Well, lets start! This game places you into the middle of a zombie apocalypse... Literally, in the middle... You're heavily outnumbered...It 1 vs. 900,000+... Or something.Its survival too! Not bashing around, practically eating away at the zombie population, with a shotgun and infinite shells... in fact, shooting a shotgun will get you CHOMPED! This game has you making decisions, that are YOUR decisions. 'Do I go into the city to find better resources, or stay in the suburbs, living off meagre supplies?'.Choices like that, really.Zombies are also a threat, guys... Not the Mamby Pamby zombies we all know... ITS THE WALKING DEAD MATE! They wanna eat'cha! And'll break into buildings to do so! They also follow sound... so when you hear a helicopter come by, happily point that one middle finger at it and scream! Your death WILL come, there's no hope... this is how YOU died! Not survived! Heh, that would defy the whole purpose of the game! DYING!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is by far one of my most favorite games to date! It blends the minutia of management of supplies with the frantic running, scavenging and fighting of a great action game.  It has fun, believable crafting and RPG elements, with the ability to really customize your experience. You can modify the difficulty in various ways from rarity of spawns, type or speed of zombies, what kind of weather, how long the day is, etc.  Also, this game is amazingly fun and easy to modify. As a modder myself, I can attest, with a little trial and error you can get the hang of the lua coding fairly easily. The modding and forum community is over at the Indie Stone forums is fantastic, there are incredible mods already (some of which the dev have fully implemented in the game like the Erosion mod). On that same note, the Devs are responsive and willing to take and respond to criticism/suggestions. Also, there are weekly progress updates so you don't have to worry about the game being abandoned by the devs.So, moral of the story, BUY THIS GAME. I have played many other zombie games (which I loved) like Left 4 Dead, State of Decay, etc. but this one tops the list by a long shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Zombie apocalypse survival sim at it's finest. The game is still in early acces but every addition to it has been nothing but amazing. You have to scavenge around abandoned buildings for supplies to survive off and if you decide to, build your own fort in the midst of the zombie apocalypse. Incredibly immersive with its wound and crafting system that allow you to build things like spiked baseball bats and sawn-off shotguns. Despite it not really being a horror game exactly it still manages to get a good jump out of you when you're investigating houses and some zombie decided to hide in a corner you can't see it. The community of developers does an incredible job of rolling out updates and keeping the fanbase informed and there's even a modding communiy. Just get this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is a great game, especially considering that its still in Alpha!  There are still a lot of bugs and it runs slowly and crashes at times but it is reletively playable in it's current state. As long as you are prepared to cope with these I'd deffinitely recommend buying this game in Alpha or at least trying out the demo if you're unsure.Some areas I hope they work on or prioritise in future releases/fixes;- Improve controls and sneaking machanic (currently sneaking doesn't seem to work well).  It would be great to be able to hide as well (maybe in some containers like bins or wardrobes).- It would be nice to see even more weapons, features and items you can create in later releases.- While most of the music is excellent I also hope they remove the tracks with the woman wailing over the top (it just doesn't suit the game well.  The instrumental tracks are far better!).  - It would also be nice if they allowed you to turn the permadeath mode on/off in the options.- Improve speed of the game (sounds like this i currently in planning)- Add the ability to fix aging weapons- More explanation of the current ailments (although currently this can be found on their wiki - search google for 'Moodles')- I look forward to NPC additions and I hope you can use them for fighting or carrying more items.- Add items like carts you could build to transport lots of items long distances (i.e. if movig out to a country retreat).- Improve the perk system.  It'd be nice to add a few positive perks without having to add negative ones (a lot of which are quite severely impacting).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A zombie survival game that truly simulates a real zombie apocalypse without being mundane like other games. Pros-Hunger and thirst system that is deeper than most (Calories and fats)-Smart AI-Meaningful updates-Weekly Devblogs -Working multiplayer-Big variety of foods-Intricate food system-Deep character creation-Nice soundtrack-World is filled with lots of things to interact with (Trees to harvest for wood, foraging in the forest for berries, etc.)-Lots of things to do (Barricade safehouse, kill zombies to reduce the risk of an attack)Cons-Some items don't have a dedicated model, but they are already working on it for the next update-No npcs yet, since they would complete the game. (They are also working on this as well)-No cars yet (This as well)Overall this is my all time favorite zombie game. This game actually gives you loads of choices on how to survive. You actually need to secure a safehouse and then make sure zombies or bandits can't break in. You actually need to make sure your food is in a safe place or else it will rot. There are lots of things that relate to real life which is what makes this game so fun.			",182,22,4,12,10,2,10

								I have played this game from near the beginning in its 0.1.5d build and the improvement and commitment they have shown to this game has been great with a weekly blog on there website telling people what their up to and how the game is progressing and as of this review they have continued to expand the already massive map and have even added in a Mall for players to run around (and most likely get eaten) in and they are hoping to bring in NPC survivers for you to kill/rob/team up with in your quest to live for as long as possible in a world filled with zombiesI would say buy the game now while it's cheap, watch a Let's play or review if your unsure to see it for yourself and enjoy the features they have put in and look forward to the new ones as they roll in			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Opinion:Its a great game if you are the fan of a zombie survival genre. It has a steep learning curve which will get you killed in your early lives playing it. You ever wanted to setup a base at a Gas Station - now you can. You can establish a base anywhere from a self built hut in the forest to a diner off the freeway, some buildings of course are more practical for survival (houses,motels etc). Just remember you need a place with multiple exits and thats has the basic survival aspects. The game itself looks exremely good it doesn't need good graphics I personally feel that it would ruin the atmosphere. But the lighting and the vision effect is a nice touch to deepen the atmosphere. I'd say its a must buy - but TRY THE DEMO.As for multiplayer, its a great experience if you team up with friends. You have to learn how to cope when everywhere you loot has already been scavenged. I remember raiding a house with a kitchen knife and finding a group of dead people on the second floor in a closet. They were loaded with supplies - I just got lucky but Multiplayer doesn't summarise the game up in hole as its mostly a single player game and regardless on which mode you play on you'll always find it tense!Survival is key as you can make a character very skilled only to die from something as silly as eating off meat. So try to establish a base and get non perishable food at first, eat all the perishables early on. Try to get a farm setup and a water source, as you'll need it once the Water + Electricity runs out which is random (unless your in sandbox).Edit,Got a lot better recently with more content and more playability. Animations soon which'll change the gameplay completely.			",245,38,8,28,30,3,29

								This game is fun even for being in early access. Where this game really shines is with the multiplayer in the state its in right now the MP is a little hard for new people to figure out. With that aside what made me pick up the game is it reminded me of old school games like Roller Coaster tycoon with is asymmetric art style. witch is my favorite video game art style. Its from a bird's eye perspective, you can only see what's in front of you such as… if there is a zombie in front of you and you turnaround the zombie disappears until you look at it again. Its a hard game to get a hold of, there is no tutorial to tell you how to fight or do anything. There is no way you can “win” the game on the loading screen it tells you “This Is How You Die.” The only this in the game are zombies and you. They are close to finishing the NPC. When they add them I will start playing again but for now its gotten a little boring but I still recommend this game if you want a hard game to play. BUY THIS			",111,14,4,5,8,4,2

This is hands down, without a shadow of a doubt, my favorite indie game. Worth more than the price tag, which is rare. Most games tend to fall short or just ""cut it"" for the time you get to play.

								10/10 It's the only survival game that actuallys feels like a survival game that I've been able to find in awhile, Or one that can provide a bit of a challenge. Sandbox is currently just like survival with just the ability to make things harder or easier than normal survival mode. Which it has been fun watching insane amount of zombies with the best hearing and sight slaughter me(lol) You'll be forced to look for food, ammo, and medical supplies while trying not to get your face eaten by a zombie, Or become infected while trying to also keep your character happy. It has quite a few elements with moods and skills that makes this game more interesting than most other games out there currently.Only complaint I have currently is the lighting, The lights tend to not actually brighten some rooms up much. Which isn't a big deal just a minor inconvince. Regardless if you're looking for a zombie survival game this one is a good one for a change. Worth every penny I spent and more!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So I played this game from a family-shared account  becuase the name cought my eye. but then i couldno stop not becuase it had terribly innovative gameplay or becuase it was realistic (its not but thats okay) but becuase the audio was bueatyful it was so perfect for the game like for example suppose you were puttering about in your safehouse there would be no audio but if you turned around and there was a zombie it would make a startleing sound so as to make a OH MY GOSH type panic effect  and then if you then ran from that zombie and started searching a random house for a wepon while it started to break down your door it would play this really dramatic music(witch fits the mood perfectley) then suppose it broke down the door it would transiton the music(to a more urgent type tune) so perfectley that you dont lose any of that inital OH MY GOSH panic effect effect. All of this is done so well that the game sterts to transmit the emotion of the game.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS DONE SO WELL EVER.I also really like the system for makeing your charcter the way the starting buffs/debuffs is really good and it is really big and well drawn out map(espicaly for a handmade map)			",35,2,0,2,6,1,5

								Very worthy game for the price it currently holds, which you never know could end up increasing when the early acess stage is completed. Why do this? first, watch the first video explaining the elements of the game, Now. This game goes very deep when it comes to way to survive and die. You can die by many accounts, the most common being eaten by a zombie. However there are ways to survive out in the wild with hunting and camping ( as stated in the video ) they are not lying! it is all possible for only $15 and they could increase the price if they really wanted to. Try the demo and put a little bit of thought in to it. the rest is up to you.			",67,6,1,4,7,1,3

Early Access Review
								Probably one of the best survival games I've played, period. I've played it since the early days on Desura, and it's grown immensely since then. It's also one of a small number of Early Access games I'll actually endorse playing in an unfinished state.Yeah, it's another zombie game, but it's explored routes that other zombie survival games have barely even considered. Sleep, hunger, and thirst are something you have to watch for obviously, yes, but at the same time there's also fear, pain, depression, boredom, sickness, even temperature is taken into consideration. And everything will affect your character in some way.It has one of the most comprehensive damage systems I've ever seen. Rather than just ""You've taken damage! Don't let your health hit 0!"", there's more to it than that. Scratches, bites, fractures, burns, infections, and bleeding can occur in all of your limbs, requiring you to take appropriate action to treat. One time I had to barricade myself in a room to perform extensive treatment; I had a deep wound in my arm from climbing in through a broken window, complete with a glass shard stuck in my character's arm. I had to remove the glass shard with tweezers, disinfect the wound, stitch it, bandage it, and keep an eye on it in case the bandage became dirty. And while it wasn't necessary, I sterilized the bandage while I was at it. Healing is something that takes place over time- unlike other games where you heal instantaneously, you'll only get better if you take care of your injuries and rest. They can even become infected if you don't take proper care of them. It's a level of realism that I've legitimately never seen in another game, and I appreciate that they took the time to implement it.One thing I like is that zombies are actually a threat in this game; one or two might not be so bad if you're properly armed, but a horde busting down a door when you're in a tight hallway is beyond horrifying. You can't just be a super zombie slayer like Tallahassee from Zombieland or any character from The Walking Dead; you have to be careful, observant, and patient. Busting through a door without any regard to what may be on the other side could be harmless... or you could walk straight into a dozen zombies that have already swarmed you before you can react. And once a group of zombies has you, you're done for. GG. Been nice knowing you.Most of all though, Project Zomboid understands what it means to be a survival game. While there is multiplayer as well as single player, it's not just a PvP manhunt disguised as a surival game like DayZ. PvP does exist, but even if you are in multiplayer, more often than not you have other concerns as opposed to hunting down other players for their food (though it is possible.) It places PvE first and foremost- it's you against the world, and the world is full of dead things. And depression, and the lack of food, and houses with alarms to alert said dead things, and uncertainty, and many other things out to ruin your day and get you killed. PvP is merely an additional feature in multiplayer, and far from required.There's so many things I could go into about this game and why it's one of the best survival games out there. Best suggestion I can give is to play it for yourself. If you're a fan of survival games, this is probably one of the most intense survival games you'll find- good enough to rival Don't Starve [Together], and that's saying something, as Don't Starve is one of the best survival games on Steam.

The Isometric style graphcs give the game a unique style and with great realism, Music, Multiplayer and an awesome mascot (Spiffo The Raccoon), this game is hard not to want tp play.If You havent heard of this game before and are curious as to what its about, then i fully recomend you get the game! Pleas be aware though, this game is still in active development and in purchasing the game you are willing to put up with bugs and glitches.Also if you are worried about future updates and the dreaded thought of having to pay each time an update is released, have no fear as all upcoming updates are free once the game is purchased meaning that you will get the finished game too (When it is released of course)So yeah, I cannot reccomend this game any more than I already have. It's definitely worth the buy and so I strongly urge that you try it out!!! =D			",38,1,4,3,3,0,1

But that is to be expected with the game being in alpha stages of development, with splitscreen and multiplayer, planned to be added in the future, this game will be amazing.			",81,10,0,7,3,0,11

								Has potential, but is a bit unforgiving with fiddly controls at the moment. There's also graphical slowdowns, but that's to be expected from an un-optimised alpha.Currently it feels like a game that needs you to play whilst having the wiki open on another screen. It's unclear as to how cooking works for example, and systems overall rely on an awful lot of trial and error, something you don't really have a lot of time for.Controls are also a bit awkward at the moment too, feeling unresponsive and arbitrary.But the potential is huge. I don't think there's a zombie survival sim out there with as much depth as this one's attempting.			",325,39,3,57,23,1,37

I can't comment on the multiplayer as I haven't tried it yet, but i've been having a blast playing single player. Sandbox mode also lets you customize the zombies, allowing you to change their speed, toughness, senses, you can even change how people get infected and how long it takes.			",278,33,10,42,50,2,54

								Has potential, but is a bit unforgiving with fiddly controls at the moment. There's also graphical slowdowns, but that's to be expected from an un-optimised alpha.Currently it feels like a game that needs you to play whilst having the wiki open on another screen. It's unclear as to how cooking works for example, and systems overall rely on an awful lot of trial and error, something you don't really have a lot of time for.Controls are also a bit awkward at the moment too, feeling unresponsive and arbitrary.But the potential is huge. I don't think there's a zombie survival sim out there with as much depth as this one's attempting.			",325,39,3,57,23,1,37

								Great game, very in depth and no serious gamebreaking bugs encountered so far, game also saves 99% of the time if it does crash so its unlikely that you will lose progress. Generally a very good and challenging game. Main criticism would be the lack of use for some items and general little balances need doing here and there. But that is to be expected with the game being in alpha stages of development, with splitscreen and multiplayer, planned to be added in the future, this game will be amazing.			",81,10,0,7,3,0,11

								Project zomboid was my first ever zombie game, I purchased it before it was on steam from the devs website for $5 best $5 I ever spent.This game started my love for survival/zombie games and is a constant go to game for me.Dont let the simplistic look of the game put you off, it has all the trimmings: crafting, base building, array of loot and of course lots of zombie killing!With active devs this game has great features added all the time and is definitely one to check out if you like a challenge and enjoy zombie/survivial games			",62,10,1,20,11,0,9

								This game will show you an infinitely possible world in an unforgiving way that makes everything you do dangerous regardless of how long you've been alive.TL;DR: 9/10 - Best zombie survival sim out there today.Zomboid is the type of game that might take a little bit of getting used to if you haven't played something like pokemon. IT will get even harder to get used to if you haven't thought about survival situations in your life. The day I realized I loved Zomboid is when I decided to try and craft something, without knowing the recipe, a molotov cocktail. I drank a bottle of whiskey, and ripped up a sheet, I then tried pouring a bottle of whiskey on the sheet, it didn't work. A couple of game days later I came across a gas can, I substituted the whiskey for gas, and 'lo and behold a molotov was created. These are the kind of possibilities that will keep you coming back forever. Everything makes sense.There are no shortage of ""oh ♥♥♥♥ I better drink some bleach because I'm about to turn in to a zombie"" moments, or ""The house is filled with zombies, I'm stuck in a second floor bedroom, I'm going to have to risk breaking my legs jumping out the 2nd story window"". The zombies are dangerous, they can and will kill you in some of the most miserable ways. Sometimes it is as simple as looking through the window before you break in to a house to prevent a surprise attack from a hole filled friend. Shooting a gun is always dangerous and rarely can you take on a horde on your own, oh yeah this game is multiplayer too...With so much content it is hard to believe a game beyond early access and with things like NPC's (really well done) and offline co-op on the way, there is an exciting future to zomboid.

								Hey everyone... I'm a big fan of zombies and I heard about Project Zomboid on a website and it sounded really appealing to me. I figured after finding it on Steam I'd try out the demo.... after dodging some zombies , opening the door to a gun shop and being confronted with the first zombie I ever fought I was hooked... Since then I`ve bought the game and played it the last couple of days, and it`s amazing.... the zombies can be avoided if you remain unseen and unheard but if one sees you its best to fight him rather than run because although you can out-run them, you``ll have a horde following you if you do....There`s so much you can do in the game that I haven`t done yet, I plan on collecting supplies and building a base in the woods away from the city eventually... My only advice is to keep playing this game, practise different techniques until you find what works best for you, and if you find it too hard play it in Sandbox mode which allows you to set up the setting to low population zombies (which still is a lot), Etc.This game has so much to offer, you can honestly feel the experience of survival in this zombie apacolypse, and its not even the finished result yet, in my opinion it`s definitely stable enough to play, has multiplayer option and one day will have a lot more than it does now including hunting, driving and looting cars, etc.If you`re thinking about buying this game play the demo, and if you`re intrigued, buy it while it`s still early access, it`ll be worth a lot more in the future... its a good deal, you get updated everytime they add something even after buying the game, and it runs on low requirements computers as long as it has a decent graphics card, 1-2 gb ram and the hard drive space required, I definitely recommend it.

								I stumbled upon PZ while browsing for a zombie rpg game back in 2011. I remember my eyes lit up once I viewed the features and played the demo. I was a die hard fan for PZ since then and have been waiting for PZ to become a zombie gaming hit. Those days back in version 1.4c were the best I could ever ask for and TheIndieStone has made my dream of a true zombie survival come to life with its great blast from the past graphics and ever expanding gameplay along side the modding community. I have met so many people because of this game and its great community and I hope PZ will become a even greater game in the future as TheIndieStone continues to develop their masterpiece.This game has given me hours of fun and I'm sure any zombie fan like myself would enjoy it.EDIT 2016:Here I sit years after false promises or rerouting of the development focus. Still waiting for even a segment of story or at least the NPCs which were scoped some time last year (2015). Be it I'll be mocked by fans who still have the patience to wait or the moderators eager to argue against my opinion, I'm tired. I've sat here for several years now interacting with the community and even getting to be a part of the inner testing group until I was kicked out due to ""certain views"". Regardless I held my head high and no matter the conflict I enjoyed Project Zomboid and the select few who made my time feel productive and worth a damn.I got to work with amazing people and discuss modding and even development with some of the devs. I can say I enjoyed PZ, but I don't anymore. The changes that have been put forward into the game have been minor to say the least. I like they're putting polish on many things but revising the look of the game three times that I can count is a bit much. Granted I know passion tends to die and it gets harder to continue projects but this has certainly been a long drought with only trickles of content making it's way into the game.The Indie Stone has grown in size over the years hiring modders to be devs and turning the roadmap upside down making features that were not originally discussed with the community. To sum this all up I had fun but this game is dry and has been for years. Until I see the story or stories or even NPCs I would not suggest this game because it gets old fast. So hold tight if you still have any patience left, I know I've given up on this title but perhaps in some time it might get somewhere.			",75,4,0,9,12,0,9

								Project Zomboid takes most ideas that you already have in your head about zombie games and completely gets rid of them, delivering a fresh experience from an isometric perspective. Don't be deterred by this, however, as this is as close as you will ever get to a proper simulation of a zombie apocalypse. Constantly improving, Project Zomboid takes into consideration a wide range of different status effects that work both for and against your character, called 'Moodles'. These effects range from hunger, thirst and tiredness all the way to advanced things such as depression, boredom and anxiety. Everything you do in PZ will affect your character in one way or another, so players must be mindful.God damn it, it's so good just please get it. Please. That is all I can ask of you. This will change your outlook on zombie games. Please. Mkay, cool.			",294,39,8,24,22,0,25

								It's a solid,zombie survival experience,even though it's in alpha it's very addictive.The controls feel wonky at first,took me like 5-6 tries to see how combat worked.There's also a few bug's like getting stuck in between tables when your climbing windows can be a pain,and right now the game lacks online multiplayer support,which I'm sure once released will be a huge seller.I also see the unlimited potential in the NPC's once added,and thats going to add a whole new layer of gameplay once it's released.So in my honest review I think it's totally worth the price right now.Their also fixing the stability issues in the next update so try the demo out before you purchase.Also in the demo your already infected so dont go pouting in the GD asking why did I die for no reason.

								UPDATED: 29/06/14I've come back to this game again recently after taking a 6-month break or so (I find this is the best way to enjoy Early Access games) and I feel like it's improved markedly since my last review.Project Zomboid is best described as 'DayZ meets classic Fallout' - if that's something that appeals to you (and it should!), then I can recommend this game wholeheartedly. In previous incarnations, the game was undeniably promising but very rough round the edges, meaning the absorbing battle against the environment and the monsters that inhabit it was punctuated with jarring bugs and glitches like falling through stairs, walking straight through walls and so on.Many of the more troublesome gremlins have been zapped, and while there are still a few that pop up from time to time, the game is a lot less likely to do something utterly bizarre, and a lot more likely to kill you with cold, hard logic and survival elements.The developers have handled the release fairly well, providing steady and worthwhile updates whilst continuing to listen to their community and prioritising the issues that matter most to the fans (stability and the addition of multiplayer). This has resulted in a game that I feel a lot more players would consider 'truly' playable and could sink many hours into, even in its current state.There IS still a long way to go - NPCs seem like they're still a way off, and it's odd to see entire towns almost perfectly modelled, but without a single car in sight - wrecked or otherwise. These things will no doubt be sorted in time - the developers have proven over the past 12 months on Steam that they are happy to take their time working on things until they're ready rather than risking adding things too early and bringing in a host of bugs and issues.Overall:Fun?: YesAny Game-Breaking Issues?: Not really game-breaking, but it's not finished.Worth the Price of Admission?: Yes. ============================================================================ORIGINAL REVIEW:First things first - I've been playing Project Zomboid since I first learned about it on Steam Greenlight way back when it was one of the flagship titles, so obviously the game-time in Steam doesn't really reflect that. Just for disclosure there. :)Anyway, onto the game, and the first question you're going to want to know is 'is it worth it?'And annoyingly, it's kind of difficult to answer right now. Let's get this out of the way right now - in its CURRENT STATE, Zomboid is bug-riddled and missing many key features. If you're buying it right now (November 2013), you need to understand that this is absolutely an Alpha - entire chunks of the game simply aren't there right now, in particular NPCs.It's also clunky to control, has a learning curve that's almost Dwarf Fortress-esque in its steepness, and occasionally difficult to navigate.But the one thing that keeps me coming back and that convinced me to part with my money in the first place is the potential. It's not the 'War Z' potential where the devs are making grand promises with absolutely no idea how on earth they're going to keep them - the basics are in there: the map is freaking enormous, and it's gloriously detailed. The zombie behaviour is excellent - individually they're not a threat, but make a loud noise or stumble into a horde and you're in a whole WORLD of trouble. The parts of the game that are complete show an attention to detail and that little spark of inspiration that give the player confidence that whatever's being promised/worked on is going to arrive, and when it does, it'll be awesome.So to conclude, although it's often banded about these days, it's more true than most in the case of Project Zomboid - when you hand over your £9.99 (or regional equivalent, I guess!), you're buying the game it's GOING to be, not the game it is right now. If you're not convinced that this is a gamble worth taking, you might be better off waiting six months for the game to take a little more shape, but you should be aware that the price will likely creep up again slightly, as the developers have confirmed that they want to reward early adopters by offering it to them for less than 'full price', whatever that may end up being.Fun to Play?: YesAny Gamebreaking issues?: LotsWorth the admission price?: Depends on your patience.

								Me and my girlfriend.She died three times in our last run, the third time, it was my fault.She had been in the bed for a week or so, recovering from a fever that fell upon her after she was scratched while scavenging. While watering her farm, I left the oven unattended, and it started a fire, quickly burning all our supplies, the house, me, her, and our hearts. I kept telling her she was going to make it, she burned alive in the end.This next run though, we started off great. We found a digital watch so now we can tell what time it is without looking at the sun, we found and moved a generator for when the electricity is cut off, and we have learned how to capitalize on our strengths and weaknesses. We know food will eventually run out, so we are trying to find fertilizer for the farm. On our latest scavenge, I asked if we could go past the Electronics Store, she agreed. We're usually a bit more vigilant, and we have an escape route etc, yet this time, after dodging a ton of zombies just to get to the store, when the alarm went off, we had no plan, and we just ran inside. We quickly checked for a way out on the other side, but that whole room was covered with windows, and the zombies are coming from every direction. With the siren still ringing, we dove into a bathroom in a hallway, knowing we will at least have enough water if the zombies 'decide' to siege us. On that note, we both have an apple and we can share one bowl of rice and vegetables. She wields a battered baseball bat, I'm wielding a worn out golfclub. This doesn't look good.- GAME PAUSED -She has to go to sleep irl. She says it is a good moment for a cliffhanger.Me and my girlfriend. 10/10			",239,53,3,26,23,2,47

								Project Zomboid offers a lot of good things to the zombie survivalist- the main emphasis of the gameplay is almost entirely around trying to survive each day, with supplies growing scarce, the horde growing larger, in constant fear if that scratch you got from one of those zombies that jumped you when you were going through the kitchen cabinets managed to pass on their deadly disease.Survival in Zomboid is not of course, entirely dominated by avoiding or doing battle with the infected. You must brave the elements, weather storms, sickness, boredom, panic attacks, food poisonings, food spoilage, tainted water, and trying to make do without the myriad of other everyday conveniences like refrigeration, healthcare, food and shelter.Zomboid is also grimly fatalistic- you will die. Even the game's opening intro always ends with 'This is a story of how you died.' You may survive, but accidents, bad luck or just plain bad planning can end your life in a heartbeat. Thankfully, the game does not end with death, and you're allowed to create another character in the world, perhaps a bit wiser this time.The game features an extensive crafting, building and farming system, already fully implemented, even 'tho the game is in EA. Latest additions also added fishing, and the game world is still growing, with new features such as character classes, new items and areas being added in a steady pace.My only major grievance with the game is the inexplainably high ping, even on servers that are not remote from my location. I've seen pings rise from 40 ms to 1000, and on one occasion, even 18k. Hopefully, the devs can finetune the game code for servers and such in the future, allowing smoother multiplayer experiences.So far, I've generally played on cooperative and non-hostile PvE servers- the community is nice enough, unlike on most FPS gaming communities, but not free of griefers, player killers or people abusing external voice chat to annoy others. Thankfully, the latter can always be muted, but one should be wary of players coming at you with an axe or handgun, either out of sadistic troll mentality, or interest in the contents of your backpack.All in all, the game doesn't offer much interest in the singleplayer department as of yet- the scenarios originally released with the game involving Baldspot and his wife Kate have been removed for now, as have been the NPCs, which would have definitely added more colour to the game world. Still, supposing you can find an adequetely populated server, I guess you can set up a survivalist commune, and fight the zombies (and humans) together, bringing extra fun to the game experience.

So hold tight if you still have any patience left, I know I've given up on this title but perhaps in some time it might get somewhere.			",75,4,0,9,12,0,9

								Project Zomboid takes most ideas that you already have in your head about zombie games and completely gets rid of them, delivering a fresh experience from an isometric perspective. Don't be deterred by this, however, as this is as close as you will ever get to a proper simulation of a zombie apocalypse. Constantly improving, Project Zomboid takes into consideration a wide range of different status effects that work both for and against your character, called 'Moodles'. These effects range from hunger, thirst and tiredness all the way to advanced things such as depression, boredom and anxiety. Everything you do in PZ will affect your character in one way or another, so players must be mindful.God damn it, it's so good just please get it. Please. That is all I can ask of you. This will change your outlook on zombie games. Please. Mkay, cool.			",294,39,8,24,22,0,25

								The openended nature of this game makes it special. You can use the sandbox feature to create the zombie survival mode of your choice. Want to slowly build a fortress to keep back George Romero style hordes then you can. If you'd rather create d shortsighted, morbidly obese character and see how many seconds you can last against a rush of 28 days later zeds then that's also an option. The gameplay is solid. The ""early access"" tag conceals the fact that there's already a strong game here. The developers are active and committed and seem to be happy to let the community influence the direction that this game develops. PZ is good. Has potential to be great			",42,10,1,22,42,3,55

								This game, which is inspired by max brooks book is really enjoyable in singleplayer, but in co-op with 3 friends it shows its flaws. For early acces, the game is deep and exciting but on the other hand it has few bugs as a movement of zombies (they sometimes stop and freeze around obstacles) and gunshots (which triggers zombie migration) goes in loops from time to time. Game itself contains everything what you can expect from this genre: making a shelter, scavenging supplies, battling a huge numbers of zombies and progress of your character. I´m really looking forward to next updates which adds more content and make the game even better. And a little advice for newbies: when you find a shotgun, never shoot with it near any city (it´s suicide).			",216,33,9,45,50,1,76

								Where to start...This game is amazing, whether its drinking bleach to going rambo in the streets with your shotgun, this game has everything! This is the BEST zombie game ever made and the most enjoyable. The multiplayer is awesome, its not shoot on sight or pvp or nothing kind of game like Dayz and Rust. The main threat is the actuall zombies for once!!! Every aspect of this game ive touched has been extremely enjoyable and is a MUST to play. Especially if your a zombie maniac like me XDIt isnt about winning or killing every single zombie on Earth, you WILL die, its just a matter of how...The community is also probably the best ive EVER seen in my life for a game, its just overwhelming how supportive and kind the community is :)Theres is no real way I can describe this game properly without been face-to-face, theres just so much to talk about! Get this game now if you like blasting zombies XD			",99,6,0,22,6,0,26

								I originally reviewed this game back in 2013, but the current state of reviews for it, have irritated me to no end. So, I have decided to update my review. Project Zomboid, is perhaps the single game that does 'zombie survival' right. It has atmosphere, character and most importantly, a dedicated team behind it. The survival aspect, your character needs to eat, drink and sleep. Deal with depression, boredom, panic and illness. All of this is on top of the obvious, dealing with the zombies. Whilst nearly everything in this game is customisable, from number of zombies, to their cognition, hearing and sight, to experience rate, custom maps and even how fruitful farming or foraging can be. The game has several presets, for different levels of gamers. With 'Survival' being the accepted norm. In this mode, zombie mortality rate is at something along the lines of 96% mortality rate from bites, and 25% from scratches. Now, this is only magnified, by the fact you can have literally hundreds, if not thousands of zombies on screen at once, should you have the settings set to do so. This game forces you to learn how to play and survive. It's not a casual 'I'll run around with a shotgun and take out hundreds of zombies at a time'. This is a survival game, truly. Without mods, your character starts as an 'average joe'. With no specific skill set, unless a career has been chosen. This game has one of the most well done trait/perk systems I have seen, since the original Fallout games. This gives a rich and rewarding feeling, to have survived long enough to learn how to build and operate machinery, houses and farms. It also gives a much larger sense of profound loss, when you finally succumb to anything in the world. From lack of food, to fever, to the hundreds of zombies that are attracted to sound and sight. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece, I love it, and 90% of the reviews agree with me. You can't go wrong with this game.This brings me nicely on to my next point, please don't be put off by the other recent reviews, slating the dev team behind this for 'slow updates'. They have gotten more abuse than I can comprehend, from this angle. They have continued to update and support this game to the best of their ability, for years. The dev team consists of only six people, up from four in previous years. In this time, they have updated the graphics - twice, adding in 3D models whereas it was a game consisting of sprites (Still an option you can revert to, in the game settings.) and then they quietly worked on double definition models, behind the scenes. They are currently working on an animation system, which has taken a while, granted, but will magnify the gameplay threefold. This game, is more than worth the price of admission. Do yourself a favour, and buy this amazing game, you really can't go wrong. TL;DR, This game is amazing. Buy it.			",114,12,0,51,13,0,12

								Me and my girlfriend.She died three times in our last run, the third time, it was my fault.She had been in the bed for a week or so, recovering from a fever that fell upon her after she was scratched while scavenging. While watering her farm, I left the oven unattended, and it started a fire, quickly burning all our supplies, the house, me, her, and our hearts. I kept telling her she was going to make it, she burned alive in the end.This next run though, we started off great. We found a digital watch so now we can tell what time it is without looking at the sun, we found and moved a generator for when the electricity is cut off, and we have learned how to capitalize on our strengths and weaknesses. We know food will eventually run out, so we are trying to find fertilizer for the farm. On our latest scavenge, I asked if we could go past the Electronics Store, she agreed. We're usually a bit more vigilant, and we have an escape route etc, yet this time, after dodging a ton of zombies just to get to the store, when the alarm went off, we had no plan, and we just ran inside. We quickly checked for a way out on the other side, but that whole room was covered with windows, and the zombies are coming from every direction. With the siren still ringing, we dove into a bathroom in a hallway, knowing we will at least have enough water if the zombies 'decide' to siege us. On that note, we both have an apple and we can share one bowl of rice and vegetables. She wields a battered baseball bat, I'm wielding a worn out golfclub. This doesn't look good.- GAME PAUSED -She has to go to sleep irl. She says it is a good moment for a cliffhanger.Me and my girlfriend. 10/10			",239,53,3,26,23,2,47

								Project Zomboid offers a lot of good things to the zombie survivalist- the main emphasis of the gameplay is almost entirely around trying to survive each day, with supplies growing scarce, the horde growing larger, in constant fear if that scratch you got from one of those zombies that jumped you when you were going through the kitchen cabinets managed to pass on their deadly disease.Survival in Zomboid is not of course, entirely dominated by avoiding or doing battle with the infected. You must brave the elements, weather storms, sickness, boredom, panic attacks, food poisonings, food spoilage, tainted water, and trying to make do without the myriad of other everyday conveniences like refrigeration, healthcare, food and shelter.Zomboid is also grimly fatalistic- you will die. Even the game's opening intro always ends with 'This is a story of how you died.' You may survive, but accidents, bad luck or just plain bad planning can end your life in a heartbeat. Thankfully, the game does not end with death, and you're allowed to create another character in the world, perhaps a bit wiser this time.The game features an extensive crafting, building and farming system, already fully implemented, even 'tho the game is in EA. Latest additions also added fishing, and the game world is still growing, with new features such as character classes, new items and areas being added in a steady pace.My only major grievance with the game is the inexplainably high ping, even on servers that are not remote from my location. I've seen pings rise from 40 ms to 1000, and on one occasion, even 18k. Hopefully, the devs can finetune the game code for servers and such in the future, allowing smoother multiplayer experiences.So far, I've generally played on cooperative and non-hostile PvE servers- the community is nice enough, unlike on most FPS gaming communities, but not free of griefers, player killers or people abusing external voice chat to annoy others. Thankfully, the latter can always be muted, but one should be wary of players coming at you with an axe or handgun, either out of sadistic troll mentality, or interest in the contents of your backpack.All in all, the game doesn't offer much interest in the singleplayer department as of yet- the scenarios originally released with the game involving Baldspot and his wife Kate have been removed for now, as have been the NPCs, which would have definitely added more colour to the game world. Still, supposing you can find an adequetely populated server, I guess you can set up a survivalist commune, and fight the zombies (and humans) together, bringing extra fun to the game experience.

Early Access Review
								Now I know that I have very low hours in this game compared to most other people, but this is just a quick review for people unsure about this game being in early access to back up the reviews of other people.Before I get onto why I DON'T recommend this game, I'm going to tell you why I do. Confusing, I know, but despite my recommendation I do think that the game is a very fun game.The gameplay is very realistic and tense and you can really get into the role of your character. Being chased down by zombies and having to manage food, be careful you don't make noise, build up a relatively safe space if you choose to.. These things are really fun and deliver on that zombie survival fantasy. The skill system is another mechanic that I liked the sound of, but due to my limited experience with that I don't want to talk about it too much since I feel that I haven't used it enough to actually say whether it is a good addition or not. What I'm saying is, however, that if you come to this game looking for a realistic and customizable zombie survival game, that's what you're going to get. There's no smoke and mirrors here.Despite my hours, I played this a lot before it was actually on steam so I do know what I'm talking about. I really like this game but my problem is that. as others have said, after years and years of waiting, very little of substance has been added to the game. Believe me, I played this game back when it had much worse graphics, and honestly I felt like it had more going on back then. There's newer and better features, but it's weird. The game just felt like more was happening AROUND you, whereas now it feels woefully dead, and that wasn't a pun.I could only recommend this game to newcomers if they think that they could get a lot of time out of this or the multiplayer, but until they get a move on and actually begin to add something of substance such as NPCs or a campaign to follow, you'll just eventually find yourself getting bored once you've done everything, and doing everything won't take very long once you get the hang of the mechanics. Now, the problem is - and I'm going to be honest and unbiased as much as I can -  the developers share very little about the additions i talked about above. They outright refuse to mention NPCs, but the reaon that they have done this is that the community would complain whenever they were mentioned about how they weren't done yet. I can sympathize with this, as I have also made far smaller projects, usually for only a few people, and people complaining that things aren't done is not only upsetting but at times outright demotivating. I respect their decision to not talk about NPCs until they are close to release, but this decision has, unfortunately, meant that anyone following the game and hoping that one day the money they invested into the game at the very start will eventually result in something that they can continue playing because, as I said, once you've done everything... despite the game being very fun, there's just nothing to keep you playing.In short: Would I recommend this game in its current state? No, but it is a GOOD game. Will I recommend this game in the future? Almost certainly, provided that the features that were promised years ago do come out. And I still hold hope that they eventually will. If and when they do deliver on those features, I will update this review after I feel that I have played the game for long enough to accurately judge the game. I am only posting THIS review to inform potential buyers of what they are going to receive if they buy RIGHT NOW. If you don't like the game as it is now, don't buy it hoping that it will get better. I honestly can't tell you that it will after how long i've waited.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								While I could say how sprawling the ambition of the developers are and how good their work is so far, i'm just going to let some other reviewer talk about it, I mean really it's been a year or two, someone is bound to already have done it. But for the words by me, I suggest buying it at a later date, assuming that the pirates didn't drain the developers wallet dry. The game was just recently upgraded with a server browsing list and some mod support, so it's definitly more ripe and shinier than what it first started out. But if you're impatient, by all means, buy it! You'll be supporting the devs and it'll keep'em working.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you can live with a few bugs, it is truly a great game.Once you've gotten the hang on how to survive (after playing & dying multiple times) there is not that much more to do, replaying to try and see if you can survive longer, build a bigger base is very entertaining however.Hopefully in future when the NPC support is better there will be more replayability.Looking forward to multiplayer!I've been playing it since early alpha, and I'm very happy to see the way the development is going it is very promising for the future :)			",624,186,31,122,103,5,152

								So... I've played this game for an entire weekend.Its not fun.It's not even close to realistic.You will rarely feel a sense of accomplishment.Yes, you're going to die.  Pretty much the zombie virus killed all the strongest and from what I can tell, no matter what career path you choose, you were the WORST at it... oh yeah, and you're one of the last alive, so you're really one of the weakest humans... ever.If you're looking for a hard game, this definitely is difficult, but it's difficult like probabilities and statistics are hard.  It's not exciting, it's zombie apocalypse for masochists version of Minecraft, at best.  At worst, it's a slow, boring slog through hordes of zombies.I'm going to give it some more chance... but mostly because I just kinda want to finish building as close to a ""fortress"" home as I can and max out all skills, if possible.

								My friend and I bought this game and have had wonderful times with it. We set up our own private server. And it was great despite our long distances from each other. Until lagging zombies magically ate him. Good times. The game is great, but not without its bugs. The problem now is the same problems that everyone else is complainging about. Progress is at a stand still. I don't want some stupid nutrition systms I want the AI you promised me 2 years ago. There's so much they promise to add and literally almost none of it has been implemented. I'll change my review when I see good change.			",50,6,0,2,9,0,8

								A wonderful game with amazing potential ruined by its developers. Years of Early Access, meaningless updates which provide so little value, it's almost pointless. Developers who refuse to listen, refuse to take criticism, pandering on and on and on with little to no progress.I was so, so, so excited to hear the announcement of NPC's into this game. That was 3+ years ago, with the developers blatantly ignoring everyone's requests for updates for them.The game is great itself, but its potential completely gone. If only this game had better developers, it could have been a masterpiece. If the developers have some sort of epiphany or some sort of miracle happens, I'll change my review. But currently, don't buy this. It's going nowhere in a hurry.			",26,7,3,3,16,0,7

								One of the best survival games out there. It's a fantastic game as-is and definitely worth the price, and yet the potential of this game is vast. Don't be deterred by the dated graphics of project zomboid. What it lacks in graphic definition it easily makes up for in gameplay and content. In fact I consider the simple graphics a boon to the game, giving ease for developers and modders to add droves of great content.The only thing that would make this more realistic is a Crapped Your Pants! moodlet, which I assure you would be the first one that would actually happen to me.

								Project Zomboid is a realistic, isometric sandbox survival game. In other words: A kick♥♥♥♥♥ different twist on Zombie Survival that pitches you against zombies from the top of your tower, firing you shotgun and screaming bad Arnold quotes...The game is set in the 1980s, in 2 Kentucky towns and a fictional suburb complete with an eerily silent prison!Start by creating your character; you can build their skills and weaknesses and choose their profession. You could be a badass veteran who can't read, a handy carpenter, or a firefighter who smokes like a chimney! The possibilities are endless!Use your tools to make a nice fort, complete with a stolen generator, log walls tied by dead zombie clothes and some fairly shoddy looking metal walls. Soon, your water and electricity will run out. You will need to farm and forage to survive, and deal with the hordes that await you...			",8,8,0,4,5,1,1

								i bought this game in freshman year of highschool and eargerly awaited the reveal of npcs. Im now in my senior year and still nothing. actually you arent even allowed to mention npcs on the forms because apparently the developers get mad and wont work on it for a little amount of time. the developpment is so slow. the game is good dont get me wrong but after a while youll be so bored youll question while you bought it. The game is so messed up on terms of placement like the tile system is what im taking about where you have to click on a tile to use the items in it that sometimes i would have incomplete houses because i couldnt select it. Just dont buy the game. maybe it will get the developers to understand that they shouldnt take 6 years to get it done and give us a little update every 4 months. and im saying 6 years because before it was on steam it was on desuara. and if you think im kidding about any of this then buy the game and see how long it takes for them to release an update. all those little update things below the game are just them talking about what theyre doing but it will take months or even years before they realese npcs or cars or even new guns or new pixels.  you cant wear armor in the game, you cant see your backpack. theres only two versions of shirts. vest or sweater.

								I was agoraphobic, so I decided that staying inside the house was my best option for survival. There was plenty of food, clothes, things to barricade the windows with, etc.. but good things don't last forever. All it took was one zombie to call the others. I ran upstairs as I heard the windows shattering behind me. I panicked and ran into the bathroom where I knew there was a window, but they found me. I could see them surrounding my house in herds. I didn't have much of a choice when they started to beat down the bathroom door, so I opened the window and jumped into the crowd. With a broken leg and the rain drenching my clothes, I limped away...			",167,29,1,28,21,0,12

I'd get a refund if i could but its too late for me. don't join me in regret of purchasing empty promises.Its developers like these that damage our trust in other developers whom are actually giving it 110% into other games.Expect to see in abandonware before long. don't say i didn't warn you.

Early Access Review
								I would compare Project Zomboid to another early access game: Day Z. Most people negative reviews say Zomboid is taking to long to get good updates but I must disagree. I tried it more than a year ago and I didn't enjoy it. It seemed too complicated, graphics looked kinda lame to me. I was in Day Z's hype. But Day Z is failing to improve as a game in general. They add items and broken mechanics every update. Zombies are still glitched and annoying and all that kill on sight got me bored.Zomboid, on the other hand, has developed a lot. It has a lot more immersion, zombies are quite smart - they see you, hear you and can smell if you're bleeding - and you can custom your experience to your liking in sandbox mode. I'm still not into multiplayer mode, still discovering its mechanics and I can tell you this game is HUGE. By the time I'm done with the vanilla, theres a gigantic mod to discover (Hydrocraft).Three weeks ago I tried Zomboid again and after half an hour of gameplay I decided to buy it. I can tell you, its worth every single cent of its price. Its a very complex game and one of the best things is building a safehouse just to find out its not as safe as you thought - then you have to drive away hordes of zombies away from the city. This is priceless.			",118,20,3,15,3,2,17

								Project Zomboid is the game that got me playing games again. Having owned the game since 2011, I've watched Project Zomboid grow from little more than a 10-15 minute ""coffee-break"" game one that supports dozens and hundreds of hours of play, solo or MP. PZ nails the Brooks/Romero zombie survival experience, from massive hordes visible in the world to the crippling isolation and sense of hopelessness characters feel within that universe. Zombies are slow shamblers -- weak and easy overcome by themselves, but overwhelming en masse. There are no ""special"" zombies here -- and no need for them, with an engine that can support hundreds of entities on screen without noticeable lag (though once it gets up to 2000 or so, the Java-based engine stumbles). Buy if the game being feature incomplete for another year or two doesn't phase you. The game's main weakness right now it's lack of human and animal NPCs, as well as vehicles. Much of the included systems are rather bare-bones and need additional content / balancing to really work well together.  It'd say it's about 70% complete at this point.Though the stable build takes 2-3 months on average to update, the IWBUMS branch tends to update weekly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Project Zomboid, What can I say.. I love it!This game was made to answer 1 and only 1 question, ""What would you do in a zombie apocalyps""Youve spoken about this to your friends, asked the question and you always seem to be alive..But what would really happen. Well the answer is simple, Play this game and figure it out.In Project Zomboid your an average Joe thrown into the thick of a zombie take over, Survices are gone, Water and Power are only temporary, Food gets scarce.Project zomboid looks like a bad game at first glance but the beautiy of this game is jot in her looks, but her brain.The depth and detail put into this game is truly beautiful in itself eg. If you get cut on a peice of glass and your bleeding, you need to get the glass out if there is any lodged inside, disinfect it if you can, bandage it if you have some and if you dont, better rip your pants into rags and wrap it up or youll attract zombies and bleed out.Its a lot of fun to play alone and even more with a friend, and im not just saying that too, multiplayer is the best thing to happen in this game, it gets a lot harder and more enjoyable with someone else tagging along in local split screen and online.Plus for the price of the game its one of if not thee best game to get for your money and the devs are great guys and girls, there a small group but they have been dedicted to this game for a long time and regularly update the game and recently has steam workshop.So please. Cuddle your spiffo doll and eat a whole water melon because this game is hardcore as heck, if that suits your taste, you wont be dissapointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Gotta tell you, I really don't recommend this game at all unless you plan on taking advantage of the workshop.Character creation was pretty cool and in-depth but the rest of the game... not really appealing, and honestly really boring. I did like the health and damage system though it gets really stupid. like really ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. For example, everything needs to be bandaged or else you steadily lose health. This applies to everything, even minor injuries. Got a ""scratch"" well if you don't bandage it you will slowly lose health, possibly get it infected, and then die if you do anything. All on the same day. Have a bleeding scratch? Well that's going to bleed you out because this game is realistic. Wait... realistic??? How is that realistic whatsoever? How do you bleed out from a ""scratch"" given you don't have a clotting disorder? It makes no sense that minor injuries can kill you or drain your health. Where is the logic and reasoning behind this?Don't get me started on fires. I don't even know why it's implemented when it's broken. I mean that as in pretty much everything catches on fire. If you forget to turn the stove off, well eventually it's going to burn and start a fire... however there's a good chance it will keep spreading and spreading, even over concrete and the roads.So far, their progress updates have been an endless stream of excuses for not having animations done--which is also their excuse for not having more content out. It's ♥♥♥♥ing pathetic, their fanbase deserves better than this. Instead they receive a long obnoxious list of reasons why they can't* get animations working.*Correction* do their job right... although honestly this game isn't laggy and it's EAUntil they actually do finish animations, I would recommend that you not fund these developers... unless of course you plan on using the workshop mods. Content-wise, this game's development is going too slow atm.			",22,4,0,6,5,0,6

								First game: Couldn't figure out the controls to fight the zombies, got eaten right away.Second game:  Figured out how to fight but had to be on the run for 24 hours straight.  Hungry and exhausted, I was cornered and eaten.Third game:  Started getting the hang of things, killing zombies and setting up a safehouse.  Got into a fight with too many at a time, got bitten.  Managed to escape and limped back to my house, only to bleed out in my bedroom.Fourth game:  Spawned in a perfect, fenced in house at the edge of town and have been staying alive for almost a month now.  I've killed hundreds of zombies, fled from hordes drawn by a helicopter, and I've started learning carpentry to build more walls.  I've got to learn how to farm, but I don't know if I have enough time until winter.  To be continued.10/10 would recommend.			",17,0,0,7,6,0,16

								A zombie survival game with base building and bar nursing, BUT unlike most of the offering this one has some legs. Zomboid is a game where the zombies are THE threat, not a PVP game in a zombie location. It’s single player modes are the core of the game, with online play as an viable option. A large and expanding / improving map, a realistic medical mechanic, and some really interesting systems which no other game has. The one thing i love about Zomboid is the number of options you have to customize the game, want fast zombies which run in small groups or large hordes of sluggish walkers. Weapons everywhere or should finding a golf club be the difference between life and death. The game is solid and is being updated ,although slowly, yes there are many works in progress which people are demanding but it’s still a great game in its current state.If nothing else put it on your wishlist.

Early Access Review
								So far this has been a very interesting game.There is things that should have been included, like npc/ other survivors. Bandits/ gangs. Vehicles that can be torched, looted/driven. If the right person sees the possibilites in this game, then he/she will be famous. Already there is so much things you can do in this game, and thanks to the bright minds in the modding community the list of doable things keeps growing everyday.I usually never buy a ""early access"" game, i dont like and i dont need the frustration, buuut i read this game was well worth owing it in its current state. Yes they were right, never before has it been so delightful to smash the empty head of my ever nagging neighbour. Everyday for ten years he has been around my door with his Jehovas witness propaganda when im watchin tv and having a beer. But yesterday i finally managed to get even, i grabbed the frying pan his wife gave me for christmas decades ago and smashed his head clean off his shoulders, The jebus propaganda flew everywhere, the walls were sprayed with blood. I went outside, noone to see, and noone yelling at me. Good! When i now walk down the street, everyone bow for me. Could it be because i am so nice and good and clean? Maybe- or could it be because i am carrying a bloody axe over my shoulder? Probably..This game is worth supporting, i only hope more additions keep coming. We want to see well detailed fires, crumbling buildings. Explosives- and drivable cars you can run over people or into structures. Now if you all excuse me, i have an appointment with some empty skulls drooling on my doorstepHave fun children And remember what your dad always told you every night when you were  a kid:  ""Always keep you axe sharp and clean my son""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Listen to me, I've spent 88 hours in this game. The best way to describe the state of this game is with this short story (that is well known in the software development world):The monster and his shoesImagine you are an ugly monster and you are preparing for a party. You hava a very nice pair of shoes. You spend a lot of time cleaning and making your shoes look even more amazing, you go to the party and everyone runs away from you. - ""The next party will be better"" you say, and then you start to work on your shoes again... ignoring the fact that you are a big scaring ♥♥♥♥ing monster.-- end of short story --Analogy whit this gameThe monster: - super slow development pipeline- NPCs (long promised) - Vehicles (long promised)- broken multiplayer (needs a ton of work, bug fixes, features to even start to make sense)The shoes  (things that were already good enough or totally unnecessary):- nutrition system (really?)- metal crafting- ultra detailed over complicated health system- painting stuff (what the actual ♥♥♥♥)- communication with in game devices (solving a problem that is already solved by external better voip apps)- the list is really big ...For that reason I think the team behind this project lacks knowledge on basic software development principles, like prioritize work that delivers real value not nice-to-have small stuff.Stay away from this game until they start to deliver value with consistency.

 Project Zomboid	 Pros: + Zombies+ Open World+ Updates+ Tons Of Looting+ Weapons+ Crafting, Building, Farming+ Mods+ Realistic. Food Expires. Health and Injures.+ Multiplayer Cons: - Complex, as in the way you do some of the things in the game are not like most games.- Inventory Management Review Have you ever watched a zombie movie and said ""If I was in a zombie apocalypse I would survive."" Well, time to put you to the test in Project Zomboid. You choose how you look and your skills and are placed in a world where the zombie apocalypse just happened (or has happened 6 months ago). You search houses for food, water, and anything that can be used to defend yourself. Build up your safe house as hordes of zombies wander around your world. Gather enough clean water to survive before the water and power shuts off. You are always on edge with this game, never knowing when a zombie is going to be around the next corner. This game is not for everyone though. It's quite complex and may be frustrating for a lot of people. If you like zombies and if you're dedicated enough to learn this game then you just found your dream game. Personally I am not a huge fan of the graphic style even though I knew it was going to be kind of retro style. If this game was mixed with The Long Dark then I would love it, but it's still a solid game. I can't wait for the final product! Suggested on sale. My First Multiplayer Experience Story I played Project Zomboid for about 25 hours and I felt ready to go to multiplayer for the first time. So I spawned into the world and started to search houses for items. Everything was already well looted and I couldn't find a single useful thing. I couldn't find a good weapon so I took a stick just in case. Sometime later a person who was well geared but had no pants on came up to me. The man said to me, ""Okay listen, I don't have time for this. I just got blood on my pants when I killed a zombie so I need your pants."" I said, ''No. Just take one from a house or something."" For it was my pants that I did not want to give away. The man said, ""No, I want your pants. It's blue and I haven't seen blue pants in a long time."" The man then pulled a gun on me, which I instantly started to run away. I didn't get far as I was shot from behind and fell to the ground. As I was bleeding to death, the man took my pants and put them on and as he walked away he said ""Should have given me your pants."" The moral of the story is when someone tells you to give them your pants... you do it.This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

								No maps to find where you are or to find one another, No means to link your party together. No way to protect your base properly with traps and such. These are my biggest complaints, the rest of the game is quite good. I hope to change my review once these things change in the game.You would think with all the ease of online access now a days in games setting up a multiplayer game that this game would follow suit. This game is unnecessarily complicated just to play online with friends if you get it to work at all!			",82,23,3,21,70,4,42

Early Access Review
								Definitely one of the best Zombie games that i have ever played. It was also one of the first Indie games that I ever purchased. The game challenges you to survive for as long as possible, At first, the world is very similar to how it would be without zombies, only they are roaming outside. But as you survive, the electricity shuts off, lights no longer work. You must roam with a flashlight to cut through the dark Mudlraugh wilderness. Then the water shuts off, you must collect water bottles, pop bottles. Or construct a barrel to store some rain water. All while evading hordes of zombies, and risking infection in all of your close quarter battles. You are a regular survivor, every scratch and bite has a chance to turn you into a moaning, bloody mess. Sometimes a frying pan isnt enough to save you when zombies are breaking in through every entrance of your shelter. The game is definitely worth the $15, as i have far more hours on it than almost any commercial game if you count desura time, and the moaning of zombies is calling you to fight or die. However, a warning, when you get insanely addicted to this, and want more zombies, you will be disappointed by the other games. Visuals - 9 for what its meant to be and an IndieSound/Music - 10, scary moaning and awesome soundtrackStory - Not back in place (maybe never it seems) Gameplay - 10EDIT: While most of my review from Nov 2013 stands true, since then the indiestone team have implemented a full world decay system so buildings/roads Crack and break or grow over with grass and bushes (originally by a modder that joined the devs), implemented seasonal tiles (now there's snow!),  have redone the whole game in double resolution for when you zoom in, added a bit of the world meta events,  and added a great multi-player mode and expanded the map with a major expansion. However, game is still lacking the most requested feature of NPCS, and I feel underestimated the difficulty of adding such complex AI interaction. However, that is supposedly there current focus but if that's a deal breaker for you it's still not in...Basically, If you can handle the isometric view this is probably the best zombie survival game that you will find and it does go on small sales  periodically.  This is what started my addiction to Early Access/Indie games.EDIT: 3 Years later and they're still talking about adding NPCs but all we've really seen is their brain storming chart for interactions. Kind of sad this and Kenshi were one of the first Indies I ever got and 5 years later it's halted development. Honestly I don't think developers do anything anymore and it's just the modder they hired on carrying the project. Still a great game and I recommend it but it's jsut sad to see them working on easier stuff the community doesn't ask for because they don't want to release the challenging stuff like a story or NPC characters. I understand before they wanted it to be perfect but when Kenshi (a solo dev until the last year) is faster than a team, we got problems...Basically its still an amazing survival game and really is one of the best zombie survival games. If you've ever watched zombie shows or movies and been like hm I wonder what I would do, buy this game for sure. But don't buy it for future content of vehicles or NPCs, buy it for once in it now. Still one of my favorite indies. Kenshi is very different but an amazing indie that's come so so far. Subterrain is another survival game that is great if you like Doom atmosphere.

								I absolutely love this game.Admittedly I had torrented this game before they implemented multiplayer. (I didn't want to buy a game so early in development, sorry Zomboid Devs :C ) I finally have picked up a copy, and convinced a couple friends to do so as well.I've easily put atleast 60 hours into v27 with a group of 5 friends including myself.The multiplayer is fantastic, and in it's current state it is well worth the pricetag.If I had to compare this to any other game, it'd of course have to be DayZ, HOWEVER I would play this over that any day.Although not as amazing graphics wise, there is so many more things you can do in Project Zomboid that you can't in DayZ.It's more immersive, and when it's night in-game, this actually gets terrifying. DayZ, not so much.They plan on adding improved hunting, vehicles, and to readd and improve the NPC's(Can't wait!)and once they do that, you'd have to be a zombie not to buy this game.In it's current ALPHA state 8/10, when they add NPC's again 10/10. Buy it. ",470,87,11,79,77,4,102

								A fantastic zombie game! Fast paced; but also with the details you'd need to enjoy a true Zombie survival. Can't wait for the full thing to come out! 9/10 Paws! :3+ Fantastic Zombie design; as well as the survivability ideas.+ I really enjoy the sound system; how the zombies can hear you is really cool!+ The way you can't see things unless they are in your field of view is awesome! Just like real life~- No NPC's! D: I think this would be a core aspect of a Zombie adventure; encountering other survivors; whether they be friendly or violent. I did read that they were originally in the game; and they got taken out. Please return them ASAP! :D- No unique Animations for weaponry! Also; some of them get screwed up. I was holding my handgun upside down; AND backwards! D; What's up with that? You should also make sure that the if you get a certain style of melee weapon; they swing differently. Like; I don't think I'd swing an Axe like a Baseball bat. XD Just saying!= It's a Zombie game. At least they aren't Nazis... /Senses incoming DLC./			",53,4,0,16,2,0,7

								Project Zomboid is Day Z meets Minecraft in a 2D isometric world. Still in alpha, but with plenty of game play to keep players entertained for hours, Project Zomboid drops you in the middle of a suburban landscape as the sole (in the current build at least) survivor of a classic zombie outbreak. You will die, this is inevitable. The question (and objective) the game poses is: how long will you survive? Surviving isn't as simple as staying indoors and out of sight however. Like a normal person you have needs. Hunger, thirst, sleep, and entertainment are periodic needs that must be fulfilled lest you risk your health and sanity. Satisfying these needs will require venturing outside and scavenging for supplies. At first it all seems so simple: find some food to eat, maybe some magazines to read and you're all set, water's still coming out of the tap after all and as long as the window shades are closed no zombie will come looking for you, that is until one follows you home and starts pounding on the window. ""Maybe he'll just go away"" you think, but before you can act the window is broken and the zombie is inside. Run or fight, those are your options. You've spent too long gathering supplies to run and you're too tired to get very far so you're going to have to fight, but with what? Quick! To the counter! The kitchen knife. You grab the knife just in time and violently stab the intruder over and over before finally it succumbs.Maybe the house isn't as secure as you thought and now the window is broken. Perhaps if you had a hammer, some boards, and nails you could barricade it up. If you're going to head out to find these things however you'll need a better weapon and you'll have to find that too. Maybe surviving isn't going to be so easy afterall.			",168,57,1,14,29,1,23

								(As of this writing, the game is still in its alpha stage)Whereas most survival horror games lack very much in the former and deliver light on the latter, Zomboid is actually a pleasant surprise. I got burned out on zombies around the release of Left 4 Dead 2 and Dead Rising, but Project Zomboid brings much more to the table. This is a game that stresses survival, and over time renders many of your sources of living (heat and water) inoperable, forcing you to scavenge for food and water. Zombies are few and far between in rural areas, but fire off one shot from a pistol, and you might as well just start over again as a horde from yards away begins shuffling their way towards you. The carpentry and farming features, though limited a bit in the alpha at this time, are still deep and intuitive enough to provide you the means of survival. However, as the tagline states, it's not a matter of IF you die, but when. Play it smart, and you'll make a tidy little utopia for yourself in the zombie infested wastes of Kentucky. Play it dumb, and expect about half the town of Tuscaloosa to turn your♥♥♥♥♥into a human buffet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is the epitome of all zombie survival simulation. Ultra realistic and only getting better with each update. I personally can't wait until the game is really up and running at full force and full funding. Would buy again, in a heartbeat. I highly recommend you go out and find yourself a bat to start caving in rotting skulls with. You gotta find some $#!T if you wanna live long enough to scratch out a pathetic message begging for the sweet release of death.... Sorry, where was I? Oh right, really awesome game, great for all sort of audiences, as long as they aren't overly squeemish of course. I would like to see the workshop go up long before the game is ready for them to be implemented, so that the voting system can really weed out the duds and then whatever ends up being the best voted at the end of that point could go into the game and be great additions that many people love.TL:DR Buy this game, it's very good.

								I have re-written my review, as i last wrote it in 2013 having played 20 hours.  I'm now up to 80+ hours and the year is 2015, a lot can change in that space of time...There is only one real negative to this game and that is the multiplayer, or rather trying to play with your friends.  It's easy enough to just join a server and play online, obviously if all your group join the same server you can play together; however, the problem comes when you want to set up a private game with your own rules.  It is not easy to do (I could just be being a bit of an idiot though, feel free to leave comments if you know of a better way than what I came up with) and in the end my group had to use Hamachi to create an online LAN.  By far and away the biggest positive has to be the developers, they up date this game so much! When I started playing there where only a handful of skills (blade, blunt, lightfooted, sprinting, cooking, carpentry, sneaking) now there are at least double that number.  Same goes for occupations (think character classes), when I began there were only 4 or 5.The game is really challenging, mistakes are punished; I would compare it to dark souls in its difficulty, in that if you die you can attribute it to a mistake you have made.  Crafting/survival mechanics are great, build a house, trap animals, fish, farm, explore and scavenge.  Stay out in the rain too long, get wet, get cold, get ill and die.  Don't prepare well enough for the power and water to shut off - starve and die of thirst.  Climb through a broken window without removing the glass, maybe you will be fine, maybe you will cut yourself, maybe that cut will get infected because you have no medical kit. Walk into the wrong part of town, get surrounded, get eaten.  Or lose all hope, drink a bottle of bleach and kill yourself!Combat is very simplistic, which helps create tension when fighting off hordes.  Time attacks well and zombies go down easy.  Mess it up and it is easy to get overwhelmed.  Mods galore, this game is early access but it has more workshop content than most!One final negative, there is no real story to the game yet, hopefully it is going to arrive relatively soon, so late game can end up getting a bit stale.  The journey to that point is absolutely fantastic though.Without a doubt, the most value for money I have ever gotten from a computer game... Ever.Big shout out to the developers for doing such a good job.  Guys like you are why early access was created and it is a pity more developers don't work to your high standards.

								Project Zomboid is Day Z meets Minecraft in a 2D isometric world. Still in alpha, but with plenty of game play to keep players entertained for hours, Project Zomboid drops you in the middle of a suburban landscape as the sole (in the current build at least) survivor of a classic zombie outbreak. You will die, this is inevitable. The question (and objective) the game poses is: how long will you survive? Surviving isn't as simple as staying indoors and out of sight however. Like a normal person you have needs. Hunger, thirst, sleep, and entertainment are periodic needs that must be fulfilled lest you risk your health and sanity. Satisfying these needs will require venturing outside and scavenging for supplies. At first it all seems so simple: find some food to eat, maybe some magazines to read and you're all set, water's still coming out of the tap after all and as long as the window shades are closed no zombie will come looking for you, that is until one follows you home and starts pounding on the window. ""Maybe he'll just go away"" you think, but before you can act the window is broken and the zombie is inside. Run or fight, those are your options. You've spent too long gathering supplies to run and you're too tired to get very far so you're going to have to fight, but with what? Quick! To the counter! The kitchen knife. You grab the knife just in time and violently stab the intruder over and over before finally it succumbs.Maybe the house isn't as secure as you thought and now the window is broken. Perhaps if you had a hammer, some boards, and nails you could barricade it up. If you're going to head out to find these things however you'll need a better weapon and you'll have to find that too. Maybe surviving isn't going to be so easy afterall.			",168,57,1,14,29,1,23

								This Is an awesome hyper realistic Zombie survival game. not the best graphics and still being developed, but it has aweome potential! Every time one of mycharacters die, as much as it makes me mad, it makes me want to try harder to get farther. Sometimes I wish this game had a leader board ether global or even just something I can can write my name on like a arcade game for how long I lasted haha.This game can be very difficult and I don't reccomend it to anyone who does not like a challenge. If you are looking for a zombie game that is a close to (if it was even realistacally a scenario) what would happen in real life, I would give this one a gander!Thanks for a fun game and cannot wait to see what else you have in store!

								I would say if you want to get more of a single player experience with a zombie survival game then this is the game you want to get. There are a multitude of ways to customise your game before you play. From the type of game, time, character settings, traits, zombie movement and amount etc. Never one game will be the same. With the addition of multiplayer in the future and a lot of planned features you can see on the store page, this is definitely a great purchase.As to how this game plays, it is not a walk in the park. This game is true survival at heart and you can't be complacent and the more risks you take, the more likely you are to die. Some ways I have died have been from not clearing a house before looting, getting cornered by a horde inside a house and also outside, eating rotten vegetable, getting sick from being out in the rain too much, falling off the stairs (early beta), not making sure a zombie on the ground is dead, walking through a forest and then suddenly getting set on by a horde, leaving the lights on or window open for visibility, getting shot by an npc (early beta), attacking a zombie on the road only to attact more further down it, burning the house down by leaving the oven on. Longest I've lived for was 10 days. I'm still new to this game and have heard about the farming, building and crafting available to build defences and to hold out against a moving zombie horde. Great game and definitely would recommend it to friends.Looting houses, hospitals, churches, markets, shopping centres, schools, sheds, cabbins, apartments, restaurants, gp centre, warehouses, commercial buildings what more can you ask for?

								The best zombie game out there, without a doubt, and it's for a $15 price mark. Much cheaper than other Early access game that contain much less gameplay.The devs frequently update the game and keep the community informed. They respect the opinions and take in commentary from gamers.This is an Early access game like few others: Good enough to be a full game.			",63,6,0,13,12,0,18

								I think project zomboid, will within under a year, become the most realistic zombie game of all time. It is a hardcore/permadeath game, so If you don't like it, don't get it. But, If your a fan of any survival game or even zombie shows like the walking dead, I highly reccomend this game.			",133,30,0,20,16,0,4

								I have re-written my review, as i last wrote it in 2013 having played 20 hours.  I'm now up to 80+ hours and the year is 2015, a lot can change in that space of time...There is only one real negative to this game and that is the multiplayer, or rather trying to play with your friends.  It's easy enough to just join a server and play online, obviously if all your group join the same server you can play together; however, the problem comes when you want to set up a private game with your own rules.  It is not easy to do (I could just be being a bit of an idiot though, feel free to leave comments if you know of a better way than what I came up with) and in the end my group had to use Hamachi to create an online LAN.  By far and away the biggest positive has to be the developers, they up date this game so much! When I started playing there where only a handful of skills (blade, blunt, lightfooted, sprinting, cooking, carpentry, sneaking) now there are at least double that number.  Same goes for occupations (think character classes), when I began there were only 4 or 5.The game is really challenging, mistakes are punished; I would compare it to dark souls in its difficulty, in that if you die you can attribute it to a mistake you have made.  Crafting/survival mechanics are great, build a house, trap animals, fish, farm, explore and scavenge.  Stay out in the rain too long, get wet, get cold, get ill and die.  Don't prepare well enough for the power and water to shut off - starve and die of thirst.  Climb through a broken window without removing the glass, maybe you will be fine, maybe you will cut yourself, maybe that cut will get infected because you have no medical kit. Walk into the wrong part of town, get surrounded, get eaten.  Or lose all hope, drink a bottle of bleach and kill yourself!Combat is very simplistic, which helps create tension when fighting off hordes.  Time attacks well and zombies go down easy.  Mess it up and it is easy to get overwhelmed.  Mods galore, this game is early access but it has more workshop content than most!One final negative, there is no real story to the game yet, hopefully it is going to arrive relatively soon, so late game can end up getting a bit stale.  The journey to that point is absolutely fantastic though.Without a doubt, the most value for money I have ever gotten from a computer game... Ever.Big shout out to the developers for doing such a good job.  Guys like you are why early access was created and it is a pity more developers don't work to your high standards.

								Project Zomboid is about how long you will survive in a zombie apocalypse. You will die eventually. This game doesn't hold your hand much, you need to find your way around in a ruthless environment where zombies are not your only enemies.This game has all the elements I've been waiting to see in a zombie survival game. Crafting, cooking, building and farming. All this while scavenging stuff out there and slaying zombies. It's best to try to avoid them zombies though, you might catch the virus yourself or get surrounded if you are not careful.I see huge potential in this game, when they will add NPC's and online multiplayer this game will be absolutely brilliant. At the moment there are some bugs, weird design choices and awkward usability, but I'm sure they will be ironed out in time.This is THE zombie apocalypse game you want.			",70,17,0,14,9,2,13

								I was never a zombie game fan altough this game is something diffrent. It have heart and it is exactly the fantesy that everybody have imagined from a zombie apocalypse... the most importantaspect which keeps you tied to your computer is the existence of rules and the necessity to obey them and not just make the player feels like it owns the world now that all is doomed giveing you 30 minutes of WOW factor and then zero consistency, like other titles that we know *caught* Dying Light *caught*.In this game you have variety and a deep survivior system that dosen't make you feel like you are babysitting the suvivior... or the soon to be dead ..Once you get to know how the game is workeing you will have tons of fun.I actully recomand this game if you leave aside the movie like graphics ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and just want to play a really good game.

								2016 Review: Lots of negativer reviews recently, and I am not sure why I have totally got my money's worth for what it was when I bought it and still believe that to this day, I played probably 150~ hours prior to it coming onto steam + my 77 and counting on steam. With the upcoming animation update is am extremely excited to see where this is going. I have in fact bought this game for a number of friends, and I don't regret it at all. Keep up the awesome work TIS.Original Review Posted: Dec, 2013 Such an amazing game, I highly recommend everyone pick it up. It is the survival zombie game I have been waiting for far too long. I originally purchased this game 6/17/11, well worth the price of admission, love that it is growing and that it finally is on steam!			",267,23,8,29,37,4,35

								This is more than immerse with a clash of anxiety and panic.

Takes alot of strat in order to live more than a week ( in game) let alone a month. Water supply shut offs and weather related scares permeate the distant Apocalypse. More than fun with alot of attention to detail.			",51,2,0,2,0,0,0

								Project Zomboid is a wonderful experience all around. Playing online I couldn't find a survivor group that would let me in, so I built my own small base, and after saving a few other players, I've become the leader of my own faction. Instead of gathering supplies and survivng, I've started organizing and sending people out, meeting with other factions to set up trades, and running goods base to base. 10/10			",117,6,0,14,6,0,9

								If you're looking for an authentic ""zombie survival"" experience, then look no further.No other zombie survival game that I have played (and I have played many) imbues the same level of depth and emotion as this game does. Threats are all around you, and you will not survive, but the real question is how far will you make it? Thirst,  hunger, sleep deprivation, heat, cold, depression, boredom, sickness, infection, and of course: Zombies. The choices you make will determine how long you will  last, leading to some difficult decision making. The game does a fantastic job of portraying a zombie apocalypse in all it's horror and darkness.  The zombies are ""proper"" zombies. That being, slow, shambling, and non-superhuman undead as portrayed in Max Brook's ""Zombie Survival Guide"" and ""World War Z"" (The BOOK not the movie!). The threat of infection is real. One scratch is all it takes unless you're lucky. And if you've been bitten, it's game over no matter how much you try and fight it; what's left is how you choose to spend the last few days of you're life. It'll make you think twice before courageously taking on a small horde of zombies with your baseball bat. Simply by playing the game, you are creating your own story for your character. It's a dynamic world full of zombies and you get to decide what you want to do and what your priorities are. There is lengthy character progression through a skill system, making you're character all the more precious as you invest more time into them. The longer you're alive, the more you'll want to survive. The game is still in Alpha, so it's considered incomplete by the developers, meaning there are many more features to come. I can't wait to see what they add to this game as time goes on. It already feels like a complete experience, so anything new they put in can only add to it. This game is worth every penny. Something that I have a lot of difficulty saying about many other games.			",267,39,3,24,28,5,43

								Project Zomboid has come a long way. The development staff has weekly updates to let you know what will be released and what is on the agenda. The gameplay is smooth and fun. This is a survival game at it's best. An immersive medical system and cooking system. Combat is being worked on to contain more moves and animations so it does feel a bit dull right now. The graphics are a top down, isometric look. Your character is customizable down to the skills they possess. As you play the game, your skills will level up and you can add points to certain skills, blunt and accuracy are an example of them under the melee skills. You will die eventually either due to carelessness or unproper planning. The game time can extends to days as your in game time spans years. With the new updates you can watch the world around you deteriorate. Radio broadcasts and in game events will keep you aware of how society is devolving.Please buy this game and support these devs if these things interest you. In comparison to other games alpha releases this game ALONE stands the test of time with constant updates and dev to community transparency. This game WILL be updated and WILL become better. It already has a ton of content and will have more in the future from NPCs to new items in game, including cars. 10/10 would survive again for a year and die in the winter due to crop failure in my huge built up fortress			",137,16,2,10,19,0,14

								Started my adventure as Bottas Waters, a former construction worker with a low-tolerance of alcoholic beverages.Found some food, other basic supplies and a fork to use as a weapon.I ventured outside, and found my neighbours house sitting empty across the street. Unfortunately, his doors were locked, so I smashed the window and entered. A zombie came out a closet so I stabbed it in the eye with a fork and it died, but my fork broke too. I then found a rolling pin, and used that as a weapon from thereon out. Looted some more cupboards, and noticed my character was getting slightly thirsty, so this was my first major introduction into the true survival aspects of this game. Fortunately, I had a drink in my inventory.Misclicked, drank bleach and died.10/10			",154,12,12,9,15,7,20

If you seek a serious zombie game which is not some typical shooting, asskicking, dogde game like Resident Evil 5 and 6. Then this is for you. Also, do take a look in youtube for Project Zomboid. It might fall for your taste. :) Have fun!			",144,85,0,37,12,0,6

								I absolutely love this game.Admittedly I had torrented this game before they implemented multiplayer. (I didn't want to buy a game so early in development, sorry Zomboid Devs :C ) I finally have picked up a copy, and convinced a couple friends to do so as well.I've easily put atleast 60 hours into v27 with a group of 5 friends including myself.The multiplayer is fantastic, and in it's current state it is well worth the pricetag.If I had to compare this to any other game, it'd of course have to be DayZ, HOWEVER I would play this over that any day.Although not as amazing graphics wise, there is so many more things you can do in Project Zomboid that you can't in DayZ.It's more immersive, and when it's night in-game, this actually gets terrifying. DayZ, not so much.They plan on adding improved hunting, vehicles, and to readd and improve the NPC's(Can't wait!)and once they do that, you'd have to be a zombie not to buy this game.In it's current ALPHA state 8/10, when they add NPC's again 10/10. Buy it. ",470,87,11,79,77,4,102

								A fantastic zombie game! Fast paced; but also with the details you'd need to enjoy a true Zombie survival. Can't wait for the full thing to come out! 9/10 Paws! :3+ Fantastic Zombie design; as well as the survivability ideas.+ I really enjoy the sound system; how the zombies can hear you is really cool!+ The way you can't see things unless they are in your field of view is awesome! Just like real life~- No NPC's! D: I think this would be a core aspect of a Zombie adventure; encountering other survivors; whether they be friendly or violent. I did read that they were originally in the game; and they got taken out. Please return them ASAP! :D- No unique Animations for weaponry! Also; some of them get screwed up. I was holding my handgun upside down; AND backwards! D; What's up with that? You should also make sure that the if you get a certain style of melee weapon; they swing differently. Like; I don't think I'd swing an Axe like a Baseball bat. XD Just saying!= It's a Zombie game. At least they aren't Nazis... /Senses incoming DLC./			",53,4,0,16,2,0,7

								I like this game. Though how to make cook, farm and build specific items should be clearly explained how to do so in some future manual, otherwise I think it will drive players nuts figuring it out on their own.For instance to say well ""just think how a grilled cheese is made"" that particular person could be some high-level chef in real life or maybe they use to make grilled cheese balls, (which is a acquired taste) the point is they might have a general idea of what to do with items in the game, when the developers had other ideas on how to use those items.Therefore a manual to list all of this stuff needs to be developed so their is almost no chance of misinterpretation.

								dont let the steam stats fool you ive played this game for hundreds of hours. i used to play it before it came out on steam and its just as good as it used to be/better. this is not a knock off of dayz and in my opinion it has way better survival aspects. building homes, making your plain old house into a fortress!, and cooking making camp in the woods, and multiplayer is in early access wich i have high expectations for. overall this is one of my favorite simulation, post apocolyptic games to exist ever!this game is a strait up 9.5/10 it is an amazing game that has many perfected aspects of survival but its one issue is the lack of current items like assault rifles and other things like weapons. something that i would like implemented is better weapon customization. sorta like dead island but overall i really enjoy this game			",139,14,1,17,12,0,15

								Project zomboid is a great game with many thing going for it that todays zombies game lack you start off being told you will not survive with that said your dream of killing countless zombies is dashed short and reailty kicks in and it kicks in hard you cannot sprint forever nor do you start with insanes amount of ammo actully youll be lucky to even find a frying pan to defend yourself with you should take your first steps in this game slowly or you will die quickly get used to the controls and the interface becuase you will be force to sometimes be on the run and yeah zombies can hear you and see you even if your deep inside of a house so be sure to find sheet to cover the windows. the music is great and fits well into the game pick this game up if you want a zombie sim type of game that you can hone your skills in and with the continued effort polishing on this game from the makers there really arent any limits to what this game can do for a zombie survivor lover......however then again you arent suppose to survive anyway			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Reviewing at Alpha Stage: I took a quick look at the pictures and one video, noticed a demo was shared to us the consumer I decided to give it a shot.Demo: The demo starts you off as a female hidden away, you're bitten which allows you to play for a couple of days before becoming a zombie, this is a tipical demo feature which stops you from playing the game for free and thinking that is all it. The demo gave me a strong impression on what it is capable of so I decided to buy it for a low cost compared to other indie games.The Alpha: Bugs, glitches, crashes will happen in every single alpha so I tend to ignore these a little whiles doing a review unless it is a major issue which it is not and I am happy to continue this review.The main menu is brilliant, the lightning flashes with the music kicking in that reveals a hidden dark secret to the two characters on screen, you have three game modes Survival, Last Stand, Sandbox.  Survival; As the game is meant to be, you create your character with its pros and cons, you start in  one out of two worlds which random generates items and your starting area which opens your eyes up and scares you from roaming too far in the early stage, you need to keep fed, watered, fit and infection free! If you're a zombie fan then playing this is logical, play it as a movie and real life scenerios for survival and you will not have a problem on keeping alive....until you meet zombies, they are slow, fast, weak and strong...some walk, some run, some crawls, they're all attracted to smell of blood dripping, sound and sight which creates or breaks hordes up.Sandbox; just like survival but you're in control for a while on what the world can be like for zombies, make them weak or super hard.Laststand: You're holding out aslong as you can before death, there is only one way to win.... stand and defend as long as you can.....Winning is death in my eyes.Graphics might look weak to you but they really fit the game well, sounds are brilliant from zombie growls, sounds of guns, alarms, windows smasing, doors breaking and more.For an Alpha it is well done for its pre-release, if you can not hack bugs, crashes, glitches then wait until people report less and less.6.6 rating for alpha. I will review it once again when the game has improved to be held by its title on its own which will be on my site.   YES I will recommend it to my friends. (Playing it on a IMAC OSX Snow Leapod.)

								This is one of the few real survival games out there/here. You don't win this game, you just get to survive a while longer each time you start a new game. There's no happy ending for you characters.  Bought after playing the demo for an hour, spent the next 2 days playing it almost non-stop. It's Alpha at the moment so there are many bugs but the roadmap for the game looks very promising. And there's also a nice modding community on the forums where you can find all sorts of mods to make survival easier/harder.			",412,117,20,54,90,2,108

								I was never a zombie game fan altough this game is something diffrent. It have heart and it is exactly the fantesy that everybody have imagined from a zombie apocalypse... the most importantaspect which keeps you tied to your computer is the existence of rules and the necessity to obey them and not just make the player feels like it owns the world now that all is doomed giveing you 30 minutes of WOW factor and then zero consistency, like other titles that we know *caught* Dying Light *caught*.In this game you have variety and a deep survivior system that dosen't make you feel like you are babysitting the suvivior... or the soon to be dead ..Once you get to know how the game is workeing you will have tons of fun.I actully recomand this game if you leave aside the movie like graphics ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and just want to play a really good game.

								I bought this Game before it wa Ever a Steam Game, 1.5d Alpha Build with Kate and Baldspot, If there is an Early Access Game that Derserves Every Cent. Then its this one. The Game Is about how you die. How you live you're Last days on earth Surviving the Zombie Apocaplyse. Hunger, Thirst, Even the Weather is Agaisnt you. You Adapt, or Die. Simple as that. You cant Win. You Cant Cure this Virus. Humanity is Dwidling into Extintion. So what are your final days going to hold?Ive played this Game for 300+ hours Including the Time I played it on Dersura and in Early Builds. Pros -Total Customization - You want Walking Dead Zombies, You got them. YOu want Super Human 28 Days Later Infected. You got them. Its all Customizable in Sandbox ModeIts Challenging - This Game will Tear you a new one. Litterally. Zeds Grab, Bite, Scratch and You best Believe Gun Shots Bring on Hordes. Houses can Have Locked Doors/Window. Have House Alarms. Lastly The Medical/First Aid Is Ace. Oh you jumped out a Window to Escape Zeds? Have fun Running with a Broken Leg. Splints, Sewing Wounds Shut. Disinfecting them so they dont get Infected.(Does not get rid of ""Zombie"" Infections). Only Infections on WoundsPlay How You Want - You can play However you want. There will be Consequences for some styles of Play. But All In all the Game can Be Played How you want. You can go around guns blazing, or take everything stealthyMap Size -  The Map isnt something that you can jog acrossed in no time. It can take a few days in Game to move from one Town to Another. Right now These Towns are Muldraugh and West Point. But the Modding Communtiy has add New Denver, Bedwood Falls, Dreadwood, The Walking Dead Prison and The game will soon have a Creative Mode so you can Create your own Cities/TownsCons - Some Features have Been In Development For a long time. NPC's have been In Development for the Good part of 2 Years, Dont Be Dicouraged though. They Want to Make Sure Everything Works and Is Balanced and Stable within the World Of PZ. (You can Go to their Forums and Find loads of Information of the things they are currently Working on) ",84,8,0,13,28,0,23

								A lot of zombie games share a common flaw. Zombies serve only as target practice. The aspect of prolonged survival in a post apocalyptic world is pretty much ignored, other than the occassional reference or scene. The concept of rebuilding in this new world is also forgotten. You just go from point A to B and shoot some zombies, that's it. And then there's Project Zomboid. You get to shoot zombies (bad idea!), but you also get the chance to rebuild. Find a good spot, build a wall and before you know it, you've got your own base to defend.Of course, it's not that easy, but it should give a good idea. The game has carpentry, farming and most recently even hunting was added (to an extent). Which brings me to the second point. The company constantly adds more content. It's a good habit, one I hope to keep seeing for a long time.So I definitely recommend this game.			",272,87,4,64,44,2,49

It was not.I felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor, and even if it's complete-the movie was just outlandish and silly.At the end you're left mouth agape, mind befuddled and good taste offended. I have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred. People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall, four floors down from the theater near the entrance. It's that bad.			",83,6,2,6,9,1,3

								So far, I've been seeking for a serious zombie survival game. And this one is my top favorite zombie games so far! Also one of the most played games in my list. Due to the crafting, cooking, supplies, ect. Then it's like being in a real situation if it were in real life. The game is worth every single coin from my pocket. If you seek a serious zombie game which is not some typical shooting, asskicking, dogde game like Resident Evil 5 and 6. Then this is for you. Also, do take a look in youtube for Project Zomboid. It might fall for your taste. :) Have fun!			",144,85,0,37,12,0,6

								I was sat round a campfire with about 10 strangers talking about how we survived and how we are going to continue. Never got so involved with a game before to feel as if I'm in it.The Game:Honestly. I have always been looking for that perfect  Zombie Game. And this is it.It's in Alpha, but for an Alpha game it's great and very enjoyable.It's realistic but balanced well to be playableIt's graphics are perfect to set the mood and style of this game.The Map is great. It's based on the real life town in America near fort Knox (You are also given tools to make your own maps)The Full price is worth it.I reccomend for anyone interested in survival, zombie or role-playing game to buy it.If you're worried about it being alpha, At least wait until they release NPC's to the game, if they get good reviews then buy it.DevelopersWanted to say a word for the Developers.The Developers keep us updated with weekly posts, and update the game every month or so, and they really do listen to the community. They have done such an excellent job this way and managed to update the game to what they community enjoys. They listen to criticism and suggestions, they even added a mod into the game because it was so well done.A Prime example of the perfect Indie Developers. ",118,20,2,26,31,2,18

								So I'm writting my first review. I'd give PZ a 11/10 even though it's in an early stage of development I would say this game is going to be one of the best for awhile. This game gives you the real aspects of surviving an apocalyptic scenario. You have to scavenge, eat,drink,sleep,build and heal yourself when injuried. Vehicles, Other survivors and animals will be added. The game is so early in development and it's already one of the best games I've played.			",34,7,0,5,12,0,0

Early Access Review
								Project Zomboid is pretty much your typical zombie survival game.First of all, any fans of being a Bandit in Dayz. This game is not for you.Now that's out of the way Project Zombiod is a 2D zombie survival game. Its simple you wake up in a house in a large town split into two districts. You search around the houses cupboards, draws and even the fridge for supply's. Now you go to the window and see that their are many other house's around you probabaly containing even more loot. You open your front door and look out and see no sigh of trouble. You walk over to the house and find that the front door is locked. You walk around the side and open the window. You enter the house and start to look around. You manage to find yourself a new crowbar to use as a weapon. You also use a plastic bag to help you hold more food. You walk up the stairs and see a Zombie jump out at you. You beat it to death but notice that your character is now worried and frightened. You walk back to your house but as you open the front door a zombie sneaks up from behind and attacks you. You spin around, pull out your crowbar and beat it to death. You walk inside than treat yourself to a nice cold TV Dinner. 15 minutes later you get sick and die. Because you didnt cook the food.That was my first 20 Minutes in project zomboid and it made an impression. Sure its a simple survival zombie game but its felt real. The scaverging is where the games best moments are. Breaking into houses and carfully moving from room to room, collecting bed sheets to put on the windows as curtains back home so Zombies arn't attracted to the light. The game plays like any basic 2D game. Just move and click. You have two menus which display your inventory and whats around you. It is very basic in that way. But its how your character is and feels that works well. If you get attacked by a zombie your player will become panicked and won't be as accurate with his hits. Or if your at your base waiting around or reading about new skills your chacter will become bored which can lead to the charcter being un-happy. The weapons are basic. You just swing your bat in the direction and the target and it will hit it. Or if you have a gun its pre much auto-lock. No skill is required you just look,shoot and you hit your target. Their are no cars in the game so your always walking which can become repative and boring. The game is fair from realistc but feels real in a way that you always find stuff in places where you would expect stuff to be. Unlike in Dayz where you find stuff lying on the floor. Here you look in draws,shelfs and fridges to find loot. I love entering new houses or areas not knowing what is going to be there.The game isn't extremly easy. If you find yourself in a horde of zombies, to put it nicely. You're ♥♥♥♥ed. Zombies are a threat even though they can be taken down by one shot at times with a gun, zombies will hear this shot and close in on you. Once me and my friend were trying to loot a bank, we ran into the parking lot to find a horde of zombies waiting for us. We panicked smashed the window and jumped inside. I lost sight of my friend as 4 zombies that were already in the building closed in on me. I freaked out, pulled out my pistol and shot all 4. Worst decison of my life. Now zombies were flodding in, smashing windows  and breaking down the door's. As I had now discoverd my friend had left me for dead. I ran upstairs and tried to find a new way out and had no luck. As I tried to open a window to see if I could climb out. Zombies snuck up behind me and started attacking me. Already injuired I was dead in seconds. The game isn't easy seeing that zombies are easily attracted to noise and you can only see a small distance where your chacter is facing. The game can be hard on your own. But play it right or with friends and you will grasp it.Now eventually you will find yourself sellting down and buliding a base. Base building consits of two things, Physical Bulding and Farming. You can build walls to fortify your house and make a large farming area that you have to fertilise and water. It's basic but it works. Farming is also a great idea because eventually all water and power supply stops. So you cant keep your food in the fridge or drink water from the tap. Once you have a base I can find the game can begin to get repatative and boring. Eventually I found myself repeating the same thing. Going out and scaving as much as I can than bring it home. With the occasional farm. That is where the game really lacks. It get's boring. Their's no big multipalyer too. Sure you can join  populated severs but its just a cluster-♥♥♥♥. In the single player theirs no AI, no objectives, no events or anything like that. I wish their was the occasional moment when you run into a gang of AI and have a all out war. Or find other bases to break into or raid. Or maybe make a town and have AI work in it. All this can be added and I wish it will. Im sure AI will be added at some point with other features because right now after a while the game gets boring. But that is a matter of hours in. You can always start a new life fresh on your own or with friends and do it all again.The music in the game is great I have to say.THE VERDICT:Pros:-Zombie AI works great-Scavaging is fun- Looks fresh and new-Good fun with friends-Feels real but not too real-Base buildingCons:-Not a whole lot to it-Gets repeative after a while-No AI makes the only threat zombies-Big severs don't workRATING: 8/10The game is worth the price by a mile. I know the game is in early acceses so they will add new things and the game will get even better and the score would probably be bosted up to and 8 or maybe even a 9. But for now it's diffently worth it.			",121,7,0,6,6,1,12

								Project Zomboid is the most true of heart zombie survival ive seen. The fact that you can scavenge for items, craft items, evade zombies, and build your own compound is great. It was defenitly well worth the money for this game. Combat is pretty straight forward aim and fire, unless your surrounded by hordes of zombies. My first true attempt playing the game was good except accidently keeping the stove on while sleeping in the dead of night then getting surrounded by zombies and getting eaten I lasted 3 days 5 hrs not bad as a start.All in all its great for a game still in development, I hope it will continue to get better as th months go on and the developers meet their goal to finishing the game they dreamed.

								So... I had a previous review when I'd played for about 30 hours that made zero sense, as I'm fairly certain that I had created the review in a drunken stupor... So, now that I've had a couple (500 or so) hours of playtime since then, I figure I would update my review...Project Zomboid is exactly what it advertises itself to be- it is a zombie survival game which you will not survive. It even goes so far as to tell you that when you start the game (i.e. ""this is how you died"") Permadeath adds a lot to equasion, especially after having spent 10 hours building a base, only to get your face bitten off by a zed while running about trying to get find a pizza. That may not be somthing many people are looking for, but for those of us who are willing to try, try again- the next time you'll last 15 hours and have a bigger base before you get your face bitten off by a zombie while looking for a pizza.Now, for all my hours of gameplay I have only played multiplayer for about 4 or 5 hours, and during that time- not once did I meet another player... and I'm okay with that. Multiplayer games just mean I have to deal with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that will suck the fun out of everything and cause me to have to search for items over and over again as they get stolen from me. Not my cup of tea.There have been multiple reviews which have critisized the developers for taking quite some time in the development of the game, addition of new features etc, and lament the fact that the game is still in early access...Personally, having played the game on both Steam OS and Windows, I'd say that the game has come a hell of a long way since the original ""Kate and Bald Spot"" story that introduced me to this gameplay. (Give her a pillow! It's fun!)The developers are (perhaps a bit slowly) adding more and more layers to the game, and each patch brings great improvements not only adding additional gameplay options, but improving both the look and the ""feel"" of the game. They do an excellent job of informing people of what they are working on and how it is coming along... so my best guess is that people who think the developers are completely stagnating are illiterate idiots, and quite possibly blind. But I don't actively involve myself in the community- so what do I know.I've seen a lot of early access games that get dumped by the developers before making them remotely playable, let alone enjoyable...So- I would say, if the price was over 20 dollars- I'd say wait till it came on sale or was a bit further in development. But for 15 bucks- it's worth it. Every penny, any day. From the sound, to the feel, to the developers keeping they players informed and involved... It's a generally damn good game.Have a nice death :-)			",142,39,2,55,54,1,43

								I requested for a ban and I was banned, can you actually believe this? Jokes aside... I may not always agree with TIS team but they are always open to talk and discuss most things. I felt this past year my contribution to the community was kinda toxic (sometimes) or lead to toxic answers, and since I realized this was not going to stop I kinda requested for a ban/time out, was contacted by pm, we talk a bit and after asking me if I was sure, they fulfilled my wishes. Thanks!About the game, I will keep it simple. If you like survival games, this is a good one, and you also have multiplayer for those interested. There is a Demo, to try it out as well.In its current state the game is completely playable, very little bugs to non. There are plenty of things to do and you also have mod support.On the downside I feel development is slower than I would like.Cheers!			",43,7,1,9,8,1,6

								This is the zombie survival experience I've been waiting for for a long time. While it consists of typical zombie survival fare such as looting houses and shops for weapons and supplies, fighting off hordes of zombies and barricading windows and doors, it offers many more unique facets of gameplay that set it apart from other games of the genre. There truly is so much packed into this game, such as the ""moodlets"" which indicate current emotional, mental and physical state, not unalike the something from the Sims, or details as simple yet intuitive as hanging up bedsheets above uncurtained windows so as to break the line of sight of zombies, who would otherwise attempt (and succeed) in breaking in and murdering you. Foods rot without refridgeration, but then utilities such as water and electricity will cut off eventually, forcing you to stock up on non-perishables like canned soup or farming your own, and rain collecting barrels must be built. You can add an additional level to your house for a greater field of view and to reinforce your defenses. If you find even these features lacking, there is already a vibrant selection of mods to add even more to already rich game. The best part is that this is only just the beginning for this game. There are so many features to come, such as local and online multiplayer, NPC's and animals (and therefore hunting as well) and I can only see a bright future for it. Yet despite it's the fact that it is still in an early stage of development, it is already enormously playable.I strongly urge you to buy this game if you have an interest in the zombie survival genre, and I would like to remind you that every dollar aids the developers in it's creation.

								For the 90 hours that I've put into this game (Singleplayer Survival Only), I can tell you that this game has a lot, A LOT, of potential. Of course, this game is all about survival, no happy ending, no cure, no nothing, and this is a concept that a lot of Zombie Survival Game out there forgot. Survivalism isn't that threatening in those other games, but in Project Zomboid, things are different. I mean, as soon as you create a game, you can clearly read ""This is how you died"".Of course, some people might say that there is no point at all, no goals, no ""missions"", etc. This is not entirely true, as the point of the game is to create your own stories after all. How will you die? This question as yet to have been answered by you! Also, when I said that this game has a lot of potential, I was referencing to the future features that it has to offer (it's in Early Access for a reason). To begin with, NPCs (not yet implemented) will have a huge impact on the gameplay, since they will become a huge part in each playthrough. Plus, NPCs will be able to give more goals to the player, as he will be able to interact with them in many different ways. To sum up, Project Zomboid might be in Early Access for a while, but it will definitely be worth it. From building a community for all survivors to putting them out of their misery when they get bitten by a zombie, Project Zomboid is one of the best, if not the best Zombie Survival Game of all time!

								This game as incredible potential. That being said I already love this game even in its Alpha stage. Of course, I know the bugs will be fixed which is enticing and what keeps me checking up on this fantastic game. I hope it continues to progress, I see myself spending many many hours now and when the game releases. If only I could help in some way with this process. Anyway, one thing I think would be interesting, which would go along the lines of player progression, is when a my character approaches a zombie he/she panics ever so slightly. I understand that's realistic, however, when I've already killed 1000 zeds I don't feel my character should be phased by a single little shambler not even aware of my presence until its skull is scattered across the ground... Eh, just an idea. Keep up the fantastic work!			",5,0,0,2,0,0,2

								Project zomboid, is a survival game at its best theres tons of things to do such as building up defenses for your safehouse to farming to survive the coming days. Although there are a ton of bugs the game gets updated pretty frequently. I highly recommend this game to any hardcore zombie fan, but i recommend trying the demo because the game may not work on your computer.Edit: The MultiplayerI think its fun but only if your with your friends dont expect to survive by joining a random server where every god damn thing is looted and raded. GOOD LUCK!			",64,9,1,13,4,2,6

								What a fantastic game.  This is kind of like the Sims (original version) meets DayZ.  If you love open world, exploration, crafting with survival horror thrown in then I would highly recommed you check this game out.  On the demo version you can get 1hr play time before you will die because you start with an infection.  Full retail game has more game modes, save and save on crash.  You start in a proper house with all the basic mod cons.  From there on it is up to you to collect, craft and discover the things you need to survive.  The thought and design that has gone into this game is excellent.  I am really enjoing this game and it is still early access.  So much more to come such as NPCs, story mode, Multiplayer servers and more.  I highly recommend PZ.  Check out the demo on Steam if you are unsure and also watch this really useful beginners guide

								I've wanted this game since 2011, I saw Dopefish play it and I thought it was real fun, I tried buying it but it was not on Steam or any other trusted platform. The've come a long way from 2011, the game looks MUCH better and polished, and it's not even done.* You can pretty much turn the game to whatever you like, if you like classic dumb zombies you can do that, or superhuman fast zombies.* Don't let the looks fool you, you can farm and build in this game. Medical attention is very fun since it's not just ""drink soda or eat something to restore hp"", It actually focuses on the parts of the body that are damaged and require tools to attend to your wounds. *Skills are good, but I feel like it's kinda tedious how the XP system works at the moment (just an opinion). *The map is HUGE. and there's custom maps. I'm really excited for vehicles cause It's pretty tedious to just run whenever you want to go, and you have to travel several days to other spots of the map. *The map actually degrades overtime. Trash accumulates, windows break, walls crack, vines grow over walls and windows, grass starts to grow around the concrete, it's very nice. *Multiplayer is fun but it's better to play with friends if you don't play on a daily basis.*NPCs were removed but they are working on them again, so you won't be alone when surviving.Overall it's a pretty fun game so far, a couple little bugs and a couple things I'd love they implemented but it's still under development. Devs are cool, they give you every monday a blog post about what are they working on and the news about the next build. It's very much worth the 15 dollars.			",110,16,3,9,11,2,3

								So, here's a story for you all. New game, walking to the Gigamart. I saw a huge horde in the way, so i decided to come back later. First house I looked in, i found a shotgun and almost 50 shells. I decided it would be a good idea to go kill that horde. I ran out of ammo, got bitten,ran to a nearby house, locked myself in a bathroom and drank bleach to end my misery.Holy RonaldMcDonald 13.6/10			",81,6,0,5,10,0,5

								This is the best zombie survival game I've played, and I've played a few. The devs are great, giving the community large, game-enhancing updates at regular intervals, as well as a newsletter on their progress every Monday. Every time I come back to this game after a new update, I feel as if I'm hooked on the game all over again, simply because it's more immersive than ever. Also, it's surprisingly difficult to survive, at least for long periods of time. Custom sandbox is great for toning down the number of zombies and their ferocity, giving you a chance to get to grips with the game (there is also a beginner mode for those who don't want to fiddle around with settings), and survival mode is just brutal - lots of zombies, hardly anything to scavenge, so don't expect to last long. There's nothing like being bitten and fending off a horde of bloodthirsty zeds, knowing that you're not going to survive anyway, so you might as well go out on a high. :PNPC's is a feature that I'm really looking forward to that is yet to be implemented, but I hear they are working on it. They've recently added radios, TV's and walkie-talkies with Build 33 which may be an interesting development in later updates, such as being able to talk with NPC's over the ham radio; also good for multiplayer too, as bases can keep in contact with the people they send out to scavenge.Overall an excellent game with active devs that looks as if it's going to get even better. Would totally recommend for fans of zombie and/or survival games, as well as anyone looking for a nerve-wracking experience which will have you hiding in your house, clutching a baseball bat, as the zeds come knocking on the windows! Have fun!			",110,29,3,30,39,1,21

								The User Interface's a mess, the game is extremely crash prone, it's a performance killer, and there's not much content.But, it's more engrossing and open-ended than State of Decay, and you don't have to immediately deal with psychopathic survivors who want you dead when you start, unlike DayZ (at least, until human NPCs are implemented, or online multiplayer's added)If you're willing to accept that it's an Early Access title, get this. If not, wait a few more months, and then get it.			",144,16,2,20,9,1,16

								Great game on the surface. But as you play it only continues to impress and surprise you with incredibly in depth ""crafting"" (I use this term lightly, because its more of a ""turn this thig into that"" kind of thing), and game mechanics. The game offers an innovative new addition to zombie-survival games, with the field of view mechanics; as zombies leave your field of vision they fade from view, and do not reappear until you see them again, or are close enough to be heard. A great buy, can't wait to see how far the devs take the game!			",130,15,1,11,19,1,2

								Extremely impressive in terms of interactivity, think even Ultima 6/7 didnt have that much stuff you could do with stuff and stuff and also what stuff could do to you. Im really abit at a loss at what to list as an example. Of course theres cooking with an extensive array of utensils and ingredients. You could drink a bottle of whiskey to get abit happier. Then you could fill that bottle with water to have something to drink when theres no toilet (yup) or sink near. Then you could put that bottle into a plastic bag you found for abit of weight reduction, but then you of course could use only one handed weapons, better to have a backpack. Then when you get hungry you could pour that water into a bowl and if you had flour you could make dough, if you had ramen you put that together and then put it into any near oven. If you dont want the zombos to disturb you you could hang some sheets on the windows and switch of the light, and read a magazine to reduce some boredom while you wait until its done. And theres lots of other interactions like that.Combat is simple but functional, as are the graphics (abit of Postal 1 and Jagged Alliance) and controls. Inventory management/looting seems complicated at first but its really not if you get a hang of the menues.It really seems like a waste that this great framework of interactivity is wasted on yet another ""fart around until you die"" sandbox instead of being the basis for at least an rpg-lite with at least a few rudimentary goals. But seeing as its exactly advertised as a ""fart around until you die"" sandbox it delivers, and boy can you fart around. And hey, even Minecraft has some quest mode now, does it?

Devs are cool, they give you every monday a blog post about what are they working on and the news about the next build. It's very much worth the 15 dollars.			",110,16,3,9,11,2,3

								What a fantastic game.  This is kind of like the Sims (original version) meets DayZ.  If you love open world, exploration, crafting with survival horror thrown in then I would highly recommed you check this game out.  On the demo version you can get 1hr play time before you will die because you start with an infection.  Full retail game has more game modes, save and save on crash.  You start in a proper house with all the basic mod cons.  From there on it is up to you to collect, craft and discover the things you need to survive.  The thought and design that has gone into this game is excellent.  I am really enjoing this game and it is still early access.  So much more to come such as NPCs, story mode, Multiplayer servers and more.  I highly recommend PZ.  Check out the demo on Steam if you are unsure and also watch this really useful beginners guide

								I really freaking love this game, I've been playing it since it first became playable a few years back. I like the new realistic look to the game, but I wish there was a way to change back to the older version when it was rather cartoony looking and all the zombies looked the same. Plus there was survivors who created there own safehouses. I miss those early Project Zomboid days, but this game is getting better every time they update it. Give me the ability to play the older version every now and again and I will be a very happy survivor.			",75,14,0,12,7,0,7

Early Access Review
								tl;dr version, 8.5/10, still has a ways to go but as it is one of the most intense and realistic zombie survival games in a genre cluttered by easy fixes.There was no happy ending. This is how you died.I've been keeping up with Zomboid for longer than I'd like to think about. When it was first announced and gathering attention, the gaming world was abuzz with a zombie survival game the likes of which we had never really seen done well. The initial game they pumped out was fun and the promises of the game to come sounded like a dream come true for hardcore gamers.But as time went on, I lost interest due to slow updates. The game kept progressing, and every year or so I'd check up on it. I was generally impressed, but eventually just felt like there were enough zombie survival games emerging like Dayz that Project Zomboid had lost its chance. Finally, I decided to check its progress out one last time.And I was finally hooked.The experience it delivers is one that no other games to date have really offered. This is a true zombie survival horror game. It does not about action. It is not forgiving. You are thrust in the middle of a zombie apocalpyse with nothing but the clothes on your back and must survive any way you can for as long as you can. There is no happy ending here. The game only gets harder, and you will eventually die.You create your character picking a profession and using a beneficial/detrimental perk point system, meaning if you want your character to be strong you will have to give something up, such as asmtha or illiteracy. There are tough choices to be made, and many skills that are very useful. There are skills for cooking, gardening, foraging, and of course combat, and you are unlikely to get many of them very high unless you survive a long time. You will have to specialize your character.If you leave your oven on, it will burn your house to the ground. But maybe that's a good thing as you lured a horde of zombies to a house far from your safehouse and incinerated them all inside. The simple act of climbing through a broken window can give you an infection leading to death if you are not slow and careful. Running is taboo. Fighting every zombie is a chance of being bit and dead.The music is good ambient music that will set the mood, from a quiet slow terror to a banging intense beat if you are running from a herd. The sounds are functional and also quite terrifying. The graphics look nice while being low enough to be able to handle hundreds of zombies on screen and hundreds more off screen lumbering around. One thing that is not as functional is the animations, most of which are decent but I feel the game could use more of them to make things more clear in a game where there is no room for error.The game gives you a great amount of customization for your gaming experience, and you can start on a good beginner difficulty to learn how to survive in a safer enviroment or pump up the zombies from Dawn of the Dead to 28 Days Later fast and die quicker. Multiplayer is offered, but at the time of this writing has a long way to go to being something amazing. The potential is there and there are some great encounters to be had with some friends but public servers seem to still be off.This game is slow to move, but the developers are good about paying attention to the community and I have faith that if/when they finally deliver this game to it's full form, it will be the definitive zombie survival experience.

I mean there's is noone to interact with mate,except for some deadbeat willies walking around like a f0kin mooses trying to sniff out  dump whereabout left the other day.I mean we seen it all farming ,fishing f0kin hiking whatever mate but whats the point if you just stashing all them supplies for yourself like a grandpa whos trying to save some pocket money and hides it in his socks so he can then buy christmas present for his grandson.I've been around since the early start and i've waited so patienly for only one thing NPC's! Everytime new update came out I was Taping that ctrl+f searching like a b3l l3nd for a one simple phrase:NPC.Well guess what fam.THe devs went like: -NO fam we not gonna mention this anymore to those idiots a.k.a Community a.k.a the ones that fuels our pockets .Instead we gonna release a update which will include camping! Yaaaay How cool is that ?.Im like seriously pal ? Aight mate now im sitting by the stinking f0kin river with my fishing rod.Chillin innit? im gonna make a tent feed start a fire and maybe feed the mother f0 kin zeds with it so maybe then they can become my mates and we can chill out together by the huge base out of the moose sh111te ive collected for over centuries so we can drink that whiskey get smashed smoke those cigs ive pinched from local stores and just simply plan our next day out.Loneliness can kill more than anything especially early access games that had NPC feature pointed out in the begining.....What a waste....

								This game is amazing. When I first saw it on ImmortalHD's channel I thought it was a semi decent game that would be fun to play. Little did I know it would evolve into what it is now. This game has come along way with the addition of an advanced medical system and the (hopefully soon to be) addition of NPCs.Pros:- Interesting. Can keep you immersed if played properly for days- One of the MOST realistic survival simulators out there. (Might not be like DayZ, but in terms of survival it is)Cons:- Little boring on single player if you are new (I prefer multiplayer experiences)Little Multiplayer Story:Me and my friend were playing in a server. We decided to head to the hunting lodge up in West Point (That's where we thought the others in the game would be at) and found it to be empty of other players. We searched through the building to find a shotgun and a few shells. I was told to keep watch since I had no weapons and out of the corner of my eye I saw two men outside fighting off zombies. I screamed to my friend ""THEY'RE OUTSIDE!! HURRY! I SEE THEM! THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE!!"" He came to the door only to bust out screaming shooting blindly at them. One was gunned down in the process and the other took a severe wound to his chest. I picked up his weapon and we followed him into the woods. We assume he bled out... but we will never know to this day.10/10 would search again			",71,21,2,9,1,2,7

 Project Zomboid  Genre: Horror, Survival, RPG, Action, (Dying Simulator) Out of 10 what score would you give it?  I would give it  10/10  due to being a unique and different style of the overused zombie survival genre. Brief description of the gameplay: Project Zomboid is an isometric 2.5-D (A 2D image that simulates depth much like 3D) zombie survival game that is very much different from all of the other...generic zombie games, including a realistic medical system in which you MUST keep an eye on your wounds else you might not wake up the next morning! What was good about this game? Everything! I mean from the configurable settings to the weather and the amount of things you can do in the game, looking after yourself is vital to your survival from depression and boredom to stress & temperature, every aspect of the human condition is counted as a survival mechanism and for you to truly survive & thrive in this environment you must manage all of this effectively, failure to do so results in death, and not just ""you die, and then respawn"" once you die in this game the whole world is gone, you could call it permadeath, all of your hard work gone, just because you decided to investigate that abandoned police station. (Police stations are dangerous; I did this once, and died almost instantly).But that's not all, you have to scavenge for vital supplies such as food, water even rope & weapons, because after a while has passed (6 in-game months by default) water and electricity will be cut off to the town and you are left to fend for yourself. However you can build defences to not only hold off the advancing zombie hordes but to provide sustenance, shelter, warmth & storage.Food spoils and water becomes tainted, so what do you do? You build makeshift water catchers to provide clean & safe water, find seeds and plant crops in a safe place...look after them and maybe one day, they will flourish into clean, edible food!And to top it all off, updates, and the community, updates on game come out every Monday (They are called the mondoid) usually these don't include any game updates (they're usually once a month) but instead just what they have been working on for the past week, and they are usually interesting! What was bad about the game? I can't really think of much that is wrong with this game, other than that there are no NPC's (Non-player characters) and there are also no cars, but it has been confirmed that these things are going to be integrated into the game in the coming months.

								For now, i want to say i really like this game. But there is only one thing that bothers me, to have REAL fun. You need to play multiplayer with friends, i mean. If you play singleplayer, it CAN get boring fast. If you play multiplayer... then it would be better. Still, if you want to play multiplayer, then you need to make your friends also play it. If you play on a random server, you will see COMPLETELY empty houses and even if there is 8 or 11 players on the server, you will not find them.One of the first time i played, i died of infection (zombie-infection) and it was really fun but after that, i wanted to try multiplayer... and for now i think there MAYBE should be an OFFICIAL server from the creators. If there was an official one, people would just join on it instead of trying to find a server or create a server.I really like this game and i hope they upgrade multiplayer a bit so it can be more fun.+ Simple GUI, no problem understanding it.+ The graphics are simple but they give a big effect, maybe because of the colors that blend into the apocalypse.+ Local multiplayer, online multiplayer, singleplayer and even multiplayer between different platforms.+ Many things your character can feel, panic, sad, sick, pain... everything.+ Many different skills you can give your character, but you need to balance it so you don't just take all positive things and so on. (I am right?)+ There is an tutorial! Welcome those who don't know how to play this!+ ""Not so high system requirements.""+ Support for controllers.+ Can be bought on Steam! Yay!- Early access, much things to add and bugs.- (I think) There is not so many options in customizing the look of your character.- I would like them to ""upgrade"" the graphics, to make them more detailed or (HD).- No campaign. (For now)- No plans for making it a console game. (The game would need to be re-written(Or something))[SPOILER ALERT]+ No way to survive(?) Already at the start when entering a world, the creators gave us a really good intro. *fade in* These are the end-times... *fade out**fade in* There was no hope for survival... *fade out**fade in* This is how you died... *fade out*""Click to skip intro""You think i gonna die? NO WAY! *Zombie bites me and i die some days after...*No sh*t, this game is reeeaaally hard. BUT I LOVE IT! :DDDDD[SPOILER END]			",43,3,0,2,4,0,2

Be aware that this is not a ""Zombie Shooter"" but a survival sim set during a zombie event. Though unfinished the developers are hard-working, conscientious, and very responsive to the community. The game community itself is wonderful and supportive. Very active modding scene. Best of both worlds - great devs, great players. The game itself seems ""retro"" and limited at first but there is astonishing depth to it. I've put over 500 hours into this game and I'm only now grasping what it has to offer.Don't be fooled by gameplay videos - the default game map is huuuuuuuuuuuuge.10 / 10, excellent game.

								Although the game's graphics are somewhat dated, gameplay is interesting and highly addictive. The default map is huge, allowing for sustained game play for quite some time. Alternate maps are available through the workshop. The sandbox option allows for custom game play controling game enviroment thru to types of zombies and how they work. You can create shamblers to sprinters, weak to strong, and then try to survive it all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've noticed recently that all the top review here are negative and I find it a bit strange, especially since the people giving those reviews are complaining about it getting repetitive and not enough being added recently. While I can understand frustrations over slow updates from the devs, but the game still has a lot of content and a huge amount of detail and complexity that you won't find in most games, especially zombie survivals or just survival games in general and more than that, the game is only 14 euro. Thats a really low price for a game that will provide u with hours of content. I notice that all these people writing negative reviews, in particular those who complain about the gaming being repetitive, all have 50+ hours in the game. That's a lot of hours for a 14 euro game that you claim not to recommend. I started playing project zomboid one day after my internet broke down and pz was one of the few games I could play offline. During that time I put around 10 hours into the game and loved. I died a lot, but I loved it because as I died I learned something new and I died from a variety of different problems, not just being killed by a zombie. Since then I've put another 10 hours into the game and another 5 playing split screen with a friend on his PC. I've had a lot of fun with this game as it is and even though updates are infrequent, the game still has hours and hours of content for a very small price. And considering that the people giving this a negative review have 50-100 hours in the game, I think they really enjoyed it too.			",78,13,0,14,8,0,8

								This is a well thought out zombie survival game that has plenty of developer support and modding/community support as well.  That's a combination to a sustainable and successful game which is what Project Zomboid is achieving.  For me I found the game refreshing because this game already has what many other zombie survival games strive to become.  There's a great crafting system, base building, various levels of difficulties, single player, co-op, or play as multiplayer.  One thing I particularly enjoyed is that the game doesn't hide the fact that you will die at some point(as the game becomes increasingly more difficult as times carries on and resources start to reduce(such and utilities being turned off permanently).  So every time you go out to scavange when you have survived for a while is a legitimate risk of the effort you have put in.Some issues with the game is the game is extremely harsh to new players, although this is getting better from the developers via tutorials.  I also suggest reading up on guides and the forum(something I didn't do initially, I jumped right in and turned into zombie food).  Some mechanics feel clunky, especially if you're used to playing with a controller, it feels more favorable towards mouse and keyboard, so be prepared for some adapting.With that all said I would highly recommend getting this game if you're a zombie fan, survival fan, or both.  You will find it rewarding and challenging at the same time.			",375,71,6,42,108,6,100

								Played co-op with my wife. Ran around and had fun taunting and killing the helpless zombies. Found lots of cool stuff, set up a survival house. She smashed in a window with her bare hands and started bleeding. A helicopter came and summoned all the zombies ever. We barricaded in our house and we killed all the zombies. Her bleeding hands(!) managed to kill her near the end. I was left in a pile of 30 zombies bodies and my wife's corpse. Well that was exciting I said to her and then her corpse reanimated and ate me.There's a life lesson there somewhere I think?			",206,38,2,43,27,0,56

								Project Zomboid is one of the best zombie games of all time although it is still in development. Some people might rant about the long time this game has been on Early Access and that some promised features are still yet to come. But they seem not to see the advantage in this longer development period. The devs really care about this game and every detail is made with love. I spent more than 1.000 hours in PZ and with every little update there is something new to explore. Bugs are rare and I never encountered any game breaking bug in a stable Build. There are frequent updates and if a bug is reported it usually gets fixed within days. But one of the best things in PZ is that the devs are in close contact with their community and a lots of suggestions made by the players have found their way into PZ. Moreover, there are plenty of options to customize your game and PZ can be easily modded and has a great modding community.I fully recommend this game if you are looking for a Romero-like zombie experience and if you are not too impatient in terms of ETAs.

								HOW LONG CAN YOU LAST??This game is amazing. The graphics are not the “best” but that’s not what this game was going for. Give them a brake for god sake it’s only like 11 people working on this game. Plus, it’s INDIE with low funding. This is game was made to see how you can handle yourself in a Zombie Apocalypse! SO LET ME TELL YOU, THIS GAME HAS IT DOWN TO A SCIENCE! The detail that you can go into is just incredible. You play like you really think you would need to in order to live day to day. If you go out and try to just kill tons of zombies with no set plan YOU WILL DIE. People give this game a thumbs down because of how long it has been in development (an because the devs keep saying how they have NPC’s an Cars on the way yet still have not got that to us). I just want to finish this Review up with a thought of my own. This game is a good game a fun game an you will always find something new to do. People play it just the way it is and love this game. Stop sweeting the small stuff. JUST PLAY THE GAME!! YOU WILL HAVE FUN!! - GodFires			",33,2,0,3,5,0,4

								In the games current state, I'd have to say it's a do not buy from me.It's got a solid backbone to it, with skills, multiple weapons, character progression, and other things that a survival game should have, as well as a huge map, with mod support that adds more, but unfortunately the devs don't know which way they want to go with it.At one point they mentioned NPC's being in the game, that's long since been abandoned with nothing said about it, and most recently they've been working on new animations... for the last half year +.  The last few dev blogs have mentioned nothing about them, instead they've added VoIP for servers (in the age of Discord/Steam/Curse/TS/Vent/etc), and a new map (modders have added 5+ fully fleshed maps in that time).As I said there are mods for the game, and, sadly, they actually get updated more often than the base game.  Hydrocraft is a big one, and comparing the changelogs, there's a lot more going on in the mod, then the game.  New items are being added fairly often, bugs being fixed, and skills being added, when the base game has only just released a new map area...Very disappointed with the game as of now, I'd wait until release to purchase.Edit as of 2nd April, 2017:  It's been almost a year since the animations started getting worked on, and for the last few weeks - at least - we haven't heard a single thing about them, but there's all this stuff about vehicles coming in.  Wonder what they'll move onto when they're halfway done with those this time...The devs have no idea how to follow through with an idea, I feel like this game will never leave early access.

								This game is great.  I have yet to really delve into the multiplayer aspect of it much, but just even going solo is a lot of fun, and the game continues to impress with each update.  You really feel alone and helpless in this game as you run around and try to loot all you possibly can while you cross your fingers and pray for the items/tools/weapons you need to sustain yourself for just one more day.  The aspect I really love in this game is how you can set how early on the infection has been in effect.  You can set it early on so there's still indoor plumbing for easy access to water and electricity, or much later on during the infection where electricity is shut off and you rely on generators or just roughing it, and water being had from stockpiling water bottles or collecting rainwater in barrels.

								First off id like to state this game is of a top down veiw. You are able to zoom in and out and the whole objective is to surviveby any means. This game (being a favorite of mine.) offers only one set ending. Your death. By what means? Who knows. Maybe your house burnt down or a zombie miss took you for a happy meal. What ever the case this is a horror suvival game. If you have a weak heart i'd suggest not playing this. Just out of caustion for your condition and the high stress of clearing out a horde infested house.      This game has a well versed medical system and the ever present way to end the game with bleach in every house. Personaly, If you like horror, survival and fortifing in a game while managing your ever depleting beef jerky supplie, well what can I say. Go to the supper market after you get this game. :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's an 'okay' game, but the waiting process for any major updates is a killer. At the moment, the game feels kind of empty with no npc's (I'm one of those weird people who doesn't have high speed internet to play multiplayer) and I don't anticipate seeing them till around 2030, at least with their current development speed anyways. Don't get me wrong, I do like this game! But with it's current build status, it can get quite boring just walking around and surviving. Alone. When they get the NPC's and all of their other planned features such as cars, new animations (have been waiting for them 'anyday now' for the past 5 months) and a bigger world to explore, then I might be able to enjoy it more. But as is, meh. I want to recommend it, but for the sake of other people who might get trapped in this endless waiting game, I can't.			",20,3,0,15,5,0,1

								I'm not sure where to start with this review, really. I could mention how despite only having 11 hours in it I feel as though I've beaten the game already, or how the mods are better than the sorry excuse for updates, but just thinking about PZ wounds my soul so deeply I barely have the strength to raise my hands to write the review... So I'll just whinge for a bit.This game has (had) so much potential, but it's followed in the footsteps of so many indie games where the devs just snatch the EA release money and disappear when they ""don't feel like"" finishing a product. The modders are the real stars of the community! They've released stuff the devs can barely manage to copy, and without mods I don't think I'd have played very much of this at all.I'd like to say I've learned my lesson about buying EA games, but I haven't. Maybe next time will be better.			",60,14,0,24,17,0,14

								Yes the update progress on the main branch build is slow, but considering the size of the team at indie stone, the grand scope they have in mind, and factoring the frequent communications via their weekly mondoid and forum posts; I can overlook my eagerness for the final product to allow time for everything to come into focus. This game has been worth every penny I spent on it and I'll continue to enjoy it upon release and well afterwards. It's also worth note that I've ran a modded server for this game on and off since I bought it 2 years ago and never had any issues setting it up nor experienced any game breaking bugs, which is impressive to me for a supposedly Early Access game.

 Project Zomboid  This is a game in the early access about survival in a city overrun by zombies. The game is not like other survival games on steam where we kill each other for a can of potatoes. It is based on cooperation and helping one another to survive. Combat in the game is poorly done in my opinion, especially with gun as we find it so you should avoid fighting with infected because every scratch can be fatal. This does not mean that our main enemy are the zombies, this includes the weather, running in cold weather in the rain might end up as a death without adequate medicines. The same is about a evacuation from the second floor in case of danger, lack of adequate preparation can end up with a broken leg. Going through the broken window without clearing it may end up bleeding and a piece of glass in our body. Leaving the oven on at the night will end up a big fire and burning of our hero. Death is inevitable, you can fight but in the end you will fall. Everything can kill you cold weather, rain, bleeding, contact with infected and other deadly things but the most common cause of our death is our stupidity :D. The game graphically is not bad and the camera is set in an isometric view that can zoom in and out at any time during the game. I really like sound design and that the zombies react to loud sound, shooting, alarms, breaking out windows and random sounds can attract a considerable amount of zombies. The game is well developed, a huge map with great potential, the two cities and the country side. The survival of a bunch of days can satisfy. This production has a steam workshop thanks to the work of other players we can modify our game adding new things like vehicles, animals that may be hunted, a new city or even a prison from The Walking Dead. It does not change the fact that the game has a lot of downsides. One of them is that there is no map and we need to use website to find each other. There is no storyline but there was one very very long time ago. No NPC on the map, I think it would be cool move because playing the game on singleplayer seems to be a little empty. And the biggest downside is that the creators rarely update their production. The game has many advantages but it also has many downsides in my opinion which does not change the fact that the game is well made and worth buying, it means that I have no regrets because I have a lot of fun while playing this game alone and with my friends.

https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Version_historyaccording to their own fan wiki, made by fans, for fans, if you notice updates by content, each update around december is the biggest, which is, ironicly, christams season, which is a comerical sales dream for most companies, due to the fact that products in game industry the christmas season is a big seller. So, its seems convient, or at least, if they disagree, a ""beneficial coinicidence"", that their biggest updates occur around the biggest selling date of the year., if you do not wish to read the whole thing like i did, ill list updates by biggest content, and highlight all the december ones. you do the math:2013:6th December 2013	(look for this one)2014:29th December 2014 (thisi s mighty fine update...seems it was near same time as last year's update.. surely not a coinci....)8th November 2013 (god damnit...at least they threw off the trail by a mere month...ah well, its 2/3...was so close to proving my point)will be updated later in december when i make it 3/4 and confirm their comericfal agenda			",277,46,5,50,95,1,71

								Yeah, so I'm gonna be another one to jump on the ""hate train"", I guess.Firstly, I have to start out by saying that this is one of the games I have looked most forward to, like, ever.The amount of hours here on Steam doesn't even come close to the ones I've had in pirated versions.I really love this game.Anyway,I'd given the game almost a year's break, seeing that it got stagnant, and though it was fun getting back into, the joy was shortlived, because the promises made by the developers years ago, are not even close to being upheld yet. Tbh., the game felt exactly the same as last I played it.We were promised vehicles and NPC's, but instead the developers chose to re-work the entire animations system, even though the original one was fine. They also spent time making new maps, implementing VOIP, new furniture, gardening, and a lot of mostly useless items, that barely changed the dynamic of the game.(Don't even get me started on the annoying zombies, that ALWAYS seems to find you, no matter where you hide.)-And as many other people have pointed out, if you post critical posts on their forums, they will get angry with you. or their fanboys will vigilantly defend them, just for pointing out obvious shortcomings of the game.Sorry, I've been following the game for four years now, and I'm just so disappointed.I cannot recommend this :/[EDIT: I just went to their website, and found out that the posts I'd written over two years ago, where I asked when NPC's and vehicles would be implemented, seeing that it had been over a year ago at that time that they had promised it, has been deleted. :EDIT]			",46,4,0,3,3,0,7

								Project zomboid and I have a love/hate relationship. I love the premise, I love a lot of the gameplay, but I hate how I feel strung along to fund another game that will take a large % of my lifespan to complete.A year ago I think they were talking about an NPC build... still waiting... it took them forever to get animations in, not totally sure why... This is one of the few games where this much time can go by between my play sessions and the game feels so similar.A game like this is just screaming to be made into persistent worlds of people and survivors with modding and more... but time ticks on sloooowly.I'm just going to say I don't recommend this game until Devs show some actual gameplay enhancements that are more substantial than stuff I could program in a month on my own... and yes, I'm a programmer, so I'm making a fair assessment.

								Edit: The devs have replied everybody! WHAT a surprise. 25 man years? ... Please tell me this is a joke ... The massive stupidity displayed in the comments only proves my point. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad and pathetic. Bye~Why am I giving it a negative review? Well, it's the same old story.I was at one time invited by the devs to offer constructive criticism of the game onto their forums. I did so, and the devs promptly threw a hissy fit and tried to start an argument with me. I was then promptly banned both from the forums and from commenting on their Steam page - over nothing. These people will label constructive reviews as ""Abusive"" for being negative even if the review praises the game and offers constructive criticism. They'll ban anyone for speaking their honest opinions about this game in a respective way.Seen in the light of the development time and quality of updates, this does not reflect well on them. This is the negative aspect of indie gaming. The least you can expect from a gaming company is to be mature and respectful. Not so with many indie devs, including this team. (There's probably a quite a few people who work on this game and have no relation to such poor and unprofessional behavior.)They need a PR person.Here were my suggestions.- Special zombies and more challengesChallenges are actually really fun, but it seems like there no update on them and there's hardly any mods that add to them. (More on mods later.) Special and more challenging zombies will go a long way to make the game more enganging. A story will too, which is another issue about the game.The apocalypse happened, but there is no signs of people anywhere. It's just an empty map... The Drayton mod has much in the way of an envriomental story. (I highy reccomend that mod.)  In the Drayton map, there's blood and signs of death. Dead bodies left behind, some of people who decided to off themselves. There's spray paintings on the wall bemoaning the military and a cure. There's signs of struggle, of life, of a story... that map doesn't feel as empty even when you're the only one.Bad behaviored devs aside who don't know how to act maturely or take criticism, this game is very complex and well done. There's an intricate crafting system. The farming system is really well-done. The enviroments are huge and intriquate and fun to explore. The zombies have very interesting behavior and it really feels like you're trying to survive the apocalypse.But then we get back to the fact that the world is so empty.Here's how a typical playthrough will go.-Spend 30 mins creating a character-Get a weapon from the kitchen-Loot houses for supplies (This is the fun part)-Skip town because now the zombies are swarming you like there's no tommorrow-Head for a farm somewhere where there's a well (infitnite water)-Farm, farm, farm-Now you have infinite water and food. What now?Eventually you get bored and just kill yourself somehow, put the game down and then picked it up again a few months later. This game is best enjoyed in short bursts.There is really no longterm goal. The most fun I have is roleplaying different scenarios and acting how I really would if this happened in real life. It's funner to set yourself up for failure by boarding yourself up in your apartment and stay in the city or mall.Once you ""learn"" the game and the zombies aren't much of a challenge anymore, there's another problem that I mentioned before. Once you start exploring, the whole game feels so empty. There's no cars anywhere. Just empty roads. No signs of a civilization past. Just empty houses. Empty streets. Empty diners. Does that sound depressing? Well, it is. (In addition, the devs said that they'll be adding cars in the game FOREVER, and a modder already made a mod that adds working cars and abandoned cars in the game for free, on their own spare time.... go figure.)Zombie survival games are a dime a dozen now, and this game has been in development for more than half a decade. Think about that. What updates we get aren't anything to sing home about. The enviromental degration system and immersive sounds we're both made by a (great) modder. That's the only two updates that really added value to the game... in the meantime, they updated backpacks and now the TV's will spout nonsense repeatedly, the same 15 lines a million times over.People have devoted a large part of their life to this game, waiting for them to complete it and still there is no hint of the Big One. Npcs. A feature that will complete the game, and made it significantly more fun in addition with a long term goal of some story.I owe you a warning. The vision the devs have for this game probably isn't what you had in mind. As I said, I had some interaction with them before. They went of some pretentious rant about how 'humans are the REAL monsters' and explaining the artistic merit of Dawn of the Dead. Their vision for this game is more along the lines of The Walking Dead than a true zombie survival HORROR game.I'm sorry to Walking Dead fans. I sort of liked the show too, but WE GET IT. HUMANS ARE THE REAL MONSTERS. We get it everyone! Humans are bad. Violence is bad. Our basest of nature is bad. We are a bad and violent people.The reason why the Walking Dead is so hated is because of all of the dumb melodrama, and how the zombies stop being scary and become just background noise to whatever relationship problems some whiny brat has. (Who explicity has salon styled hair and high-end make up...) I said this before and I'll say it again. In the zombie world, zombies are the main character. We want to see horrors. We want to be scared. The ultimate nature of humanity isn't scary. It isn't horrifying. Sorry. Once zombies stop being the main character, then it stops being scary and we wake up from the nightmare.So I'm looking forward to the NPCs, but I'm not interested in the direction they are taking this. Fair warning. Dying Light is a good example of what I mean. The original story sucked and detracted from the quality of the game. However, The Following; the story was quite good and added a lot of depth to the game and zombie lore. The difference is that in the latter, the monsters were the main character in the plot. This is how horror succeeds where other genre's fail.But, by the time they finish NPCs the lifespan of this game will be long over. No Man's Sky is coming out soon. It's indie. The devs are actually friendly. It's complex and awesome, and suprise, surprise! It's actually finished within 10 years. Why waste time with drama and an empty, unfinished world when I can just play another game? Please tell me.This game has value, but be aware - before buying, it's just ANOTHER zombie survival game that's in EA that will probably never be finished within our lifespans.Oh, and to add insult to injury... they focused on multiplayer for $$$ instead of the NPCs.One last note: None of the mods for this game are that exciting. Wow, I get purple hair and now I can eat bugs. There's nothing really big in the mods section. The most popular mods are female nude mods and a Deadpool skin... enough said. Nothing to add challenge. No big overhaul, unlike the wild and creative mods you can get with games like Civilization. There is this one modder who said that they wanted to make a mod that turned this game into The Mist. Where did you go? Because that is a great idea. How about a mod that turns this game into The Thing?Here's an idea - wouldn't it be great if we could start playing while the infection is JUST beginning rather than AFTER the apocalypse already has started?Imagine it. You wake up, living your normal day like in real life. Then someone gets infected. It's slow at first, until people (NPCs) panic. More and more succumb to the infection. You are living the begining the the World War Z diaries. That would be great.This isn't that, but if only it were... it would be really good.			",6,3,0,2,3,0,1

Early Access Review
								In short: If you like watching progress bars this may be for you.  There seem to be a bunch of folks who really enjoy this game a lot, but it wasn't for me.I knew going in that this is an extremely detailed zombie survival game with a huge range of possibilities.  I'm OK with that, and I generally appreciate games that make some nod toward realistic world building (zombies notwithstanding, of course.)  My issue with this game is that it's just not fun.  I only played for an hour or so before I surrendered to the fact that it is just boring, plain and simple.  (I was playing offline, so steam doesn't track time properly; I actually had to play the silly thing again for online just so it would let me post a review.)The biggest issues I have are with the times required to do anything.  I actually like that it takes 5-10 seconds to fill a water bottle or a few seconds to dig some bit of electronics out of a cabinet.  What I don't care for is things like a baseball bat that takes 10 seconds to pick up, 20 more seconds to store in a backpack, 20 seconds to remove from the backpack, and finally 10 seconds to store in a cupboard when you get home.  If you find a nice collection of goods or equipment to bring home, you're going to spend a huge amount of time just waiting for progress bars to progress while you move items around in your inventory.  There needs to be a middle ground between the time required to deal with inventory tasks (looting, moving things around, etc) being meaningful and being wasted.  As it is, I felt like the game was more about watching progress bars than it was about zombies or survival.The book system is another offender in this way.  I was unable to actually read an entire book (Basic Cooking, mind you, not Rocket Surgery Level XVIII) because I'm not willing to wait 10 real minutes for a progress bar to complete in a video game.  220 pages at 2-3 seconds per page is a long time to wait while doing nothing fun.  Not surprisingly but higher skill level volumes have more pages still, so yay?  At first I was even more unhappy since the progress bar completely restarts whenever you move or do any action at all.  It appears that you completely restart the book but it does record partial progress (there's a small tooltip that shows how many pages you've read.)  I will say that recipes (plans for an electronic timer, let's say) are learned much more quickly (fewer pages, presumably) so that this isn't a problem for them.Just moving around and fighting are clunky as well.  Whack a zombie in the head with a baseball bat (you've got to be holding the RMB while you click the LMB, because reasons!) and it falls over.  If it doesn't fall in just the right direction (maybe within 15° off of your current view direction) or if it stumbles back a step before falling then your followup smacks are going to miss.  Gotta take a half step closer and adjust your angle slightly.  Whoops, you stepped on it instead, now you're swinging at the dirt past its head.  Perhaps ranged combat it less frustrating, but I never got there.If the exploration aspect of that game were lacking while the rest of the game (survival, crafting, etc) compensated for it, that could work, but as it stands, neither part of the game is worth it.  It's a game that is essentially sorting through inventories and watching progress bars broken up by a mildly frustrating game of exploration and zombie fighting.  I guess you die eventually, but I couldn't be bothered to get that far before quitting.			",16,8,0,6,10,0,6

								I should have reviewed this game ages ago.  I absolutely love this game! It is, in my opinion, the best survival crafting game I have played.  It has a focus on realism, barricades take realistic amounts of resources, no building guns out of iron ingots and plants or something like that in this game!  Updates can be slow, and the game isn't yet complete, but the devs always put out quality updates, and do everything they can to keep in touch with the community.  The game has come so far, and has a fairly large fanbase, and a pretty great community of players and modders.  If you're unsure about buying an early access title, don't worry here, this game is stable and has plenty of content.  If you really, really won't buy then I implore everyone whom has an interest in Survival Crafting games or a generally realistic survival simulator to at least keep an eye on this title.

								Will it ever NOT be in early access? This is getting ridiculous, and I regret supporting an unfinished game, just like Starbound. It's been more than 4 years. 4 YEARS. The main menu's 'theme song' or whatever it is of the women moaning and ooo-ing is infuriating to listen to, you get injured once and your speed goes down to a crawl, and only injure yourself farther the more you move. Realistic, sure, but that doesn't mean it's fun when you get in 1 minor scuffle with a zombie and die 2 days later just trying to recover in bed. The world is dead, no NPC's around ever, it's just you waking up in some house surrounded by thousands of zombies in a town. I sometimes hear helicopters pass by over head, but I don't think those are actually for anything. I remember playing it a few years ago with that starting tutorial story with the injured wife and husband, that showed promise! where is that? where is ANYTHING like that? theres almost nothing to this game it feels. Theres farming, but you can just scavenge for food forever it seems. You can build safe houses, but why not just fortify an already built house? There are 2 maps and I can't tell the difference between either of them. You can level up your character but it doesn't seem to have any real impact on gameplay.You can venture around outside and get weapons and guns to make finding food easier because you don't need to worry about zombies so much, but then they break or run out of ammo and you need to find more weapons so you can find more food so you can survive longer so you can just repeat until you die. If there was actual NPC's to interact with then the game could start getting some semblence of a goal, you find some guy out in the city, befriend him, trade resources & help each other out, find more survivors and make a community together, all while dealing with zombies and hunger problems and other hostile survivors! But no, the game doesn't have that. This wouldn't annoy me so much if the game has only been around for a few months, but this simply isn't the case and the game has just sat in my library for years now even when I bought it back on Desura because it wasn't avaliable on steam.  Is 4 years not enough time to make a game and get it out of early access? Apparently not!  It feels like they're just using the term ""Early Access"" as a shield for their unfinished game they don't want to work on. But I don't know that, it's just what it feels like after waiting so long. The 15 hours i've played is more like 15 1 hour sessions checking to see if the game has gotten any better, and so far, I wish that I could refund this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game is ♥♥♥♥in' amazing, feels, and plays like a fully developed game. Yet, people will leave negative reviews since it's been in developement for a long time. The team's made of like 4-5 people, one of them recently having a kid. Most reviews will say something along the lines of:""No NPC's, no car's, repetitive gameplay""But the thing is, car's and NPC's aren't neccessary for the game to be good, it's still fun, and the best zombie survival simulator on the market, and if NPC's and car's are important for you there's mods for it.Definitely reccomend.

								Project Zomboid or PZ for short is one of the better survival games to have come out on steam. Don't let the pixel looking graphics fool you because the game offers quite a lot.  It is the attention to small detail in a game like this that makes it feel like what you're doing and the choices you made on your route mattered and made the difference between life and death.  Open a window to a house because the front door is locked, an alarm goes off! How will you deal with it? You've been bitten on the hand while playing with some friends. You're going to turn soon, do you tell them and maybe have them kill you where you stand for their safety or trek on like everything is okay.  Forget you've put something in the oven and then gone to sleep. Wake up toasted.  Project Zomboid is a good enough game to support but the devs make buying early access a pleasant experience. How the devs conduct themselves is partly why I jumped all over PZ and it was the best purchase I've made on steam to date.			",72,10,0,10,6,0,4

								A great combination of retro graphics with modern gaming mechanics. I've been looking for a zombie apocalypse simulator that wouldn't kill the graphics card on my Mac and this game fits the bill! The game play reminds me a little bit of the looting mechanics of Diablo mixed in with the intricacies of character leveling and extensive crafting and cooking systems, there is a lot to discover. Not to mention the map is quite large. I've played about 15 hours now and I have barely covered a small portion of the map.I definitely recommend this game to everyone, there is something in the mechanics of the game for almost every type of player.Not to mention the multiplayer will be coming out eventually and that experience alone will change the feel of the entire game. Definitely something to look forward to!			",16,2,0,3,1,0,2

								In my opinion, it's the greatest zombie simulation game I've ever played.  Sure it doesn't have the graphics or that First-Person Shooter feeling of a game like Dayz, but there's much more freedom and it's a more realistic experience.  You can build, barricade, farm.  And now I hear it's even multiplayer.  You have more things to worry about than just food, water, and health.  There's boredom, depression, fear, anger, pain, and sickness.  The character creation is interesting because you can get bonuses based on what your previous job was.  You can also pick strengths and weaknesses.  For example: You be claustrophobic (+4) and Short sighted (+2) but then you could be Athletic (-6).  The game isn't even finished yet and I'm still impressed.  Definately worth the $14.99.

								I was put off buying this game due to the graphics but gave in after reading some of the other reviews on here and discovered that I love this game. It seems game mechanics overshadow pretty graphics.Project Zomboid is an amazing Zombie survival game. All the times I've played I have yet to use a gun which in my opinion is one of the best aspects of gameplay.With not only the constant threat of being eaten by zombies there is also the threat of infection, dehydration, starvation, exposure. All these different elements trying to kill you make you genuinely care about death (a rare thing in any game).I would definitely recommend this game to any fan of the zombie genre who is sick of fps cannon fodder fests.

								I can't remember what I expected from this game before buying it.  I think I was looking at a typical hack and slash game.  A friend recommended it, so I gave it a go.  I'm glad I did.An hour into the game, I still wasn't sure what I was playing.  I liked the passage of time, the needing to eat and drink, and finding better weapons, but that was barely scratching the surface.I learned to build new objects (by learn, I mean I figured out that I could do it...  you don't need to find plans, or anything, as the game just lets you know what you need after you find a hammer).  I thought I was doing well, and was a little worried that this game was going to end up being Farmville with zombies...  then the power and water went out, and I was left unable to cook food easily.  Without power, there's no refrigeration, and perishables will rot.  Now, it's a battle for survival not just against zombies, but against time, and your own biology.  Hunger and thirst are as dangerous as any biter.  The rain which was an inconvenience before is now essential, and it doesn't come along often enough for my liking.If you're on the fence about this game, just pick it up.  Farmville, it ain't.

It is however on the cusp of having those features added so it will soon get even better.It may seem like it is never getting updated but there are various beta versions you can enable through steam which are updated frequently.Worth getting!

								""a zombie game thats main focus was the elements of survival not the zombies themselves""I followed this game about a year before it popped on steam, unfortunately, I lost my previous copy due to tranferring computers. But I bought a second copy and noticed the improvement. This is a game where you die. No avoiding it. You just die eventually, which i've seen a few people question what the point was. Theres your answer. But its dependant on how soon you die, how your fate is sealed, is what makes this game enjoyable.Graphics are simple, but improved before early access. It does use a console though, which says something. Options isn't high quality, but its acceptable.The game is quite impressive of making you learn from your mistakes. You get to create a character and apply him with perks and also change how the world works. The perk system is a counter-weighing system, allowing you to have positive perks, as long as you weigh it with negatives. The game itself is quite difficult at first, any encounter with a zombie can have you infected and dead, but if you really want to, you can live with the infection, it'll just be harder. Zombies themselves are quite brutal, but easy when alone. they have senses, so guns shouldn't be your first option and you should allways make sure your not being stalked. Random events occur aswell, such as burgular alarms, gunshots and helicopter flybys. Don't expect to be saved though, these just rile up the zeds.Personally I've been looking for a zombie game thats main focus was the elements of survival not the zombies themselves, and this is what the developers seemed to be achieving, however it just needs more mechanics and complications. Being in early access does mean it'll be improved and I can't wait to see the final product.8/10			",387,86,8,53,61,1,57

								This game is very deep, definately don't judge a book by its cover here, or should I say a game by its screenshots.  True the graphics are basic, but the gameplay is challenging and fun.  Its definately alot harder than it looks, the zombies are relentless and you will die very quickly your first few run throughs.  Take it slow and cautious, don't leave a safe house unless your sure you can make it to another one.  If you manage to survive more than the first few weeks, you will start to level up your character and can explore all the options for survival and crafting that the game has to discover.

								Project Zomboid... Project Zomboid.... Project Zomboid. Ooooooh Project Zomboid, how you have messed my life up completely. Me and my friend bought this game to play with one another, but to our amazing shock, we can't. I tried joining servers, tried making a server and hosting it myself on my computer so that we could just play. Why so complicate? Why so stupid? Why ruin my entire life on a game that won't let me play multiplayer with my friend? It's all I want, it's all I've ever wanted in my whole desires, just to play Project Zomboid with my friend. Hah, more like Project Failboid. I'm not happy with this and it makes me upset, my life is over.But on the other hand, this game is absolutely amazing and is super fun to play. I love how in depth it goes, ripping off sheets and having to put them on the windows so the zombies can't see you. This is so damn awesome! Thanks for the game guys. Definitely recommended. :D			",73,6,0,14,7,2,17

								Okay I have played this for 9 hours straight and haven't got bored yet. When it says ""This is how you died,"" I remember that I will actually die at some point. This game is really fun but at the same time, really challenging. My friend and I (playing on the multiplayer beta) have dealt with hordes, multiple houses caught on fire, alarms in many houses, a helicopter drawing zombies to our position, and much more. And we've barely scratched the surface. We've probably cleared out, say, maybe 2 neighborhoods of supplies, and maybe a little more. I got scratched once and ended up being unlucky enough for it to be a scratch to the head. I died of infection. This game is so fun that even cooking or reading ""Advanced Farming"" can be fun. You should get this game now.Pros:Super Fun, Yet challengingI can't even say anything else, just everything is good basically.Cons:Multiplayer doesn't have everything (yet)Some houses have furniture in... let's say... interesting places.

								Great game, with a lot of bugs which is to be expected of an early access game. HOWEVER, the multiplayer crashes and causes loss of player data causing them to restart completely. I understand early access, but dont release a feature that could wipe all progress until it's fully tested. Game dev 101.  Good game, but please PLEASE fix at least the alpha version features. This game has been in development too long to have character saves lost left and right. I've loved this game far too long, but even I'm getting close to losing hope. I wouldn't buy until the full release is out, if it ever comes. I still reccommend but don't expect to return to a character the next day.			",170,31,2,50,37,3,27

								""How will you die"" I just started playing this game. I really like this game there is so much to do and find. It is about ""YOU"". About how ""YOU"" will die in the the zombie apocalyps. About how ""YOU"" will sruvive. When you start the game it will be hard and you will die. Even if you have played for a long time and/or you are good a games you will die. Thats the point of the game, but dont give up. Keep trying. You will get bored but you will come right back to the game. In a couple mins.  When i play this game i like to think of walking dead. (I'm not saying they ripped off of Walking Dead, but it is a zombie game) It feels like i am really in the zombie apocalyps and I like it more then Dayz.  If you want a realistic zombie game here you go! I know people say Dayz is realistc, but this game is better. You will see how this game is better then Dayz in a couple mins of playing. There is SOO MUCH MORE TO THIS! Just look at the current features.  Remember, this is early accses so that means their are some bugs and their is a lot more to come to this game.   I really like this game so far and i want you to get it to. There is a singleplayer and i think there is mp but not sure, but they are coming with some. So get this game it is a blast of fun!

								A great combination of retro graphics with modern gaming mechanics.

Not to mention the map is quite large.

								'The Promising Early Access Title from Indie Stone'I wanted to wait to be more experienced before writing this review, but couldn't at all! This game will have you jumping from the first minute you start playing, to the last, even when you half expect a Zombie to be hidden in a bathroom waiting for you to open a door, it still shocks you, with its gripping yet gory soundtrack, to the way they lunge towards you from the darkness.Once you've done some messing around with pressing buttons, you will find crafting and cooking very easy to work out too, with a little help from the wikia on what food items go into what food recipes, you're away, making yourself Grilled Cheese Sarnies, Soup and Coffee.My first major mistake, and the first way this game managed to fulfil its promise in killing me, was letting me find a pistol and some ammo early on. Feeling powerful, I fired off some shots at oncoming Zeds, before I knew it I was out of ammo, with a Horde chasing me down, unable to get away, I slowly got eaten, limb to limb. After a few deaths and happy mistakes, you realise your own play-style and quickly develop dynamic ways to stay alive.This game is still in Beta, but its showing great promise, and from the moment you start to play, you won't be able to put it down and stop.With Indie Stone working on a stable multiplayer for this game, and currently in the progress of changing to a better engine and more features and skills to rank. I'm looking forward to the future of this game.			",79,6,2,22,22,1,27

								Project zomboid is a awesome zombie survival game. The game is very realistic as are the zombies. While I think this is a awesome game, it might not be your cup of tea. This game IS NOT ABOUT KILLING ZOMBIES. A lot of people might make that mistake. This game is about survival. Hoarding a lot of food and water, securing a safe house and trying to dodge the zombie hoards. You don't just charge into a group of 10 zombies bat swinging. That's how you get killed. The devs highly recommend trying out the demo first, which is a good idea as the game can be buggy and it has not been optimized very much as of yet.			",103,32,1,20,32,0,21

								An absolutely thrilling experience that compines the tedious work of basic survival with the intensity of flesh-eating zombies.  The soundtrack adds an eerie atmosphere to the game; the graphics, although not considered good looking, they have come to grow on me.  The style of the graphics really fits the tone of the game.  This game truly and honestly allows the player to experience zombie surival at it's best and most realistic.  The game is also being updated it seems somewhat frequently, making the game significantly better with each update.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys zombie survival games at all.

								This game is the only true zombie survival simulator. Sure, It doesn't have realistic graphics or first person mode like DayZ but this game is friggin HARD. You can go out, get yourself a shotgun and try to take down a hoard but more and more will be attracted to the sounds of your shots so you'd better have enough shells to take down every zombie in the sound radius. You'll need food and water, while you can get plenty of food your perishables will spoil and there's only so much ramen and jerky in the world. You'll need to keep moving into more and more dangerous areas. Water will be cut off so you'd better have a good stockpile of it before it runs out.I could really go on, Barricading your house, finding new food sources, finally saving enough bullets to take out a hoard and get though the cities but all I REALLY need to say is this. If you think you're a badass that will survive the zombie apocolypse think again. This game will show you no matter how badass you are, you're nobody special. It only takes one mistake on your part and you're zombie food. So yes, Buy this game. Hell, Buy 8 copies of it. This game is amazing.			",257,33,11,26,28,1,22

								A solid title that stays true to the survival genre, and stands out in a sea of overdone zombie games.Pros+ Highly interactive world, with lots of choices and a lot of freedom (e.g. you can fish, cook, farm, craft, build a safehouse, drink bleach and die, etc.)+ Good number of realistic and detailed survival mechanics+ Lots of items, with many uses (e.g. you can form a rope by stringing clothes together to descend from higher ground safely, or rip said clothes to create makeshift bandages)+ Unique traits system (balance good and bad traits when building characters)+ Very large maps with a variety of locations (e.g. neighbourhoods, town squares, beaches, forests)+ Includes a very flexible sandbox mode that allows players to customise the world, the zombies, and player settings (you can even go against running zombies for the whole 28 Days Later experience)+ Ability to speed up time up to 3x, reduces wait time for time-consuming tasks+ Supports both online (up to 64 players) and local (split-screen, up to 4 players) multiplayer+ Zombies can jump scare you+ Has official modding tools and level editorCons- UI design is not very user-friendly and intuitive, may take some time to get used to- Controls are not very intuitive, and gamepad does not play well with some UI elements- Lack of map system to see where you're going, with many long roads that lead nowhere - you may sometimes go for long walks and never come back (although vehicles are planned for future releases)- Currently, lacks a storyline or at least objectives to work towards (purely sandbox as of now), so like most survival games (The Forest, The Long Dark, DayZ, etc.) you pretty much make your own goals - may be dull for some; but from what I understand, there will be a story mode in the final versionOverallGiven that this game is still in Early Access8.5 / 10			",288,38,9,26,20,2,38

								If you are looking for a zombie survival game, I highly reccomend Project Zomboid. It is the ultimate zombie apocalypse simulator. Not only is there the typical hunger and thirst in it, it also has heat exhaustion, sleep deprivation, Illness, and even fear and boredom! The only downside is that it is in alpha stage, so there are a few bugs. However I have not encountered one because the developers have dedicated alot of time to fixing them. I highly recomend this to people who love zombie survival games.			",75,7,1,14,8,0,10

								Despite a few bugs (as is expected from early release) I can see great care, and great quality being put into this game. Definitely pick it up now if you'd like a great, and unique zombie experience. There will be bugs, but investing will allow you to see the process of this games development. There's lots to do, lots to interact, and a level of realism that can't be found in other zombie games. I would actually more call this a zombie simulator, and for once survival is actually pretty tough. I got thirsty in game, and it took a long time to find fresh water, there was points where I got swarmed by zombies and had to run. You are not invincible in this game, it is the Dark Souls of the zombie subgenre. RECOMMEND FOR SURE.			",428,88,10,57,27,3,42

However, teaming up with a bunch of dudes and go killing another group who just survived a zombie attack is just pure evil in pixels.The lights, sounds and invironment sets a good apocolypse world10/10 would drink bleech so one wont die from thirst.

								Project Zomboid, even at it's current stage of development, is probably THE best zombie suvival game out. No question.Other games like DayZ and The Dead Linger don't even come close. (Even though they're also really early in development). Even with Project Zomboid's recent updates that add multiplayer, it's impossible for it to turn into the deathmatch with zombies as a back drop like DayZ. The zombies are actually a huge threat in Project Zomboid, which is really the best thing about it. You fear them, because one bite, even one little scratch will eventually kill you. A horde that happens to pass through could chase you out of the safehouse you worked for many real-life hours to fortify and stock full of gear and supples. The survival elements are really deep, despite not being anywear near finsihed, and the problems it does have I won't nit pick about because of that reason. Of course there are some problems. Nothing major, and I'm pretty sure they'll add it in due time but hygenie should be an element in the game, and it should effect happiness/saddness. And you should be able to watch TV or play games for entertainment (as long as the power is on, and use batteries for portable games). The only real issues I have with the game is the overall graphics, and the fact they took out NPCs that were in ealier versions of the game, I know they're going to come back but it really made me sad that they did that. The blood splatters look great, but that's wear my praise for the graphics end. I don't like how the game looks, they're should be something there that gives the game a darker tone, because the spirtes and graphics look a bit cartoonish in my opinion. I think some special effects should be added to make the game look more pretty, like fog/fancy lighting/etc. That doesn't make me love the game any less, but it would increase the immersion to me.

								The ultimate (and in my opinion) definitive zombie/survival game.  Trapping, fishing, building, cooking (IF you have the supplies and prerequisite skills), fighting, surviving and ultimately dying, and that’s just what is in the game at the moment. Sandbox mode allows customisation of your grave, sorry I mean playing field, for even more options. If you are still on the fence try out the demo first. All in all it is one hell of a game.

								I must say, this game sure has it's charms. Let me tell you of my most recent experience in Muldraugh. I Started the game and set out for a place to call home. Ran until I came to the commercial district of town, and took up residence in a small apartment building. Managed to loot several stores nearby and got a decent amount of food and tools. Food kept and water was abundant, until the power failed across the city. I eventually set out to find a hammer to fortify the doors below the apartment I was in and a generator to power the facilities inside the building itself. In the process I found more food and even a shotgun, with a stockpile of shells. Thinking I could take on the world, I disposed of 3 zombies around the apartment building. Big Mistake. The entire building was surrounded within minutes and I had no safe way to get out. I decided to jump out one of the windows in my apartment room after the horde busted down my door. Sadly I ended up with a fracture and moved at a snail's pace. As the horde surrounded me I began taking large quantites of zombies out with the help of my fully loaded shotgun, but I eventually ran out of steam, shells, and time. I was eaten alive and pretty ticked off at the fact that I lost all that progress, but man it was a good run indeed.I highly recommend this game, It's got that indie feel to it, but fleshes it out to the point where it becomes a very interesting and time consuming game!

								Great game, still early days but id expect the end result to be brilliant. If you like zombie survival games but with a different perspective to your usual first person hack n slash then this is probably the game for you; just because its made by a small indie developement company it doesnt mean that it lacks the perks of a blockbuster great, from character customisation to feeding and arming your lone survivor this game has everything you could need to make your last days on earth worth every penny. (On a side note the game does of course have some bugs none of which i have personally experienced as of yet however this is of course to be expected of a game in developement. None the less purchasing this game will greater increase the feedback to devs who can iron out the creases of this title and improve upon its previous patches)			",106,11,1,13,10,0,31

I love the actual survival features in this game! Having to manage your inventory cna get pretty difficult if you tend to keep things that 'may be useful' as I do. To think that killing more than two zombies and even one can pose a big threat is pretty great. And then to think that there are harder zombies.. Ugh, makes me cringe at the thought of sprinting hulking zombies. I would highly recommend this to survival and zombie fans alike.			",72,13,0,9,26,0,30

								Phenomenal game.  Still in early Beta, but they are working on the bugs and fixing them fast.  I have been playing a few days, made several bug reports, and they have fixed every bug so far.The idea behind the game is a zombie survival game, but it doesnt stop there.  They have multiple game modes functioning already (survival / sandbox / last stand), they have plans for more as they work out bugs and improve content.  Eventually to include multiplayer / co-op, which is a huge plus for me.Actual gameplay is great, theres cooking, crafting, killing.  You can really build your character as you play through the game, via skill points, which are earned from experience from doing one of the aformentioned tasks.Anything you can imagine in the zombie / horror genre is either in the game, or being implemented in the game.Highly highly recommend to anyone.

								Obviously, this is a work in progress, and as recommended, and try the demo out before you buy.Once you get the hang of it, you are in for a great game. One of the best non-PVP zombie survival games I have played. You'll feel tension as you explore places, you'll laugh at yourself when you do something dumb (like walk casually into a hotel room and don't check the bathroom for zombies, yep, my bad), it really is a lot of fun.

								Project Zomboid... Project Zomboid.... Project Zomboid. Ooooooh Project Zomboid, how you have messed my life up completely. Me and my friend bought this game to play with one another, but to our amazing shock, we can't. I tried joining servers, tried making a server and hosting it myself on my computer so that we could just play. Why so complicate? Why so stupid? Why ruin my entire life on a game that won't let me play multiplayer with my friend? It's all I want, it's all I've ever wanted in my whole desires, just to play Project Zomboid with my friend. Hah, more like Project Failboid. I'm not happy with this and it makes me upset, my life is over.But on the other hand, this game is absolutely amazing and is super fun to play. I love how in depth it goes, ripping off sheets and having to put them on the windows so the zombies can't see you. This is so damn awesome! Thanks for the game guys. Definitely recommended. :D			",73,6,0,14,7,2,17

So much you can do in this game! you can farm, build your own house, build a house on a house on top of that house so now you can say house-ception, kill zombies, kill more zombies cuz you just used your gun and now the entire horde just came out of no where, drink bleach (10/10 drink bleach again), use a spoon to kill zombie (so you can pretend that your killing Liam from 1D), drink from toilets, close the curtains so that the zombies don't see you masturbating to bring your happiness up.

								This is how it would be if the zombie apocalypse happened. No one is immune you can't just run into a horde and shotgun your way around, you become infected from scratchs/bites. Gotta keep warm depending on the time of year. Craft rain barrels to get water after the towns water gets cut off (presumably by the military). Random gun shots/jets and helicopters fly over attracting zombies, forcing a mass zombie migration halfway across the map. Loot, craft, build, move. Rinse and repeat just don't get scratched bitten or catch the flu. Great game. Graphics are a little iffy but I play for the realistic gameplay.			",17,0,0,1,3,0,1

If you can survive long enough, maybe you will be able to fortify a home, start a farm, or even meet a few friends to co-hibitate with-  careful though, some of the survivors have short tempers or get extremely paranoid and, well... there's really only one outcome for lack of trust in a Zombie Apocalypse.Hey, we all die someday!

								I have to say, this game is so realistic, unforgiving, brutal and overwhelming, that I have found my self spending hours into this game and it is not even away from Early Access...There are bugs here and there, but thats usualy players fault(trying to vault into a wall and getting stuck is your fault) which I've learned to avoid(after I made a battalion of survivors die under my watch).Gameplay is very good, crafting, hunger, emotions, the ever inreaseing zombie danger all add up to making the player more freaked out then the charater(like that friend of mine and his character who've lived more then I totaly played).Zombie are well defined, the Sandbox mode even gives you choice to make your own enviroment, from making zombie die from a spoon attack, make them slower then a snail, to making them run faster then super man and hit just as hard, making even garbage a precious loot to having grenades in night stands.They tend to move(group up) into hordes, and if you played State of Decay (another excellet zombie game) you will know that unless you remove those hordes they'll just keep pileing up, doing that is risky on it's own level.Graphics are 2D (might be a troll but I've heard forum guys say its going 3D) but still well done, the movement and player actions are fluid, adjusting to every little thing you've cought up, from being light weight, to minor injury, and heavy load combines with massive blood loss(This happen, and you might as well start a new character)The building/crafting/fortifying is also and decently made feature, from water collecting barrels, to good 'ol wood walls and nails and hammer barricading. The immagination is your limit(and well, resources D: and zombies around them)For the future updates of NPCs and more spicy stuff I believe this indie game will have its spot in the light as an brilliantly made survival(Everyone dies eventualy survival) game that will make a mark, just for the developers to finish and polish is so well we're gonna need welder helms to look at it :DOverall 79/100Update #1 : Still after many weeks playing this, game is so compeling and addictive, feeling the pain and anger after having your little mate die to some random cough you picked up while looking for some more bacon bits and some tuna cans.Don't be fooled by only 7 hours of playtime showed, I have over 400 and going on and on while offline, I might even eventualy break the game when it hits v1.0, and I will be happy to try and do so like a bear inside a bee hive while all the bees are out playing dodgeball :)Update #2 They have added multiplayer... My first reaction ""GRIM YOU'RE HERE I CAN SEE YOU! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" (Grim was my teammate).Currently buggy as hell, but at least has a PvP toggle so removes some banditing around, but is starting to get abused, overall its on a good road and I'll be waiting for more!

								I have not put in a lot of time into this game, I will be honest.  But I have played it.  And I have died.  Many times.  More than I think I can reliably count.  And yet I come back and live a little longer eeach time.This is an early access game, no mistake.  But it is still worth it.  These guys have already made a good game - the mechanisms are there.  The game is there.  Does it bug a little?  Sure.  Could it be prettier?  Yeah, definitely.  But these guys took a Dwarf Fortresss approach before they went to Steam; they wanted a SOLID, GOOD game, not a pretty, so-so game.  Already I'd say it's worth the money, and theese are still working on it.  It'll only get better.Would buy again.			",155,52,0,60,61,1,36

								You're not likely to ever find another zombie game, or straight up survival game, with as much freedom as Project Zomboid. Build a base in any building you find in the map, or build your own from scratch. Forrage, fish, and hunt to avoid the hoards, or risk runs into the city to nab your suppiles there. Use the extensive crafting menus to create all kinds of walls, weapons, and survival supplies, or stick with whatever you pick up.What I love about PZ, is that everything you do has weight. With only saving every time you sleep, close the game, or die, you have to be very careful and really weight out the pros and cons of everything you do. There are no second chances here, one bite and you're dead. Maybe not right away, but give it time.Even though this game is still being updated and filled in, it feels so complete right now, that I can not stress enough that it is worth your money even if you are only slightly interested.

								I start my day like any other as I wake up and look through my bedroom window. Apparently the zombie apocalypse has happened.. The first thing to do on my agenda is scrounge my house for supplies and weapons, sadly the world seems to have a cruel sense of humor, as the only weapon at my disposal is a butter knife. However that and my meager supply of food will have to do. I step out into the dead and lonely world only to find... It's not as lonely as I expected it to be. Only when the ""company"" is a horde of zombies around every street corner begging for ""just a bite"" of my flesh I would much rather it to be a lonely world. I was forced to come to the quick realization that walking out the front door was nothing short of ringing a dinner bell and not my most thought out plan, and a butter knife not the most relyable weapon as my life quickly came to an end the very day I started it. This is pretty much how easily day 1 can come and end in project zomboid, all depending on where you spawn, the zombies in the area, and how sadistic the game wants to be with what spawns in your starting house, along with your own skills of course. This only compounds to the fact the game begins turning off resources such as water and electricity. Also did you establish a well fortified base in a lowly zombie populated area? That's great, except for the fact I think I hear a helicopter flying over said base and now there seems to be an army of the dead shambling your way, I hope there's a backup plan in mind. Zomboid is easily one of the more sadistic games out there right now and funnily enough that is it's greatest appeal.			",33,13,0,13,12,0,5

								Despite a few bugs (as is expected from early release) I can see great care, and great quality being put into this game. Definitely pick it up now if you'd like a great, and unique zombie experience. There will be bugs, but investing will allow you to see the process of this games development. There's lots to do, lots to interact, and a level of realism that can't be found in other zombie games. I would actually more call this a zombie simulator, and for once survival is actually pretty tough. I got thirsty in game, and it took a long time to find fresh water, there was points where I got swarmed by zombies and had to run. You are not invincible in this game, it is the Dark Souls of the zombie subgenre. RECOMMEND FOR SURE.			",428,88,10,57,27,3,42

								I remember when I first found Project Zomboid. The systems were basic, I was playing the demo of just trying to keep Kate(was it?) alive when the neighbor came in and killed her and possibly you too. The game was one of the most fun things I had ever played. Now that it's at Build 30 and there's even more coming, such as vehicles and actually functional NPCs, the developers haven't failed to impress. An intermediate medical system, amazing fortbuilding and survivability half-simulation, half-survival game. Now even winter comes and the world deteriorates, as do the zombies. This is a game that promises that you WILL die. That's inevitable. It's all about delaying the inevitable. Right now, multiplayer is shaky and laggy, but given that it's been 3 years in waiting, the multiplayer is beautiful and it will be given the works very soon. All in all, I give it a 10/10. One of the best games that I've played. It has good replay value and plenty of entirely player-determined goals to go for. Did I mention the farming?			",98,16,1,25,23,0,33

								Drink Bleach to solve your problems, and although multiplayer has a few issues with being ""Sick"" and all that, with the non-existant sleeping, it is still relative fun to play together and survive, making houses that can barely stand on there own at level 1 Carpentry :^), it's a really good gamee to immerse yourself, running around trying not to get killed by like almost anything:- Zombies- Infection- Broken Glass- Fire- More Fire- Being ""Cold""- The Weather- PVP- Jumping out of a 2 story building- Eating dead ratsThe list goes on.Still, it's a really good game and I thoroughly enjoy the experience. Whilst still being in early access, I have alot of trust in this game to do well in the future.			",100,28,0,21,12,0,8

								I bought Project Zomboid three days ago, so far I've played 30 hours. If that doesn't speak volumes about it I don't know what does.Good points:• Very active and constistant developers (and friendly).• Lots of updates and planned updates/additions to gameplay.• Cheap... I feel guilty for buying it on sale, believe me.• HUGE map, I don't care if it's not randomly generated, it takes a while to memorize due to the sheer scale.• So many items, more to be implemented.• Interesting building, moodles, skills, crafting and actions.• Fairly difficult until you become more knowledgable, even so it can rip you a new one sometimes. Difficulty will even be ramped up for long surviving characters so a huge bonus for those of us who enjoy getting their arses handed to them.• Multiplayer, cry in a corner with friends!• NPCs to be added, this should really change up each playthrough.• The music.... holy god damn the music. I adore it.Bad points:• Too addictive.In short, try the demo, fall in love and throw your love and money at the developers.P.S. Put a propane tank in an oven, turn it on and enjoy the mayhem. You're welcome.			",112,20,3,21,21,1,20

								Been gaming for over 30 years, and this is THE Zombie game I've been waiting for! Don't be fooled by the faux-3D isometric graphics, this game has a ton of depth. Yes, it's ""another"" Zombie game, but there's a difference, this one is good.Perma-death, sandbox, crafting, survival - it has it all. It's not even finished yet, but I've still put in more hours, and have had more fun with this game than any I can recall.Do yourself a favour, try the demo, or better buy the damn game!

								If you're looking for killing zombies then this game is not for youSeriously, this game put much emphasis on survival. You need to take care a lot of things, like you need to eat, drink, watch for your health and even entertained (by reading books and magazine of course, not that kind of ""entertaintment""). A lot of status could affect the character, got hit by a zombie and your character will feel pain then your hit won't be as hard as before, when you're panicked you could miss a swing or two, when you feel cold you could get sick, when you feel hot you get dehydrated easily, and many more...A lot of skills also put in consideration for your character, like how much your skill in aim will affect how good you are at shooting zombies (higher aim, higher chances for headshot), sprint skill affect how long you can run before you're tired, and others that I forgot. Besides fighting skill, there are also cooking, farming, and crafting, all of them are self explanatory. To level up your skills, you just need to do a certain action that related to the skill(s) you want to raise, like if you want to raise your blunt weapon skill, just keep using that rolling pin. Unfortunately, for sneaking, It's quite hard to do unless you have light feet trait. Since there's no crouch or stealth button, the only way to level up sneaking is walk past behind a zombie hoping you didn't attract him.Besides skill, there are also character traits. And I must say not a lot of other zombie survival game paid enough attention on this. The charm of the game is this, and also what make this game interesting. The character creation is quite simple and not so detailer, but the character trait is not. You need to choose both bad traits and good traits, since bad traits adding points to spend on good traits, so there will be no character with only good traits. Also, the traits are balanced, want more good traits? Good luck, you also need more bad traits. Some bad/good traits will eliminate other bad/good traits, like it's not logic if you have both strength and feeble traits.At first, there were tutorial in game, but they took them out because they want to polish the game features first. The tutorial is iirc connected to the story with the guy on the cover, and also good for beginners. But, before the NPC is featured in the game, tutorial is not there and you need to hang on with hints or wiki or guide provided by other player. But don't worry, for basic survival, like scavenging, first aid, and the other, it's quite easy to do. If you can use your logic or experienced with fallout 1 or 2 (maybe 3), you won't get trouble. The problem comes with crafting and farming, since there's no tutorial in-game, you need to lookup guide and/or tutorial online. Zombies are threat, I repeat, zombies are treat. A couple of zombies won't give you much trouble, but a herd of zombies will. Also, they are quite persistent in following you. Just make sure you lock the door and window when you go to sleep. As for human enemy, since there's no NPC yet and I haven't tried pub, so I can't say much. tl;dr A great zombie survival simulator, the downside is there's no in-game tutorial and NPC yet, but the multiplayer and single player are good, I recommend you try the demo first			",136,33,1,31,20,0,9

								Project Zomboid is actually the only game I would call a Zombie Survival Simulator as of today. A Challenging Basis to it even adds how realistic the game truely is.  Games like Dead Island are interesting but I would probably not call them survival simualators. Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil (even though im a big Resident Evil fan) & The Walking Dead Game are all amazing gameplay, love the storylines, amazing graphics & even the Characters are loveable but they all don't really get the survival simulation that we are all looking for. I personaly think that DayZ is interesting but it's too much of a death match shooter, lacking ambitious crafting and sheltering. Although it came pretty close.  Beware the game can be stressful and challenging as I would hope a survival game would be. Its almost like playing a twisted version of the Sims.			",35,7,1,6,2,0,1

								Finally a Zombie survival game that does it right. Where the game stands now I can recommend that you will have alot of fun and with the latest update it just got more intense.Top down 16 bit graphics brings me back to SNES days but so much more devoloped than the games I played when I was young. with all the skill sets it can be a little overwhelming at first but it's really simple to learn, and I have to say the learning curve is a bit realistic when it comes to gameplay. Like common sense does play a role when cooking in the game. I love the fact that you have to eat and drink but are not forced to by losing your health overtime, and it doesnt feel like im doing that 20 times a day to stay full, Great game would have payed full price for it. Hope to see some great future updates.			",55,5,0,4,3,0,1

								A very fun zombie sandbox survival game that pits you agianst hords of zombies while you try to survive for as long as possible. There is no hope. There is no cure. This is how you die. It reintroduces ideas of zombie games such as farming and healing your own wounds, but it brings to the table new ones such as if you get bit, to prevent from getting infected you can cut off the limb thats bitten before the infection takes you over. They are also working on npc survivors that you can befriend and use to help defend your base. By the way you can build your own base. That's right, but good luck finding the fire axe to chop down trees to get wood, the nails, and a hammer to put it all together. Yes there are some glitchs, but compared to what they were years ago when I first started playing it, they went a long way from where they started. They are also planning to add muiltiplayer so when that comes out, that's when the game will get really good. Some gamers might not like it because they're times where its enraging to find an area without zombies to make a safe spot, but if you start playing enough, you'll come to understand that where ever you start, thats what you are going to get, unless you kill most of the zombies in an area you want to make your base. They orginally had a story mode where you took care of your injured wife, but it isn't in there anymore and it's what the title screen is based off of. Lastly the one thing I learned from this game is that GUNS ARE A BAD IDEA, not only are they loud, this was proven on mythbusters, but the time it takes to aim, shoot and reload, is enough time for them to over run you and kill you. So yeah, to the people who think the shotgun or the chainsaw is the best weapon againse a zombie you are dead wrong... Well... undead wrong I should say...			",211,26,5,14,21,0,15

								Project Zomboid, Zombie RPG:Project Zomboid is a very realistic Post-Apocalyptic Game that will immerse you in every new play through, with different experiences that will get you to make difficult decisions that will change how your character lives his life in a ever changing zombie apocalyptic world. You as the player take control over everything that happens, whether its that you choose to risk staying the night in a zombified house or take sleeping pills that change your characters sleeping patterns.Project Zomboid is currently still in development, which is truly amazing, because the game right now conveys a extremely playable version even if it’s only in Beta. The game is being worked on and further development updates are being released to give the players more content to play around with. Updates are very consistent and nearly always add more content to the game (unless it’s a bug fix update which are also frequent).If you’re the type of person that enjoys a completely realistic and immersive, zombie apocalyptic experience, where every character has a different to story to tell, with every play through. Then Project Zomboid is for YOU. ",127,10,0,10,9,1,4

								83 hrs on record and i'm still steaming through this game. It does take alot of time to get used to!!! do not give up on it in the first 3 days that you buy it. watch videos, look at the wiki (some but not too much because there isn't much about it there), play multiplayer and find a good server. they are still making updates to this game even though it's some what slow, it is still a plus to see progress. I advise you to buy this game if you are looking for a challenge and can handle 10 hrs of work going down the drain if you are careless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Most of my reviews start a lot like this... HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥! (last time im doing that) This game is so freaking amazing! So much you can do in this game! you can farm, build your own house, build a house on a house on top of that house so now you can say house-ception, kill zombies, kill more zombies cuz you just used your gun and now the entire horde just came out of no where, drink bleach (10/10 drink bleach again), use a spoon to kill zombie (so you can pretend that your killing Liam from 1D), drink from toilets, close the curtains so that the zombies don't see you masturbating to bring your happiness up. And soo much more!!!			",133,12,4,7,9,1,5

								This is how it would be if the zombie apocalypse happened. No one is immune you can't just run into a horde and shotgun your way around, you become infected from scratchs/bites. Gotta keep warm depending on the time of year. Craft rain barrels to get water after the towns water gets cut off (presumably by the military). Random gun shots/jets and helicopters fly over attracting zombies, forcing a mass zombie migration halfway across the map. Loot, craft, build, move. Rinse and repeat just don't get scratched bitten or catch the flu. Great game. Graphics are a little iffy but I play for the realistic gameplay.			",17,0,0,1,3,0,1

								Project Zomboid... Project Zomboid.... Project Zomboid. Ooooooh Project Zomboid, how you have messed my life up completely. Me and my friend bought this game to play with one another, but to our amazing shock, we can't. I tried joining servers, tried making a server and hosting it myself on my computer so that we could just play. Why so complicate? Why so stupid? Why ruin my entire life on a game that won't let me play multiplayer with my friend? It's all I want, it's all I've ever wanted in my whole desires, just to play Project Zomboid with my friend. Hah, more like Project Failboid. I'm not happy with this and it makes me upset, my life is over.But on the other hand, this game is absolutely amazing and is super fun to play. I love how in depth it goes, ripping off sheets and having to put them on the windows so the zombies can't see you. This is so damn awesome! Thanks for the game guys. Definitely recommended. :D			",73,6,0,14,7,2,17

								I bought this game on sale expecting very little, but looking for the zombie game that really feels like an apocalypse - not a shooting gallery. Surely, I love playing a round of L4D or KF now and then but in truth they are only satisfying for their shooter components, settings, and funny physics. Project Zomboid is nothing like that. The first time I fired the game up it told me, ""This is the story of how you died."" Of course that got the philosopher in me interested. After all, don't you ""die"" in every video game, but usually with little consequence? Well, that first game, I lasted a mere minutes (4 hours of game time). From that moment, I realized that there was a lot more to this game than I was expecting, and a lot more than some of the other early access zombie games offer. Are there still bugs? Yes. Is everything in the game that should be? No.But what the game does to its player transcends what most games do. It makes you really care about how you live and die in the zombie apocalypse. And for that, and because it is (in my experience) without any game breaking bugs, this game deserves a 10/10. Someone should have made something like it 10 years ago. I would still be playing it.

								Very fun game indeed, even in its early stages.I could see myself playing many hours of this game.To be honest i really havnt found anything wrong, or that i dislike about it.A very well done top down zombie survival game.So many things, even very tiny aspects of the game, are done to profection.The game includes a feature that can be epic/annoying - the sounds of gunshots are added and can be heard ( no one is doing this, its just a random event)Zombies follow the sound of the shots moving them from place to place.One day i was working on my farm. there were many gunshots in my area..I knew what i had to do... I grabbed every piece of wependry i had and went outsideI could see the horde in the distance. I had to defend my base.It waves of undead seemed endlessAfter i ran out of ammo, broke every baseball bat, pan, hammer, and axe i had i ran back inside my houseand nailed every door shut..I knew it was the end... I walked inside my bedroom, opened the the storage box, and grabbed bleach and sleeping pillsI took them both and went to sleep in a chair.11/10Would play again ",91,3,1,12,7,1,2

								Already a fantastic game, and still getting better.Fun in singleplayer, the recent addition of multiplayer has really placed this high on my games to play.For anyone who enjoyed Don't Starve and/or wanted a multiplayer option in Don't Starve, you should really try this game.The art style is nice, the sounds are effective, and the music is immersive and really sets the tone for the game.  The gameplay is solid and the controls are actually quite simple.I like that it's not a jump-scare game.  It's not a nightmare-inducing horror game, just set in a horror setting.  The zombies are well made and work logically: You can take a few on, but a whole hoard is a serious problem.  Has the makings and elements of replayability, and multiplayer really ups that a long way.  Losing isn't the end, either, as you can make a new character in the same world, so you can ""reclaim"" your base.Modding is also a key point to the game design, which increases the scope and versatility of the game a lot, allowing people to play the way they want to.

								I can't believe this game is early access! Def worth getting if you want a game where you can do damn near anything. If this game gets any better, I may never play another zombie survival game again.It takes a little getting use to with the controls at first, and setting up a server seems like a small pain (my friend did ours), but once you get it, you have a ton of control over your server and it's free to keep it going on both private and public ends!

								I love this game. So far, I have not been able to survive more than a couple of days, but every game I last longer than the ones before. It does have some noticable bugs - once, I had to leave a house because the game didn't register that there was an open door and kept accessing the fridge behind it, leaving me open to zombies at any time, and neither ovens nor microwaves are currently functioning on my laptop, but these aren't big issues. The game is in development, and promises to be even more exciting. It's worth trying the demo, at least.			",32,15,0,10,6,0,4

								This game has been in development for a while now, I remember hearing about it at least 2 years ago, at its made progress since then. The development has been quite slow for this game, I will give them that they had faced numerous events that caused this that other companies normally don't, but it would be nice if there were more features in this game and less glitches. That being said, it has a great idea that it is centralized around. Surviving zombies is the least of your troubles when you are starving, cold, dying of thirst, and panicing all at the same time. The struggle for survival goes much deeper than the zombies and once the town's water supply is cut off and food starts to dwindle, things get exciting. This is what the game has going for it. I would give it a 7/10.			",55,10,1,10,8,0,13

								I have been following this game since i first ever heard of it on Moddb.com. I then bought it after following it for a year and had since had it on Desaura with a early Alpha release. So all in all I have been following this game for two years and can deep down tell you it is totally worth getting!. In this game you can make friends/foes, do what you want, collect water and food before it runs out. Electricity and water will one day turn off so you will be left in the dark to fend for yourself. Look on Moddb.com to find out more about this very amazing indie game so get it now whiles it is still so affordable!!!!			",159,25,0,17,32,0,45

								A game with great potential. For people that enjoy survival-sandboxes that require skill. This game will easily give you a few days of fun if you decide to ""skill it out"" and keep yourself from looking up guides or walkthroughs.Just remember when purchasing this game (at this point) that it's still in alpha-stages. There are some gimicky mechanics and visuals. But for the most part it's playable as a sandbox game. If you're deciding not to buy the game I strongly suggest keeping an eye out for this title in the near future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The way you need to juggle your needs (Food, Water, Sleep, etc.) while also dealing with the hordes of zombies outside your house who would love nothing more then to eat you is fun, yet provides a challenge.

								This is how it would be if the zombie apocalypse happened. No one is immune you can't just run into a horde and shotgun your way around, you become infected from scratchs/bites. Gotta keep warm depending on the time of year. Craft rain barrels to get water after the towns water gets cut off (presumably by the military). Random gun shots/jets and helicopters fly over attracting zombies, forcing a mass zombie migration halfway across the map. Loot, craft, build, move. Rinse and repeat just don't get scratched bitten or catch the flu. Great game. Graphics are a little iffy but I play for the realistic gameplay.			",17,0,0,1,3,0,1

								This is one of the best zombie survival games I have ever played. For the most part it's fairly slow paced and strategic but when you get into the main areas with buttloads of zombies, you better hope that you can fight.			",96,19,7,7,23,1,12

								I have been following this game since i first ever heard of it on Moddb.com. I then bought it after following it for a year and had since had it on Desaura with a early Alpha release. So all in all I have been following this game for two years and can deep down tell you it is totally worth getting!. In this game you can make friends/foes, do what you want, collect water and food before it runs out. Electricity and water will one day turn off so you will be left in the dark to fend for yourself. Look on Moddb.com to find out more about this very amazing indie game so get it now whiles it is still so affordable!!!!			",159,25,0,17,32,0,45

								Project Zomboid Is a Helicopter view zombie survival where you have to run around gathering supplies Almost every item has its use. Zombies actually are smart in this game they can see you, smell you, and hear you, there are many Dire situation you could get into while looting stuff for example I could break into a house and the alarm might go off alerting every zombie in the area and directing them to the location.You actually have to be smart while playing this, you have to have strategies for almost every situation for example if an alarm goes off in a house find a an escape route with the least amount of zombies. Never have I been so terrified of the AI because if you get careless well you're as good as done.Zombies actually have memories they'll remember which direction you were going and follow that direction even if you're out of their sight Zombies a force to be reckoned with.this game does have its problems but it's expected since it's in Alpha.How will you die?Rating 9.7/10			",102,7,3,9,15,0,2

								Ah Project Zomboid. Definitley my favourite game to date it just realises the scenario of a zombie apocalypse to the maximium. I just love how you can just read the zombie survival guide and use it as it's own tourtorial you don't even need to have a tourtorial for the game, it's how the player chooses to do it his charecter could be a zombie survival expert or some kid that doesn't know what the hell is going on (even though every one is 27 years old 0.0) that's the beauty of project zomboid you choose how to survive you don't need someone telling you how see if you would survive or not even in your own preffered apocalypse fast zombies slow zombies which ever you wish. I definitley recomend this game to any die hard zombie fan's that always wanted a perfect zombie game don't turn away from the graphics and let it play.And you may even wan't to relive your own apocalypse in your local area well you can do that too just download the map editor and make your own it's not that hard i promise....But This is an unfinished game so do expect some bug's and sure you cannot relive everything and thing's are missing BUT DON'T WORRY IT WILL ALL COME! :D i look forward to the day this game let's you fill up a bath with water and run over some zombies with the radio on listening to the army coming to kill everyone. If you actually read all of this i sulute you. :P			",26,1,0,6,2,0,1

								THE BEST Zombie survival game i have ever played, and i've played a few now!Graphics aren't the best in the world but it more than makes up for it in detail and game play. After approximately 2 months the water and electricity cut off, so by that time you need to have set up a base(2 storey buildings recommended), barricaded doors and windows, crafted better melee weapons, made rope ladders from bed sheets(see what i mean about detail:)  built perimeter fences and water butts. Collect anything useful, which in this game is almost everything!Plant seeds to grow crops.Become completely self sufficient......and survive.More content to be added as this game is early access. I did have some problems getting game to work (cheers bruv) and do come across the odd bug, but this game in it's current state is VERY playable. Demo available, although i've heard (not played it) it doesn't give justice to the full game. Good idea if you are worried about beta issues though. Full game only £10 well worth it in my opinion!!!!EDIT: 250hrs+ and still going strong! Extra content added about every 3 months to stable branch, but experimental branch is constantly evolving. Animal hunting to be added in the near future, fishing and trapping already added to stable branch along with awesome shopping mall map update.Best £10 i've ever spent!!!EDIT#2: 2 days short of a year since my last EDIT, this game is now so good, every time I play the game I run the risk of ♥♥♥♥ing my pants......and I'm not the only one! Infact, I have heard rumours that the dev's are considering putting a disclaimer in the store page before anyone becomes seriously injured.                                           !!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!

								If you are looking for a zombie survival game, I highly reccomend Project Zomboid. It is the ultimate zombie apocalypse simulator. Not only is there the typical hunger and thirst in it, it also has heat exhaustion, sleep deprivation, Illness, and even fear and boredom! The only downside is that it is in alpha stage, so there are a few bugs. However I have not encountered one because the developers have dedicated alot of time to fixing them. I highly recomend this to people who love zombie survival games.			",75,7,1,14,8,0,10

								An absolutely thrilling experience that compines the tedious work of basic survival with the intensity of flesh-eating zombies.  The soundtrack adds an eerie atmosphere to the game; the graphics, although not considered good looking, they have come to grow on me.  The style of the graphics really fits the tone of the game.  This game truly and honestly allows the player to experience zombie surival at it's best and most realistic.  The game is also being updated it seems somewhat frequently, making the game significantly better with each update.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys zombie survival games at all.  Even if you don't think you do, try it out with the demo; this game provides a never-before-seen experience that I have really enjoyed.  I love this game!			",169,30,1,21,16,1,24

								I only have a few hours in on this one but I can honestly say I like the direction this game is going.  At this time I haven't played on a server, and I also haven't done much crafting in the game, so I may add more to this review after I experience both those thing.  Overall if you like survival and you like zombies you should give this one a shot.  Also I think it would be easier on older systems as the graphics are fairly simple and pixel and it's an isometric view, kinda reminds of super nintendoish graphics or early PC.

And then comes project zomboid and shows me once again how wrong i was. Yeha sometimes u get the feeling there is something missing in these games. But hell this game is still so damn fine. You just play, die and every time u learn something new and u want to die again.First character died cause i jumped out of the window on the second floor, missclick. In some games, i wont mention now, u just get angry or sad with that and close the game. but with this game u cant really get angry.

								A challenging survivor game with a lot of content. Similiar to many other survivor games, it doesn´t offer any larger endgame scenario, but the distance of you ""winning"" the game is very long and there are lots of events between the two points of hopeless survival and eventually becoming fully self-contained and separated from the zombie apocalypse (kind of winning the game).The game master ai makes sure the zombie hordes evetually find you though.When you start playing, at least for me, the mechanic was a bit tricky to learn and the learning curve hits you in your face. But when you get over that it gets much better and soon as you learn to survive a bit longer, you start to care for your character, even though they don't really have a personality (at least yet)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Defintiely a Thumbs Up for this game. Been playing it for days now and can't get enough of it....Starting off with nothing, looking for food, water, shelter while trying to stay alive among the Zombies. Once a home is established, one has to look for things such as axes, farming seeds, nails, medical supplies, saws, hammers etc. in order to start your own farm, fortify your home base or build rain collecting barrels for when water and electricity is shut off and food you could previously find in homes has already gone bad over time. The different game modes let you choose how you wish to play, in sandbox mode for instance zombies can be customized amongst other things such as loot and weather. Also, having skills that gain exp as you play, adds further awesomeness to the game.One thing that the game still needs, to really stand out, are NPCs though, but I've been told that they're on their way, amongst other planed features.In a nutshell, I'm quite happy that I found this game and I'm looking forward to the upcoming new features.

								Project Zomboid, Zombie RPG:Project Zomboid is a very realistic Post-Apocalyptic Game that will immerse you in every new play through, with different experiences that will get you to make difficult decisions that will change how your character lives his life in a ever changing zombie apocalyptic world. You as the player take control over everything that happens, whether its that you choose to risk staying the night in a zombified house or take sleeping pills that change your characters sleeping patterns.Project Zomboid is currently still in development, which is truly amazing, because the game right now conveys a extremely playable version even if it’s only in Beta. The game is being worked on and further development updates are being released to give the players more content to play around with. Updates are very consistent and nearly always add more content to the game (unless it’s a bug fix update which are also frequent).If you’re the type of person that enjoys a completely realistic and immersive, zombie apocalyptic experience, where every character has a different to story to tell, with every play through. Then Project Zomboid is for YOU. ",127,10,0,10,9,1,4

								Wonderful game.It's literally how the end times would be.You need food, weapons, shelter.You get depressed, you get hungry, infected.Each character can be customized with special skills and downfalls.Lots of customizing on bases, it's fun being in a close call situation.once you die, you die!You can rank up skills the longer you stay alive.You can even craft! Water goes out, electricity goes out. You need people to watch your back.The few downfalls of the game I see are as follows.1. Hard to find servers and connect to active ones. They need to put the server list into the game system.2. Crops are almost pointless in multiplayer. Though this would be your main way of surviving, it's almost pointless. You wait for HOURS and HOURS for these crops to grow. Then you harvest ONE and then go to bed, wake up and BAM everything isr rotten. You have to water them non stop also. 3. There needs to be ways to save food for a little longer. Using salt on meat, or burying food in the ground or something.4. Needs more weapons. Guns, blades, etc.I would check this game out, it's worth every penny. But it still needs a little fine tuning. But the game is very playable.			",38,3,1,6,2,0,6

								So far, I have experienced nothing on the level with this game in terms of survival.   I hope this title continues to push the envelope in gameplay mechanics, hell, it may very well be the most fun and creative co-op experience to date.  Unique game that might slip under the radar in the mix with games based around kills, which would be a shame considering this game is HIGHLY focused around surviving, instead of mindless waves of ineffective zombies, encounters with the infected are highly dangerous. Just know, all it takes is one scratch or bite and the onset of infection could sink in leaving you with nothing but an untimely demise in your near future.Creative minds and resourcefullness can result in unforseen events, usually resulting in personal injury, property damage and even the occasional missing person.

								This is the number #1 best zombie crafting/survival game out there. I have played a great deal of survival as well as crafting games but none have givin the variety and depth of zomboid. even in its current state without its wealth of planned features you cant beat it. I highly recomend it to anyone looking for a open world zombie game full of stuff to do. such as nailing a sheet to a second story window for escape, rain barrels to collet water for when the power fails (which it will and you must plan ahead), useing a sledgehammer to connect safe houses, or just building your own. You have to eat, drink, treat wounds, fight off sickness as well as zombies, heck you can even get wet from rain and that has a chance to make you sick if you dont dry off with something.This game is as deep as they come and it will only get better with time. keep up the good work indie stone 10/10 even in its early access state.

								Update: It's worth noting that the game now has working multiplayer. You can host your own servers without even needing VPN software like Hamachi or Evolve.I first played this game in it's alpha state on Desura and it simply is THE best (zombie) survival game I have seen. Emphasis on 'survival'. You know how minecraft has a ""survival"" mode? Yeah Project Zomboid does the survival aspect the way you'd really expect it to be done.Surviving in this game is really challenging; you start in your own house and all you have are your clothes and whatever items you can find from all the drawers and the fridge. You'll have to mind the weather, make sure you have food and drink, obviously watch out not to get bitten, find medical supplies in case you get sick and so on. You'll also need to find a good shelter, be it by barricading a house you find suitable or building your own from scratch..Definetly worth the money, I cannot recommend this game enough.

I still stand by it, slow though the progress may be. They've achieved some amazing stuff, but they're doing it at a steady rate. They don't release anything without it being absolutely ready. When Zomboid finally hits 1.0, it will be in good enough shape to melt faces. Even if that's in 2020.			",2892,1095,111,320,410,37,471

								I've been a huge PZ fan since back during the old Kate and Baldspot days, so I was super excited when it came to Steam.+Huge locations, tons of looting.  Zombie killing, crafting, and survival tactics are varied, fun, and well implemented.+A lot of really creative ideas from a dev team that listens to community feedback and is constantly improving/adding.  Weekly blog also helps to keep players in the loop.+Gritty and immersive atmosphere.  Can be challenging, but still rewarding-Minor bugs (not crash inducing, but sigh inducing)-Constant updates means you will continously restart your character to enjoy new features.The only real disclaimer I would add is that it is Early Access and so there are many unfinished features.  The game is constantly changing and being updated, which means you are going to have to keep restarting your chanracter, losing your accumulated skills and your base/loot.For some easliy frustrated people, it would be better to wait until it is finished and pay a little more, but if you like zombie games and you like survival games, this one does so many things right - firmly placed at the top of my list over the slew of other similar games on the market.

								Project Zomboid is one of the best zombie survival games out there, it's hard, it's scary and it's challenging.The world is huge, and the buildings are designed with care, the three modes are basically the same, but they are all fun to play.This game is worth every penny.Something that did bug me was how the game crashes too frequent, but it's easy to fix.After all Project zomboid acomplishes what many developers seek for. And that is to create a challenging game.This is a must-have.I look forward to future updates such as multiplayer (The beta test is not working with me) and more modes, as well as the return of BaldSpot and Kate's tutorial, and god bless me if they add cars.

								So, I've never really wrote a review for any Steam game but this one has bolstered me to do so. I've bought this game before it was even on Steam, I was instantly given the Steam copy with my old account. It seems trivial but this leads into the greater scale of the developers commitment to delivering to the consumer. Each Monday they release a ""Mondoid""on their site, a news article letting us players know what they have been working on and how things are going.There have been ups and downs but this game progressively keeps getting tuned up and bit by bit, better. For an early access, every form of this game has been completely functional. The impressive amount of features they've been pumping into the game has made this ride worth it.After stroking the developers ego a little bit to much for even my own liking, I want to get into the game play. I'm sure others can describe it more eloquently than I, but it is pretty much the closest thing you will ever get to a real life zombie simulator. Fracture a leg? Tough luck, you're going to have to baby it for about a week until you might be able to run again? Hopping through a broken window? Ack! Cut your groin up on entry. There's plenty of examples to go with but the fact is, this game is unrelenting. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to get a scratch and having to wait to see if you are infected. Frustrating is generally bad but in the scheme of this game, you are trying to hang on to your survival at any means necessary. Sometimes the small achievements are good ones. Like when I was able to gather enough ammunition in an apocalyptic wasteland to fend off bandits, that resonated somewhere that I achieved something. The game punishes you, every success is awesome. Every failure, depressing. The thought that goes into this is unparalleled, with water and power turning off after a few weeks. This game is literally trying to cover every imaginable angle. I'd ramble on about every feature, but all I wanted/needed to convey was A) The Development team is solid and B) This is the best zombie survival sim I've ever played.			",64,25,0,27,7,0,15

								The ultimate (and in my opinion) definitive zombie/survival game.  Trapping, fishing, building, cooking (IF you have the supplies and prerequisite skills), fighting, surviving and ultimately dying, and that’s just what is in the game at the moment. Sandbox mode allows customisation of your grave, sorry I mean playing field, for even more options. If you are still on the fence try out the demo first. All in all it is one hell of a game.

								This game is the only true zombie survival simulator. Sure, It doesn't have realistic graphics or first person mode like DayZ but this game is friggin HARD. You can go out, get yourself a shotgun and try to take down a hoard but more and more will be attracted to the sounds of your shots so you'd better have enough shells to take down every zombie in the sound radius. You'll need food and water, while you can get plenty of food your perishables will spoil and there's only so much ramen and jerky in the world. You'll need to keep moving into more and more dangerous areas. Water will be cut off so you'd better have a good stockpile of it before it runs out.I could really go on, Barricading your house, finding new food sources, finally saving enough bullets to take out a hoard and get though the cities but all I REALLY need to say is this. If you think you're a badass that will survive the zombie apocolypse think again. This game will show you no matter how badass you are, you're nobody special. It only takes one mistake on your part and you're zombie food. So yes, Buy this game. Hell, Buy 8 copies of it. This game is amazing.			",257,33,11,26,28,1,22

This game truly and honestly allows the player to experience zombie surival at it's best and most realistic.  The game is also being updated it seems somewhat frequently, making the game significantly better with each update.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys zombie survival games at all.

The only downside is that it is in alpha stage, so there are a few bugs. However I have not encountered one because the developers have dedicated alot of time to fixing them.
