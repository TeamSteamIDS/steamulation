												Beautiful game.  Unfortunately, that's all there is.  Controls are shot and unless the company intends to patch it massively, they're going to be bad, even with a dedicated flight stick/HOTAS setup.			",55,5,0,11,1,0,2

												I feel this game has too many bad reviews, that don't do it justice. The gameplay is excellent. It's similar to freelancer, but with inertia and glide/slide mechanics. It's a joy to pilot the fighter!Sure it could be longer and have more options, ships and whatnot, but then it wouldn't have this price tag.Great dogfights, varied mission objectives. Hope they make a second one!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a big fan of space flight simulators. It doesn't matter if it's the X3 type where you control a vast trading empire as you roam the galaxy with your fleet or the the more simpler classic version where you just fly around in your ship and shoot other ships. That's why a game like SOL:Exodus managed to excited me before I even knew anything about it beyond the genre. Trouble with getting excited over a genre rather than the individual game however is that more often than not, you buy a really bad game.SOL:Exodus is a simple flight simulator. You fly around in a small fighter craft and shoot at varying forms and sizes of enemy ships, from other fighter craft to big burly bomber ships. Not much else to it, as you complete missions you get the ability to upgrade some of your ships basic systems but it never goes beyond more health or more damage. Sounds like a concept too simple to screw up, unfortunately it is not that.The flying mechanics in Exodus is down right broken. There is no perpetual motion, no strafing, no features of the kind you would expect in this kind of game. You fly in a straight line against your chosen target until you get to weapons range then you match speeds and mash the fire button until it is destroyed. Rinse. Repeat.Zero gravity flight is usually some of the most innovative and interesting gameplay you can find but in this game they somehow managed to make it dull and uninspired.The storyline of Exodus takes place in the far future, Earth's sun is set to go supernova and you are part of an expedition that's traveled to the far reaches of the galaxy to find a suitably planet for all Humans to relocate to. You start the game as you discover just such a world but before you have any time to celebrate you get attack by a bunch of religious fanatics. Going back to Earth to tell your fellow humans about this wondrous discovery of yours you find that a religious cult has taken over, one that believes dying in a supernova is a good thing. And so now you must fight these over the top bad guys in order to let humanity migrate to this new world you have found.Graphically the game falls flatly on the mediocre scale. Space is nice and black but don't get too close to anything or you might notice the game's low budget. Sound is equally unspectacular and the voice acting is just plain atrocious.SOL:Exodus is a bad game in a dying genre and it will unfortunately get a lot of sales from people like me, desperate for a new fix. If you have any sense though you will stay well clear of it.Also that one dead achievement makes my pseudo-OCD go nuts.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												It's not bad - more Starlancer than X-Wing or Freespace. But sometimes you don't want the complexity of all those systems to manage. It would be perfect if they made a Battlestar Galactica mod for it, since it's got the whole ""WW2 aircraft carriers, only in space!"" vibe.

												Very Short Campaign, Great Game play. Adds a new Unique feature to Dog fighting called Sliding. the best way to describe it would be a 360 degree turret ability with all guns and missles. It integrates almost seemlessly with the navigation controls so you are able to pilot and shoot with it. The AI Elites can be a handful without sliding so if your having trouble learn to use it. That said however the AI has a serious flaw with close proximity to solid objects, if you lure them into a dogfight at very close range to a large ship they may crash into it killing themselves. I was able to do this twice, once by accident the second time on purpose ^_^.Overall, a very thought out and well made space combat sim. The story and campaing however due to it being much to short was a dissapointment.			",108,23,1,28,9,0,15

												The biggest problem with this game is that you do basically ALWAYS the same thing.After the training, the first two missions are absolutely identical.... shoot at things while some wannabee priest screams about being god and joining the dark side because they have cookies. Good for the rist 20 minuted, the problemhere is that this continued for all of my gameplay period, so i decided to quit playing.Graphics are ok, the soundtrack is tedious and repetitive.You have only one ship which you can upgrade in term of weapon, shield and ""turbo"".Yes, everything already sawn, nothing new here.Said this, i simply cannot recommend this game			",364,124,12,77,26,2,71

												If you liked classic space sim games like X-wing, I think you'll like this.  The core flying and shooting gameplay is solid and familiar, which for some reason few games have pulled off in the last decade.  The voice acting wasn't bad either; it kept me interested in the story.  I wouldn't have minded a longer game - I finished it in 3 hours - and there's no multiplayer or other game modes, other than replaying the campaign.  The leaderboards and vanilla achievements aren't enough to make me play it again.  But if you see this at $5 or cheaper, I'd say give it a try!			",251,48,1,16,8,2,23

												This game recieved a 57 aggregate score on Metacritic; I'm assuming this reflects the initial unpatched version.

												What is SOL: Exodus?it is a rather short but cool linear space sim. You control a small fighter against alot of enemies and usually have to protect some ship with too low hp (even on easy) the game has a rather neat hacking system tho, wich makes it a bit more interesting.The campaign can be completed in 3hours on easy but will take maybe up to 10 hours on hard depending on your skill and luck as your teammates are really useless.The good:- its a space arcade sci-fi fighter sim- hacking is new and interesting- hard difficulty is hard- mission challenges makes you want to replay missions- the achievements are doable- xbox controller supportThe bad:- Too short- Repetative- Hard is too hard- no co-op or mp- your ships flight path is weird sometimes, this can be very annoyingIn short if you like arcadey space battle games this game is worth checking out on a sale, just dont expect AAA quality.despite its shortcomings I actually had alot of fun.

I do love the designWhat I'm really saying is that this is a great starting point, but Expand!!!  still needs so much more added to it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sol: Exodus is the kind of action space game that hails back to titles like Freelancer, and it is a welcome addition to Steam's game library.  If you are like me and find many of the space genre games to be overly complex and often tedious like X3 or Starpoint Gemini, than SOL:  Exodus may be the title for you.  A welcome addition here is native controller support, which adds to the arcade feel of the flying and fighting sequences.  In addition both widescreen and modern AAA graphic effects are available, although the actual ingame graphics are nothing extraordinary for the genre.  Overall, SOL:  Exodus is a solid action space fighting game that should be part of any gamers who have a fondness for accessibility and action over deep gameplay mechanics.

I think it will be ok to play. I would recommend checking it out. SP or not, it'll be something to break the monotiny of other games when the noobs are out in full force. lol  ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sol Exodus is a ""space fighter"" game that is exceedingly difficult due to enemies that move too fast / your own ship that move too slow, forcing you to rely on missiles which you only have a very limited supply. You are also often saddled with extra objectives like protecting other ships. The missiles are so slow and ponderous you wonder if you're playing a 1970's game rather than a space game. And the plot about a religious zealot organization with starships that puts the human exploration command to shame yet the exploration command was the organization tasked with finding a planet for the citizens and colonists of Earth. WHERE did these yahoos get the money? The plot made no sense, the weapons are weak and lame compared to classics like Wing Commander or Freespace, or heck, even current clones like Eterium. it's basically an indie clone with the barest of backstory. Graphics are not bad, but overall it's an also-run that were difficult to play long-term.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												*scaled rating at the end*I wanted to like this game. I really did. But it's just to plain and dumbed down. It can almost fly itself. Space combat here reminds more of Independence War. You can literally spin around 180 degrees. Kinda like doing sports car drift in space. Interestingly, it does not work with CH Products sticks but is perfect with my Logitech 3D Extreme. Acting and story telling are straight out of the Alien Breed Series. Wingmen are useless. Most of my missions were solo.The only reason for my low scores here is that I bought this and Freespace 1 & 2 at the same time. I loaded this first. But played both versions of Freespace and the modded version of Freespace before a played the fifth mission of this. When a 10 year-old game gets my time over a new game....hmmmmm. Well, I'm just saying.Thumbs up because it works and I bought on on 80% off sale.Graphics 8/10Audio 8/10Controls/UI 9/10Immersion 4/10Grind Level 3/10 (low is good)Replay Value 3/10Overall fun 4/10			",232,10,9,24,26,3,74

												As much as I wanted to love this game, it's terribad.Controls are garbage, with no real mouse support (the virtual stick which they've added in is a complete joke that may as well not even exist for how useless it is) in this day and age, kills any hope of it having any life beyond a $2 sale.  Games from 10 years ago managed to get this right, out of the box, there's simply no excuse today.Length is unforgivable despite the bargain bin price.  At BEST, the game is 4 hours of playtime, so unless you get it at the $2 sale price mentioned above, it's simply not worth putting up with and wading through the aggravation.There's suggestion from the developer that there will be DLC, but honestly, they need to give away content until it reaches a MINIMUM of 10 hours before even considering charging money for what should have come with the game.$2 max is all it's worth.  Don't bother otherwise.			",539,129,32,84,37,6,95

												I dunno ~ it felt alright and looked alright.  The basic concept is that you play an FPS space shooter like the old school PC games.  Protect the main ship and kill big/small ships attacking...  You don't explore or choose missions, its story based in large open areas.I just didn't like the way the weapons felt, not fun to shoot stuff, but it is fun to fly around.  The bad guys felt like they needed AI tweak. The mini-map is lame (needs 3D quad  space map, not 2D FPS map.)  The difficulty swings wildly... you are never in danger though.... just your fleet ship you spend most the game protecting.   I didn't finish it because I didn't feel like it.If you like this sort of thing, worth it at a discount... but it is a step backwards from Wingcommander in story space flight or Decent  in combat value - in my opinion.

												Action Fight Space Sim. No roleplaying. No customization. Missions are fun and hard. Nothing like the X series or Freelancer. More like Ace Combat in space.			",288,61,9,76,30,0,89

												Much too clunky and unsatisfying. I'm not flight sim die-hard, but flight and combat mechanics felt all kinds of screwy to me.			",216,26,2,29,13,0,36

												Half-baked game UI design paired with both repetitive, uninspired gameplay and a groosly oversimplified ""athiests == good guys, religious people == bad guys"" plot.It trys to emulate the great space sims of the past such as Wing Commander or Freespace, but in the end it just leaves you wanting to frag cats and shivans, followed by the designers of the turd of a game.

												This is a alright game, but when I asked for it gifted I expected something else. I expected this was a grand strategy game when I got it, but it turned out it was a dog-fighting/fighter game. Not my forte, if it is, go ahead and get it, it's pretty nice, but I have to be honest and sadly click that little know their, because, simply, it's my opinion, I'm not a big fan of these types of games.

												Passable space shooter.Absolutely nothing special, but a competent implementation of the genre. If you're after a few hours of non-newtonian space dogfighting with an instantly forgettable storyline, go for it. If you want larger scale a la Tie Fighter or Freespace then look elsewhere.

												Nice little space shooter. Its shorter but thats ok. Graphics arent too bad. Fully voiced. In my playtime I beat the game twice in the process of farming the perfect game. Overall, decent achievement farm which I easily did in one sitting.			",674,170,29,114,120,3,131

												It reminds me a lot of the late, great Starlancer (precursor to Freelancer).  I'm really hoping there will be a sequel that has an economy, co-op, multiplayer, and many ships/weapons.  SOL: Exodus by itself is pretty fun but rather short.  I like the hacking feature allowing a fighter to take down massive ships.			",368,111,9,50,66,5,90

												Imagine the cult from Dead Space and the cult in Tomb Raider having a baby. Then dropping it on it's head after watching too many Battlestar Galactica reruns.I want to like it. I know these guys tried to bring back classic Wing Commander gameplay. But see, here is the thing, Wing Commander had a good story. This is mediocre. This game could have gone Starlancer with it but for some reason the developer is obsessed with religious space radicals. Let me make it simple for you misguided developers. If you are going to go Wing Commander, you need to look at what Chris Roberts did and learn from it. He took WWII and turned it into a space combat dream. This...this like a bunch of teenagers played too much Dead Space then played maybe one mission of Wing Commander and deciding they could make something just as good.If you are going to copy X-Wing or Tie Fighter, the same deal goes there. You have to have your Empire and your Rebellion.This isn't rocket science! Heck if you have to copy something, look at space based anime. There are fantastic shows like Yamato 2199 which have a much better story than this tripe. I might finish this game someday but right now, its just pulling teeth trying to get through each mission.

												Anyone buying this game expecting Wing commander or Freespace look somewhere else. You only got 1 ship, no different weapon loadouts and a bad story. I would not recoomend this game. 2/10 stars.Try the demo before buying. Trust me, the game is much worse.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
