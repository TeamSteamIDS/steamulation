								The first thing is to ignore all of the promo pictures of this game at the time of writing this. They are from a version of the game that will not be developed further. The realistic look is gone. Apparently the developer couldn't figure out how to make that work properly and instead of hiring help, he's scrapping it entirely. The local evangelists will tell you it will still be available, but it needs a lot of development to reach a playable state, so that will not happen now.The version that is now under development will look sort of like Mario64, see the project's webpage or the developer's twitter for screenshots of that. If that is what you want to like to build your creations in, then by all means get this game (or better yet, wait for it to be updated to an actually playeble state). I was lured in by the false pretenses of the realistic look and the new version is not the game I'd thought I was buying. Therefore, a big thumbs down from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Do not buy this game it is a waste of money, and no longer looks how it does in the screenshots/videoWhy?1) Single developer - One person working on this game2) more bugs than an ant hill3) No updates in forever4) Developer wanted to ""get back to his roots"" and his inspiration for the game which was ""Lego"" so he's changed the entire look of this game to look like somthing closer to mine craft. I.E he bit off more than he could chew and took the easy route.5) Crashes a lot.Basically paid for something I will never get, not because of time constraints but because the dev changed the entire thing, I feel robbed.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

								Phenomenally good game. Absolutely amazing, realistic landscape and the ability to create extremely high detail structures. Why wouldn't I recommend it you ask? because not only has the developer continued to work on the game completely solo (resulting in about 6 months of no updates, he has now also decided to completely change the game from the smooth and realistic perfection that it was, to a fully block-based game that just looks like an uglier version of minecraft. Apparently this is because lego is his passion or some rubbish like that. I guess he must really like his lego if he's prepared to lose the 95% of players who bought the game because of it's realism... oh and then watch his ""passion"" dissolve into nothing because he set himself up to compete with minecraft.If you couldn't tell I (like many others) am rather unhappy about this. I spent 50 hours in game on one project which is now going to be ruined. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Update 01/18/17: Dont be confused by the recent positive reviews they have been requested by the developer and rather then blaming his poor habits and clear disregard for community feedback he blames the bad reviews on the poor state of his game, he stays active for a couple of updates and then disappears for 4-6 months completely changing the game without any feedback.Update 09/20/16: You can see my old review below, I havent kept track of blockscape progress after I parted ways at the end of last year so this update is to give you insight into what has changed, the developer finally updated the steam store page reflecting the current look of blockscape which now allows me to show you what it use to look like when I was a supporter of this game: http://blockscape.wikia.com/wiki/Photos The developer completely disabled the forums on his site, thus hiding all the feedback he received against his current build but as you can see from the reviews most of the community that supported him have since followed his example and turned their back on him as well.This is not something you want to invest in for one reason: while the talent of the developer is amazing you never know what your paying for, I payed for a realistic looking voxel game and now I am dealing with this, and without the developer providing a means of feedback your really at the whims of whatever mood the developer finds himself at any given day.Update 09/09/15: its been seven months without any word from the dev, over a year and a half since the last update, forums are dead and the dev doesnt care that the community doesnt want his ""new minecraft clone"". LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR, the pictures shown on the store page are no longer what the game looks like! please look at the rest of the review to see how the game really looks.While I have been a major supporter of this game even before it came on steam the direction that the developer has been taking it in is nothing but down hill going from beautiful landscapes as seen in the preview photos, to making it seen like a look alike to cubeworld and minecraft: http://forum.blockscape.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=7268 (Link no longer works as the Developer deleted forums)the developer even though said ""Now is a fun time for you to play the game and take part in the development.‚Äù has stayed silent for 7months reworking the engine to this new design without any feedback from the community who purchased the game and is now know for his lack of communication and seems to be totally against his current community of followers now more then ever.

								UPDATE 2/25/15   Jens' recent appearance seems to have been short-lived, and he's disappeared into his coding hole or wherever he runs off to for months at a time.  This review is starting to read like a diary, and I think its time to pack it in and move on from blockscape.Why you ask?Simply put.. Blockscape is hailed as being the ""ultimate block buliding game"".  Unfortunately, by the time this game is remotely near playable and feature inclusive, there will be so so SO many other voxel sandbox games out there that are more current and better designed.  Why continue to wait around for BS when you can literally Sandbox (as a verb) in:SpaceMediaveal TimesPost-apocalytic zombie nightmarespixelated retro worlds2D platform worlds3D open worldsRight now, the only future promise i see in Blockscape that isnt currently being surpassed by other games is its graphical quality... however with the focus moving away from the publicised ""smoothworld"" to a more blocky algorithym, combined with the extremely slow development time will leave this game dull and visually antiquated by the time it breaks out of alpha.Goodnight blockscape hoepfuls, and good luck! I'm done holding my breath!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 01/23/15  It's surprising how a few quick words from the developer in the forums can turn an entire community around.  Jens (the developer) has been opening up a bit and discussing with us the silence that has been turning the forums toxic for months.  I think I need to upgrade my review to guardedly-hopeful.  Though we have not yet seen an update, the sudden reappearance of Jens (as well as an acknowledgement and apology) in the forums has defused a lot of the once-tension and given many of us back the hope we had when seeing this amazing program for the first time.If we get screenshots or an update in the coming weeks that make the game a bit more playable I'll for sure change my review to ""reccomend"", but for now I still can't say its worth it if what you're looking for is a polished game.  If you're looking for the ability to get in on the ground floor of an amazing gmae and make suggestions that may influence its design, then things are starting to look much better!------------------------------UPDATE 12/25/14  Taking a break from my three children on Christmas to post a few words (see Jens, this ISNT hard)Jens gave a lackluster post earlier this month about how he ""felt he had to"" release an update by Christmas.  No promise, and absolutely no excitement in him about it.  Well it's Christmas (after Christmas in Sweeden actually) and the ""Update"" we recieved was a picture of a sled on the blockscape main page.The little bit of hope I had died today on Christmas.  Thanks Jens.I'm calling this Vaporware until the dev. proves me wrong----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 11/12/14   Jens seems to have a new person doing part time PR on the forums now and has promised us daily updates on the blockscape main page.  I'll give him a point for the attempt to reach out, though those 'daily' updates are starting to grow less frequent, and the last one only served to show us that:A- Jens does indeed own a set of legos, andB- He can build monochrome landscapes with themNot that I don't appreciate him at least trying, but aside from his afinity for tiny plastic building blocks and a few screenshots of a supposedly revamped lighting system... we're still not getting any real information and certainly no interaction.  This has the oily feeling of abandonware where the dev pops up from time to time with a meaningless update just to prove its still in production. (Castle Story, Spacebase-DF9, etc)I'm still recommending that people stay away until we see at least one code update (with significant bug fixes and user issues adressed).---------------------------------------------------------------------------Until Jens is willing to grace his user base with a post, information, or just any basic interaction.. I have to reccomend that you stay away from this game.  we were promised involvement and community interaction, but if you want to see how well that has played out, just have a look in the forums for this game.  Not one devlog post since Steam EA, no interaction with the community, and not a single update of substance (both in programming or simple comments).Many of us simply cannot play the game- I'd say at least 30% of us are experiencing memory leaks so severe that the game will crash every time after no more than 5 minutes.  This specific problem has existed since before the steam release, but as of yet Jens has not even acknowledged the issues, let alone given us info on it.These communcation problems have begun to turn Jens supporters against him.... every day I watch the rating on Steam go down just a little more due to negative reviews.  I could turn this review into a 3 page rant, but I wont... if you're on the fence about buying this game, please go and read some of the forum posts before you make up your mind!

								This was one man's project to create a better minecraft clone. He failed. This will plainly not be finished and is in an unacceptable/unplayable state.It started out pretty good, went in an optimistic and fairly promising direction, but when that looked like too much work/too complicated to the dev he didn't get help, instead fell further in over his head & hasn't gotten out.  The dev needs to either hire some help, or have the honesty to admit to everyone that this thing got well beyond his abilities/desire to finish & just call it. Seriously, don't be yet another EA dev that goes out like this- admit it's not working, admit you don't want to finish this, or can't finish it- and just pull this thing offline. Because before too much longer your rating % is going to go low enough for Steam to pull it for you. And... c'mon man. You should have gotten some help much earlier, things have gone pretty bad with this one, but at least have the honesty and dignity to admit it & pull the plug yourself.Players: Save yourself the trouble of downloading/installing/submitting a refund and just don't buy it.

								Short version: this game is dying form a slow death due to lack of news and updates. I have been following this game since january 2013 and while I admit it does have potential for creative builders, it's all there is: potential. The game has not been updated since july. The developper does seems more or less active since he is still playing the game here on Steam and he was connected in the forum the 23th of december but he barely communicate with the community. We don't know whether the game has been abandoned or not (maybe I'm too optimistic since some have already lost hope). If you are interested in building richely detailed buildings and decoration; you can do that with the present game. You can look at some of my pictures to get an idea of the possibilities the game offers.  And yes the game look just like in the video but don't forget that they were taken in the optimal conditions with a pretty good PC. The problem is that the game take a lot of time to load the map properly and this creates a lot of issues. I don't regret buying it but I would not recomend it at this moment. You should wait to see wheter the game is updated or not in the near future. This is my main drawback. The game has others issues but it's still in developpement, so it should be expected. But since there is a lack of communications and no updates, the issues are not fixed, yet.			",33,12,1,19,17,0,15

								I'll keep this review SIMPLE.This game: Is good by concept- It IS essentially a Minecraft clone that Looks better but I don't mind that I REALLY don't However...I do MIND:  No updates (on STEAM) for MORE than a year.I do MIND: NO Discussions (or VERY LITTLE on STEAM) far as I see.I do MIND: Not responding on HIS OWN FORUMS.If you are looking for a GOOD Game that is UPDATED without your saves quitting and deleting themselves every 5 minuets- GO BUY: Minecraft, Rising World, and plenty other survival-build games or even Castle Miner Z is BETTER than this game.If you are looking for a INDEPTH to detail building game- This WOULD be a good one if he would update it or stay very active in the community (what's left of it).Final words/Conculsion about this game: **DO NOT BUY THIS GAME** (Yet). It's not very good at the moment, the STEAM Pics/Videos of it (officially) are WAY out of date. Google/Youtube THIS game (for a RECENT Date, not old dates!) and you'll see the REAL Game and it's STILL changing...Some footnotes (worth saying): He is working ALONE. His driver crashed?(No one gives a damn) and It's been MORE than a year sense He's done ANYTHING(big/massive/productive) with it.Make your own conclusion: but right now, it's Really not worth buying, Scam or not- He made a good chunk of money nonetheless and thievs don't care if they steal 1 dollar or 1,000,000 dollars- it's ALL profit to them.

								Beware the false advertising/misleading screenshots.They are changing the way the game looks, it will be a Minecraft clone now.

								Original review separated from this new addition on 5/10/2015:Developer has posted more information about his rewrite, and honestly before you pay $20 for this game please look at the community/dev pages because this game is really taking a turn that I don't appreciate and I feel like a lot of people are going to buy this game based on the game's screenshots and videos available now and like I did, be very excited about the beautifully generated landscapes, but those will be changing very soon in favor of performance. I would still recommend this game, it has a really great platform as a voxel building game. However, terrain generation is headed in a new, blocky direction that I'm not fond of.Original review:Frustrating to see so many ""not recommended""s because ""The developer has abandoned"".Visit the actual blockscape webpage/forums and you'll find out that he's very active. They keep a dev blog and are very active with the community there. ***There haven't been many updates because the dev has been doing a complete engine re-write, which (from the devlog sounds like it's going well)Do some research before you jump to the conclusion that the developer isn't going to update/isn't working on the game.  This game is early access and nowhere near the finished product. The graphics are absolutely stunning and if you can read that statement and cringe then you need to not pay $20 for a game you know you won't be able to run. I bought this game in early 2013 and it has come a very very long way. At that point there was nothing but a ""creative"" mode essentially with a survival mode that only differed by having you obtain the materials before you used them at seemingly random harvest rates.Now theres much more to the game, even with a well done electrical system. If you buy this and find yourself floundering with the insane amount of build control, visit the official blockscape forums and download some of the maps other players have made for inspiration. The landscapes are so stunning that I often find myself forgetting where I am (irl) and getting lost for hours just exploring the world, and never finding a place that I want to desicrate with my mediocre building skills. (I don't have much time on it on Steam because most of my playing was before this went to Steam). TLDR: If your computer isn't great, your going to have lag (it's graphically stunning), check the minimum specs before you buy. Dev hasn't abandoned, he's rewriting the game engine shouldn't be much longer. If you hunger for updates/info/community check out the offical blockscape forum.Here's a link to the devlog http://forum.blockscape.com/viewforum.php?f=27 ",34,27,0,9,19,0,1

								March 2016 Update: I would love to update this review; but every single update this year has crashed on boot.REVISED REVIEW:  This review is a work in progress and will change often, until it feels right.I've been following this game since late 2011 and have helped spread the word for what I thought was the future of the genre that Notch helped revolutionize.  It had blocks 1/16th the size of Minecraft and the corners had 45 degree angles, helping to make the game seem less blocky than anything else on the market, even into late 2012/13.  The game had a few glaring issues that held me back from playing, like the inventory system that hasn't changed and isn't at all intuitive--but it was a solid start to a game with HUGE aspirations like sailing with lifelike wind patterns.But this is where a fundamental problem came into existence.  The vision for the game was never clearly laid out.  Jens had his vision in mind; and the forums had their own.  So the forums pushed and prodded in various ways and we ended up with the engine that's in the videos on the store page.  It's an amazing engine, and the forums went crazy over debates like whether it's even 'fun' to have life sized mountains.  I mean, if it takes hours of real time to get to the top of a mountain... is that fun?I was one of the ones pushing for them though.  I'm not sure it was the right choice, not only because I no longer believe it's actually fun; but because somewhere in the mix, Jens lost the game that he was so passionate about in the start.  And this is consildering that there were probably less than 60 people following the game, and only fifteen or so who were even registered on the forums at all.  You can imagine how some of us felt when Jens proposed a Steam release in the spring of 2014.  The forums were split over whether it needed more time before release.  My personal belief being that it needed another year to actualise itself as a game.  A YEAR?  I hear you say?  Yes, this is where I mention two of the biggest concerns I have with Blockscape.The game is and always has been developed by one individual, Jens.  This is a HUGE undertaking for one individual and it can take very long periods of time to develop even mundane features.  This has led to the issues that the Steam community are already all too aware of: Slow output of releases.   It seems that weekly blogs and at least a bit of forum interaction is required to thrive in the Steam community.  And yet there are a great number of games released on Steam, where the developer thought they could handle it and it seems they couldn't.  So you see a bit of activity for a few weeks and eventually you never see the developer again.  See 'Sentris' for a great example.So now Jens isn't happy with his game, the forums are unhappy that he's completely shut us out and the Steam community, for the most part, have no idea about any of the history behind it all.

								I have had a lot of faith in this game. It has looked beautiful, however BE WARNED. The developer has announced that he is changing the look of the game significantly. It will not have the realistic look as the main style anymore. It will revert to a more minecraft blocky look. While it will apparently have an option for realism, that will not be a focus any longer. This is pretty much a game killer for me, so if you are considering buying - wait until the new render settings are implemented so you can see what ot will look like - because what you see now may not be what you get.Update: Dev is communicating again and saying that he will be keeping the realistic world, so fingers crossed it will shape up to be all it is capable of being.

								When I first purchased this game it looked amazing, a fresh take on block based games. I played it for some time only to realize that taking scoops out of rocks and collecting bugs & swans out of seemingly thin air was boring.  I tried my hand at building a house and the moment I placed a bed. . . BOOM! a lifeless blocky man appears & after staring in to his dead eyes for a bit I assumed he was there to stay. Honestly, it used to have potential & now i've lost hope, save your money. If your really interested in whats going on with this game the dev has posted more on Blockscape's facebook page. . . .PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There have been no updates what so ever on steam or the original site which was created.All I can see this game doing is stealing peoples cash just so the dev can live easy.The game is buggy and horrible to play for long periods of time, crashes heaps.please reconsider before you purchase, the videos sucked me in too, its not what you think guys!UPDATED A YEAR LATER (15/10/2015)Soooo, thinking that there might have actually been some work done on this and progress coming along nicely... I looked at the news to find 2 more community updates and a few screenshots.This developer is a fraud and has stolen the money off of hundreds of people.UPDATED JUST OVER A YEAR LATER (11/1/2017)Hi guys,Well I'm here once again reviewing this game. I just downloaded it and spent less than 15 minutes playing it to discover that over the year+ I have been gone the developer has removed and changed a tonne of content and not for the better.I thought I would give the game another chance as there had been quite a few good reviews for it lately and to my surprise a few updates that sounded promising. But once again I discovered that it has minimal content and it had its once half decent terrain changed into a minecraft look alike with more edges.Not only that the crafting system is disgusting, for 5 of those 15 minutes I was trying to work out how the inventory opened and how it workek to try and craft a tool, that I then had to figure out how to use. Once I got sick of this I decided to run to the house that had been generated close. After entering the building my eyes were attacked with a hard to see grey fuzz like looking under murky water.I simply cannot recommend this game once again, it had so much promise and sadly the developer just cannot do it, 3 + years I have had this game and been waiting for something good to come of it and all that was added that was actually a good addition were the sounds.If you're looking for an open world survival/building/crafting game that is voxel seriously get minecraft, 1000 times better and can be modded.

								There are so many things wrong with this game.  I am honestly convinced the developer has stopped support (it's never been updated since I've owned it).  If I had to choose one game in my library to kick myself over, this would be it.  I was desperate to find an in-depth and attractive voxel/building game.  I snagged this up right after seeing the screenshots and trailer.Optimization for this game is‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•poor in it's current state.  It suffers from constant stuttering and a distinct inability to minimize the window.  Minimizing the window wouldn't be such a big deal if the game had a decent tutorial or any tutorial.  The UI is confusing to learn and clunky once understood.  There is a hunger mechanic (I think), but it diminishes so slowly it makes no difference (Apparently, there are some animals to kill or something.  There's an occasional bird.).  Gathering resources is a pain, especially trees.  And, there seems to be no real incentive to get AI characters as they are buggy and pretty much useless.I can say this game has a great amount of potential.  And, is an ambitious endeavor.  It has beautiful graphics.  The idea of pre-constructed castles/towers is cool and adds a mystifying element to the world.  Should the developer ever continue this project, it could be an amazing experience.I just wish it was better.EDIT: After reading some of the other reviewers, I checked out the developers website.  There is progress being made, but none of it is yet released.  The developer may release a new build before Christmas.  Still, there really should be more frequent updates. I've had this game for months now, and that's too long to wait for an update (Call me fickle/demanding, but I feel like I should be able to see what and where I've invested my money).UPDATE 01/05/2015:Still no update...  Seriously?  If this game ever gets updated, I will rewrite my review, but as it stands I feel cheated.UPDATE 3/20/2016:Some good news as far as this game is concerned.  The world generation is looking better than ever.  The textures are gorgeous and the general shaping and appearance of the world have become surprisingly organic.  But, the controls, opaque gameplay and poor optimization are still major issues.  Also, it appears the preconstructed castles and towers are a thing of the past.  That's pretty disappointing.  I will update again in about a year.			",103,40,0,44,19,0,12

Early Access Review
								1 May, 2016 - Since Jens is updating the game again and supposedly hes started from the ground up, I thought I would give his game another look. TL;DR - Like Dark Horse, I still vote ""Neigh"". Spend your money elsewhere.  - He did fix the juming issues when moving to new areas/chunks. - Realistic still renders a lovely world, from a distance. Textures seemed to take a step back when viewed up close. - Clipping still a major issue. Now both Blockscape and Realistic modes will also jump the avatar to the next highest cliff/elevation when running into a wall. Falling through cracks still a problem. - Tools still cumbersome/unwieldy to use. - Load times are better, but only marginally. ORIGINAL REVIEWLong Story Short: This game isn't ready for primetime, and the Dev doesn't understand the difference between ""proof of concept"", Alpha, and Beta releases. This game is borderline proof of concept stage, maybe early alpha release. And it's not worth the $20 USD (or your regional equivalent). I am suffering from Buyer's Remorse.What I had hoped was this game would be the answer to the question that Minecraft poses: Can someone make a voxel sandbox game that allows for a realistic world built from unique (non-blocky) shapes. The videos that the Dev has posted on YouTube seem to say this game has the possibility of answering that question. But not in its current state.Pros: -The graphics are great. Don't get me wrong, the rendered world looks fabulous, and so does the buildings built in this world.-The Dev is on the right track with his User Interface. Reducing the voxel size (to 1/64th of what Mojang uses) and using a pallet and brush approach to paint the voxels onto the world canvas is the right direction. Tools still need work, but this is the right direction.-The generated castles (while not really built like castles) are neat structures to explore.Cons:-The underlying engine isn't there yet. It needs a lot more work before this title can claim Alpha status, let alone Beta status:     - Game randomly crashes to desktop.     - Game randomly throws up ""Game Over"" screen with no indication something was going wrong or why the game ended.     - Game randomly hangs. Whole system freezes. Sometimes it recovers if let sit to stew long enough.     - Game uses too many resources.     - Game does a basic render and skin on the entire visible spot of the map, and only renders a small section around the player with the shading, skins, and textures. Screen twitches and jumps like a kid on a caffeine binge. Players will have to wait for the map to render the spot they moved to till the system renders the new location. This high definition render bubble is very small.     - Object collision bugs leads to some rather interesting game play. (Example: Walking down the stairs can lead the player to get stuck between floors, as the system only tests collision on feet and head.)-There is very little help available. Players are expected to figure out everything.     - The only help provided in game is a list of basic controls. (And this is missing a few of the vital controls. Expect key smashing to find the hidden features.)     - There is very little text for objects in the game that can clue a player into tasks. All of the tabs are blank, and most of the objects have just a name and what resources are required to make them. There is nothing to help players figure out how to use most of the objects.     - Unless I'm mistaken, there is very little documentation online to help the player along. Even the wiki site for the game seems to be a half abandoned after thought.-Most of the user interface menus are half built. Many are missing navigation prompts (Hint: ESC backs out of most, but not all screens.) In-game menus also do not appear to be well formatted.-Text in game can be quite small for large resolutions. Font choice doesn't help either. -Features are not as far along as the Dev lists on his web site and on the Steam page.-The tools are still a bit clunky to use.At this point, if you are considering buying this game: Only buy it if you wish to help the developer along and you can catch it on sale for $5 USD. If spending half your play time fighting bugs and reporting them in the boards does not sound fun, same your money and buy Minecraft instead. (It's only $7 USD more, and further along in its development cycle.) The game in its current state would have been good to use as a demo for a KickStarter campaign, but it should never have been released on Steam. I fear his rush to make money off this game will actually discourage people from buying it once it's polished and playable. I doubt many people who play Blockscape can actually recommend it.I do not wish to discourage the Dev. I can see the general direction he wishes to go with this game, and it is a good one. If this were more polished product that was further long the development path, it could stand to be a challenger to Mojang and Minecraft. I welcome him to contact me about the comments I made here.

Early Access Review
								I don't ever down-rate Early Access games simply because it's usually about bugs or gameplay etc which are ALWAYS in Early Access and get fixed along the way etc.. but this game is different. I am down rating it simply because of the stated facts on the main page which since i purchased it last year haven't been done.""I will continue to do regular updates""""The game is very stable.""""I release new updates at a steady rate. I often ask questions to the community and take part in discussions and the feedback I get is of high value for me.‚ÄùAll of the above are taken from the main page, The Dev takes absolute minimum to zero part in the Steam community, he has by almost all means abandoned the game on Steam side of things.The game is by no means stable at all, since purchase i collapse through the buggy floor and through the world half the time and can't get any gameplay done, this would/could have been fixed if he did indeed do ""Regular updates"" but he doesn't at all, The game itself has had a HUGE overhaul and been completely redesigned to be more blocky.. the bugs i won't complain about BUT the overhaul took up 99.9% of his time and the other 0.1% was spent updating his website, no time has been taken to fix any bugs or release updates. This is the only reason i will downvote this as i believe the main page to be VERY misleading. I for one absolutely hate the new blocky look as i bought it for the realism, but changes are all part of early access which i accept, i just hate that zero time has been spent fixing the current game for the people that bought into that so he could make the new look.If you want to buy this game then do so via his own webpage.If you're very active in the Steam Community and enjoy taking part in Early Access Development then avoid this game. Copying and pasting things into a pinned section as a devlog then vanishing again isn't what i call ""taking part in the community"".			",833,309,24,116,124,9,145

								Update 10/23/16: LOGIN FAILED!Update 1 11/23/15: No Updates, a year and a half later. I mean the developer has been a bit more active.. but that is all that has changed, and even then it has been more recent then something that changed a while ago. People say ""lay the dev a break."" Sure, I will, once he decides to actually update a game. You see, when you charge MONEY, 20 dollars, for your game (Which may not seem like a lot depending on how wealthy you are) I expect to get my damn money's worth and for the developer to keep his promises that he sold the game to everyone on. This game has a hell of a lot of promise. But again, I am review the current game, not the update that is promised and not the promise this game has, I am reviewing it based on how I played it and how the developer is currently. But hey if I have anything good to say, the music is amazing. That is about it. ""Don't mix Clay with legos""Then why did you do it to begin with?Personally I got this game back in July 2014 (Thanks Vitamin PAIN for the correction) during the Summer Sale (which seemed to be the death of many EA games, Vox, Blockscape [This Game], and a few others whose names currently escape me). I was EXCITED AS HELL! The huge beautiful world that puts Minecraft's ""Mountains"" to shame and the ability to build what could be a huge city that actually looks like something feasable in the real world. Now, I didn't have any problems with running the game, and from what I have read I was one of the lucky few. The world the game takes place in is imense. Not counting the non-existant Cave Systems and lack of mobs, the world looks great. The colorful graphics and cartoony textures looks fantastic. After a few hours of playing you realize that this nice world is only the cover of something worse. I have been aware of this game since 2012. Some people calling it a ""Minecraft killer"" with what seemed to be an entirally flat world, it was impressive then and still impressive now. Recently he seems to be taking it away. YES YES YES, He has said that ""Features will be added to both world types"" which is cool I guess, but you also have to take into account that this ""Flat world"" that he is adding is supposed to, in his words, ""Make adding features to the world a breeze"" . Common knowledge would lead anyone to realize that ""OH HEY, maybe just maybe having two world types for survival may make adding features more of a challenge"" which the many defenders of this game seem to not realize. The developer is the DEFINITION of inactive, his twitter is filled with screenshots of something that he promised to bring a while back, and others are more what I call ""junk tweets"" for a dev which includes him talking about the wonders of Driver lineses. I have nothing against those posts but if you intend on people taking your work and game seriously and what them to think you haven't entirally abandoned the game you probaly should post only about the advancements of the game instaed of about your everyday life when you are not, not coding your game that people over the course of 2 years have spent 20 dollars on. People say ""he is a one man team so give him a break!"" As surprising as it may be Notch, who made Minecraft, was a one man coding team for over a year! (2009-2010) and brought constant updates, yes you could say ""Its been over 2 years with constant updates and now he has stopped"" but you are missing the fact that this game is FAR from feature filled as Minecraft was at that point and time. Out of the 30 months it took Minecraft to become released in 2011, Blockscape is about at where Minecraft was in September... 2009. This becomes an increasing problem when you realize that about the first year of Minecraft's exsistance was just Notch testing what would and wouldn't work in a voxel survival game (which was in its infancy at the time) but Jens has had that groundwork that Notch has publicly shown everyone over his development so that makes it even less of an excuse for this game to still be this far behind in development, it appears that Jens has bitten off more then he could chew in this case.  Speaking of biting off more then he could chew, Jens (The developer) said ""Don't Mix Clay with legos"" talking about the flat world in comparison to the new blocky, shapy world. Ok, if that is your saying of the day (he made a blog post where he said that phrase about 5 times) then why did it take you so long to realize that? Why until now did you think that everything was perfect. I hope that this game does come back from the grave with a vengence, however I do not have a big feeling with all of the complaints that are active. If he does come back and actually decides to make a game instead of jerking around then I will be happy to make a reivew. However, I find it kind of hard to make a positive review of a game whose biggest feature is ""It runs on PCs Sometimes""Oh and a side note don't believe anything the store page tells you, ""I Will never abandon this game!""...One year later and still nothing.

Early Access Review
								Alright, I've been following the development of this game since shortly after it's initial introduction. It has changed drastically since the very first form that it had taken. However, to me this isn't as important as the person behind the game. Obviously a game can't be developed without a hard-working individual, or group behind it.About the DeveloperJens Blomquist is the sole developer of this game, and following every comment or post made by him, every image that he's released or any video, I've began to notice one inherently obvious fact: He is passionate about this game. Though there have been periods of a lack of communication this isn't through his lack of desire to discuss things with the people that are playing the game. In the official forums, when they were up and running, he would often discuss things with people.But most of all, these periods of him being under the radar are because he's working so hard on a project he believes in. In an age of games that are being developed just to try and make more money it's refreshing to have followed someone for so long, to see their mood raise when people are genuinely engaged in what has been shown or developed, I feel that is quite rare. I'm not saying that other developers don't care about their games, but in regards to Jens, I absolutely know that he does. To say anything otherwise is something I consider to be unfair.The Game ItselfCurrently the game is changing quite frequently. The gameplay and interface is still a little bit complicated or convoluted, there are few tools, but numerous manipulation shapes that you effectively equip, rather than equipping a shape to place. I believe this will be down to the fact that there are so many materials; to have, for example a triangle in 30-something varieties would be absurd, considering you would have a square in those same 30-something varieties. As it stands, there needs to be a better way to utilize this. Perhaps an object that lets you convert any material into a shape, with a return on any blocks it doesn't use (one can assume that in a square of 64 blocks, a triangle is roughly half this, thus returning 50% of the blocks used). There needs to be far more simplification.Additionally, often there may be rendering issues but this is likely due to an understanding lack of optimization - Why optimize something when you're still implementing features? I purchased this game around 5, maybe 6 years ago. Similar to the stock market, it's something I've invested in and periodically return to see how it's progressing. Personally, I find the larger levels of detail to be wonderful. Any time I build something in any game, I consider that detail to be a god-send. The worlds are large but currently without many terrain features, though most recently one was added to make things more varied. I expect in time there will be fields, subtle hills, gorges, caves, etc..Movement itself is fine, though it feels very robotic right now due to a lack of head-bobbing. Strangely though, I would actually turn this feature off were it there. There needs to be some effect that emphasizes movement. The actual placing of blocks is good, you use your scroll-wheel to adjust the size of the block, from 1x1, to 2x2 then 8x8. I find myself overwhelmed at times with what to build. You can build the simplest of structures or a meticulous castle. It depends on how long you're willing to spend.Currently, albeit slowly, there are features being added. Most recently there were creatures, bombs and terrain collapsing, and the game completely changed it's look. This change in look was a bold decision by Jens himself. Imagine if Infinity Ward had changed Call of Duty from realistic to cel-shaded? You would consider them mental. This would be a massive risk to the sales of the game but they wouldn't do it without good reason. Something similar happened here. The world generation completely changed, but there are absolutely numerous good reasons as to why this change has occured.In SummaryAs it is one man, things will be slow. You do need to understand this if you are going to purchase the game. I have seen many complaints about how slow development is, these complaints are negative and unfortunately have the effect of causing development to be even slower - Less sales, less money, unable to hire people. Quite ironic, really. I'm not saying that people aren't entitled to their opinion, truly you are, but to criticise the development of a game as being slow when one person is behind it (and the game is in early access, no less) is like shooting yourself in the foot. I suggest in the meantime if you are prone to being impatient, don't buy this game yet. It needs a good, supportive and patient community of people that can give feedback and help it develop. Remember how long No Man's Sky took? I'm not comparing the two, but the only reason that wasn't subject to as much flak (though it received a fair share) is that it wasn't accessible to all but the people creating it.Early Access can be good, but not when people expect to play a fully-functioning game from the moment they buy it. That is not the purpose of accessing a game early. You are there to help and support something you care about. I do care about this game, otherwise I wouldn't post this review.Personally, I'm enjoying the wait and I'm in no hurry to play something that I trust, when completed, will be precisely what the creator wants it to be. I trust Jens' decisions and no matter what the game becomes I know I'll enjoy it because to me, the passion and investments of the person behind it are more important than what I think. You might call this blind, but in regards to any artform, passion shows.The more passion there is, the better the end result. And I have no doubts that Jens has plenty of passion.

I would wish nobody the misfortune to purchase this game believing its an amazing block builder. I think one day if the developer decides to update the game it could be amazing. But, right now this game is a piece of trash honestly it should be removed from sales on the steam market.

I had to do a force shut down and do a restore/repair on reboot. I finally just completely removed the game from computer. I highly recommend that no one buy this game.			",25,70,0,14,2,0,0

								I've supported this game since it's original conception years before it ever reached Steam. I've always wanted it to be something great. It was the first game I saw that was trying to take the Minecraft craze to a new level. The videos and graphics wowed me and in it's alpha stage I was super excited about the final product. Here we are, damn near 2017, game is still unfinished and still sucks. It will never be something. Save your money. The developer who I have spoken with in the past, is super lazy and is not actually serious about finishing this project. He is distracted and is probably working on something else entirely.

So i got it since it looked great, but it hasnt updated at all lately...i only played for a little and then i just got bored.  Its quite laggy for me, and there isnt much to do at this point.  As of right now i dont reccomend this game, but if they start doing what they said they'll do then this game could be great.			",106,13,2,10,41,0,48

								It's not that this game has no advantages at all. There is the freedom of building really large structures of various materials, endless worlds to explore, you can build gardens and plant trees and other stuff in them...But:* Each world you explore is empty apart from the few butterflies that you occasionally run into, bugs that crawl out of anything you mine and swans/fishes that swim through thin air and vanish in the walls.* The game crashes to desktop quite often. If you forget to save every few minutes, you can loose all you've built.* Optimization suc*s. I have a lower-high-end computer config built for Witcher 3 and still entering  a forest or a plane with lots of grass made the game crash to desktop. I tried setting everything to minimum and playing in low resolutions but it still didn't help.* For building you need many units of processed resources (e.g. to build from brick you have to mine stone and craft bricks from it). Crafting 2 units of processed resources like boards or brick takes 1 second, no matter if you craft from your inventory or via a workbench. To build a decent-sized house you need to leave the game running, your character crafting, for 20-30 minutes.* The author spears to have abandoned the game‚Ç¨20 is definitely too much for this game at the current stage of development. If it gets finished it might be playable, but for now, don't bother. ",79,8,2,20,6,0,10

								If you want a game that surprises you by being something other than what the videos and screenshots promise it to be, or if you simply want to find another builder type game that has decent visual content, then by all means spend the $20 it costs to purchase this title and ignore this review, otherwise read on.Graphics (BEFORE): Very straight forward, you're tossed into a world full of rich, beautiful graphics. Smooth and Beautifully rendered trees and landscapes that I could wander for hours just to look at and enjoy. Any and all of the mobs in the game however are very much untextured and wander around as monochrome colored shapes of what would seem to possess a future of possibilities.Graphics (NOW):  Gone are the beautifully rendered worlds of before, replaced with literal blocks and terrain that are very much not the reason why I bought this game. The fact that it appears I cannot even play this game with the old graphic quality that it continues to advertise is an extremely disappointing factor.Gameplay (BEFORE): Clunky at best. Moving over terrain is a nightmare but it can be quite interesting as well since jumping a bit seems to enable you to climb up what would otherwise be a slope physically impossible to scale. Day cycles are a neat experience requiring torches at night to see, just be sure not to place them near grass or where grass was at one point as they like to catch just about everything on fire if they are too close to it. There is no purpose to the player having a health bar...Gameplay (AFTER) Movement isn't an issue anymore as the terrain is now a flat surface of evenly rising and falling levels. Almost seems like the developer did this to fix the issue rather than trying to figure out how to get voxel based terrain movement to work properly. Health bars mean something if you want to play on hostile monochrome colored monster mode. Enjoyability: (BEFORE) It was ok for a while but it quickly gets boring because with the small scaling of blocks it takes forever to build even a small hut, let alone add the intricate detailing that a more creative builder might appreciate. The terrain is nice to look at but with nothing truly unique except the occasional abandoned stone structures with grass covered floors, and even those don't seem to have much variation to them.Conclusion: That's all the points I can really cover since that's about all this game realistically or rather ""unrealistically"" offers. If you're here looking for a straight up builder game then maybe this one will fit your fancy. I got this game because it looked like an awesomely realistic take on the sandboxy Minecraft style. It has sadly not lived up to my expectations and I feel cheated for it.As for the pricing, let's compare: $20 is a very steep price for a game that is not only ""still"" in early access but has also greatly dissapointed fans (myself included) by taking a very big step backwards in development and drastically changing its direction, while still promoting what it once was. Even at $10 I probably wouldn't purchace this game. This game has far less to offer now than Minecraft did back in its Alpha 1.2.1 days and I purchased it for $10 then. And I would gladly pay $30 for it now. In my oppinion, this game might be worth purchasing if it were sitting somewhere around $5.Buy at your own risk: You are not getting everything that you expect.Ps. Checked back as of 8/16/2016 and have to give the developer props for switching out the falsifying screenshots of the previous gameplay graphics that no longer exist in this game.			",22,5,0,5,3,0,3

								TL;DR - Best building game I have ever played *BUT* it crashes all the time, so unless you religiously save it every minute WITHOUT FAIL, then all your hopes and dreams will be destoryed, which hurts. Very badly.I don't know why people rage so hard over this game. It's still everything it ever was. It still looks like the screenshots. The one and only problem is the dev team is one man, so progress is about as slow as you'd expect. People take it so personally and have toddler tantrums. Chill out.Yes it's made zero progress for a very long time, and will probably never make any more progress. Why? Because people stopped buying it, thus funding the development. Why? Because everyone loves to complain and hate, leading to an overflow of negative reviews.The haters killed the sales, which made them hate it even more... well done.Is it a good building game? Yes. Best I've ever played in terms of detail. It's also full of game breaking bugs. You can build some amazing things, if the game doesn't crash on you. There are ways to avoid it, like don't place blocks down too quickly, but yes, sooner or later you'll suddenly be looking at the desktop. And no, you haven't saved it for hours, so goodbye to all the progress you made today.That happend to me several times. After the 3rd or 4th crash I walked away. Awesome game, progress destroying crashes.Works 99% better than Landmark. 99% worse than Minecraft.If the game never crashed, it'd be amazing. But it crashes. All the time.The only big remaining problem is the world generation. The biomes are tiny and consist mostly of snowy mountains and barren rock/dirt areas, and tiny little patches of green here and there. What you end up with is a patchwork of mostly barren mountainous landscape. The biomes just need to be 100 times bigger, then this game would be the best game ever.That's the foundation it needed. From there it would have been onwards and upwards, getting better all the time. But, for whatever reason, it just sat there. People got angry and now think it's the work of the devil, and that the dev is a scamer or worse, because people are childish. I'm sure this went a long way in making the developer walk away, as people had decided to rage and hate and join the band wagon of flames because they like being part of the tribe.This game is infinitely better than the crazy torch wielding mob would have you believe.So what's the bottom line?If you want to build buildings in a game with the highest level of detail yet achieved in a game (that I've seen), and don't mind having to remember to save it as often as possible for fear of crashing, then this is the game for you.This worked for me for a while. But if you're getting into it and are excited about a new idea you've just had, and you're really keen to try it out to see if it works and looks good... which gets you into it even more because now that you can see it coming together, you're getting more ideas about how it can look even better and !!>>CRASH<<!!..........You didn't save any of that did you? You haven't saved in half an hour, have you? You haven't been keeping up with your saves... yeah... that's all gone now. Sometimes that wasn't a big deal. But once or twice, I just lost my masterfully done staircase (or something) that I've been racking my brain over for hours and had finally came up with a design that fits perfectly in the room and looks way better than I was imagining. That hurts. Makes it hard to keep trying.Fix the crashes and this would get a soild thumbs up from me. However, it crashes like a drunken baby attempting to fly a 747 with his/her lips. It's fun on the way down though.			",234,78,7,28,13,1,25

Early Access Review
								UPDATE  - January 18, 2015This game's last update was in July 2014.  The developer has made promises of updates, but so far nothing has occurred. The last promised update was to occur before Christmas; but here it is a month later and not only has there been no update, there has been no word from the developer.  Since the last update we have seen pictures of him on holiday with his family, pictures of his building block collection, and promises to roll up his sleeves and get to work - but we have seen no update!DO NOT BUY BLOCKSCAPE!There are only two possibilitiies: This is a case of consumer fraud or it is not. If it isn't, then the developer, who is but one person, has bitten off more than he can chew, and either lacks the financial capital, the skill, or both, to go any further with development.  In either case, purchaeing Blockscape would be a waste of money.ORIGINAL REVIEW - October 3, 2014Even though I've only played Blockscape for 3 hours, that is enough to have experienced all it has to offer.  Blockscape is reminiscent of Minecraft, there is no denying that.  Does that make it a Minecraft clone? No, not yet.  Will it be?  That remains to be seen, but from what I've seen so far, I don't think so.What I likeThe graphics.  It's a very beautiful looking *ahem* game.  The building.  Blockscape offers many different shapes and sizes of blocks, so it's possible to build some very nice-looking structures.  Likewise, because you can also carve so many different sizes of blocks from the landscape, it is possible to sculpt many nice-looking things.The bugs.  The only bugs I've found in Blockscape so far are crawling around on the ground.  The programming seems very solid, and the developer seems to have spent a great deal of time making sure everything works as opposed to simply cramming new content into something that is a buggy, unplayable mess.What I don't likeWell.... it would be unfair to list what I don't like here because what I don't like actually falls into the next category...What I would like to seeMore options. Key binding.  I'm left handed, and I can't stand using WASD.Volume control.  The music is loud enough to drown out my friends on TeamSpeak.Mouse sensitivity. I would like to turn this down. My mouse jumps all over the place.Intuitive UI.  I spent much of my 3 hours poking around the keyboard just to see what was what.VerdictAt the moment, this is a game that I would play merely as a casual game.  Something I can go to when I've got a few minutes to kill at a time, not something I would devote hours of game time to.  If you can pick it up for $5, go for it, but I cannot recommend it at $19.99 at this time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								I am rewriting this review on 12/4/2016.So, at this point, the game has a very negative review base. I will inform you why that is, and why I do recommend the game.First some history (not long, don't bail now, I know history can be boring to some people!). Blockscape was going very far, had a beautiful world, and was just wonderful to look at. Well, eventually the game got too overwhelming for the solo developer (Jens Blomquist) to keep going for a while, and he took a break. He wanted to figure out where the game was going to go. During this period the reviews started to shoot down because the game was being labeled as abandoned. But it actually wasn't. He just got overwhelmed, being alone in this project and having such an advanced type of game (I know voxel programming some, and it is not easy in the slightest). So after roughly a year and a half, he released Blockscape's biggest update. Made the game a completely new game. Now the reviews are still bad, but he is actually releasing great updates weekly. The reviews are starting to go up. We can make them go higher if we try because he has found the right path now!On to the game's review itself.Blockscape is a wonderful looking world of creativity. The survival elements are not there yet, at least not all the way, but the creative elements are great. You can build amazing things, with loads of shapes, materials, and even 3 sizes of every block. You can build large structure with Minecraft sized blocks, and then add major detail with tiny bite-sized blocks! All shapes (cubes, slopes, corners, other weird shapes) come in the 3 sizes, and you can even turn off the grid snap! The graphics are fantastic in my opinion. The gameplay is now solid, there are nowhere near as many bugs now as there used to be, and all kinds of things are being updated and improved regularly. Now for some pros and cons;PROS:-Graphics - The graphics are great. They look nice and give a good style to the game to make it unique (my opinion)-Gameplay - The gameplay, while not loaded with oodles of content, is still fun. It can be a little tricky to get the hang of, but still good.-Building - The building in this game, according to me, is much better than building in Minecraft or 7DtD, etc. The amount of detail you can get into is amazing.-Loads of materials, block shapes, and building tools - The title of this 'pro' says it all.-Developer Communication - He is very good about responding to posts and questions.CONS:-GUI - Needs improvement. I like the way that your tools are handled with one hotbar and materials with another, that is fine, but what is hard to get used to is the way the GUI works. It is a bit un-intuitive, but not horrible.-Multiplayer - It is not very easy to setup, though this one is kind of just my problem, other people have no problems, so this one you can ignore. You have to port forward, and sometimes it crashes, but that could just be me, not sure. It is early access after all.-Price - While I love this game, I do think the price is a bit high. Maybe 10-15 would be better for now.MIXED (Good and Bad):-Bugs/Performance - The performance, while still relatively slow, is much better than it used to be. It has some bugs here and there, but also nowhere near as bad as it used to be. After playing for 1 to 2 hours (depending on your machine of course, those are numbers according to my PC) it starts to delay when you build. You click, 1-2 seconds later, the block is placed. This is not always the case, but it does happen.So overall, yes I recommend this game. Now that you know the history of 'why' this has a bad review, it is up to you to decide if you want this game. Remember, bad reviews because he took a break, lost the ""sight"" of the game, but now he has gained it back and the game is doing great. So does he really deserve a bad review still? He has fixed those things that made the community upset with him. So, choose wisely young one.Jens, if you read this, thank you for making this game. I read your last News Post, and I hope it doesn't come to that and I hope this review helps the rating go up. I am happy you have such a passion to complete this game, and I wish you the best of luck.			",94,4,1,7,9,0,3

								Why would anyone think that encouraging trust in a developer that threw his customers to the wind when he felt ""overwhelmed"" is a good idea? Jens has already walked away once, for a year. From my point of view he abandoned paying customers and that's okay in an Early Access program? In what universe is that just excusable?That's the reason the game has such well-deserved criticism in its reviews, and the reason it is ""Mostly Negative"" as reviewed overall. Jens earned the ire of those whom he ignored after taking their money.Should you purchase an unfinished game when the man responsible for completing that game has already shown he will disappear for upwards of a year at a time?Should you purchase any Early Access game from any developer that has proven unreliable?In my opinion, absolutely not.  I cannot encourage others to purchase this with the developer's history. And if you disagree, frankly, I have to wonder. ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me"" right? Or have we stopped being taught basic common sense?Maybe when this game is actually finished, and the developer has spent as long proving he's reliable as he has proving he isn't, this review will tell a different story.

Without a team, communication and looking at gamers feedback this game is meant not to be alive. No fun, not worth its 20 euros !!!			",7,1,1,4,0,0,3

								Game looks fantastic and is good and catches the eye, at first... Then the bugs start making themselves apparent. This game is awesome don't get me wrong but where is the dev? It had 3 updates in under a week or so after it hit steam then nothing, just nothing. No bug fixes means I can't play this game with confidence and I'm aware its in it's early access but carging $5 rather than the $20 seems like it would ease the buyers remorse that runs rampant with games like these. In short I suggest you follow this game if your interested, not buy it.			",110,7,8,27,12,0,13

								Ok, I don't post any reviews on Steam but this time i feel obliged to.To begin with, anyone considering the purchase should keep in mind that this game is EARLY ACCESS. And when I say early access i mean really early access. This game is made only by one person and recently had a complete overhaul of style and mechanics. It has lots of bugs and glitches but it is one of its kind. I've been searching for hours for similar games and this one just destroys the competition.Important thing! This game is absolutely not abandonned! You want to hear news? Follow developer's twitter (@JensBlomquist).Do I recommend this game? Absolutely! I'd recommend it to anyone who needs something better for building than minecraft and for someone who can put up with all the bugs and glitches.It is really beautiful and powerful, even now in it's early stage.If you are looking for a more finished product all you can do is wait. The developer is doing what he can, but complexity of this game and the fact that he is the only person responsible for this game indicates that it's not going to be finished soon.

								This game showed a lot of promise but it ended up being a huge disappointment. The game is too broken to really enjoy at this stage more than just walking around and building a very small amount of stuff, but even walking tends to overload this game it just cant keep up. This wouldn't be a problem if i knew this game was being worked on but honestly its been almost a year since it came on steam and there has been no updates except a few pictures that actually show a downgrade in the quality of this game. If the game would have looked like the blocky pictures being shown now i never would have purchased it. As it is i really regret spending money on this game. Hopefully one day it will turn out to be a great game and if that ever does happen i will edit this review, but as of now i wouldn't recommend it.			",208,40,1,20,18,3,20

								Where should I start...? Okay, I'll give a list why you should not buy this game.1. This is a Minecraft clone.2. You can't change graphics, so you always have to deal with these horrible pixelized graphics.3. It hasen't been updated in forever. (Almost like another game: Cube World)4. This game is really boring in both modes.5. Even with a good computer, this game always has a horrible frame rate. Mostly below 30 fps.6. There are no settings to change controls, so you keep pressing weird button placements and looking like an idiot.7. Complete waste of money.8. The chunk loading is horrible. Sometimes you have a normal lush landscape, and then you just have out of place chunks that have a completely different landscape. I'm not talking about the biome borders, the chunks actually just load over eachother, and this mostly happens when loading a world inside another world.9. THE GLITCHES. OH THE GLITCHES. The inventory can sometimes screw up and not let you choose anything, and sometimes you can even make the game crash just from grabbing an item from the creative inventory. I call the mode ""creative"" because the normal name is just stupid.10. I forgot what I was going to put in ten. Damn amnesia.So, those are all the reasons I have why you shouldn't buy this game. After playing this game, I regret using $20 on this Minecraft clone. In the end, this is just another Minecraft clone that is just trying to get that $2500000.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its kind of like seeing an old friend on the street peddling drugs for money or sex. Its just sad... I really hope the devs get it together and work hard on the game to make it better.

								Got this a week or two ago, when I started playing I couldnt get over the fact that I was half way in the ground most of the time after running up a hill. Most of the terrain seems a bit, buggish as I kept falling through it but would quickly jump back up to the surface. Been waiting a while for an update or hotfix even, but not a single word since I've bought the game. I love the idea of this, especially the NPCs and ability to build a town full of people. I just feel its a bit ""UNPLAYABLE"" right now.			",206,24,7,23,26,5,16

								I wish I'd spent my money on a few Saints Row IV DLCs instead.In the current state this game is in, I have constant regret buying it.It's glitchy, the menus are confusing, and there is a minority of items in the game at current.I'll just do some pros / consPros:+ Pretty graphics+ Lots of tools to shape buildings the way you want it to be+ People move in! You could start a cityCons:- Very glitchy when running into un-loaded terrain- Menus are confusing- Toolbar is difficult to navigate- Model for the npcs and players are kinda annoying, I feel like they should be in a budget game- Glitchy when entering one of the premade towers- Crafting menu is confusing / unhelpfulIn the game's current state, I really don't reccomend it. Buy something else.BUT! I do reccommend you keep an eye on this game, and see where it goes, because it seems promising,but I really hope there are MASSIVE changes to what is currently in the game in the future.I rate Blockscape a 2/10 in it's current stateHarsh, yes.

								This game is definitely not ready even for early access. Unless you're on a flat surface you will be clipped off of the landscape, always just below it and making it really difficult to navigate. The game controls an non-intuitive and the help doesn't provide the most basic methods to build something, only to change what you have selected.Graphics looks good but since I can't really navigate or figure out the most basic things of what to do, they are useless.Save yourself the $19.99 or whatever the offering is at the time - the game is not playable in any form at the time of this riting (12/19/2014).

								Waste of money doesn't seem that they are getting any work done on the problem of bugs like: Falling through the ground, having to wait several minutes for the world to load so you can even do anything. The even worst part about it is that there is absolutely no guide or wiki for it. In my opinion this game is bad waste of twenty dollars, untill it gets help fixing the bugs. But don't get me wrong the scenery and sounds are awesome, but the NPCs are over complicated and every time you want them to do something you need to give them a friendly tap on their face. And don't get me started on how much it takes to run the game, I have a brand new Toshiba laptop and it still is lagging every step.			",31,4,0,8,1,0,1

								I bought this game several years ago to play with a friend, and have been keeping an eye on its progress ever since. The graphics style changed significantly in this time (from highly realistic to more manageable/gamelike set-level terrain), and many of the poor reviews seem to be due to people not liking this change. On the plus side, this change meant that the dev was more easily able to add features, the latest being a couple of enemy mobs with fairly simple AI. The dev is working on this game alone and hasn't always been the best at communicating progress, leading to many fans thinking that he had abandoned it. The updates are irregular both in terms of frequency and content, but the game is defintely not abandoned. If you can make your own fun with an excellent building mechanic and patience is one of your virtues, then I would recommend this game to you in its current state.  The scenery and music are beautiful, and make for a relaxing atmosphere to build or explore. There are still a few crash bugs though, so remember to save often!			",55,23,0,14,18,0,10

								I have never played this game.This game is so poorly optimized that on the 3 different computers I've had over the course of having bought Blockscape, I have never once gotten past the launch screen. On the LOWEST settings possible, I have launched the game and sat for hours on hours, doing other tasks, hell, going to class for a day, waiting to see if it'd be on when I'm done. It's never started. I've never played.If I understand correctly it's been, what, some 2 years now?Shouldn't you, by now, have some idea of how to optimize your game so that casual players (who, I feel, a casual open world creative game is marketed towards) can play it?I don't recommend it unless you possess a computer that can calculate the 475,832nd digit of pi, because apparently this games graphics are more taxing than GTA V on Medium to High on my 2 in one laptop built for office/school work.

								Developer was brave enough to start over from scratch , and I think it was totally worrth it. Walking around the world is really neat. The way the voxel engine renders the landscape is very artistic. Thre are caves, and living things moving around to give life to the planet.Still in very early Alpha, but you can already jump in and explore and build your dream castle.I bought this game before it was even on steam. Verry happy with my buy now.Developer is not afraid to say when he is wrong, even if it means a complete rewrite. Most developers will ride a broken pig of a game into the dirt before admitting they made a mistake. This guy just makes sure it is right, even if it costs a years or 2 worth of development.

								I went to the store to see how the game fares and I see the ""Mostly Negative"" rating ....I can understand that some people who like me own the game for a long time might not be pleased with some decisions.I can understand that people get to easily mislead by pictures :PI can understand people getting mad.Let me tell you this:I am not mad at the dev :) and like so often, less is more.Blockscape is on a great course right now. There were some ideas that did not turn out well, but the developer is re-focused and is delivering many updates and fixes.The engine is now running really smoothly and I can non longer find any bad meshing. The art-style is coherent with the game's name :). There are many ""voxel"" games out there that envy the rendering range with such detail at long distance. You can see what you build a very long way. The block size is small compared to other similar games and therefore you can do accurate and nice looking building with all the possible shapes and materials that you can use.The responsivness of the game is really great! (and I played a few of this type)There are a few lighting problems when mining deep down but that does not stop me from mining.The NPS's will need some improvements.The water is nicely done but could be a bit faster for the re-flowing of removed blocks.For now I can easily recommend the game for people who love to be creative and build stuff. The survival part is not in yet. I really appreciate what the dev did till today and I am sure he's still going to walk a long way with this building block jewel.Thank you for this game!

								I'm very torn with this one. Right now it isn't so much a game as it is a sculpture/map editor, with alot of map no-clipping. My most major complaint is that this game is $20. I personally think the game should have been in development a little longer before having it exposed to the public, and that the controls need to be better labeled. I found randomly pressing buttons on the keyboard gave me more information on how the game works than the 'help' option did. I see the potential, but I'm not sure if this title will make good on its promises. It has a good world generator it seems, with some ruins and trees to find. But you're better off generating a flat world and trying out the controls to give it a more fair evaluation.However, at this point I feel like the project could go either way. Consider it more a donation than a purchase at this point in time.			",81,7,1,2,16,0,6

If developer is reading this im gonna make some requests; game definetely needs a better world generation or an option to create our owns with height maps in a tool. And an easier way to place blocks with a click and drag option snapped to the XYZ axises. So we can place them at once. So far so good.

								To be honest it's not perfect, but the point of Early Access is to give the little guy a chance against the Ubi's and EA's of the world. The fact that it has been in production for so long is because it's progress is directly related to the support it receives. Unless it sells enought to hire someone else (which I doubt it has), then it's all up to one person. Think about that. Even if he hires a developer right out of school with little experience and on contract, he's still going to shell out $40k-$60k a year. To do that, he needs to have made enough to cover his own expenses PLUS those additional wages PLUS taxes. Even if you run at a loss, you can't do it forever with your business. Eventually the tax man cometh.So the guy needs to sell, conservatively, $130k or so of the product to fund a year. That would be about 6000 copies at full retail. Unfortunately he doesn't get full retail. Steam takes a cut, as does the reduced margin anytime it's on sale (which is probably the majority of unit sales). A little research says Valve takes about 30%. This gives us a floor of 8,500 copies at full retail. When we factor in discounts, it's likely he needs to sell 15-20k copies PER YEAR.Based on the fact that there are only 690 reviews, and they are mostly negative. With games that generate that kind of passion more likely to get reviewed than mediocre games, it seems unlikely that more than 10k units have been sold. In fact, the trustworthy internet tells us that the average Steam title only sells 32k copies in its lifetime! http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-06-19-the-average-game-on-steam-sells-only-32-000-copiesI think it's safe to say that it would be tough for Jens to fund a team right now and the only way to make his vision, which is really cool, a reality, is to be supportive and encourage sales.This project has potential and I really hope it bears fruit. I don't regret buying this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Tried the 'new' version of the game, looks nice at first glance but after roaming the map for 15 minutes you start to realize that apart from the odd tree, mushroom and out of place stream of water the world has no life to it. Survival mode is basically ""don't fall off a cliff"" mode, and overall I really think I have not got my moneys worth for the game. I wish the dev all the best though.			",246,67,1,41,29,1,16

								If you like to design things then you would like this game otherwise it's not much of a game.  So far, all you do is basically go around and collect resources and make items.  There doesn't seem much point in game at all.  It's a survivor-type game, but it's pretty hard to die.  I've only found you die from drowning and falling, though you might also die from starving (not sure yet).  Speaking of death, food is hard to come by, which keeps you alive and lets your NPC work for you.  I have an NPC, but they never did anything that I could tell (even before they were hungry), but I'm sure that is just my fault.  The game crashes a lot and has a lot of glitches.  It would be nice if they posted updates more often.  They need to add a compass, altimeter, GPS, minimap, an overall map and resource map (or be able to make notes on map).  I was mining in search of gold and went really deep and got disorientated and dug for hours without finding my way out (had to cheat and use code to teleport out).  They need to make game more interesting, add more content, more types of resources and different requirements to obtain them (leveling).  It would be nice to see physics work...  a bit wierd to cut a tree in half and have the top half still standing (same with rocks staying in midair), though I understand this would probably be too difficult to implement.  Hostile mobs have been mentioned as an update as well as trading with NPCs.  That would help a lot, but honestly they need to do a lot more.  I see a lot of potential in this game, but it's too boring and needs a ton of work currently.  I feel it's overpriced a lot.  I recently bought Lantern Forge for $10 and it's a fairly similar game, but I find it much more enjoyable, though it too gets boring after a bit.  I personally think Blockscape would be stretching it to charge $10 for this game (in present state).  I think the game looks good, but I would much rather play a game that is enjoyable as to one that looks good.  Hopefully, they'll make it more enjoyable soon.			",29,10,0,56,27,0,11

								Posted: 17 Jan, 2015 @ 3:33pmgot the game over 2 years ago and have only seen it updated twice it is incomplete glitchy crashes and even though it is beautifull its a waste of $20 as of nowupdate: the game is now playable and the survival is fun you can advance getting tools and stuff now there are 2 seperate modes there is the realistic mode that i prefer with the game being more pretty although it does seem to feel empty still but i have only been playing on my current world for 2 hours so far i tried the other game mode and it looks alright even though i started in the dessert it looks nice and feels like there is a little more for some reason. and reminds me more of minecraft alpha. and once i started digging i soon realized there was a maximum depth and if you fell below it you would continue to fall without any way to return to the surface..overall i would say i am pleased with the updates that have occured so far but the game doesnt feel like it has advanced a whole lot since it was first released on its website long before it came to steamupdate againafter 4 hours of playing the game started to get extreamly buggy graphics were not loading i wold bounce off the watter when trying to jump into it and maybe due to weight i could no longer swim.. now after i saved and restarted the game i cannot reload into my saved file and am dissapointed but still hope the game becomes goodseptember 2016 update:i think i can finally recomend this game IF it continues to get updates the game runs way better and hasnt crashed on me since i re installed it and played 10 or so hours of there are things to do in it now aome mobs. the water is still irritating though, infinit water blocks that drips more infinit water. needs new musicoctober 2016game still crashes  often after start of new game			",114,32,2,32,19,2,8

								This game has real potential to be superb. as the world looks beautiful, with a stunning day / night cycle. My biggest hate for this game is the start game engine is too predicable, I restarted the map at least 30 times today (hoping I would spawn in a green lushous coastal area or a beautiful island), and found that the map biomes looked virtually ideantical each time with little variation - with taundra mountains and large empty castles blotting the landscape (without a trace of life).Looking at the time taken to develop the game this far and the number of bugs still to date, I dont think $20 is value for money, and it is clear the developer is not skilled enough on their own to complete the game, and I would strongly suggest outside help is resourced to assist completion - as the right skills could make this game top of its league! The game concept is a strong one, but I would like to see the game menus streamlined, the inventory and creation tools arn't very easy to use - I would ideally like to see a core base like Minecraft with easy menues and a clear technology structure pathway leading to space, and the integration of ideas from a number of different games to make this game unique. I like the idea of a randomly created planet, resource and economic colony management (i.e like space engineers), I would also like see city builder aspects like from Cities Skylines enshrining colony and empire management like Civ and Planet Explorers. I'm looking forward to seeing how this game develops - I just hope it doesnt turn out into another unfinished early access game on steam.			",9,1,0,4,17,0,8

								After 6 hours or so, I feel like I'm finally getting the hang of it. I understand the mixed reviews but boy does this game have a lot of potential. The block building detail goes way beyond Minecraft unless you load it up with mods. What this game still lacks is dedicated multiplayer server support(only peer 2 peer is an option right now) and a streamlined UI.  People will usually complain about how Jens (the developer) stopped releasing updates for almost a year at one point (at which time the game was being re-written from the ground up from what I'm told). I'm not completely happy with the new look because I was sold on the realistic look which looked amazing years ago and still looks amazing today!. The draw distance is absolutely incredible! I prefer playing in realistic mode because of the better cave systems (kinda similar to what I'm used to in Rising World).I was hesitant to buy because of the previously steep price tag and bad reviews from the past but then I noticed something, over the past year Jens has been cranking out updates pretty rapidly. He even finally started making tweaks to the UI and adding some on-screen tutorials which was beneficial to me because if you've never played this game before and look at the UI, you'll get confused easily. Well, I'm getting the hang of it. Does it still need lots of work? Sure. Do I wish the game was done years ago? Sure. But it is a fun game and Jens hasn't given up on plus he recently dropped the price which was a really smart move. Seems like he is dedicated to completing this project and seems like the game is on the rebound after a bad year so I choose to support him for perserverence. I've heard of plenty abandonware games but this is not one of them. The game is still needing of some more critical features but it seems to be heading in the right direction again. I read on his twitter that he's going to put more work into the realistic world again (or merge the two world types) which i'm really looking forward to finally.			",26,8,0,2,2,0,0

								Initially when I purchased this title, it was very new on Steam and had a bright future. Over the past two years, the developer has seen all manners of critcisms, some justified, some produced from pent up anger due to a lack of communication over much of 2015.As it stands right now, the game you get for your $20 is a sound investment. The gameplay is lacking in most aspects outside of building; however, the building itself is very well done and allows for creative designs with minimal effort. The game looks beautiful; grass blows softly in the wind, and the textures are very well done. The art direction within Blockscape suits the relaxing, laid back nature of the title perfectly, and truly makes it out to be more a work of art than a game in some regards.This is only a short review, due to the aforementioned lack of much to talk about. What you see is what you get in the trailer, and if that interests you, then you should be right at home in Blockscape.			",458,116,14,66,45,5,61

								First of all i have to admit that the dev made alot of mistakes what comes into pr and developement but, there is one thing that matters for me the most. He really care's about his game and tries to make things right for now there has been steady updates for a while so im happy that dev still support's it even after everything that's happened.Do i recomd this game? Yes for someone who really likes to build accurate stuff with blocks and has the patience to wait for the features and bugfixes. No for someone who doesn't have extra money to spend into in developement game with very little features right now and without a timeline. It's little disappointment for me that we never got a working ""realistic generation"" but that's something i can live with because the primary point for me is that you can build very detailed buildings and so on...And if you made so far reading this... i bought this game about 4 years from the time im writing this from his website so i have seen almost every version of this game even those that were blocky before the whole ""realistic"" thing even was in the game.FOR THE DEV: i really did like the early version of blocky world before the random gen, and i hope that we can see something like that once again.Keep on working with this and someday this game might get it's glory back.

								(Note: the trailer seems to be out of date. Check the screenshots for more repsentative samples of hwo the world looks).I've been following this game since 2012. That's right, I've owned it for four years.I haven't played it much since the first month or, so only occasionally checking it out (see my play time).Yet, I shall still recommend it, but certainly with a few caviats:1. don't expect a playable game you can jup in at any time2. don't expect it to become anything like that for a good few years, more than likely3. don't expect very frequent updates from the dev.If you can handle those, the game is a fantastic long term patience building exercise, and when it si finally playable in 2025, you'll get to say ""I was here in 2016!"". How cool is that? I suppose that depends on your sense of articial honour for wasting money before others had time to. Which, in my case, is pretty strong.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you've just discovered this game, please don't be put off by the negative reviews and do some research. Also, Jens, you really need to update the screenshots on your steam page.

								PRICE CUT!   The the creator of this game has cut the price from 19.99 to 9.99.To me 9.99 is a great price for this game because the game offers the ability to build things at a much smaller scale allowing you to make more detailed creations.  This makes the building aspect much more satisfying than that of minecraft (though minecraft has it's own thing going for it).  The Game as of recently has been updated on a monthly basis, (sometimes more often) and as of the state of the game now, the building aspects of the game are enjoyable and worth 10 dollars even if the game is never updated.  character models, npc's and a few other things need improvements.I reccomend this Game to those who want a more detailed building experience than minecraft currently offers.

								This game is definitely quite early in development, but it evokes an early Minecraft sort of feeling. The graphics are quite nice and it's good to see a survival construction game that doesn't rely on looking like Minecraft as a crutch. This game has it's own unique style, which apparently different from what it fist looked like, upsetting the earlier players. I wouldn't say this is a bad thing; the lower poly - but not completely cubic look is great, and there are nice little touches like the grass blocks having overhanging grass textures.Overall  while this game has a fair way to go in terms of adding content, there is a lot of potential and I would love to see where the developer is going to go with it. It also looks like he's stepped up his game recently and is releasing updates pretty regularly. Coming from a one-man-show, this is a great game.			",241,37,13,12,22,2,30

								What is Blockscape ? As I write this, Blockscape is a great piece of software for building fantastic structures and terrorforming. It has two different worlds in which to build. A realistic landscape reminiscent of something one might see in a Maxfield Parrish painting, or what might come to mind when reading The Lord of the Rings, at least when I read it, anyway. The other is a more surrealistic, albeit blockier, version with waterfalls and small streams and rivers. It is a bit ""minecrafty"" on first inspection, but this is more than just stacking big ugly blocks together. There are three different sizes of most blocks which come in several different shapes from ramps, corners and squares, to cylinders, triangles and spheres with a few more in between. There are many nice textures to use including several types of wood, metal, stone, glass and even lights. Blocks can be rotated, flipped &c based upon their position relative to the direction one is facing. They really seem to know what you want to do with them. Not always, but most of the time. If you want some examples of what is possible in the game in terms of creativity, check out some of the screenshots. It is quite amazing what players have built.     Blockscape also has a ""game"" mode which is a survival type mode but it is a bit lean at the moment. In all modes, you can get NPC's to spawn by building beds. There is crafting and resource gathering. I have not played it so I can not really say too much about it. That is being worked on, though and needs fleshed out. In time it will become more involved. One of the few complaints I have is the relative emptiness of the world. There is a good soundtrack (which could use a bit of variety, true but if fits with the game), swans and fish. Hostile mobs are one the way. But yes, it does feel a bit lonely at times.      Blockscape has many negative reviews presently, most citing the lack of updates, the game being abandoned or a scam. And yes, it was a hell of a long time without updates while the new world generator was being completed and Jens, the sole dev on the project likes to  to keep to himself when working, although he did keep us posted about major developments and shared screenshots of the progress. But I can relate. I work alone too and interruptions knock me off the step but things have changed alot. He communicates regularly on the forum and answers questions when asked. Development has NOT ceased and in fact, I am sure it will increase since the major work is now seemingly complete. Now he can work on fleshing out the survival mode and getting things ticking over nicely. As for those braying that the game was a scam or abandoned ? Enjoy your crow, just watch out for the bones.    In conclusion, no, Blockscape is not for everyone. If you are looking for the next ARK, 7d2d, H1Z1 ad nauseum then stay clear. But if you want to express yourself creatively in a captivating world, and help support further development, then I would reccomend it.  ",118,18,4,42,62,0,55

								Blockscape is a very promising block-building sandbox with some impressive features that place it above other block-building games. Unfortunately it has almost nothing to offer beyond building, and has other black marks in the form of very slow development, unpredictable developer and a dead community.The Good: INNOVATIVE BLOCK SYSTEM.Small blocks (4x smaller than Minecraft's), huge variety of block shapes, ability to freely combine any block shape with any material. Intuitive wiring system with logic gate blocks and colored wires. All that allows for greater freedom and detail than most building sandboxes offer. PRETTY GRAPHICS.The game boasts some nice visual features like long view distance, ambient occlusion, and dynamic shadows even on distant objects.  DESIGNED WITH MODS IN MIND.It's already possible to add, save or share custom objects and crafting recipes which can be easily integrated into the game. A large variety of custom-made furniture and other items are already available on the game's forums.The Bad: NO CONTENT, NO CHALLENGE, NO REWARD.Most of the features that you'd expect from a finished game are either incredibly basic or don't exist at all. In its current state Blockscape is just a building sandbox. UNFINISHED UI.User Interface and navigation are clunky and barebones. Some elements (like inventory tabs) are not labeled at all, and whatever is labeled - is often done so in a tiny, barely-legible font. Switching between tools and materials is a chore, and the few tricks that do help are not explained in the game anywhere. SOMEWHAT GLITCHY.When you exit the game - it often remains running in the background, slowing down your system and racking up playtime until you kill the process. Last time I checked certain chunks of the world were not loading. I can't comment much more on that as I have long stopped playing the game, but it's something you may want to keep an eye on. STATE OF DEVELOPMENT.The game has had a very promising start but was later butchered by developer's sudden change in attitude, which halted updates for over a year and completely killed off the game's community for reasons unknown.Since January 2016 the updates have gradually resumed, but the official forums remain a ghost town. The developer keeps flip-flopping between different aspects of the game without fleshing-out any. As a result, gameplay (or lack thereof) is pretty much the same as it was two years ago, and the progress is slow.TIMELINE:- 2012. Started off great - developer maintained fantastic communication with the players and released frequent updates. Community was very involved and active, helping report bugs, sharing custom objects, making simple mods and even modding tools and editors. Sometimes developer broke promises or vanished for over a month, but then he'd return with a big juicy update and everyone was once again happy. - 2014. The game hit Steam and Early Access. Updates and communication reduced to non-existent with no explanation. After months of confusion, anger and desperation from the community, developer attempted a sad excuse of a ""daily"" devlog, which soon reduced to weekly, then monthly, then stopped completely. All while game's store page listed some blatantly misleading information (including ""frequent updates"" and ""communication"") which didn't get corrected until months later. At this point players have completely given up, while spam bots have taken over the forums.- 2016. 16 months later, finally, an update. The changes mostly consisted of engine rewrites and a new blockier world, which was met with very mixed feelings from the community. While the new world has a more stylish and unique look, it's also lost much of the scenic beauty the old realistic worlds had.Since then there have been occasional updates that kept bringing more tweaks, fixes, rewrites and some new features.- 2017.The game keeps getting tweaked and updated, although the updates lack a clear direction, and as such the overall progress is still slow. There have been some interesting additions nonetheless - improved building tools, more work on mobs, material physics, defense towers, new world objects, and another on-going major rewrite to the world generator that aims to combine the best of both old realistic style and the new blocky one.Overall there's a good base for a good game, but none of the features are fleshed out enough to actually add anything to the gameplay.The game advertises itself as a survival / exploration / tower defense / empire building game, but since none of these features are even remotely complete - there's no way I'll recommend it. However if all you want is a creative block-building sandbox - the game is in a good enough state to be worth checking out.I will keep this review updated when/if the game's state changes for better or worse.

Early Access Review
								Bought the game two years ago when it had nice beautiful terrain and wasn't another Minecraft clone, right before the news hit that it was going to scrap the beautiful terrain to focus on ""getting back to its roots"" or some nice PR slogan like that - effectively turning into a Minecraft clone, in reality because the pretty stuff got too complicated for the dev. Well sure yeah, if a dev isn't making progress it's better than giving up... or so I thought, now it's two years down the road and still not enough progress to show for all that waiting which has made it clear it would have been a better idea to terminate the project. You see, there is a timeframe from when you set out with a goal until you must reach it, nobody would pay for Tetris these days and the game I wanted two years ago that was reverted to something I didn't adore but would have played has been surpassed by a myriad other games by now, sure it has shown progress but TOO LITTLE TOO LATE. Developers have passion and are people too, I hate stomping on someone's dream but get this game done bigger and better and release it yesterday or just give up already and learn from the experience, I feel awful for saying this but it's my honest advice and has been my thought for the last year. For those who haven't played many games like this I'm sure it will be a bit of fun for a while so if it keeps crawling towards that distant full release you fledgling gamers may get some good enjoyment out of it, unfortunately for anyone with general experience playing these types of games it isn't even worth the meager sum it costs nowadays. 4/10 just makes me want to send legendary code to the dev in 2014.

								My review only covers the Creative Mode, I have not yet played Survival Mode.If you like making things out of blocks like in Minecraft, then you'll like Blockscape. It has much smaller blocks and also has angled blocks. With just those two features alone, it can make for some really good looking buildings/maps. The smaller blocks allow for much finer details and the angled block lets you make a nice smooth roof, instead of a roof that looks like stairs. The angled blocks also make the terrain look much better.It's kind of like what you'd expect Minecraft 2 to be like. It still has work to be done on the game, but it's still being actively worked on, and has had heaps of updates lately.Don't let the negative reviews put you off this game, it is a must have game if you're into Minecraft type games where you build things out of blocks.

								The game seems to not be getting the greatest rap as of late, sure, but it's not necessarily a bad game.I thought the game was completely paused indefinitely in development, but I suppose not?The updates may not exactly be exactly... The quickest thing, and they're not regular, either, but the past couple of updates, long ago as they may have been, did add quite a bit to the game, and it's actually very refreshing to be playing this game after such a long time. It's actually not a bad game.It's not an absolute tenouttaten, but I would say it's a solid six.			",375,76,9,34,33,4,16

								first of all I think that this game looks amazing sometimes. but when I try to build it just reacts so slowly and i glitch through the ground all the time, this makes it look like I'm playing like a 10 inch gnome or something. Also i'd like to say that I think The developer should just make a map just like in the game rust, because it is so glitchy trying to build when you need to wait 10 minutes while the world around you is still rendering, so we can play on a pre-made map while the developer can work on the randomly generated maps. Then i'd like to say that my pc has al the recommended specs for this game, and most of the time even double the specs, And still i'm glitching as hell.Still it is a pretty fun game to explore and i understand that it is in it's early stages of development.

								I should've reviewed this ages ago and since the new update has just come out I think now would be the time to do it because this game really does deserve more attention than it gets. So to everyone who's read the negative reviews about how the dev is lazy and doesn't care about it anymore you should know that he's working on it again now and recently he completely changed the visual style and 'started from scratch' almost . It looked amazing before however it looks just as good now and despite what people are saying I think it's still a really good game both visually and mechanically. The main reason I got Blockscape was because it's like graphics porn. It looks amazing and the stuff you can build on it is phenomenal!! Even though it's still in Early Access you can already do so much with it I would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to build super detailed structures that look absolutely incredible. Just look at some of the screenshots and you will see what I mean, pre and post update. I feel like it was worth what I paid for it and love going on it to show off to people how sexy everything looks and how much you can already do with it. 10/10			",105,23,1,12,22,0,3

I waited so long to by this game because I was scared off by all of the negative comments on Steam. They have all lost their minds! Jens is doing a fantastic job. One of my biggest complaints about Minecraft is the view distance. Jens got it right. Thank you Jens for this game and please keep up the good work!

								This is not only the most buggy game I have ever played it is also the most buggy early access game I have ever played. It was so buggy it was unplayable. I was shaking up and down in what looked like an amiga game.I thought I saw a castle ruin but it was in fact, after some extensive loading, just a normal castle. If you play this and you feel the need to minimize the game all of the above will multiply all over the place.  The map will look like a warzone of bugginess.With that said, hope that this game will become playable one day as it looks promising.			",123,10,2,23,23,1,36

								Looks beautiful, but it's a bit laggy. I'm getting 5-7 FPS on smallest screen size that works, clouds turned off, all settings as low as possible, with occasional bursts of 13 FPS after I hold still a bit. Movement feels like I'm standing on a boat. For example, I struggle to walk up stairs and to actually build anything was nearly impossible. After a few tries I gave up on trying to place stairs to make it easier to enter one of the generated (but gorgeous) structures.  I keep falling off things because I can't steer! Maybe with a serious gaming computer it would be playable. I'll try playing it again after the game is more optimized. For now I wish I hadn't bought it. You win some, you loose some.Pros: Looks gorgeous, tall mountains, nice terrainCons: Needs a really beefy computer. Needs a way to turn off some effects for better performance. For me it was too laggy with hard to maneuver controls.			",5,2,0,3,6,0,0

You freely get the last improvements to the game if you buy it. Jens is providing new cool updates at this time and the game is going forward now.I currently must have around 100 Hours (steam only) playing this game.Once you realise the potential of the game and if you like building things, you will stick to it.Graphics are just stunning.I advise you to watch the pictures / videos from the game.Have some suggestions? Tell Jens via twitter or the forum and he will answer you.I really think that it's one of the best building games at the moment.Once Multiplayer will be fine working, It will be a pleasure to play with you.Fran√ßais:Bonjour amis francophones,Ne regardez pas les √©valuations n√©gatives √† 0.1 heure de jeu...Le jeu reste en d√©veloppement et vous b√©n√©ficiez de toutes les nouveaut√©s gratuitement de toute fa√ßon,Il y a eu un trou d'air parce que le d√©veloppeur recr√©ait enti√®rement un syst√®me de g√©n√©ration de map.C'est de l√† que viennent les √©valuations n√©gatives.J'ai pr√®s de 100 heures de jeu sur steam seulement,La raison pour laquelle ce jeu me pla√Æt tellement c'est que les possibilit√©s de construction sont juste √©normes.Les graphismes sont magnifiques.Le d√©veloppeur (Jens) est √† l'√©coute et vous pouvez lui parler sur Twitter ou le forum du jeu.Sinc√®rement, je pense que c'est un des meilleurs jeu de construction qui soit en ce moment,Pour vous en convaincre je vous recommande de jeter un oeil aux captures d'√©crans / vid√©os du jeu.Une fois que le multi fonctionnera normalement, ce sera un plaisir de jouer avec vous.

								I am huge on reviews of a game in EA, I was back and forth with this game from the begining. I decided today to take a leap of faith on the game and honestly, This game is grea. For those who say its bad or its a ripoff of minecraft, Have probably never played minecraft ever. Ive had minecraft for 5 years almost and this game is nothing alike it. This game is easily played and yes its still in EA developing so bugs are expected. Only downside to this game, is I just got it and I have to goto work, so Im left not playing it. Sure people will say i only have 2 hours of playtime, But Ive been a steam user since 2009, So let them talk, I dont care. Its really up to you people who want to play the game to listen. This game is amazing, A new way of building, different shapes and sizes and different blocks added to this game, You can literally build anything in any way. For those who say a tutorial would be nice, Stop being lazy and look it up. It took me 5 secs on google and [w,a,s,d] - movement [space] - jump [f] - fly [n] - noclip. Off the top of my head, like seriously please try before writing a bad review of a great game. Honestly for 20$ I think Jen is doing great, I have already recommended this game to other gamers, and to the nay-sayers, this game is being advertised in gamestop. I think minecraft and tekkit are doomed and will completely drop to their knees for this game.			",80,1,4,2,3,0,1

								I've owned this block building game since 2012, and I've enjoyed watching its development.  It has gone from a very blocky world to having two game modes: Blockscape (blocky) and Realistic (natural/realistically shaped landscape).The Blockscape (new) world has a geometric look to it.  You can build stuff on the clouds and this mode has both waterfalls and caves.The realistic world features smooth transitions between the blocks.  The clouds are realistic, and you can't build on them.  There are also no waterfalls or caves.From what I've read, the plan for this game is that it will allow you to build settlements that are inhabited by NPCs.  These NPCs will work for you in exchange for food.  Farmers will grow food, miners will mine minerals for you, etc.  In the end, it will be a sort of build-it-yourself city/ nation simulator with blockbuilding and adventuring elements.   The developer is still developing some of the basic features of this game, and I look forward to seeing how it turns out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pros: It's pretty (arguably gorgeous, at a spiritually haunting level), dev is honest that it's unstable (beta opt-in is called ""unstable"")Cons: Buggy, slow to develop (last major update was ~1 year in the making), not terribly optimized (980ti + 16GB RAM + SSD + 6700 = pegged out fans and slight stuttering).Nutshell: I RECOMMEND PAYING ASKING PRICE _only_ IF YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THE DEV, ARE OPTIMISTIC, AND VERY PATIENTAnalysis: It's currently a neat toy proof of concept. It has potential, absolutely, and latest update is a welcome bucket of graphical goodness. However, it had the same potential a year ago... I believe the developer should either hire a contractor to QA and bugfix, or quit his day job (yes) to QA and bugfix.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I like the look of the game so much i bought it today. I have come across some glitches and game crashes when playing realistic version which i would love to play more of as i like the look better. Read all the bad and good reviews and about how long it as been going i must say it is better than minecraft if and when it gets finished please carryon with this game it will be popular if you do. Maybe hire a few more people to finish it as i read there is only one person making this. Briiliant game once completed. All the money used to buy this game should help you hire more to finish it.i have had the game a month now and the game constantly crashes on realistic world do not take any notice on the images used for the sale of the game as you cannot play realistic this issue as been going on for a very long time with no fix.still waiting for a fix on the crashing on realistic world 2 months on there is no communication from the developer he never replies to any questions asked in the forum. If you pay ¬£15 like i did for the game you would at least expect the developer to help with problems on the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I bought in way early on after minecraft no longer scratched that building itch for me. the game went dark for a while while the developer was overhauling the engine but as of the past couple months they've been posting a lot of updates. I'm especially impressed with how the game handles mass editing of blocks. I was kind of expecting it to be a tedious job but there's an ""mBlock"" tool that works sort of like a painting brush in photoshop or something. Making walls and leveling terrain is super simple and lets you focus on your building plans instead of the busywork of clearing a site. If the game keeps getting updates like it has been recently then I would easily reccomend it for people looking for a new voxel building game.			",135,44,10,21,29,6,26

								WARNING: This is very much an early access title. There are things that are unpolished and incomplete. There has also been a major change in the visual style of the game since it's release, so it's not unheard of for major elements to change (though that's not necessarily a bad thing). Good:-While very minecrafty, visually the game is solid; much more cartoony than previous version-Can see the start of a certain amount of depth in the crafting-Loads upon loads of building elements, with a much more granular approach than a standard minecraft cloneBad: -Lacks any sort of tutorial or guidance (may not be a con, depending on your preferred playstyle)-UI elements are incomplete and many objects lack descriptions-Bugs, and not just the ones that come out of the ground (though none that have been game breaking so far)-Character models are super ugly compared to the landscape (appear to be placeholders)Ugly:-Developer was out of touch for a while, which made people... sorta mad. He has since returned and updates have been much more regular since then. Things could still go wrong, but I currently have faith.			",99,40,4,15,26,0,17

								While this game holds a lot of promise, there has been some skepticism on how much is really available now, and how many updates there are. There has also been a lot of changes that has made this gameplay evolve from what it was when I first purchased it. I like every change that has been made, and I appreciate how much effort the dev has put into with his limited budget and time, I think his head is in the right direction and he understands now exactly what we want. I just hope people can see that now as this game really is shaping up to be a fun game.			",7,0,0,5,3,0,0

								Looks AMAZING, Plays COOL, and overall, AWESOME! But a review is not a review without the ups and downs...First off, the game will not be able to run very well on a single_core CPU, I have one but I have seen lots of gameplay and played the game a little myself. You can choose between 2 different art styles; realistic, and blockscape. Realistic is self explanitory, blockscape worlds on the other hand are more artistic and cubic. Call the blockscape art style cubism if you want. there are a handfull of different materials in store, and a good amount of shapes for you to build amazing structures! Just look at what people have already built! I'm not that artistic and creative, but maybe you are. The world is very visually impressive, especially the realistic worlds. there are a few drawbacks though, the characters kinda look like maneqins making them sort of creepy. The game is also very slow to load in editable terrain. If you have a quad core processor, you should be fine. If you want to be the best artist and builder of this side of block street, pick up Blockscape!			",29,3,0,2,3,0,0

								(first of all, english is not my first language so sorry for the typos)I have no Idea what the community who recoomended this was thinking. feels like they are getting payed or something.ok my experienceSinge player world.new gameType in seed (always like seed based kinda games)start on a beach with good musicinstantly notices that you can basicly walk upp 90 degree walls (thats not ok imo)and texture based faults (like buildings popping up only halfway through and then dissapearing when you stop to let the world load for a bit) (may be my stupid computer...)movement hacks, specially when walking uppwards hills, like stumbling on a stair even if you walk on a smooth hill. music stops, kinda good sound but a bit lacking. and the horrible stumbling noise when wall walking up a smooth hill does not help.trying construction only to find it a bit lacking. basicly you mine slow as hell and all the resources you mine can be turned into all the other resources or something like that. sure, ive got alot of different forms i can put out with different materials, but minecraft with modding is still a bit better (microblocks). I understand this is a project in development and I am just saying this because I read some nice reviews that I decided to buy it, and I feel like this game is not worth 20 Euros. maybe 5 is a better price, so better wait for a sale!Edit: And yeah the game just shut down on me like that without warning.Edit: Second trymaybe I was to harsh I thought and gave it a second try, started out on an really nice looking hill, and I can see really far and its beautiful, turn around and there it is, a ...mountain?...a...uh, am i inside it? whats going on? cause it looks like you have Id clipped in another game and just standing on the inside looking through it...and yeah, walked into a mountan pillar, ended up on the top, fell down and game over, the screen says, new game?Edit: third try I ended up in a forest, when walking and offcourse avoiding the trees I remembered the mountains so i walkt into a tree and sure, there i was, on the tree top, no, the game is not worth this kind of money even for an early access. its a rip off, im closing it down and hoping the developers will have a good heart and fix the problems and fix them really soon and not go like the devil and just live on the money they are even now getting from innocent gamers.

								This game is really great even if it never makes it past this point as a building sandbox.i7-4790k2  MSI 970'S SLI1920 x 1080 Screen**PROS**+ Beautiful: A highly stylized world with dramatic lighting and incredibly far view distances make this game a breath taking sight where simply walking around is a treat+ Fast and Smooth: In Blockscape world gen the game runs smoothly with no slow down at all high settings. In Realistic, the game will slow down, but it's never a jagged stuttering, just a slight decrease in overrall speed.+ Intricate building: The game has tiny voxels, maybe the size of tissue box in real life, this makes builds significantly less block. The addition of corner pieces and sculpt tools (in the realistic worlds) allows much more natural and curvier forms.+ Tools/Customizability: You can make your own models that fit within a 32 x 32 x 32 box and have them as a quick select option, this makes building soooooo much faster for larger builds. I have predefined steps, building blocks (of varyiing sizes), columns, and arches. The way to get these in game is a bit in depth but completely doable**Considerations**I don't call these cons, because they don't bother me, however I want to provide an unbiased report of things that interested persons may want to know about= Gameplay : This is, as of right now a building game only. The other features are not yet implemented.= Slow Development: The developer, is very thorough but slow. This is to the chagrin of many people. If you are expecting a quickly developed game, look not here. It is a single person/ and the fact it is in the state it is speaks alot to the developer's abilities so keep that in consideration. Slow but good!= Building controls: The building controls are based on perspective with no key set to flip. This can cause some problems, but the flying ability and no clip ( f and n in build mode) can solve most of these issues.So if you want a great building game with a solid foundation and a long term goal of becoming an open world sandbox look here!

								I have been one of the first buyers and see very much potential in it.Some people here tell you that there is no progress, which is simply false.There actually were some months without updates, but this was simply because the developer made minor changes to the world and thus the game was not playable at all.There is a lot of progress, but most of it lies in the detail.Sadly the game is only developed by one guy, which limits of course the speed of development.Compared to some AAA Titles the game is pretty stable ;-)The people comparing about crashes just use the unstable (alpha) builds...To the gameplay:The most survival features are not implemented yet, so survival is just experimental at the moment.The god mode works great - you can build impressive detailed buildings, electronic circuits and much more.Multiplayer now also works again (was broken for some time in the previews/alpha builds).

								Interesting game ...It's all I said I wanted: Vovel game with blocks small enough to build thing in greater deatail and graphics detailed enough feel alive, Smoothed terrain and rock that isn't smoothed to the point that man made caves still look man made, beutiful sky and weather and building material that's truely inspiring. However, I guess I lied. It's not what I really wanted: higher resulution means more busywork and blocks of this size may be beyond my tolerance for busywork and the people make crash test dummies look warm and fuzzyHowever, Blockscape leaves me cold in a way I can't put my finger on. Everything is clinical and precise. It almost feels sterile.For the record: Blockscape is drop dead gorgeous and rock solid and the author is AMAZING BEYOND BELIEF. Sigh, this may become his unfinished masterpiece. Still worth the price just to see this work			",50,24,0,13,14,0,17

								Bought the game today. Played it for 2 hours, or more correctly, TRIED to play it today. But the game didnt last more then a few minutes before i glitched through the ground and just kept falling. Tried to change specs, then the game didnt even start up. Commands didnt work. Controles was unprectical, and querky, and I wasnt able to play the game for more then 20 sec between every glitch moment, until after a couple of min, glitching through the ground. Tried this for 2 hours today, and the game was totally unplayable. Even as a early access, I am dissapointed, since what on earth is the point in releasing a game in early access until enough job is done on it to even use the most simple functions. Atm, a complete waste of time and money. Wish the game gets finished and that the end product is good, but as it is now, I think it needs a lot of work just to get it to a place where its even acceptable for beeing in early access. Interesting concept, but lacks functional quality.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As for the devlogs, they show progress but in game I see very little of it and it feels the same as when I purchased it.Jens, the developer has clearly lost momentum and that‚Äôs disappointing.

								Okay so, here we go. If you think oh look at his play time you aint got‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to say. That's exactly what i want to point out.Okay, so 2/3 months ago, i downloaded this game. I saw it in a youtube video, it looked amazing! And i still think, that it looks beautiful. But then... I started with playing survival. Well that was the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•iest experience i've ever had. 9/10 times you glitch trough the ground which basically makes you unable to walk anymore. Also, 9/10 times you're unable to collect any resources, or do basically anything else. So that's that for survival. Now, there is one point in this game which i like. A little light in the dark, to say it like that. Basically, you can understand now, survival is‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• But man o man, creative. I do like creative! Well, flatground creative to be exact. Because for me, that's the only thing actually playable right now. I was really hoping to explore the beautifully rendered landscape in survival, and create some awesome houses so that villagers start living there. But, that was imposssible..Anyways, right now. I don't reccomend this game. I really, do not reccomend it.But, im sure that in the future. If the creators actually got of their lazy asses and did something, this might turn into a great game. Thank you for reading my review, if you did. ^^			",40,2,0,3,1,0,1

								I've been following Blockscape since the beginning and obviously there have been some mistakes on the communication toward community from the developer. But we are here to judge a game in Early Acccess state : The game is good and has a huge potential.I'm really looking forward the multiplayer part of the game and hope that dedicated server are coming soon.

								Barely played it, but I've been following the updates since it got approved as early access game on steam.There was a time without any updates and the project seemed to be dead, yet the dev came back with full motivation and keeps working on Blockscape with full love. Sure, it takes some time since he's working alone, but updates are coming and bugs are getting fixed. I'd love to see it to have a full release.Keep up the great work!			",52,4,1,7,4,0,1

								My negative review comes primarily from one standpoint, yet i believe its the most important factor to consider when supporting an early access game. Development.This game has sat in my library for too long with minimum updates.Get a move on! We all want this game to be successful, but we just dont know if the developer(s) can be bothered.I and plenty others will be sure to change our reviews the moment things pick up again. If they ever do.			",115,33,2,22,5,3,3

								Hey, Jens. If that was your name?I know a couple of other guys that has tried Blockscape as well. Neither of us knew what the controls were, and it was actually difficult building something decent before running out of patience. It has beautiful graphics, a good handful of content and an eager developer. It really doesn't deserve such a bad rating. Please try and rethink the controls of the game - making it less confusing at startup. If you manage that, I will personally tell people I know - that this is a good game.			",146,28,12,19,37,2,23

								The bones of this game to be are pretty strong - a lot of potential, the world generation is very nice, the editing options and general block layouts offer a trememdous amount of options, but so far it is pretty far from being an actual game - crafting progression, UI and general amount of things to do is rudimentary at best. I recommend putting this on your watchlist, the foundation seems solid and once someone starts taking care of actual gameplay it might turn into one of those gems that you sink an endless amount of hours into. Right now it's ninety minutes of frustration until ragequit. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game is FINALLY showing signs of life, and isn't entirely horrible, however at this point in time wrt to what there is I cannot in good conscience recommend that ANYONE purchase this game.  Simply put there are MUCH better survival/sandbox/openworld/crafting games out there.Honestly, I'd give it a neutral if it were available however since it is not, I'm going with negative.  Hopefully at some point in the future IF the developer continues working on this I will be able to switch  to recommended.			",615,198,4,188,93,0,150

Early Access Review
								There's potential here...but it's to be seen if it is braught out by the dev. So let's get to getting on with the impressions:-=The First Time=-I can't say this game made a good first impression. I loaded it up and made a new world...immediately i noticed the framerate was absolute horror..roughly 15 or less. So I decided to change the settings which leads to the first mistake: no ingame options to adjust graphical/audio/etc settings. You have to set these when you start the game (a window pops up as you click PLAY on steam)...thats where the next mistake comes in: Lack of Quality Options. There's only HIGH and LOW for all the settings but the last one...where it's HIGH and VERY HIGH. As of note, i played on LOW settings for everything...it didnt change much.That wasn't all though, I tried to play the game at a lower resolution (which tends to help framerate i've noticed, for me anyways) but when i changed the resolution, the game instafreezes upon loading leaving a black screen. Apparently the game plays only in higher resolutions from what i've found...the lowest i could get it to play was around the 12xx by 720 size. There's also no volume sliders or adjusters i've noticed...which is more or less a SIN in game dev 101. So roughly, a bad first impression...but i finally got to play (in 15 or less fps depending on stuff around me).-=The Game=-This is not a certain other sandbox game(s)...this is more focused on BUILDING than surviving. That and theres no actual threats to the player in the game as of this review...at least none that i've found.Given i've had very BAD framerate, i cannot say for 100% certainty how fluid and responsive controls are..the only thing i can comment on is the crafting system, the building system and how the game looks.Crafting: It's simple, but that's once you wrap your head around the interface itself. C opens the Crafting Menu with a split window; Left Side has 4 tabs with different type of things to craft (you dont get any indication of what those tabs hold until you look in them), on the right side is what you can make with what materials in your inventory. So if you have Palm Tree wood and you're looking in the BLOCKS, you can make Palm Planks (shown on the right side of the window). Here's the bad thing about the system: You can craft ONE at a time or you can craft from ALL of that material...the crafting runs on a timer depending on how much crap you have to craft (much like Starforge's system)...there is no inbetween. You can slowly craft one-by-one or dump it all.While you DO get a TON of materials from beating up a singular tree or rock (which can warrent the Craft All button without worry) the time it takes to craft is unbearable...and it's made worse that you CANT EXIT THE CRAFTING SCREEN WHILE CRAFTING..unless you abort the crafting.Building/Terraforming: This is the shining part of this game to me. Once you understand how the cursor works (it's a 2d Grid that shows how much you're building/breaking space-wise, the size can be adjusted with the mouse wheel from 1 to 4 to 16 squares) it makes terraforming and building easier to figure out. This system makes digging a flat surface into a hill-slope very easy compared to other voxel games (again, Starforge is FRUSTRATING to make a flat, non-wood/metal surface with raw materials like dirt). Making mistakes in your digging is not frustrating as you just aim the cursor grid into the whole, left click with dirt, bam. In a sense it's an alternate version of how you place blocks in --insert certain other popular game here-- and it works great as far as voxel building games go. You just need to stop thinking this is --certain other game--. The downside to this system at current is the grid sometimes glitches and is on ""something"" close to your face that isnt really there...but is fixed immediately when you swing your fist/tool a bit.How it Looks: Also it's high point....and it's low point. High because it looks fantastic on high settings (defualt btw)..low isn't as bad either. The low point comes with the fact that the framerate is utter crap...at least for me. I don't have the best PC ever, but it's good enough to run intense games like Deus Ex: HR, Dishonored or FF14:ARR at near 60FPS. The only time i get 60 on this game is if i look DIRECTLY INTO THE SKY....and ironically that's where i get a glimpse of how eye candy-tastic this game would be had i not suffered framerate issues. It's likely my PC isn't to snuff for this game but it could also be the game isn't optimised or it needs tweaking (specifically in it's graphics settings) to run smoother. I dont know how to work with 3D game engines so all things considered: If you got a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in' PC, this game shouldn't be an issue as it is NOW.If you dont (like me)...prepare for suffering in this area.-=Glitches/Bugs=-I came across one that crashed the game...it was odd but it occoured when i was looking under a boulder and there was this ""blank"" purple patch in the ground. I looked at it and the game died on me...i suppose i'll dub this ""Looking into the Abyss"" and boy did it stare back.Aside from that, i haven't noticed any other glitches...though i've seen screencaps of people finding some (they're usually related to graphics it seems.)-=So what do I do?=-I personally DON'T recommend this game as it stands on 9/23/14...there is great potential i can see in this game, the problem is when it's brought out and if it's existing problems i've encountered are fixed or improved upon. This IS Early Access and it shows...but I want to see this game be its perfected vision, so i'll root for the dev to do his best.As with all Early Access games there is no guarentee it will be finished and as the statistics go, there is a high probability you will ""waste your money"" on a Early Access Game.BUY THIS: If you want to support the dev and like what you see NOW as far as the game is currently...not what it MIGHT be.DO NOT BUY: If you don't like these types of games, a poor PC, thinking this is a replacement for a certain other crafting game, WANTING a replacement for said certain other crafting game.SUGGESTION: Wait until things improve if you're not willing to fork $20 over on what is essentially a gamble (as it is for all early access titles.) It -will- likely cost more as it progresses to the ""Complete"" stage of life, but if it lives up to it's potential it will be worth it. If you DO want to jump in now, then go for it...just be paitient and try not to be that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• who sends death threats to developers who take thier time or adjust things in the game itself. If all pans out well, not only did you get the game cheaper than the others, but it would be worth the wait.			",249,40,3,55,6,2,22

								For now I have to give a bad review. The world looks really good, but other than building there isn't really much to do. There are no baddies to fight. It would have been cool to expect some skeletons in the big castles at least. The game hasn't been updated since July 2014 and I have my doubts as to if new updates will ever come again. I'd recommend for any interested people to wait buying the game until after the next update, which would then give some confidence that the game actually is still being developed on.

								I won't be harsh, but I have to be honest.  I think the game is in limbo.It's a sad thing to see a game with this much potential go stagnant, but it has.  Rising World at this point looks far more promising, and has a lot of what this game could have been.  For what exists right now, from a developer who has not updated for nearly six months, I have to regretfully recommend against this title.  Such is the Wild Wild West of Early Access, though, so I can't be angry.I also just proofread my review in Wheatley's voice.  Take that for what you will...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game has the potential to be an amazing builder and it has the builing blocks to make fantastic creations. The problem is maneuverability,  it's very hard to move around and place blocks easily. It makes building a simple hut take a long time to build. It is beautiful but in a full regular world your screen buzzes and bounces around because of the poor mechanics and the almost complete inability to go up any kind of hill. On a flat world this game is good for building very detailed and amazing creations if you have the time and patience to work through the poor movement and placement.If you are looking for a builder to make buildings or whatever, Minecraft is the best. I've been looking for something else besides Minecraft and was hoping this was it. Sadly it doesn't posses the proper gameplay to be fun and not frustrating.			",66,2,0,10,4,0,4

								Game is messed up/glitchy, and there were no updates during the first few months that I owned it as far as I could tell. Haven't bothered to reinstall on my new PC. DO NOT buy, and DEFINITELY not at full price (in case you're so curious you decide to buy a broken game).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								When i first bought this game back in 2015 i immediately thought i threw away 20 euros. It really was not playable, it had tremendous cliiping issues and texture/model issues with the terrain. It felt like a broken pre-alpha.I came back to this game a week ago and i am happy to say things have changed. It finally is starting to become something more concrete that can be probably played for hours non stop if you are a fan of the genre, and the potential for creativity... it just surpasses any game in it's league. Also, respect for the developer man, 1 man army... and he never gave up. He's really talented and i can see from his posts that he is passionate about what he does and that is probably the most important thing for the development of a videogame. In conclusion i think this game has a really big potential, I can't wait to see what the developer has up in his sleeve.Buy buy buy.			",27,2,4,3,1,0,0

								I really had hope for this game when I first saw it come to greenlight, even got it before it released on Steam.Looked amazing, all the builds, the detail, everything was outstanding.I firmly believed if the game just had a following, made it's way into social media, it would soar, but it never did.Then I looked into it and found out Jens went crazy and basically said, ""I like minecraft. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• my game, let's just retexture Minecraft"". That was a long time before writing this but it's just all too bad, had so much potential but it was all squandered, and for what? 411 negative reviews? Maybe he couldn't keep up with the hype and thought whatever this terrible design choice is was the only way out.Hopefully someone can fix Jens mistake, someday.			",63,3,0,5,18,0,18

								I bought in to the private beta of Blockscape about 6 months ago, and I've been playing it ever since. I think it's one of the nicest pieces of software I've seen for a long time. You can build almost anything you can imagine, in real time, with high-resolution textures. I love the freedom and creativity it offers, and I'm very impressed with the results that can be achieved.There are, of course, limits. Curves and circles are not really possible, but they can often be convincingly faked. Everything is created on a square grid, with all elements aligned to the grid, so  angles other that 90 degrees are not really possible. Again, there are specially shaped blocks available which allow you to fake the appearance of angles other than 90 degrees. For me, part of the fun is learning to push the limits, and to design good-looking structures within the confines of the game.The game currently has two main modes, ‚ÄúJust Build‚Äù, and ‚ÄúPlay the Game‚Äù. Of the two, ‚ÄúJust Build‚Äù is currently the more finished, and more stable. As the name suggests, you just build. You don't need to hunt for resources ‚Äì your inventory is always full. In this mode your character can fly, and can also noclip through solid structures. ‚ÄúJust Build‚Äù can either be used in the normal procedurally generated world of the game, or on an infinite flat grass plain.‚ÄúPlay the Game‚Äù mode was previously called ‚ÄúSurvival Mode‚Äù, and involves the hunt for resources to make tools, buildings, food, weapons, furniture, and eventually, machines. Friendly Non-Player Characters (NPCs) can already be created, but hostile enemies are expected soon. This mode is very much in development at present, and some interesting things are planned.The current build is not without problems, and a couple of irritating bugs may appear. That said, bugs are to be expected at this stage of development. If the game was bug-free and complete, it wouldn't be in early release. In the six months I've been playing the game, the Developer, Jens Blomquist, has shown himself to be a dedicated and reliable guy, communicating well, and producing regular updates and improvements.In all, I think this is a great game, and despite the bugs, I really enjoy playing it. I have high hopes for it in the future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's been almost 2 years since I bought this game. It looked so promising when I got it, I even gave it a positive review. That was back when I thought Early Access games were a good idea. The game has barely changed in the last 2 years, game dev seems to have forgotten it, taken the money and run, and what has changed is actually worse it seems than it was originally. Don't bother, skip this, never get it, and as a general piece of advice, stay away from all early access games, none of them are worth it or will ever be finished.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Blockscape is an interesting game, it's a bit confusing and hard to get into but for ¬£7 it's not a bad game for the price. I do understand the bad reviews but I want to support this game as it has so much potential. At the moment the game feels more like an experiment, but if someone wants to try a block building game with a difference than Blockscape could be worth a shot.			",149,80,2,26,52,5,29

Early Access Review
								Blockscape is a building / survival game based around mining and building blocks that measure 6'' by 6'' by 6'' (looks like) to create a unique sandbox appeal. However, its early access state shows through like a laser through a tissue. A few glaring issues are abound, but the game is really a standout non-so-similar idea that the creator seems to have a confident approach towards. The responsive break and build system serves the game well enough, while the combat seems to lack excitement. That said, the AI for both neutral and enemy entities is basic and serves what purpose it needs to. All in all, it was not a fun game to play for me, but I can see how one day it will be. Now onto the pointers. Remember, the bad review stays regardless of my feelings. It is not up to par to be considered a continue play game.I redownloaded the game to give it another shot on the lowest possible settings* and although it worked, did not hold up well to criticism. ¬†¬†¬†¬† *My first playthrough had technical issues rendering it unplayable.Let's start with the negative...-UI is hard to read out, sometimes patterns used for some items are not the same to follow for others of similar status.-To Equip an item is a process that requires trial and error before coming about.- The lighting engine seems to die if you go too deep, it is as if you are in an open field.-AI sometimes fails to understand that there is a roof above their head, a table for eating, and a door that is indeed open or closed.-Unresponsive movement and combat with a lack of feedback allows a player asking if they really did attack the block, if they are moving, or if they took a hit. Audio cues notwithstanding.-Liquid physics are a bit jankey, they stopped working after a while and liquids would float in magic shapes suspended in the air, while other liquids would fall normally.-Lighting often bugged out for me, leaving me in darkness/purgatory (Everything is white with black backdrop)-Some items felt out of place, such as the ghosts from bugs being solid objects.-The gameplay feels robotic and unnatural, like lizard people who can do everyday life but lack the subtleties.Some positives-Still has nice lighting, when it is not breaking on me.-The amount of textures and sounds associated with said textures is a nice touch.-trelonist is a lonely ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• who has nothing better to do than annoy people.-The small scale of building is great for detail and to create what you really feel you want to.

								Kudos to the dev(s) for bringing it as far as it has. After a long wait, I gave it another try and it looked much better. Crafting was quite a bit better and I even made a tool with little difficulty. Sadly, I kept placing it as opposed to using it. The user interface is still shakey past crafting, leaving the player wondering how to use a tool and how to set their quick slots (which apparently aren't quick slots). Good progress, the world looks great, still a ways to go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								i don't know about everyone else but i like this game, it does have a few bugs (like the second tab in the tool menu crashing my computer (plz fix this)) but it handles well, some people don't like the controls but thats only 'cause they minecraft too much, i would definitely advise to save often (it does crash occasionally with extensive use), do bear in mind that it is early access and it isn't finnished yet.also i noticed a lot of people getting salty because ""the graphics arent realistic enough"" but if the game itself is good why should it look realistic, i think it looks fantastic, the abillity to add fine details is a really big thing for me but for the people used to cod and other mediocre high-graphics games it isn't what they want, but screw those guys, they probably have the creativity equivallent to a stone anyway.i think this game is well done for just one guy, or just in general really, and i look foward to the many updates to come in the future and for this games progress.so if you're not a shallow cod playing stone then you should definitely give this a good go (mind the load times) [you might need a while to get used to the controls but they'll grow on you] so yeah 8/10 maybe a 10 when it's done			",87,31,1,13,9,0,12

Early Access Review
								PREFACE: I've played this game for roughly 1-2 years before it hit Steam.Do you like building in games like Minecraft and Blockland?This game will put them to shame.Blockscape takes the traditional block-based building and pushes to the next level.The music combined with the scenery really makes this game something special.BUILDING:The building in this game is simply incredible.You can build with traditional blocks, like in Minecraft...Or you can make them smaller (1/9 being the smallest) and getting some serious detail in your work.Not only that, but the terrain smooths and deforms to look semi-realistic.And finally, there are ramps/slants/wedges! That's always a plus.I give the building a 9.5/10MUSIC/SCENERY:The scenery and music (we'll call it the theme) is beautiful.The new terrain generation is a little wonky sometimes, but the frequent updates are sure to fix it soon.The game feels bigger than Minecraft even though both games are infinite.Something about the huge mountains and canyons and lakes just makes it seem large.The music is beautiful and I never get tired of it. It adds so much to the experience.I can only wish for more songs to be added in the future.I give the theme a 7.75/10OVERALL GAMEPLAY:I've not really gotten into the survival mode of the game that much.It's still in heavy development and build mode is a bit more polished and fun at the moment.The game is definitely replayable, but some of the current bugs might ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up your save or cause frustration.I've had a few times where all the blocks in my inventory just turned into white polygons.It can be upsetting when you work on something for awhile and it just corrupts...But the game is still very fun and enjoyable.I give the gameplay a 6.5/10THE FINAL VERDICT:Is this game worth buying in early access?Is this game worth the current price?Will this game be worth it in the future?Is the gameplay good?Is the building good?Is the theme good?The answer to all of these questions is yes.As if that wasn't enough to convince you to buy this, check out the community forum (google it).There are ""texture packs"" of sorts and building ""blueprints"".The community is amazing and the forum is one of the coolest places to just sit down and talk that I know of.Overall, I give this game a 8.5/10. It's one of the best sandbox/building games I've ever played.I recommend this to anyone, especially Minecraft/Roblox/Blockland fans.			",71,6,0,5,7,0,5

I usually am very understanding and dismisive of these kind of things,but  DEAR GOD it is constant.

								This game looked cool and I saw let's plays of it. I thought it was a very cool-looking building and exploration game that was better than Minecraft.I bought it for twenty dollars and it is a laggy, bug-riddled game that's confusing. It is so slow. It only works on one resolution; not because it doesn't fit my monitor, but because the game doesn't even want to bring up its menu.It looks like a good game, and I hope it is fixed, but I will not, and can not, play it in its current state. 1/10, don't buy (yet)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I'm going against the grain here. A lot of people are unhappy about the state of the game and missing features that they were no doubt expecting when they bought this game. Which they've quite right to be as this game is far from finished and there is a distinct lack of communication on Steam at least from the developer, and whether this game evolves beyond it's current state remains to be seen.So why am I recommending this game then? Well despite the glitches and bugs (my game always starts rendered in 3D which is bizzarely fixed by ctrl alt del out and in again and the texture glitches here and there AAAAAAANNNNDDDD the fact that the interface is fiddly at best. Yes despite all that buried away underneath is a damn good building game!If you are after Minecraft with better graphics forget it. That depth of gameplay simply isn't there. However if like me you just like building stuff then stick with it as once you get to grips with it's arkwardness, it is very flexible with what you can do thanks to being able to adjust the size of the blocks you can place. The landscapes are endless and look surprisingly good. I have heard that should this game be developed further it will become more blocky like minecraft which would be a real shame. However I have also read that the current asthetic will be retained only not developed further if that makes sense!So in short:-Like just building = worth a punt.Like building / survival = not worth your time at present.

								There is stuff missing (as an example the fonts are painfully small and many items are missing proper descriptions, an example would be that you can build two kinds of oven but which one is which once you build it? no descriptions).  Early Access stuff, you know the drill.  The crafting system is confusing.   Also you may find yourself accidentally deleting stuff. ALOT!  One wrong right click and boom there goes your wall or your crafting table.  With that said, this game is visually beautiful.   You can build till your hearts content.  I play it.  Should you?   If you have limited funds, buy a finished game instead, otherwise this is worth a look.  Lets hope they add a demo so you can see for yourself.			",154,18,4,43,45,1,35

								Avoid like the plague if your looking for a meaningful game that's polished. I purchased the game on the dev's site back when it was in very early builds. That was years ago.... I still don't see this game as being approachable as a game like minecraft at all. If you want better graphics in a voxel game use an enb shader on minecraft with a realistic texture pack, it will surpass the visuals of this game easily. Overall this game is at max worth 5$, the developer made a big mistake pricing it at 20$ for the state its in currently.			",107,23,12,16,42,0,23

								I cannot recommend this game at this time because it's heading into game developement limbo. This is not a review of a finished product, but of the current state of an ongoing project that will soon be changing into an almost completely different game visually. Even then, at this stage, I feel strongely that there are some good realistic looking minecraft clones cropping up around the web that are far more interesting than this, and then there's modded minecraft. The development of this game seems unreliable and fickle, so while there is certainly a game in developement here I couldn't tell you if it's going to be the game that's advertised down the road. You're better off holding onto your $20 until the roadmap for this game gets a little more clear, because there really isn't one right now.			",276,32,0,64,26,1,45

								The best way I could describe this game is to say it's a very polished version of Minecraft.It's fun and there's a lot you can do to make your own custom creations. So far I have created only a small house but the level of detail I was able to put into it was something I really didn't expect!I don't truly understand all the negative reviews on this game so far. The screenshots must have recently been updated because they do represent the game you get. Many of the negative comments appear to be from people who bought the game previously when it had a different look to it. Unfortunately, being Early Access, this is liable to change and some people aren't so happy with that.The game isn't without its flaws and bugs but it's playable and its fun. Be warned, though - there isn't much in the way of tutorials and you'll need to work out some bits for yourself (such as equipping your first tool and learning how to make different shaped blocks). Once you've gotten this down you'll be on your way!In my opinion, this is definitely one to watch and very impressive from what appears to be a single, lone developer.			",214,28,8,23,27,2,36

								I love this game so much, but I'm concerned for it's future, its been forever and a year since theres been an update, and now with word that the dev's are changing this game to a ""minecraft"" style brings tears to my eyes, I'm worried it will no longer have the effect it has had on me, or many others, Blockscape is currently beautiful, realistic and can go many places in it's current state. The recent Scrrenshots say otherwise however, so my review for this game would have to be summed up as early access Blockscape was a wonderful game, the full version will not be. What sets this game apart from all the other voxel world games is it's realism, it's tapestry of visuals, to ruin that is unjust, it is wrong to change these things. I hope the dev's come to their senses.			",76,9,0,13,9,0,2

Looking through the forums and online I can see this is a common issue. Its a shame because from the video and screenshots it looked like it would be fun.

								This is a great creative sandbox. Still has a few issues to be sorted but the building options are endless compared to some of the other similar titles out there. As it is at the moment apart from the long loading times especially if you have created lots of stuff, it is an awesome game. Can honestly say if the developer keeps working on it and takes it in the direction its going, it could quite possibly become the best in this field of games. I would love to see dinosaurs added as mobs in survival mode as that would just add another dimension to it.  Definitely worth getting if you like building games as this one is great. Its great playing multiplayer and building stuff together, altho the only thing i will say is avoid the paint tool and the sculpt tool in multiplayer as it does cause issues at this stage. Otherwise enjoy a great game to be!! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I was concerned with all of the bashing in the forums. However, I bought this game and am enjoying it very much. It is an early release game, but the content and graphics are amazing. I have even decided that when the developer updates to the new graphics I will still enjoy the game. Even though there will not be the same 'realistic' design, I feel that it will improve gameplay. The wide varience in topology creates a 'jumping' as the program tries to decide your location, you can simply dig a level spot and it ceases, but with the new design and it's designated angles it should resolve this. Congrats to the developer and his sole mission to create an amazing game!			",12,3,0,2,2,0,0

Although it is a little more difficult to get the hang of than other similar games the results are amazing once you get the hang of the tools (its really the difference between using paint and photoshop at the end of the day) I give it an A+ for those who like to create very realistic enviroments and objects.

Very difficult to do anything at all, and the only help in the game you'll find is a control menu.I'm pretty excited to see all of this implemented properly.			",167,27,3,19,24,0,11

								this game has great potential and will be a great game following further updates. but as it stands in early alpha, i still feel the game needs some work. Unfortunately i am using a low end gaming laptop so i do not get to be enchanted by the aesthetics of this game, so my review is solely on game machanics and as described in the description this is exactly what is being worked on at present. As long as the dev team keep hard at it, this game will be fantastic so i will keep my faith in it and recommend it to all			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								There's a lot of potential in this game still but very fun to play even now, in early release. My only tiny complaint is that the left and right mouse button controls feel like they should be reversed, but that's just because I'm used to Minecraft controls. I would definitly recommend people give this one a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I have only played a few minutes on here, and I will say this is in its very early stages. It took me awhile to figure out how it works, and there is about 1 minute delay during a movement. But like I said only a few minutes on the game. This game is not for the light-minded survival/Minecrafter. It is more on the level of an experienced survival/engineer type of game; it could turn into something amazing. I am looking forward to updates, and game improvements. ",14,10,0,12,7,0,4

								This game could be the new billion price game! what i miss in these mining games tho, is a little physics. i imagine you are building in a pvp server (or somthing similar) and one player are building a fortress, house, base etc. on a mountain side. where you pherhaps see a huge rock or just carve a huge rock out of the mountain, so that it could roll down the mountain and destroy the apponents structures! now i don't know if such thing is possible in the engine the game uses, but it would be awesome!!!annyways great game in manny ways, tho you need a bit of a buff computer to run it. but im shure that it's just a part of the alpha ;) 3¬Ω stars from the [TNT] review (so far) ;)			",112,12,9,5,20,1,2

								This game looks stunning when you first spawn, but ive tried everything and no matter what i do once i step to far away from my spawn point i literally just fall through the ground, or everything starts clipping up and glitching out. walking through hills and falling into nothing. I couldnt dig in most areas because the glitching was so bad. I really was excited for this when i first saw it but like i said, i havnt even been able to experince it because of the bugs. I dont know if im the only one with this problem, but i will recommend it because it looks so good. i just wish i could play!

								Now, I know what your thinking.  This is Minecraft. This is what I initially though.  You and I are almost right.  It's *like* Minecraft.  I emphasize like because Minecraft is fun, it's addictive, it's by all means a good game.  However, Blockscape is much more ambitious then Minecraft.  In the first five minutes, I found something I been finding rare. Exploration.  The procedural generation created an absolutely beautiful landscape.  The creation is much more detailed then what you get in Mincecraft.  I can not wait for two things.  To see the worlds created by people not just precedural generation and rpg.  They are both going to be awesome.  But this never occur if you do not support it.  This an ambitious project and in opion deserves to be realized.			",64,33,1,90,16,1,16

								Blockscape is a Voxel based sandbox/ open world/ exploration game with a heavy emphasis on building. Yes its similar to minecraft in many ways, but its NOT the same. Try it out, and dont be so quick to judge. This isnt a ""Castleminer-Z"" or some copy of Minecraft. Hell, look up some reviews of this game on youtube, you'll be surprised on how many people support the fact that this isnt just some minecraft copy. Its aims to be greater, in a more diverse and polished way.Better graphics, smooth blocks, tiny blocks, and a whole universe of new ways to build that arnt found in Minecraft. This isnt a "" Hype Train"" either, its very real. I saw this game on steam for $19.99, decided to take a chance, and now im overwhelmed with how great this game is.I've played hundreds of hours of minecraft, and only three of Blockscape. From my short time playing this game I can already tell its better. Everytime I play this game I compare things in it to Minecraft, and I always found the Blockscape mechanics to be superior. This game is going to become the ""Minecraft Crusher"" of sorts, and im looking forward to all the kiddies whine about why minecraft will always be better, as this game will quickly stomp on their little fanboy dreams, and rise to the top.Get lubed up, because its coming in quick.

								I clicked yes on this because the idea is better than minecraft with its basic, basic, basic textures and old school pixle block by block design. The game is very buggy and seems to have issues even with my high end GTX 970, 16gb of ram and i7-4770k, the game uses way to much ram. The game also seems to just be plain and simply under developed, as of right now in my opinion i give the game a 5/10 for effort and semi-original concept. The game in my opinion is also only worth $10 not $20, updates are rare and usually are some time in between.			",47,6,3,5,17,1,2

								Even though this game is rough around the edges and is a work in progress, the concept and quality of this game seems to be good so far. This game has alot of potential and a bright future if Jens finds a way to finish this game. For those who don't mind it being incomplete I would definitely reccomend this. ",140,19,0,17,11,0,9

								A pretty version of minecraft that allows you to use smaller blocks as well as non block smooth curves and slopes. Already a large amount of things available to do and lots of content likely to come in the future.EDIT:I did also notice that for a long time the game was still being updated and while it felt somewhat dissapointing that it was taking this long, I do see progress being made by the developer and feel that there is value in keeping an eye on it or even buying and following the progress.

								Long ago, I bought an early alpha license to this game, which was very pretty but quite basic. So I forgot about it.Now it's come to Steam, and it's changed rather dramatically. The view distance is phenomenal, the rendering is gorgeous eye-candy landcapes, and buildings work. Mountains are a realistic height, lakes and forests and ruins dot the landscape. It's an eye-opening experience wandering through their procedural generation.Cons: It's slow to travel, rendering gets glitchy as you move (I have my settings maxxed, so taxing it a bit), and sometimes parts of trees, or whole forests, seem to fade in-and-out. It's a bit slow building, but probably because the smallest block size is itty bitty so a high level of detail is possible. The people are hideously ugly plastic atomatons. No mobs except bugs. Needs a world-edit type function for creative.Still needs work, but well worth seeing. You can already build some impressive stuff, and get delicious screenshots. And I haven't even tried multiplayer yet.			",131,32,3,11,20,2,19

								Great graphics for a game of this type.  I love the varying voxel sizes.  Unfortunately, it is buggy and crashes a lot.  Also, food seems to be rare and it's not clear how to find it and eat it.  Also, I am not sure how to use tools.  Instructions could be better.			",8,6,0,17,15,0,17

								I haven't been able to play much of the game due to my computer being on the minimum end of requirments, and the fact that this game is heavy on CPU usage, but what i have been able to play i liked a lot. There are od course still some things that need smoothing out in the game but given that its still on early release those things will prob get adressed before full release. I think the realism sets it apart from Mincraft along with having more options of materials and block size to build with. I have 2 concerns though; Firstly, Its been a few months since the games last update and their are definatly still problems to fix so I hope updates will happend again soon; Secondly, I read on the blockscape website that the developer is going to change the game world by making it less realistic and more blocky like Minecraft. I think this is a big mistake since the realism is what i believe a lot of people are attracted to about this game. Minecraft already exists as well as a slew of others just like it. The reason i didn‚Äôt like Minecraft was because of the overly blocking graphics, it‚Äôs just not my thing. This game seemed perfect , but if Blockscape turns into Minescraft, I'll be very disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Considering it seems like development so far has mainly focused on the aesthetics of the game, and the actual survival mode isn't very functional right now, Blockscape seems very promising as it currently is. People complain about the developer not answering them posting questions in the forums but it's still at the stage where that is only one person, and I guess you should keep that in mind deciding whether to buy it now or not. It's currently pretty much all about the build mode, but there's already the possibility of making custom tools to build with, up to the size of 8x8x8M I think, which add a lot to that part of the game. NPC crafting is also pretty interesting and not something I've seen in other games, currently they build roofs if you lay out a ""roof zone"" for them and put nice trimmings on doors and windows for you, and you can make them craft blocks. The crafting system seems kind of unbalanced right now in terms of how long things take but I think the idea is that the finished game will involve a kind of strategy element with the NPCs speeding up crafting.. basically, the game is still in really early development but it's very pretty and has some specific things about it which set it apart from similar things.

								Basically a very simple, yet somewhat in-depth voxel builder. It offers two modes: ""survival"", and creative. The ""survival"" mode is tedious and lacking of content (in my opinion). It offers a set of shades and sizes. The materials are up to you to ""gather"". Gathering of materials is simply tedious, and gets old real quick. The only danger ""survival"" offers is taking fall damage, and drowning.There are no enemies as of yet, and I doubt it'll get implemented any time soon. The game crashes from time to time, and there's no auto-save.. so you've got to save every now and then.There's a variety of options when you launch the game, but even on maxed out speccs, the textures are pretty dreadful up close. Overall the game looks nice from a distance, it's only up close it looks bad. Good lighting for such an early release, though somewhat annoyingly fast day/night cycles (yeah, the game has day/night cycles..) since you're mostly building and having a hard time seeing where/what you're doing.The game isn't bad.. But I've read people saying ""It's better than minecraft"" etc.. Far from the truth. People are entitled to their own opinion, but this is nowhere near minecraft standard. This is basically the same voxel you've seen in other games(7 days to die), only it's just that.. a voxel builder.To conclude, I'm sure the game'll get better with age. I'll keep my eyes on it as it (hopefully) updates. As of yet, I can't really reccomend getting it unless you're really into builders and builders only. no worth the 20‚Ç¨, but I've got nothing against giving hope to a dev in need. Just keep the updates coming, yeah? 5/10 - barely reccomended..			",277,48,3,42,27,0,21

								It's a little bit clunky in the controls, and the lack of tutorials is a bit of shame, but after playing for a while and just messing with things, seeing what I can do, this game shows great potential. Even though there's a long way to go to get a finished product, I feel that this game could easily become the spiritual successor to Minecraft.There're a few bugs to iron out, but the lighting, the texture quality, the terrain generation, they all look amazing and the worlds feel immersive and limitless as to what you can achieve.
