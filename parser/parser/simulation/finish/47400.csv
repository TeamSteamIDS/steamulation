												During the Pre-release stage of this game, skirmishes were promised against AI or Human players; Steam even had the feature on the store page as well.  After watching the DEV-team videos and listening to what they were ""promising"" I decided to pre-order it (pre-ordered it the day before it came out).Fast Forward a day and stronghold 3 was released. The features that I had purchased this game for were missing from the in-game menu and when I got out to check the store page they had removed at least half of the bullet points for what this game was promising. Fraud? The game itself is riddled with issues; path-finding, graphical mishaps, and the beloved soldiers mixed with wall syndrome.  The skirmish is no longer a skirmish of any sort but a rather boring and pointless sandbox free-build mode where you build a glitched-out castle on one of 7 tiny maps.The campaign itself is TERRIBLE. The cutscenes are storyboards, which they try to play off as art (something only BL2 was able to pull off without it seeming like the game was rushed and released without polish).Dont buy this game. Dont buy any games from the criminals at Firefly, i wouldnt purchase this game for $0.50 and it was the last game I have or will ever pre-order. It's worth noting that after reading reviews of their newest ""game"" it appears that much of the same happened yet again. They simply cash in on a halfway decent game that was made 20 years ago without putting forth much effort to change or enhance anything. Terrible company, terrible games, and terrible ethics.

												I'm sure there are already enough negative comments to ward off even the stupidest buyer but I'm going to add mine anyway because leaving a negative comment is the only enjoyment I get from this game. The initial release of Stronghold 3 may be the most shameful act in gaming history. If this were Japan, the staff of Firefly would be honor bound to commit Hari-Kari. Like so many others I have been with the Stronghold Series from the start; absolutely one of my favorites until...Stronghold 3. It was more than a slap in the face to fans of the series. It was an insult to the entire gaming community. It was months late from its expected arrival. Each delay accompanied by an assurance they were refining the game. What they were doing was hurriedly hacking together a cheap revised version of SH2. Even though the ""frankenstein"" they had created still lacked life, they released it upon the world, in time for the Christmas market. Thanks to trusting fans and unwary buyers the game went gold immediately. The scheme had worked perfectly. They dangled it front of us with a lot of hype [lies], made a fortune in initial sales, delivered a bonified POC, figuring to patch the monster together in the following months. And then failed to deliver on that as well. Here's an example of the refinements they were making. I call it, Mission: ImpossibleOne of the first missions is to defend the town from wolf attacks. I built 2 wooden towers with ladder access, put archers in them to intercept the wolves and reduce their numbers as they approached the town. The wolves came, climbed the ladders into the towers and killed my archers. Any playtesting at all could not miss this.If releasing this abomination upon a trusting fan base wasn't despicable enough; consider how they treated the foreign markets. The Chinese were sold a retail copy that could not be converted to a Steam account. That meant they had no access to any patches except if a kind soul posted a cracked version somewhere. Let me say it again. They sold the Chinese unplayable versions of the game with no support. Anything for a buck.I don't care what excuse they give for their actions. They cheated me. They cheated the world. And there's been no retribution for the crime. Firefly is dead to me. I don't look at anything that has their logo on it. There's plenty of new, respectable talent and castle building games are coming on all the time. Firefly should stick to games about organized crime anyway. That's where their true talent lies.

												I've had a few attempts playing this game, let me summarise:At launch:  a buggy mess, a festival of bugs and crashes and AI/UI issues.  You could not place certain (crucial) structures like steps .. which would allow you to mount archers on the walls.  Archers did not return fire as mace-men approached your walls.  It was a ridiculous and frustrating mess.  Only positive I can say is I liked some of the gritty art style.A few months later:  it seemed like the developer was as disappointed as most consumers .. there was apparently some advices saying they blamed the publisher who pushed for an early release, and that they would endeavour to give consumers the game that they deserve through patching and constant and consistent after-sale improvements.  (Apparently the game we deserve is 'poo poo' because even with them working through the list of problems, the game, although playable in some ways, was still deeply flawed.  Archers still wouldnt retaliate, still had issues placing simple things like stairs up to walls).About a year after launch:  I decide to give the game one last try.  (Loved earlier Stronghold titles and the concept in general).  They made some improvements to the game .. archers could fire back .. structures could be placed .. overall the game became somewhat playable .. BUT .. even after all that work they really barely achieve 'passable' .. archers may retaliate, but there's no mechanic for wall cover, and they get no elevation bonus to range or accuracy .. so basically 20 archers attacking a wall v 20 archers on a wall .. probably the attackers would win because they are clustered into one big kill-group, firing all their arrows together accurately, while the wall guys are scattered about and some would be out of range to attack... but yeah, basically the ones on the wall get no benefit).  Also you'll place units on a wall and they will become un-movable.  Just plain stuck.So basically, despite a good legacy and concept, the game sucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2/10Overall, don't buy the game. Its terrible... It doesn't live up to the Stronghold series. Don't even buy it on a sale even if its $7.49. Go buy a small game with 8 dollars, you can probably find something with more playability. Go ahead and buy those cheap DLCs or cosmetics you've been wanting for your other games. Go ahead... its much better to buy cosmetic DLCs or small packs then it is to buy this game.CategoryRatingGraphics8/10 The games graphics are probably the best in the Stronghold series, but there are problems stated about this belowModes2/10 The lack of modes is terrible, there is no more skirmishes, there is a great lack of siege battles (and those siege battles are pathetic). There is no built in editor either.Campaign1/10 The campaign is terrible! I haven't even got through the first mission it was SO poor!Building placement3/10 This is a true horror. They added a nice new way to rotate buildings, but the downside is, it takes longer to place buildings now! But whats worse is the spaceing! You can't place buildings closer than 6 feet now! Buildings are so spaced, but the maps (which I won't do a category on) are also terrible! You can only place buildings on 1/4 of the map, because of the elevation, and the strict limits! You have to be careful of where you place, and you can only place so few buildings because of the stupid placement system.Bugs and crashes4/10 I myself haven't saw much bugs (but I have heard of a lot) But crashes, theres a lot of that too. Not even 2 hours, and I already had a crash. The first Stronghold is more stable with crashes, even though I have Windows 8 and no compability mode on!How it runs2/10 LAG LAG LAG and low FPS. I really don't know if its my computer or the game, but it has a low FPS. Other people have stated there was lag though. But it is bad... I can run 800 people with a small castle on the map in Stronghold 2 on high graphics, here I can't run 100 people on the map with even medium graphics. Avoid.ExtraOnce, a Youtuber named DiplexHeated said,""The buildings are terrible. It all just feels like a village, unlike a castle you'd see in Stronghold 2."" ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Have I not reveiwed this stinker yet? Geeze, it was like... two years ago now I played (and beat) it?Personally, I don't care about the bugs, of which there really arn't THAT many compared to earlier Stronghold titles. The game worked okay for me and I got through the campaign without any real serious issue.No, where I got upset, where I feel the devs truly betrayed everything that Stronghold stood for, was thinking I was no longer smart enough to build my own castles. That's right, its Stronghold, a castle building sim, in which you don't build castles. On every single player map the castle is already built for you. Oh sure, you can build a wall between two incredibly obvious cliffs to seal off a supposed weak point, but I wanted to build frickin' castles. The first game let you build castles. The first game said ""Here's some land. There's a quarry. Choose where to place your stockpile ANYWHERE on the map and, oh, by the way, you're getting attacked in about ten minutes."" That's what made Stronghold, Stronghold for me. Sure, they still gave you some castles in Stronghold 1, but they usually destroyed them in the first assault and made you rebuild them, often having to scrap some of the infastructure so you could pull your defenses back to a more practical postion. Stronghold 2 backed off of that, but still allowed for it, and on the missions you were given a castle to start, they were often little more than a ring wall and a single scout tower just to get you through the first attack. Stronghold 3... gives you a full castle on most maps, doesn't want to let you decide where to place defenses (and fights you tooth and nail when you try), and on the rare occasion you don't start with a fully loaded bastion, the places they want you to build are painfully obvious. In short, they've made what once was a good castle building sim into a below average Midieval RTS. For shame.Throwing salt on the wound is the way they handled the story. The original Stronghold's story was pretty good, and the characters were humorous, colorful, and fun to listen to. Yah, they had dialouge in the first game. Good dialogue. In the first game you were supposed to be afraid of The Wolf. You would panic when he attacked your early castles, and the final two missions against him featured huge battles that saw nearly complete destruction of the castles involved.  Comparitively, the Wolf of Stronghold 3 is a has been that should have stayed gone. Unfortunately this reflects on the protagonist as well who, while a capable military leader in the first game, might as well be a court jester in the third. Even the last few battles, where you go up against the Wolf himself, are so toned down it might as well be a sprawling bar fight. In the end, I was actually happy the game ended the way it did, they both deserved it.TLDR: If you've never played Stronghold, get the first game. It's infinitely better than this turd, and you actually get to build castles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm just.. i don't know. I'm shocked.Back in the days I played ALOT of Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader and it was totaly AWESOME.This ""game"" here is just.. i don't know. What the hell where they thinking?! The unit movement makes you think you're playing on half if not quarter speed. The pathing is ABSOLUTELY stupid. Unit attacks aswell - an example: Lets say you have 50 Man-at-arms (spear throwing unit) and ORDER to attack a group of enemy units atleast 40 of these Man at arms will throw their spear although the enemy man at arms dies from 3 spears maximum thus making 37 Spears go completly into vain.No skirmish mode just ""User maps""I was realy fighting with myself to make a pro/con list but i just can't. It's pointless. I hate to say it but i see no Pro's in this game and i'm realy an easy customer when it comes to games.2/10 max. Wouldn't recommend it and I'm glad that i got this game through a Bundle for 3Euros instead of paying 29.99 for this piece of crap. Holy hell Firefly what happened? Sh1 and Crusader were awesome? How could you ♥♥♥♥ it up that much?!Like i said 2/10 max. Would not recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bad pathfinding and bugs, glitches, and hell knows what else beyond comprehension plague this game. I have gotten hours of enjoyment out of it, but that was only because I am a die-hard stronghold fan. Anything less will find no enjoyment in this game, only the frustration of trying to get not everything, but ANYthing at all to work the way you want it to. There are only 2 solid points to this game - the graphics and the gridless building system, both of which are the best in the series as of the time of this review. The military units don't behave properly and have minimal AI on their own...there IS no AI for enemy opponents whatsoever, meaning more often than not they sit there doing ♥♥♥♥all until you go to them instead, there are massive game-breaking glitches with the physics and pathfinding, and the multiplayer servers are so god awful that they had to slap a 150 troop limit and 125 building limit (INCLUDING TOWERS AND GATEHOUSES) into the multiplayer to make it barebones functional and you can still expect massive lag left and right - not computer lag, but network lag where the whole game will slow to a crawl.Want the bonuses of a 3D stronghold game that doesn't suck and has functional multiplayer? Go get crusader 2.Otherwise just get ANY game in the series besides this one. This is the ONLY game in the entire series that I would not recommend, as it is the only one that provides more frustration than it does fun - the next worst in the series falls to Stronghold Legends, which is not nearly as bad as this and is easily playable and enjoyable.

												-If you are a Stronghold fan, do NOT buy this game. The frustration is painful and not worth it.-I have always been a Stronghold fan and wouldn't hesitate to recommend Stronghold, Stronghold 2, Stronghold Crusader or even Stronghold Legends to any of my friends. So of course I was biding my time until the game finally released and squandered $60 on it. I'd equate the anticipation level of buying it and actual gameplay akin to Duke Nukem Forever.While there certainly are positives: the game is gorgeous when rendered and boasts a lot of new content. The basics that make the game flow and playable are the worst in the series. As much as I would like to rant as to how Firefly could botch a release so badly after having released a prior version, Stronghold Crusader Extreme, wherein the player could field an army of up to 10,000 troops and limitless buildings, I have no idea.The number 1 issue that ruined the game for me was the slow replenishment of the player's campfire (distributable population) mixed with the prioritzation of industry over military. For instance if an opposing army kills the workers of any industry buildings beyond your walls, or even wolves for that matter, you will not be able to build any troops until the workers are replenished in the order that they were killed. Unfortunately that is just one glitch of many that should have been cleaned up during simple game testing. Whoever was in charge of cleaning up this game ought to have used Lemon Pledge.

												Stronghold 3 absolutly ruins the formerly great franchise by destroying everything great about the older ones. First of all, for me anyway, the multiplayer doesn't work, period. There is a limit to how many men and buildings you can have on the map at a time which kills the ablility to build however you want. There is no ""skirmish"" mode which in older titles would let you build a castle and army to face off against opponents doing the same thing on the same map, no longer. The only thing this game has that is better than Stonghold 2 is the the graphics are slightly better. If you want a good castle building game, buy Stronghold 2 instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Summary - THERE IS NO CUSTOM SKIRMISH WITH AIThe above title is all you really need to know. This was the first game of the downfall of the brilliant Firefly Studios Stronghold series. This game lacks content, and is the slowest and most boring Stronghold I've ever played. I have played every stronghold that has come out apart from the newest Stronghold Crusader 2. This game does not have a Custom Skrimish mode, the economic campaign has about an hour-long playthrough and the rest of the campaigns I didn't even bother to try to finish with.The Good -The only merit this game has is the Free Build, and you have to download the map editor to this game SEPARATELY. The graphics look nice and polished, the lighting is decent and that's about it.The Bad -Simply put, this game is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The music, the voices, the buildings and even some of the characters are ripped from the other strongholds. The largest map in Stronghold 3 is the smallest map you can make in Stronghold Crusader (I'm dead serious). The game sucks your PCs performance despite there being 1/100 of the amount of stuff to process compared to the Total War games. MULTIPLAYER LOBBYS ARE DEAD.RATING: 4/10EDIT: Fixed 2 typos.

												I'm writing this three years after launch. Don't be fooled by the frequent discounts, there's a reason this game is *always* on sale:STRONGHOLD 3 IS CRAP.  Even if they were giving it away, it would still not be worth the download. It's a messy, buggy resource hog. In my first experience, the game would freeze for 10 seconds every minute or so. I endured that BS for ten minutes and then it crashed. Most of the three hours I got out of this game were spent in the map editor. None of the maps I made could be played. I've made a large map exactly the same way I used to do in SH2. It failed to load. I've reduced the large map to a single castle with a few trees around it. No enemies, no animals, not even a river. It failed to load as well. I was able to load a medium custom map but the game would keep freezing over and over, making it unplayable. I couldn't even play the campaign. As the ""game"" was only taking space in my HDD, I uninstalled it. Even if you're into games that crash often and slow down to a crawl for no apparent reason when you're running it on a machine that's WAY above the recommended specs, there's a lot of better options out there. Even if you're a die-hard Stronghold fan like I used to be, and if by some miracle you can get it to run, you will find out that Stronghold 3 brings less of the same, as they removed several cool features that were present in SH2. Support is nonexistent as developers did not deem it commercialy viable to keep patching this failure of a game and have decided long ago to focus on their next rip-off instead, so it's pretty much abandoned now. All the patches this game will ever receive have already been released and they weren't nearly enough to solve the major issues that still plague this title. FireFly will have a hard time convincing me to buy anything from them in the future. My advice? Go waste your money somewhere else. This is not the entertainment you're looking for.

												I preordered this game for $50 and to date that is the most I have ever been robbed by a game purchase. I remember watching and interview with the lead developer before the game came out where he expressed they'd learnt from all the fan feedback from stronghold 2... Apparently all they learnt from it was how to make a crappier game then their previous titles.Stonghold 2 is not generally considered the favourite in the series, but comparing 3 to 2... 2 wins. 3 has absolutely no redeeming gameplay features. Visually it looks better (excepting personal taste) but even the lauded features like wall destruction physics which are nice to look at in actual fact make the gameplay much worse. I have never before played a game where the walls are hands down the worst place to position your archers... They will recieve no extended range, no cover, and are more vulnurable as they will fall to their death when the enemies weakest units chips down your stone walls in seconds with their daggers. Pretty much the opposite of a castle ""sim"".The ecconomic sim is also suffered. Smaller maps and bigger building footprints means you can't construct a small castle town let alone a complex one. Clunkier interface, less building options, dumber AI (how do you even achieve that?) and all around less content makes this a step backwards from the series previous installments in pretty much ever single way except graphics rendering.If I could get my money back I would because I don't think I have ever been more disapointed in a studio... This is the game that was the straw that broke the camels back as far as my personal policy on preordering games goes. As it stands I wont even consider getting stronghold 4 until it's been out for a year, has 8 out of 10 reviews and I've had the opertunity to try a demo.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is sadly unfinished, and since there hasn't been any patches in over a year, I fear it never will be.  I constantly ran into missing features and game-breaking bugs, and after a couple days I gave up on it.Even buying this game when it was on sale last year, I felt this was a waste of money.  Sad to say that the original Stronghold & Crusader are still the best games of the series.Addendum: Every time I see this game on sale, I look to see if there's been any updates to the game, and unfortunately there isn't.  In fact, when I last looked the other day, I found a posting that said there was no more patches planned, and that they have effectively abandoned the game.  Considering that Steam has recently refunded a couple other incomplete games, I'm now considering asking Steam for a refund on this game.  I doubt anything will happen, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

												Guess there isn't much I can say on this game. I bought it when it first released, and it was in a pitiful state. Fast forward three years, and the game is still not in any better state. There are plenty of bugs, and terrible design choices that should have never made it into this game. Many features that were promised never made it into the final release of the game, with much more being cut for one reason or another. Overall, I would not recommend this game to anyone who loves this series, and to go back and play the Stronghold Collection that comes with Stronghold, Stronghold Crusader(extreme), Stronghold 2, and Stronghold Legends which are all far superior games to this pile of rubbish.

												Gave them a chance, and they messed it up.When I first heard of Stronghold 3 coming out, I was really excited being a veteran of the Stronghold series. Though, at launch the game was buggy beyond reason, and unplayable. Because of this I decided I would give the devs a chance, and wait it out in the hopes of them releasing a patch to sort out the rough edges.Almost 5 years on, and the game is still in the same state. I simply can't recommend this game, when Stronghold 2 is not only more fun, but also alot less buggy.Avoid this, and instead buy Stronghold: Legends or Stronghold 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hear thee, Hear thee my loyal knight. Never have I played a strategy game so boring and so mind numbingly dull. The graphics of ye game seems to have got worse compared to the last one, almost as bad as my 'Ye Old English speak.' I feel that cometh ye time when you have saved up enough money to go spending it so  frivolously, you should stay away from Stronghold 3, like ye old Witches house placed upon the hill.In short and in modern english it's nowhere near as good as the last one, which in my opinion was alright, but this is boring and unengaging. The combat is bad and so are the graphics in many ways. Just please don't waste your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the biggest letdowns of my life. I was looking forward to this because I am a big fan of the Stronghold franchise, and when I was led to believe that Firefly was finally going back to their roots and cutting the gimmicks, the reviews for this game begin to reel out and that was where my disappointment begun to happen. It's just so horribly put together compared to older Stronghold titles to the point where any longtime Stronghold fan would find it absolutely cringeworthy. There's also this issue where if you redirect a unit's goal location, they pause for a brief moment before continuing to the newly-directed location, no other Stronghold game does this and it's absolutely infuriating. It's a lot better now than it was at release, though. They managed to patch up a lot of problems, but the damage has already been done. It's been said that this game's bad release is due to Firefly Studios being forced to release before it was finished by their publisher. If you're new to the Stronghold franchise you'll probably find more enjoyment in this than I, otherwise just buy Stronghold Crusader HD on Steam, you'll get a much better experience.

												The soundtrack is fantastic, but other then that, there is nothing here that the older games didnt do better. Its impossible to discuss the gameplay when so much of it is buggy and broken. My favorite moment had to be when I ordered my archers to defend the walls, and when they attempted to climb the stairs to get to the top, they glitched straight through it, got trapped inside the wall, and remained useless for the rest of the mission. Seriously, the original Stronghold and Stronghold Crusaders are classics. There is no reason to play this when those exist. Props to whoever worked on the music though, it made my 3 hours of disappointment somewhat tolerable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The bugs are minimal now, but still present in many areas.  The campaign is relatively short and a little repetitive at times.  Most importantly there is no skirmish mode meaning that the game has little to no replayability.  Any of the previous stronghold games are leagues better than this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well I'm certainly glad I tried the game.. Now I can safely say: Don't buy this hunk of junk. Instead, go watch the 'Heroes' or 'Breaking Bad' series, potentially 'The Mentalist' and 'Supernatural' along with 'The Vikings' as well. It's FAR more worth your money and time (to clarify, as they are amazing series).Sadly, the Stronghold series has had a special place in my heart since day 1. I LOVED the first, the second just as much and Stronghold: Legends was one of my all time favourites for RTS (I know a lot didn't like the fantasy mix, but I enjoyed the slightly difference for once, of course the original was there should I get bored).Then they announced SH3: My life was almost complete.They released SH3: My life WAS complete.I played SH3: My life was thrown into a well with a giant slab of steel tied around my ankles...This game takes nothing from the previous ones that made them so good (other than the storyline, which personally was a little cheap as it's basically the same damn missions). The missions maps are horrific and restricting, the combat is god awful and nothing like the orginals when it comes to army management and the list goes on and on. I'm sure you can read other reviews and here the same story.Go look at Anno 2245, out soon and I CANNOT wait. I know it's SciFi and not medieval, but Anno 2070 was one of my favourites and I highly recommend that to any RTS fan. As for a modern 'SH3' but a good one: Sorry I don't know any at all for you. I've been looking for a while and sadly keep coming back to this one :(Happy gaming!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It took me a long time to finally beat this game, but I am proud to say I have done it. Stronghold 3 is an interesting addition to the series. It adds incredible depth into the story and lore of Stronghold series. If anyone has played Stronghold Kingdoms many of the ideas for how that game is played come from Stronghold 3. I personally think this game is a fun game with an incredible campaign. But in all honesty there are a lot of problems and I won't hesitate to list them all out for you. Military Campaign:Stronghold 3 starts off after Stronghold 1, essentially skipping what is the terrible tales of Stronghold 2. With improved voice acting and better cinematic (realizing that using in game graphics for cinematics was an awful idea - thanks Stronghold 2) Stronghold 3 creates a story which really revives the series. Set ten years in the future you play ""The Boy"", the main character of the original stronghold series. In this tale enemies attack the kingdom you worked so hard to restore pushing you out of the capital. You must recuperate and slowly retake your kingdom. To do this you fight off the offspring of The Rat, The Pig, and a new foe The Jackal. Throughout the story you figure out a much greater foe exists  The Wolf and he is back for vengeance. Economic Campaign:In the economic campaign you play Lady Catherine who is trying to rebuild the country, particularly the Abbey, after the war has ended. In this you must complete tests by meeting economic growth factors. The Economic Campaign shies away from military and allows you to play a game featured on running the day to day life of a castle. The Problems:What's wrong with this game? Well there is a lot that makes this game terrible in most people’s eyes. 1) There are lots of bugs; in fact I had to save about twenty times per map just because I didn't want to take the chance of my units getting stuck in walls or random places. On a few maps you only get a couple units and if one of them gets stuck it can be the difference between a victory and a defeat. 2) The units attack one unit before spreading to attack others. This means the first time your archers attack an enemy they all fire at the same enemy. The wasted attack results in a couple second delay which allows the enemy AI, who spreads their attacks, to hit all your untis. The end result is the computer has killed a bunch of your archers. 3) There is no Skirmish mode, they took it away again!!! I don't know why they keep doing it seeing as everybody wants it, but they do. 4) My game crashed every time I quit the game resulting in me having to sign out of Windows and sign back in. This can be very annoying and at one point caused my save to go corrupt (hence why I started saving about 20 times per match).5) You can only slow the game down to Normal speed, so no longer can you use the slow speed to establish yourself.6) The graphics are not that great, especially seeing as how this game is a more recent edition to the series.7) I could not play with duel monitors; every time I would try the game would lag beyond playability. Now some would say this is my computer, but seeing as I can play essentially every other game with second monitor up and watching a TV show I don't think it is my computer. 8) There is a building capacity; this really limits how you can play in some missions. Results:If you can get past all the deficits the game offers, and instead just enjoy the game for its story then it is a blast to play. I thought the campaign was amazingly well played out, and the story had me wondering constantly what was going to happen next. The dialogue before each mission was very well done, and if you already listened to the dialogue you could simply skip it. The gameplay is much better than Stronghold 2 and the units are much cleaner. The idea of auto-market functions is incredibly useful (you can make your market sell resources if you go over a certain amount). And incorporating the statues to generate honor is incredibly helpful as you don't need to waste space on banqueting goods.I recommend Stronghold 3, but only if you can get it for a good deal. Its not easy to look past all the problems with this game and still enjoy yourself, especially if you paid full price. Pros:+Amazing story with beautiful campaign+Added statues to generate honor instead of having to use banqueting goods+Market has auto-buy/auto-sell features+Trees do not disappear as quickly as in Stronghold 2.+Added nighttime battles. In a couple levels you must defend a castle at night, which requires you to use fire to light up areas of the map in order to see approaching enemies.Cons: -Lots of glitches, bugs, and errors.-Building cap-Poor unit AI-The enemy on the campaign isn't very bright and doesn't maneuver his units very often. -Lowest speed is normal speed-No skirmish mode-Doesn't function with dual monitors-THERE ARE NO BOATS, THE STEAM PICTURE DECIEVED ME!!!!!

												Hmm... where do I begin? I waited until this unreasonably low sale price to try out Stronghold 3. I have been a dedicated Stronghold fan since I discovered the first game, it was engaging and fun, Stronghold 2 added new features to managing a kingdom that were just downright FUN, it was almost like a good RTS/City management game, and I hoped they'd build off of that for Stronghold 3.Well, that lasted a full minute and a half.Not only did they strip the enjoyable parts of Stronghold 2 out of this game, they basically remade Stronghold 1 with more confusing divisions, no gameplay improvements, and similar if not the same unit dialogue.Even at $2.99 I'm struggling to justify the purchase, and it is heartbreaking to me. I LOVE this genre, I loved the older games, I wanted a game that built and gave me MORE of the in-depth stuff, and here I got a game that just... cops out.Even writing this review hurts.

												Negitive;This game is a complete combat overhaul away from being decent. It is NOT worth the steep price.It is also very frustrating to figure out since the tutorial does not even cover the MOST BASIC things, like unit stances and how to rotate placeable builings and camera controls. (Or anything at all really)I spent more time on google/youtube trying to figure out basic things. It took a really long time to get comfortable with the user interface. The honor system is simply dumb and not explained at all in-game.I have seen no map builer, this is something that is either missing or I just can't find it. This was one thing I expected to see in a castle builder game.The free-play is very limited and it seems to only give close to infinit building materials... So if you want to build a castle from basic starting goods, your forced to play the even more limited campaign missions.Somewhat positive;Still, I play the economic missions when I'm bored of other games.If you have a LOT of time and patients to figure stuff out, and don't expect much compared to the older, better stronghold games, it might be worth a try. But the price is very steep for what you get. Maybe if the price goes down?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game blindly, after having played SH2, and only 2, without reading any reviews. I just assumed this was gonna be as good, with better graphics and mechanics, and maybe even less annoying narration. What an utter disappointment, I can't stand to play it. Not after the precedent SH2 set for me. This is a big step in the wrong direction. Do not buy it, they couldn't give this one away.  Now my Steam says I've clocked in 38 hours on this game, personally I've only clocked in about 5 hours, my younger brother racking up the rest. No way I could bear 38 hours.

												Let me start by saying i've played all Stronghold games besides the new Crusader and I enjoyed all of them. I especially enjoyed Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Legends, but i can't say that about this one unfortunately... First, all troops walk which is extremely irritating, especially If my castle is under attack i expect my troops to move with some urgency. Second, they took out skirmish which i think was a mistake and very disappointing. Third, when you go to mount walls the cursor turns to a staircase and i cant tell where i'm clicking and it's kinda stupid, it was a pointless change and it was perfect before. There's no attack move so I have to order my troops to attack one target or they all just march into death if they come under attack. The AI seems a little stupid, my troops are in defensive mode and being shot and enemy troops are nearby but they don't retaliate, even in aggressive they didnt seem to do anything. I don't ever write reviews but I'm very disappointed because I love Stronghold but i dont understand why this turned out the way it did. I see a lot of great potential for the game. New structures, wooden towers, houses vary in size depending how close they are to the keep, certain new features i like but the features they for some reason took away or changed completely ruin it, it's like they crapped on that battle mechanics of the game. I honestly haven't played much but that's because i cant bring myself to enjoy the game because of these changes.  I don't understand why it's like this and i hope they fix it. I unfortunately don't recommend this game until they do something about it. ):			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I can't put my finger on it but something about the mechanics felt horribly off from the other games.I won't go into detail as there are far better reviews on this store page which I would end up repeating however I will say that I kept thinking ""all these reveiws are exaggerating and it can't be that bad"" but it really is that bad.

If you enjoy building detailed castles, this game is your choice, however, get it when it's on discount, because it's unfairly overpriced for the lackluster gameplay it has.

Unless you want to experience crashes, bugs, unbalanced gameplay and super wolves with opposable thumbs definietely avoid this one and possibly any future Stronghold titles.Oh boy did I learn my lesson. Thankyou Stonghold 3 for teaching me never EVER to preorder. I honestly don't think I can ever forgive FireFly studios for releasing a game in such a state.Plus the keyboard I got for preordering didn't even work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The other stronghold games are some of the most amazing things ive ever played, but this.... firefly gave up developement to a different studio and they do not know what they are doing.

												I do not understand the meaning of word ""Gold"" here; I suppose there must be some added features here, but I will never have the perseverance to see it - units stuck in random locations, building stopped working for no reasons... I suppose the game remained unfinished because some lack of funding? Then why spend resources adding additional features instead of correcting the bugs? Or is it simply a layer of gold paint to cover the eroded structure..I do not think developers are the ones to blame as they are simply tools that can be replace/rehired. I do not think it is the QA's fault either because there game has been out for a long time now and there is no need for QA to see the game is bugged. The company' management who release the game are the shortsighted ones that would sacrifice the reputation of a good series for some changes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												13 minutes in and I can already say I wouldn't recommend this game. I've played every Stronghold game, so I'm looking at SH3 in comparison to the other entries in the series.I went into the game expecting utter garbage based on the reviews I've seen. Was it? No, I don't think so. For starters, this is definitely the best looking game in the series. Unfortunately, a few things bother me too much to consider playing it over the other SH titles. FIrst of all, NO CUSTOM SKIRMISH. This means, you can only play missions they give you. Custom skirmishes are my favorite part of any SH game, so not including them here really cuts down on replayablity. Another issue is the troop movement speed. Troops don't run. They mosey into combat. This makes gameplay incredibly slow and anticlimactic, which is enough for me to not bother continuing with the game. Which sucks, the game does look nice (for a SH game) and I really enjoy how there is no grid-based building in this game. I could look past other various tiny glitches not worth complaining about, but the troop speed really kills this game for me. If they included custom skirmishes I may have been able to look past this, but not being a huge fan of Stronghold missions to begin with, this game sadly isn't worth it to me. Luckily, Stronghold Crusader 2 fixed those issues, so at least Firefly learned from their mistake!EDIT: 99% of my time in game was idling for card drops, I didn't continue to play it for 4 hours.

												I am a huge Stronghold-Fan. Completed all the campaigns in S-1, 2 , Crusader, Legends and spend HOURS upon HOURS playing Stronghold because I just love the game mechanics and the castel building.But Stronghold 3...is a simple DISGRACE for the Series.1. You get little to no Introduktion to the changed game mechanics, and Tutorials given are soooooo boring and tiresome (unlike in Stronghold 2 where they were good!!!!) 2. Building Towers and Walls has become super annoying, with Units running up stairs and bugging through the walls, Defense - Deathtraps being massively overpowered with the ballista having an overpowered shooting range ( try Missions 7 - The Sultan - on hard and you will understand, if you happened to have bought this ***** game), 3. Lack of love for NPCs they keep saying the same stuff, no difference at all.4. Multiplayer doesnt work.I really do not reccomend this game, too many bugs making it hard to be at all enjoyable.

												SH2 made me suspicious, but somehow they got away with all the ""we were noobs in doing 3D"" crap. And SH2 also  had some nice additions in the Castle-Sim part. But this.... I can't believe they build this up on SH2. More likely on a crippled early-alpha development branch of SH2.It's crap in it's purest form. And if you are in any way interested in gamedesign, I highly recommend buying it for 1-2 € for educational purposes. Literally everything was done wrong in this game (compared to SH1, Crusader and SH2).Don't judge the developers as if there were no predecessors of this game. They had something functional on the table and they totally destroyed it. They took every single system (economy/walling/troop management) and flushed it down the toilet to replace it with something a mentally handycapped, blind ape coded. (Fu for using poor animals as cheap labour, btw.)Don't be mislead by my playtime. I tried to play the game for 1-2 hours at first. The rest of the time is checking after each patch. There are things you don't have to play through to judge it reasonably. There is nothing they could hide in the campaign what would save their game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I took a chance with my four dollars plus change and got it.  Glad I did.  In spite of all the hate that has been heaped on this game, it has a certain appeal.  That is, if you like town/castle building, hoarding resources, ordering peasants around, and seeing your enemies crushed and driven before you; while listening to the lamentation of their women.  Soundtrack is fitting for a feudal lord, but John Barley Corn tends to play a tad too often, and the lyrics remind me of brave Sir Robin.  Graphically, the landscapes are rendered like impressionistic oil paintings, which is fitting for this genre, although not for this time period.  Also, if you've got a hankering for medieval architecture, you'll be treated to variety of historically accurate building styles; a few have given me ideas for building defenses in other games like 7 Days to Die.  The one thorn in my crown over this game is multi-player because I can never connect.  However, for the sale price the single player modes are worth it, and real feudal lords didn't have an internet for their multi-player games either.  I give it two forks up!  (Note: One of the forks is somewhat bent from jamming it in my ethernet port while trying to get multi-player to work.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Right, Stronghold 3, definitely a major let down on release and still sucks now. There are still a good amount of bugs, still runs slow, and unless you somehow find someone to play online with you will get about 5 hours of gameplay before never playing again. The game rarely gets updated and when it does its nothing major, maybe a few bug fixes or community made maps. Overall i give it a 6 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stronghold 3 may look like a medieval fortress simulator where feudal armies throw themselves against vast layers of fortifications with thick walls and towers that look as if they reach the skies. This is unfortunately only true if you play one of the scenarios that feature already constructed fortifications. Throughout the rest of the game you will never get to build anything more than a few haphazardly placed walls and the occasional watch tower.The problem with Stronghold 3 is it's speed. Everything moves at a dreadfully slow pace. Gathering resources and building structures seem to take forever and most of the game seems to take place without any interaction from you, simply waiting for something to happen. The extremely tiny maps doesn't help either, making every town feel cramped.You play as a feudal lord starting every map with your, very small, castle and some starting peasants. As you build resource gathering structures or conscript soldiers those peasants get used up and to attract more you need to provide them with adequate housing, food and not as much plague as you would like to inflict upon the lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.As your town grows you start to get involved in the more costly resources as well as the more complicated resource chains letting you equip your army better and feed your populace more sufficiently. Along the way and depending on the scenario or campaign mission you're on you might face the additional threat of invading armies or super aggressive wolves that'll kill your poor defenseless peasants and put a stop to production until you can attract some more.The problem with economic and city-building aspects of the game is as mentioned before, the speed. Everything happens at a snail's pace. You place your initial resource gathering buildings, got get a cup of coffee, come back and place the another resource gather. You repeat this process until you get enough of an income to start placing the more advanced resource harvesters as well as building the beginnings of an army and then you go get a cup of coffee and come back when you've got enough resources to place another advanced harvester or recruit another soldier. You spend more time waiting than actually playing the game and that is a serious design flaw.I am normally all for slow paced intelligent games but this is just ridiculous and the slow speed adds nothing to the game's depth.The military aspects of the game is predictably simple. You harvest resources to construct weapons and then use those weapons to conscript your peasants into military service as a variety of different types of soldiers. The actual combat however pretty much boils down to box selecting your army and clicking attack on the enemy army, hoping you got the right numbers and combination of troops.Graphically there is nothing wrong with the game but not much right either. It neither adds nor detracts much from the experience. The sounds are comfortably boring although the soundtrack does feature some neat flute music that fits the genre very nicely.All in all Stronghold suffers from two serious design flaws that takes it from being a great idea to a bad game. The slow speed makes the game boring and any sense of accomplishment you get from finally getting a proper economy working is instantly removed when a new map starts and you are thrown back to square one having to rebuild. The lack of proper fortress building however is what truly kills it for me. You will never come to a point in the game where building those mighty fortifications that is the game's trademark becomes natural. It takes far too long to get there and once you do you could probably have won the map three times over.Stick to the older titles in the series or looks elsewhere, this is not a game that delivers what it promised.

												Okay so game is actually pretty good, I liked graphics, art, enjoyed, but here is where they lost me personally. I really loved stronghold 2 in my oppinion it is the best game of all the strongholds I have played. The story line in stronghold 3 is reallly crappy.. like seriously. There is no single  mission where you get to just build and kill enemies you always have to defeat or defend your self on time. I hate that. Also there is no unique story line characters like there was in stronghold 2 man I missed those guys!! that story line really made you believe you are actually doing something while this game you just kill everyone in time.. basically 95% of the missions are based with time so and really cheap I HATE IT. In my oppinion they could of redo the Stronghold 2, update the graphics, include more things like co up, players vs pc etc. Extend the great story line, include more stuff you can build and do basically more interaction. Simpply add more stuff to it and omg I would buy that game for my self and my other 10 friends right away. Now they messed it up.  All there is nice graphics, but that's about it.  So not worth it.

Broken collision leading to infuriating build methods and even more broken gameplay. Texture popping on walls. Texture mismatching on terrain. Certain mechanics which means the AI can instantly win. Multiple scenarios where by the best alternative is to just restart the level ( which is also infuriating ). I understand why this game has this rating... And I have to agree... For £23.99 Jesus thats crazy... not at that price... This game is essentially an early access quality abandoned project. That is what you are buying at a premium price. You have been warned.

												This game is an absolute piece of garbage. Buggy beyond belief, no kingmaker/skirmish modes, there are only 6 poorly made maps to choose from in free build mode and the campaign is again marred by bugs. Don't waste a penny on this garbage. Do yourselves a favor and play Stronghold 1 and 2 because this game is utter trash. I actually spent 3 hours making my epic city and then I saved it. When I reloaded my save it didn't save my 3 hour progress and put me back with my tiny little town. The ai also struggles to move about within castle walls and they tend to get stuck WITHIN the walls making defense impossible. And it removed tons of features from Stronghold 1 and 2. And the fact that you cannot upgrade your keep and that you can no longer fight within buildings is a great way to kill immersion. Overall, it's a terrible game and as a long time Stronghold fan and player, I say to please avoid this game like you would the plague.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those games that didn't exceed the ones before it. Stronghold holds a very special place in gaming as it holds castle building, fighting and economics in equel amounts. While the 3D graphics are nice, they ultimatly end up hindering you when placing objects. Because these objects have such big 'footprints' it means building can become a pain when everything is forced to be spaced out. Worse yet, you can't connect walls to create interesting shapes. You basically can make squares- and that's it. The economics don't seem a lot different than titles before it and the combat which you'd assume would be improved- also seems to be the same level of strategy. It's a very chill- laid back type of RTS in that sense. Even though it's dated, I'd prefer to play Stronghold Crusader, at least there's a lot of creative control there.+3D Graphics+Soundtrack-Meh Combat-Castle Building-It's 3D, but the game is still very aged feeling.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I still can't stress enough that this game is garbage, there's no fun here. To add on i've only played 4.8 hrs because it's  SOOOO BAD! BTW it took about 5 mins to review that's how bad it is!

But, that may have been how the purchasers of Stronghold 2 received that game as well.  SKIP THIS GAME.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I only find it fair to compare this game to it's predecessor, Stronghold 2. When I played Stronghold 2 after playing Stronghold: Crusaders, it was a step forward in graphics and it seemed to add a lot of features; although, even then, I and I believe many others found it greatly lacking in depth and entertainment value. With this game, I am completely let down. I chose to buy it because I misplaced my copy of Stronghold 2 and couldn't play it, so I figured the sequel will have improved on it and would be a better choice, but I was wrong. The maps are smaller, how can that happen? The graphics are really no more improved at all. And the gameplay is stagnant, boring, no matter what mode you do, even if all you do is seiges. It really feels almost like an unfinished expansion to Stronghold 2 that doesn't really add anything. Not recommended; I'd rather go back to the older versions or go forward to the remake of Crusader for a try at this franchise again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I barely give any negative reviews cause i believe that most games deserve a fair chance. I really wanted to get this game on day 1, though i had finaly got it on sale for less than a euro. While i liked the more defensive/small map concept, the washed out colors, voice acting, music and all the small addons here and there, the ai is brain dead, making battles almost unplayable. Of course there's no rts with no ai issues, but here you deal with massive lack of basic pathfinding, collision problems (soldiers stuck into the bridge) resulting in searching for a loophole in order to finish the map. If you get it on sale it might offer you some hours of enjoyment, though some frustration too.4.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Grade 4/10Stronghold series has been in deep trouble and continues to do so. That is very sad thing, because I really liked the original stronghold games. Buy either original Stronghold or Stronghold Crusader or wait and hope that the Stronghold Crusader 2 will be better.Full review:The developers of Stronghold 3 said that they attempted to return back to the roots of original Stronghold games after that Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Legends had been disappointments. Personally I don't see that much resemblance between original Stronghold games and Stronghold 3. This might not have been the problem, because this series might require refreshing instead of going back to roots. Whatever the developers tried to do, the game is a failure. This result was heavily affected by the fact that the publisher pushed the game to markets before it was ready. Now the game doesn't have any game braking bugs anymore but some annoying bugs still exist and the gameplay just isn't nearly as good as it should be.I'll start with the gameplay. The gamplay is too slow. The gameplay in the actual Stronghold games has always been slower than in the Crusader versions to place more value on the economy but in this game the gameplay is just too slow. The units are too slow and also the economy is also extremely slow. Even new citizens spawn too slowly. The result of this is that the army sizes are extremely low as well as the size of the castle.Next i'll talk more specifically about the economy. The economy in this game seems to be very difficult to manage. It seems like that no matter the player does, the player is all the time on the edge of collapse of the economy even if the enemies don't attack you castle. Even worse is how popularity is calculated. Before this game the popularity was very stable once the most basic needs of the citisens were secured. In Stronghold Crusader 3 however the popularity changes all the time because a) the economy is all the time on the edge of collapseb) amount of population has drastic effect on popularityc) Popularity is always going up or down unlike in previous game in which it was easy to have stable popularity.The result of both economy and popularity being at the edge of collapse is that the player uses almost all the time micromanaging these things leaving no time to build the defenses or care about the army in a game in which half of the game should be doing these two things.Third main problem in this game is the castle building. The building of walls and towers was changed dramatically for this game, but unfortunately the new system is total disaster. It is difficult to use and some of the difficulty might actually be caused by bugs. In a game, where economy is requiring your constant micromanaging and enemies attack every now and then a difficult to use waal bulding system is huge problem. The new system also prevents the creation of imaginative castles. On top of this the player is unable to create moats around his castle inexcept in the scenario builder. The developers have admitted their mistake and the building of walls and towers will be reverted to how it was before for Stronghold Crusader 2.Fourth main problem is the combat. The combat is very slow and units under melee attack are very unresponsive. This makes makes usage of fast troops pointless. In previous games I preferred to have mixed army (because different units had their own strenghts), but in this game only useful troops are swordmen and crossbowmen. Exception being knights that are needed to destroy siege engines.To summarise the gameplay part: Stronghold crusader is a game combining medieval combat, castle building and economy and it fails in all these aspects.Last thing that I would like to mention are graphics. The graphics of this game are awful. Both the soldiers and buildings are are very difficult to distinguish from each other and I also dislike the chosen artistic style. If the developers of this game can't create clear and beutiful 3D objects they should revert back to 2.5D graphics that was used in original stronhold game because that game had very beautiful and clear graphics.

												I had high hopes for Stronghold 3. I played the previous stronghold 2 and stronghold legends which were both entertaining games. Kingmaker and skirmish modes were what made the game, the cheesy campaigns were alright but i just loved building my own castle and defending against waves of (average) AI controlled units. I had hopes that Stronghold 3 would provide great graphics, difficult to beat AI and a new found love for the series. If you loved the previous installments for the series i wouldnt spend the money for this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was a big fan of Stronghold 2 so I'm disappointed with Stronghold 3. To give an example of a recent frustration: It feels like the range on enemies is far greater than the range of my own units. I put 100 archers within 10m of an enemy tower. Did a single unit fire upwards? Of course not. Capapults have to be within 10m to fire at anything, which is stupid - a catapult has a longer range than 10m! Enemy archers on the ground will fire at my archers on the ground and mine won't fire back because the enemy's range is greater. The game is frustrating, annoying and a chore. Population recovers so slowly, you fail an assault on an enemy and have to wait 20 minutes before you've re-recruited another one. And you bet that one will be wiped out just as easily as the first because enemies outrange you and if they're on towers, you have to throw 10x their numbers at them to get through. The game feels unbalanced and unfair to the player.			",50,3,2,8,13,1,13

												If you have played the original Stronghold you might have liked it to bits, just as I did (and still do). That is why I bought this game (I waited to buy it at 5€, since Stronghold 2 was not a very good game). What a mistake... Do not let nostalgia make you buy this game, it will only dissapoint.The AI is absolutely stupid. Your troups are as good as helpless if you don't guide them by hand. Archers get stuck on walls and stairs for no reason. Maps are tiny. You have none of the freedom you had in the original when building walls and fortifications. The wall building tool is very difficult to work with and will force you to build some awkward looking structures out of pure despair. The campaign story is dull and uninspired. Sound and music have been blindly copied from the previous games. The new fighting by night feature adds nothing but frustration. Overall this game gives the impression that the developers were just lazy.In short: steer clear of this game. It was not even worth the 5€ I paid for it.Be wary of future titles made by this developer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been stalking this game on youtube only to find it on sale on Steam. So of course I thought, oh geez this is going to be so much fun. It's anything but fun. I've always been a huge fan of RTS games and I've been looking to fill the hole where Age of Empires used to be. This most definitely is not that game. Not only do the mechanics make very little to no sense (posting archers on walls has no advantages at all), but the game play is just very crude and unbalanced. This was my first taste of Stronghold and I can safely say I won't even bother installing the other versions. Biggest gaming let down ever and I played Destiny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought the Stronghold pack for 2 and saw 3 on the list. So I decided to install it and play since I never got to when I had the disk version as my old computer was crap and the disk went missing. Was shocked to see there was no skirmish/kingsmaker mode. Said arlight lets jump into the military campaign. Cared nothing for the story, but dear god was the unit mechanics horrible. The enemy archers had 3 times the range of my archers. Furthermore whenever I would order my archers to attack they run up into melee range and start shooting. Melee units seem to have an extremely short agro range even with agressive stance, and they are pretty slow in this game( Even some of the light infantry such as Men-At-Arms are very slow). There are quite a bit of bugs like units standing on invisible walls after the walls are destroyed. The animations are so choppy for melee units. Altought 360 building rotation was nice, the building placement (especially for castle walls, towers, and stairs) are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Castle gates don't make sense to me in this game. Sometimes they work and open for your units, other times they close on you and won't open. To make matters worst, your units can get stuck on buildings or the terrain and become immobile. Formations seem to give little benifit now, For example in earlier games column formation would allow your units to move faster, but now it doesn't seem to do anything or is so small its unnoticable. missile units have lost alot of value as you can't even target properly with them without getting them into melee range. This game was a major disappointment and like others have stated, feels as if it was still undevelopement. 4.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This doesn't hold a candle to the game to its predecessor, Stronghold 2.  It’s sad how many features were abandoned when they made 3 even with the additional content made available.  Stronghold 3 lacks a good tutorial and many castle pieces present in Stronghold 2.  You lose the escape door, different castle wall thicknesses, and much of the simplicity that made Stronghold 2 such a great game to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was a BIG MISTAKE buying this game... I don't even know where to start with this....I've read the comments byt I said what the hell , if it s at least a decent castle builder It ll make the money worth it but nope... the buikding itself well...it s not THAT bad... I mean you have some options for the walls etc but personally i expected more . Now with SOME of the bad stuff... the combat sistem is VERY VERY VEERY BAD , firstly because most of units can t fricking run and are so daamn slow it makes the battles just aweful (i understand that like a fully armoured knight can t run but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ what about the pikemen or just the ordinary guys with a fork , why on earth can t they move faster ? ) Besides that the AI is horible and the units even if they are put on agresive mode they don t attack most of the times if you don t tell them and if you get them to attack you wouldn t understand what on earth is happening there . Also , in what univers can a monk armed with a stick destroy a friking 10m thick wall...NOW COME ON! ALSO the missions SUCK♥♥♥♥♥and are vrry badly explained and can get boring a lot. And last but not least the amount of food that you need in order to feed the population is too high and makes the game even more boring .I expected this to be an awesome castle defence builder with at least some decent fighting and also to keep me engaged in fun medieval city builder , instead I got a average to poor castle builder , with horible unplayable fighting and mostly boring city builder(it can be fun at times but it doesn t last much) DOES NOT deserve its money and DO NOT BUY unless you can get it for like 5€			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not to belabor (good word, write that down) a point, but this is a hunk of sh!t. The graphics look to be from 2005, not 2011. The music is good. The tutorial is 3 min and basically shows you nothing of any systems or menus or hotkeys/orders of the game. Funny after all their patching and complaints of terrible unhelpful and uninformative tutorial, they didn't expand on it. The combat is shotty, as you can't attack an area, just click on one guy. Sometimes you don't auto attack enemies in the area. Clicking on places to go is finnicky and doesn't work half the time. The enemies have no health bars so you can't tell how you are doing in a fight. For some reason your guys walk super slowly anywhere you order them, as apparently people didn't know about running/jogging in the medieval times. There is no seemingly obvious way to speed time or things up to not make you have to sit there forever. Multiplayer is dead. I wasn't a fan of strategy/sim games to begin with, and this didn't help in making them more interesting. Didnt' feel like waiting around for the other terrible features that the long fans of the series have mentioned previously. Waste of time/10, as well as 4/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Given to me as a gift, I tried liking this game a few times. First time it wasn't so friendly to my laptop at the time, so I put it away for a few years. Had a new laptop, was in the mood for an RTS, so I gave it a try.One of the things that drew me to Stronghold was its pacing. I don't play many RTSes because I dislike being rushed by them. I like slow-paced civbuilders. Stronghold isn't quite that, but its economic campaign allowed me to focus on aspects of managing a base beyond ""you are going to be murdered in the next ten minutes, make that not happen.""However, I've ultimately decided I can't stand the game because it's designed in such a way that your subjects are BREATHTAKINGLY stupid. Soldiers that can't even manage basic self-preservation without explicit orders, peasants who will let their house burn down when there's a well literally in their front yard, and farmers who will bring their wheat two miles uphill to the storehouse rather than the mill right next to their field, where it was going anyway.All of these (except for the soldiers, no excuse there when they're set to aggressive stance), have their roots in the game mechanics. But intentionally designed stupid is still stupid. I'm not going to waste any more time with this and neither should you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Capturing my imagination, love for games, and constant eyes on my PC screen with the first Stronghold.  However, the 3rd has lost it all.  Some of the features we saw in the first 2 are no longer there, as well as some buildings.  It seems that the creators of stronghold 3 kept saying to themselves, ""that will do.""  Instead of pushing harder to create a game that blows the minds of players. It feels that they have gone the quick and easy approach of get it done and get it out there.  That said, I still wish to continue playing, but the constant crash between missions.  The bugs I have encountered such as peasants standing in one place or not pursing empty jobs in free build.  The map after loading is a shambles with half a building inside a piece of land or under water.  I was really rooting for this game during my install, but until I can figure out these bugs and the creators come up with patches to enhance the experience of the game, it seems it will be uninstalled.There is one thing I liked, which was the hovel (housing).  It has more variety depending on how close they are place to your lords castle. But that is really much it.So is it worth buying? Yes and no.  No for its faults.  Yes, so you can potentially experience what I am experiencing playing this game and write to Firefly Studios and say, ""WTF.""			",38,2,0,3,11,0,6

												I played the first stronghold game and aside from better graphics, the game is still the clumsey beast I knew back then.  There really isn't much to see here, you play one game their almost the same. I was bored within half an hour of playing, it was really lacking.  I don't think I'm going to bother with this franchise anymore. It just lacks the depth of other games of the genre.  Plus the maps feel small and the building big... Though they have made castle wall building a little easier, its still crzy at times. You really won't be able to do much more then basics half the time.I'd go for the series ""The Settlers"" over ""Stronghold"" any day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While Stronghold 3 is the worst received entry into the franchise to date, don't let the negative reviews stop you from picking it up for under $5 on sale and enjoying the second chapter of a story started over 10 years previous with the original Stronghold.I personally find the game frustrating and enjoyable in equal parts, yes, there are bugs in the game which can make you want to pull your hair out at times, the difficulty of some missions is not for the faint of heart and on some level appeals to the inner masochist. This is a game you must play for yourself to truly appreciate the ambitions never fully realized due to it's broken state at release, cry the beloved castle. The Good:+ The price, on sale I got it for less than $5+ The graphics, I personally love the weathered impressionist atmosphere of the game world+ The single player campaigns by themselves are lengthy enough to keep you occupied for a dozen hours or more + Includes map editor for you to create your own eyecandy scenarios or MP skirmish maps+ The removal of the grid means building placement looks more natural, good for those who love eyecandy+ Great flexibility in designing the medieval castle of your dreamsThe Bad: - The dynamic castle design (post grid) was never fully completed and you'll have units getting stuck in the walls which is annoying as hell- The story is told through the use of hand drawn illustrations, if they had been full color the presentation would have been superb. As is, the black and white charcoal smudges feel somewhat unfinished.- The leaderboard for mission scores is offline with little likelihood of being restored- Peasants can get stuck in buildings- Killing pits are all but invisible, good luck deleting them if you want to put another building in your minefield. - The game is prone to unpredictable crashes, sometimes when you are creating a game save. After experiencing first hand the problems with this game I can understand why players who bought this game full price are still seething. That said, I do recommend picking this game up on sale if you've played and enjoyed Stronghold 2 or even if only to understand why the release was such a disaster.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ive played the stronghold games since a little after stronghold 1 was released. this game is horrendous, removal of the skirmish mode and the much more restrictive building limit as opposed to previous games really kills the fun and replay value. While this game looks nice? What does it actually hold above stronghold 2? or stronghold legends? What has been upgraded apart from graphics? I've thought long and hard about it and it seems that there is very little, if anything that is superior as opposed to previous titles. Save your money. ",160,12,1,31,14,1,21

												Well, at least you dont have to add stairs on wall part by part. :')Anyway, saw many bad reviews on this game, so I decided to give it a shot and here is my review >>So, let's start with cons first:There are slight problems with building placements, you can't place on some part of the terrain. + buildings for wood and meat were small, but now they are wood and pig farms, which means it's bigger, you can't stack millions woodcutters on one place and enjoy in wood rain.Peasant houses are in my opinion really bad, cause you will eventually have really big population (soldiers and workers) and you can only get max (10 people per house) when you build near castle, few units further, number of available peasants will decrease, same as cost and size of house. You don't want to place 50 houses for 50 soldiers.Next one is about gathering stuff, in good known Stronghold Crusader, there was wood by wood, stone by stone, apple by apple. Here i think it's a bit more than that, maybe it's better but i don't like it much.Game is crashing, but not too often.Now there are pros:Stockpile with unlimited storage, yes, thank god!!As i said before, you get a bit more resources from single unit. (can be stored in pros and cons together)You can set any daytime, yes, you can even play at night (still, when you click on peasant you will hear ""morning, your lordship""Yes, you still can hear ""Morning, your lordship!"" ""Can't target him sir!""You can play various scenarios (historical sieges), and on community maps (although there is only 3)It's pretty and everyone who love Stronghold will like this.nahnufihemathick/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a huge fan of the Stronghold franchise, but I have to say that this one didn't really impress me, except the graphics and campaign modes. They never added a skirmish mode (which dosen't make sense in my opinion) so if your looking to play the campaign modes and multiplayer, this is the game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stronghold 3 is NOT a terrible game, but neither is it a great game. Comparing it to it's predecessors, Stronghold, SH 2, SH Crusader, it has a feel of being half finished in the most important areas. Walls, buildings, towers, traps, all are hard to place how you want them. The free build maps are only a small handful of pre-made areas, no custom map making. The main story continues from Stronghold 1, and it's decent enough to finish, though the ending is really dissapointing! The graphics are better, and they added a few awesome songs to the soundtrack, but they aren't enough to have you keep playing more than a few hours at most. If you played the first games, I don't reccomend playing this one. If this is your first, give it a try and see if you like the concept of castle simulation; if you do, get the original Stronghold and SH Crusader.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunately, this game adds nothing to the Stronghold series. It even uses the same old voices and same music from previous versions. The gameplay is a direct copy of the original Stronghold economy, and combat has not seen any significant improvements. The graphics are not impressive for a recently released game such as this, and the GUI leaves a lot to be desired. The story is unimanigative, and the missions are practically copied from the first Stronghold. The cutscenes are atrocious; simple black-white drawings with a voice-over, some sound effects and blood splatter. The weather and day-night cycles had almost no effect on gameplay at all.If you have never played Stronghold before, this will no doubt hold some entertainment value. But if you've played the previous iterations of this game, you're just getting more of the same old thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has many problems compared to LITERALLY every other stronghold.(by that I mean yes I have played EVERY single stronghold game since the start. this is just my first on steam.) It also has many good things. In the end I can not recommend this due to its single biggest flaw. Lack of skirmish mode that all the Stronghold games before it(kingdoms excluded). That single flaw is enough for me to say thumbs down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												IMPORTANT: dont get confused by the 0/0hours played, i deleted the game before writing the rewiev. I'd finish it completly.I really waited long for this game and expected a lot of it because i'd love the second part. If you dont have much time oir just dont like to read long rewies skip this because it will get longer. Well i dont know where to start with the negative points so i start with the few good points:The Graphics are really really good and i do like them also the soundtracks are great but thats it!It shocked me with alot of unrealistic facts, beeings and a so stupid programmed unit controlling, that every crusade is a torture for the player.First, there is no ballistic trajectory. Arrows, spears (yes they can be thrown in this game but almost as far as an archer can shoot next negative point) stones from catapults etc. are just flying in a straight direction to the target. Doesent matter if there is a ground wave, bigger rock or something else in their way. They flew just through it.Next point: There are placable traps on your walls now like a stack of logs wich incinerate themselvs and rolling in directon of your enemys. Good idea bad performence. EVERY unit wich just touching it - dies. A person who didnt played this will now think:,, bro that are burning, rolling logs of course they die!'' Thats right but the main problem here is: They die even whenn the logs stopped moving! I saw 120 units of peasents (its a fighting unit in part three) dieing because they ran into burning logs wich stopped moving in a straight line. Lemmings would be proud of em. Next Point: One of the main reasons i bought this game was the Sandbox mode and skirmish against KI- Players. All i got was a big NOPE! in my face. There is none. No Sandbox neither a skirmish mode! only the campaing can be played great who didnt like this? Thats really sad because the sandbox mode was one of the best things in part two and i've been really looking forward to play it in good graphics.If i had knew all these things before, i wouldn't bought it and thats why i dont recommend it. To save all of you who thinks this game includes the best parts of Stronghold 2 trust me: It doesent!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's really not a bad game. I really love how you can put your buildings basically anywhere. The graphics are pretty good and the lighting is amazing (in my book.) If this game didn't have the title ""Stronghold"" it wouldn't have that bad of reviews. Though, since this is a Stronghold game, the thing that I miss is the villagers. They were so voiced and actually commented on things you did, now this game does too, but I click on a villager like 10 times and he still says, ""Morning your lordship."" I even had a villager say one time that he was eating so much that he was getting fat.  Since when did people back then care about getting fat? lol	 I don't know, it just feels like they don't really appreciate what I'm doing for them.Pros:GraphicsLightingBuildingWallsCons:PriceRIP Villagers			",51,13,0,14,12,0,1

												The game runs great and captures alot of what the earlier games did well with not much newly added. The graphics in this game are outstanding, and show how dated the older games in the series really are. However the detail and design are just about the only things this entry does right. The sheer lack of things to do makes Stronghold 3 fall far short of its predecessors. With only 2 campaigns, economic, and military and a few historical seiges the game becomes boring so quickly. There is no linked trail or custom matches, so there is little to no replayability. Even if you buy it on sale, as I did for $10, the game is hardly worth it.But a least it looks pretty!

												It seems Firefly has forgotten completely what made Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader great games. No skirmish, no map editor, and the story looks as if it was thrown together last minute. They literally used uncoloured concept drawings with voice over to do the story. Reused one or two of them as well. A few times!The building placement grid is gone, and the game seems even more sluggish then Stronghold 2. As well, form what I see, there is no smooth transition for the day/night lighting they focused -so much- on. “It is a sunny day ma'lord” and with that, bam, light.I am embarrassed I just paid 50 bucks for this.

												Unless you are a true die-hard fan of the stronghold series, you're not going to like this game. Even if you are, you're going to severely disappointed. Another game that just fails to live up to its predecessors in every way. Building placement is clunky, unit pathfinding is near broken, Countless bugs litter the game and while it is playable (at least for me, some still seem to struggle) It requires a far beefier pc than should be necessary. Many features are from previous games are just downright missing, others seem half implemented. About the only thing the game has going for it... well it's kinda pretty, and the music isn't half-bad. But who wants to pay $30 for something that is at best an ambient screensaver? The historical sieges can be a little fun but they are the only mode really worth playing. Hate to say it but the reviews are bad for a reason. If you MUST try it make sure you pick it up heavily discounted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well...I had to finish the game to make a review, both economic and military campaign, took me just 15 hours. Nothing in the game is what it used to be , some changes that were made dont even make sense.  Here it goes:The campaign itself is continuing after 2001's Stronghold storyline, it consists of around 18 missions, some are fun and most are not. I wont spoil the ending, but my *!*^$^ng jaw dropped after seeing how it ended, i sat there for 5 minutes in disbelief, over how pointless playing the campaign actually was.There is no skirmish, which used to be the CORE of what made this game fun. Some buildings are too large, and the maps are too small and have VISIBLE borders that look like naked flat stone (???). This above is covering around 50% of what is actually wrong, there are many small details missing and so many frustrations, this game couldn't have been  a success anyway. For it to be good it would need its entire engine remade, with modern PC's and oldschool game mechanics in mind. I honestly wouldnt even mind them making a Stronghold 4 in 2D as long as it was FUN , which this game was not. I bought it for 2$ and i guess for that price its worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dont buy it. Game play is dull and there is no skirmish mode.It needs a powerful graphics card and the graphics are not that good. Loved the earlier strongholds and love strong hold crusader II which came after this. Save your money and skip past this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I""m glad I bought this game on 85% off special because it is one of the worst ****ing games I've ever wasted a few hours on. The combat is buggy to the extreme, the game play is boring, the music and AI voicing is tedious - in all, this game has absolutely zero redeeming features.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not buy this at any price.  I got it for $7.50 a good year after it was released, after all the patches and fixes.  There AI pathing is insanly bad, army guys constantly get stuck or trapped.  The AI cheats like crazy, there is no skirmish mode (just a sandbox, but no opponets), the scenerios are very contrived and simply lame.  I loved the original stronghold, but each iteration seems to get worse somehow.  This latest release is the worst, yes even wrose than thier last release.			",173,37,0,73,40,0,75

												This game looks amazing. It is far from it. I loved the skirmish mode in the previous installments in the series where you could build your kingdom and fight other people. It is not the same in Stronghold 3. They have taken that feature out and replaced it with ""Free Build"" which is absolutely pointless. It only lets you build a kingdom, thats it! They have stopped updating this game. The multiplayer mode has never worked for me. Unless you want to play story mode or it is on a huge sale, please do not buy this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to say, being a follower of the game since the beginning, i'm pretty let down by this game. No proper skirmish mode (which is all i played) and the online is kinda sad. Stronghold 2 was great, and i was really hoping that they would have expanded on that. But the simple change of a few buildings and a slightly different HUD isnt exactly an upgrade. Not to mention the graphics are more of a downgrade than anything else. Over all, i'm glad i got this game on sale and not at full price.			",84,20,6,16,26,1,21

												I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state.  Its not very well thought out and is full of bugs.  Maybe in 2 or 3 months it'll be in a better state.Also, the wolves can fly right up your towers and eat your archers.  These are friggen giant harrier wolves with no mercy or care of the laws of physics.They eat physics for breakfast and tower archers for lunch.  I suspect they also eat my mill workers for dinner as my mill workers certainly don't seem to be producing any flour for bread...			",366,79,4,54,31,5,84

												Do you know what my advisor said to me the other day? “Sire, it looks like Stronghold 2, smells like Stronghold 2, tastes like Stronghold 2… Good thing we didn’t pay retail.” I do love the Stronghold series, but Stronghold 3 is simply an abysmal failure.In terms of game play, aesthetics and overall feel, I get the impression that someone just took Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Legends, put it in a blender and hit puree. That could have been a tasty beverage, but someone got the bright idea to strain out all of the detailed play mechanics and structures from Stronghold 2 and throw them away. Why?!Stronghold 2 was an awesome game, BECAUSE you had so many management options and detailed buildings! There were geese and eels in a pond, which was my personal favorite structure, followed closely by the royal treasury. There were lots of detailed buttons and menus when you clicked on structures…And while we’re on the subject, since everything in Stronghold 3 feels repurposed, what was so hard about carrying over all of the peasant dialog from the other games in the series!?! What fun is it to be lord of the castle if you can’t click on your peasants and listen to their simple babble? How are criminals supposed to steal from my granary if there ARE NO criminals!? Done away with gong pits? Madness I tell you!All of that is gone in Stronghold 3… But at least there’s a day / night slider and some weather options in free build… Oh, and you can free rotate buildings… But the walls don’t connect to my castle anymore either… Win some, lose allot? As we’ve heard so many times before: “People are leaving the castle.”			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has caused any computer ive ever installed it on to crash (since it first released (maybe 3 or 4 different occurences)...coincidence?) Its also sub-par in comparison to its predecessors, especially the original and crusader which is what I'd suggest you play if you havent. My biggest problem with this game is the heresy they call improvement, on what is one of the best castle editor games of all time, probably the best. Going from individually being able to build a custom bastion tile by tile to lengths of pre-fabricated fortifications... Maybe there are awesome mods for this game or some aspect I didnt notice but I cant recommend it, especially being a sequal to such a fantastic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No matter what you pay, if you've played any other stronghold installment, you are going to hate this one. Half the freedom of strongold 2, half the storytelling of strongold 1. Half the variation of stronghold legends.Missions are a complete bore. No variation or sense of progression. The situations you are put in are so painfully lackluster that it feels like yo're doing the same thing over and over again. My biggest gripe is that you never get the chance or even feel the need to do your best to make an ultimate fortress and garrison that can withstand any siege, or an invincible economy and infrastructure that can weather any disaster. They do all this wrong, and they also manage to make the building mechanics truly atrocious. nigh impossible it is to build any castle wall without getting a headache. building costs are also so high that it feels like you're playing an MMO. Long story short, This game sucks.			",64,13,0,5,4,0,12

												I think something that a lot of people left out in their bad reviews is that their complaints are with the multiplayer service, not everybody is an overcompetitive♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥so I decided to take the risk and buy the game anyways. I have a pretty low quality computer when it comes to video games, it's a 4 year old non gaming laptop. I was worried when reading the reviews that the game would not run it all on my computer since the people posting the reviews most likely had much better computers than I. The negative reviews are pure slander because they can't get their fix of online superiority. Not only can I play the game on full graphics, it doesnt even crash like the steam edition of stronghold legends does. I was happy playing because the game fixed a lot of things that I thought were missing in stronghold 2 and still had a similar feel. I think the graphics and day and night cycle are just wonderful as it is so pleasing to see your keep in the night with the torches on the walls sometimes. I bought stronghold 2 a few days before this one so I never really got a handle on the troop and combat system until recently but it was kick♥♥♥♥♥amasing a army of over 100 men. I could go on for forever about how much I enjoy the game and I am really happy that I took the risk and bought it even after all the negative reviews.

												Hello Community,In short: DONT BUY SH3! (go play SH2 or AoE2 or AoM or SCII (my regards to steam! #yolo) if you want a fun RTS experience instead of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥, if you want to know why i come to this conclusion you are welcome to read on, ive structured my post in: 1. What i did2. PROS3. CONS___________________________________________________________________________________1. What i did:I played the first 3 missions in the campaign.I Tried to play this game in multiplayer mode with a friend for about 45 mins.I played 1 on 1 with a friend for 1-1.5 hours.I played with the Graphics options___________________________________________________________________________________2. PROS:Graphics:- The game looks good (better than SH2) because the plate armours look dirty and not so shiny like in SH2,this new textures also make the walls and other Buildings look dirty and more realistic (which is good in my opinion) in  SH2 the walls and armours looked kinda ""blanc"". Also other units with lighter armour like spearmen swordsmen or crossbows look better.- There are a view completely new buildings for the stronghold like very low towers (I dont know what they are called in english) and better looking houses for the villagers.Also ""old"" and familliar looking buildings like the cheese production and others look better now.- Sounds are good, there is at least one new song playing in the backgrund while playing,the old talking sounds of the units when clicking on them and giving move or attack or formation command have been coppied (makes players who played SH2 feel familliar)- there are new fancy graphic options like depth of focus changing with the distance a building has between it and the camera and special options for light and particle effects.(I dont like the change of sharpness very much because i feel like not being able to see something (for example a blurry high tower with its tip close to the cam) very well. but im sure others will like it AND you can switch it off so this is a PRO.- The menu looks nice and is simple- Graphic changes can be adopted without restarting the gameGameplay:- It is now possible to rotate buildings by rotating the mouse wheel, therefore buildings can be packed closer to each other in the castle (thats a really cool feature in my opinion and prevents the player from being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because he wasted some space).___________________________________________________________________________________3. CONS (those are overwhelming the PROS by far in my case because i bought the game for the multiplayer experience and remembered SH2 being a good RTS game):About ""setting up"" a multiplayer game (i enclose the points in ""About ""setting up"" a multiplayer game"" in brackets because i cant rule out the possibility that the game destroying buggs described below where caused by my friend having a ping of arround 800 (please give me feedback if others are observing the same buggs)):- In the Host menue several times almost nothing happened after hitting the ""go"" button (even thou everyone was ready because he had clicked on the ""rdy up"" button an od number of times). Just a text at the bottom of the screen appeared saying: ""game is being started..."" (or simillar).My friend with whome i was connected via Skype said he could see the loading screen but nobody was loading (counter stuck @ 0%).----> we couldnt start the game.- Also changing the position of the players on the map did not work when the maximum number of players on the map was reached. i think the developers did not include such a function in their game. (correct me if im wrong here). SH2 had this function. (it seems to me that this was just lazyness and bad work). If they did not include such a function i ask here: Did the developers see the possibility of the Host wanting to change the position of players after the game is full? Did they even test the multiplayer mode?)- When setting up teams when trying to play for example 2 on 2, does ""annoy just a little bit"" :D because its just possible to count upwards and then reset the counter at 8 to 1 if you click it again.therefore if you click one time to much you have to click several times to get a correct team setup, this wont be that bad if the ""counter"" would react fast so you could for example click 5-8 times in 2-3 seconds to correct the mistake. (in Age of Empires 2 they did solve it that way and it was okay)BUT: somehow hitting the ""Teamcounter buttons"" or the ""go button"" in host screen while being the host often does not have any effect at all, and you have to click again and wait 1-4 sec. until you see if the changed parameter becomes ""online"".- Also a programme running in the background while hosting changes the numbers = teams of the players which have not been clicked on, on its own if the host clicks on a players number=team to make him go one team up! (as if the host was too stupid to think on its own!)This ""feature"" makes the host stay calm because the ""mini plan"" the host formulates kinda subconcious when setting up the game would sound kinda like this if you put it in language: Me and my friend(s) or other players in team A and the other players in team B. Then he goes on changing the numbers by clicking on them and if he screws up something (for example clicking one time to much which can happen with a high probability because the changes wont be accepted always or when they do with a delay :D)The ""AI"" of the background programme ♥♥♥♥♥slapps the host in the face by changing♥♥♥♥♥♥on its own! and the host goes like: ""what the ♥♥♥♥?!"" I(!) am the HOST(!) I(!) change the NUMBERS(!)!!!One could eventually try to shout the following at ones screen 3 times in a row:Get thee hence, evil background programme get thee hence out of the game Satan!!!"".I can tell from experience it didnt work in my case...(that was a joke).- The chatt in the host menu (which is used to communicate with other players) (simillar to the buttons) often just did not show a new message i did type in and hit enter even if I waited a view seconds. The ""lost"" messages did appear when spamming a view more messages after the initial one.As you can easily immagine i was staying cool and relaxed at this point in time because i realised that i did pay 20$ for a good load of fun buggs which wood enrich my experience greatly. (this is meant sarcastic).Ingame experience:- Wall building partially did not work ingame for no obvious reason (probably i was too stupid to connect the gate with the wall correctly but i think that also was a bug). Also there was no invisible unit (like the assassin in SH2) standing there which couldve prevented me from building the wall. i can rule this out because i asked my friend if he had an invisible unit standing where i wanted to connect the wall to the gate i built.- One time my archers just did not attack enemy units which where passing by and where in range (at least it felt like they where in range; of course i did not measure the range ingame, thats the job of the developers). probably they have reduced the range of the archers dramatically but im guessing that this was a bug of the ""AI"".- It seems like you have to click on the ground to see the ""building menu"" which (in my opinion) is bad, i want a button (which can be configured as a hotkey) to click on to make the game show the building menu to navigate to the building i want to build. i dont want to click on the ground to summon up this menu.I repeat here: DONT BUY SH3 until they remove the worst buggs! (they probably wont remove em.)Better play other games which are fun! SH3 is a waste of your money, time AND makes you go mad (especially if you ""play"" multiplayer)Thanks for readingand @ the developers: Thank you for making this great game, removing most buggs and making my day! f*ckerz!!its a worthy follow-up to SHC and SH2!

												I am writing this review because I think there are too much negative reviews about the game.I wouldn't say this game is bad, although in many aspects, it is not what we are used to have in other Stronghold games. It does have some bugs, and the one that is most common is troops stuck when you place a new buildings near them, and similar stuff... Still, same thing was happening in Crusader 1 and Stronghold 1 as well, with exception that in Crusader 1 this unit would disappear, or remain stuck on wall crenelation until the player does something to set him free.Also, many complain how they cannot play with massive armies in multiplayer... Why do we need to play with so many troops? Can we play with smaller troops? We would make some smaller castles, and attack each other earlier with less troops... In the end - it is the same if me and my opponent have 50, or 500 troops. Still, I must admit that I wasn't playing it in multiplayer much, and those games I started - I did face the lag, but I cannot say I have some powerful computer, so I do assume that is the reason why I had those problems. For this reason I decided to play only multiplayer games 1v1 on smaller maps, but it doesn't have to do much with the game itself - it's because of my PC... Also, I hope that we should be able to play multiplayer games with less troops and less buildings, and still, to have the fun. :) In fact, that is another challenge! Try to make your economy efficient as much as possible with less buildings. :) The other thing about Stronghold 3 is the fact that I was reading some reviews before buying Stronghold 3, and I knew there wouldn't be skirmish, and I knew there are still those bugs - so I got the game with low expectations. :) So, when I got the game, I was only looking at those good things of the game, and still, there are more good parts, and those bad ones.Nevertheless, it is not an excuse, and I am also sad that Firefly gave up this game, and that they didn't work on it a little more to fix those few remaining bugs.I would also like to add that it is Stronghold 3 in which Firefly introduced some new interesting things such as: building walls in all possible directions, and putting any buildings wherever I want and rotate it however I want; special abilities of some troops, such as men at arms: they made spearmen more useful this way, etc... Also, I like it more how a castle looks in Stronghold 3 than how it looks in other Stronghold games - here castles are more natural, but that is only a matter of taste I guess.Among those new stuff I do dislike how they made troops just leave the barracks - peasants do not need to walk to the barracks... This is something that could be exploited even in some campaign missions! I also dislike how they made the siege camps just like in Stronghold 2. One doesn't need to bring the engineers (and to protect them from the enemy) to construct mass of catapults in the middle of nowhere.I only want to say that besides its bad reputation Stronghold 3 is not that bad as they say - it is a good game, and we do have to admit that with this game Firefly gave us something new! I am sure that if the game wasn't published too early, they would have done it way better.1. there would be less things to be fixed in patches, and2. Stronghold fans wouldn't be so much driven away from the game after their first impressions, although it is bad that Stronghold 3 doesn't offer skirmish mode. (I guess that they had though/hoped it would be as good to us as Stronghold 1 was without skirmish mode, but in year 2011 we were expecting nothing less that a game with skirmish mode.)Sadly, that bad reputation Stronghold 3 got was almost certainly the reason why they gave up Stronghold 3, and why they left some more things to be fixed... Even if they made a perfect game afterwards, little people would get it. Little people would be playing it, there wouldn't be much of those who would recommend it to someone, little people would be buying it...Still, even though I am recommending this game, my advice would be: don't get this game with high expectations, and still, you should have fun playing it. :) Also, I don't think it is worth 27,99€ - don't rush when buying it, you should be able to find a retail version for less, or you could wait from some sale at Steam, and to get it for less money.

												Overall a pretty enjoyable game. Yes, it has more bugs than the previous Stronghold games, but after a few hours it doesn't bother me anymore.If you're a fan of the previous Stronghold games I wouldn't skip this game just because of the bad reviews. Stronghold 3 IMO isn't as bad as many claim it to be, just give it a try (´∀`)b			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hey guys, i love stradegy gaming, and this just doesnt cut it for me. The multiplayer side of this game plays better than singleplayer and Campaign mode together. You basicly build town, add castle walls, and balance all this with a growing population. Many problems come along the way with all this, besides no enemys. Can get boring real quick.

Even the storyline are effing same with Stronghold 2. I got cheated by this game developer. I am a hardcore fan of Stronghold series, even played the online one too but enough is enough.

												Really dissapointing. Possibly the worst game in the franchise. I've been a huge Stronghold fan ever since Stronghold 1, therefore' it pains me that they've almost destroyed the series. If you've played previous Stronghold games, here are a few things you should know:- There is no longer Skirmish mode- There are only a few storylines to play- It's incredibly bugged- There is no longer custom map builder- Terrible storylines. None of them are the least bit entertaining. If I could go back in time and prevent myself from getting this game, I would.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They walk so slow...I can't believe how slow they move. I couldn't even play 30 minutes before I just quit the game. The gameplay...is slow. The actual buildings are too big and wonky that it's confusing on how to make them and even place them...oh yeah there too big like the woodcuters camp. Stronghold 2? Woodcutters camp...3x3 placement...Stronghold3? 10x12 or something huge so it takes up so much space! The buildings take up too much space and it annoys me...and the rotation of the building is so slow I swear that my mouse hated me for doing that. The actual training was stupid and annoyning and this new scribe? He was annoyning the entire time. The popularity system? I didn't even try to understand it because they gave a half♥♥♥♥♥attempt at trying to explain it. Visually it's good and it sounds good, but looks can't save how terrible everything else is. This is Strongholds younger slower brother who can't think too hard else he gets a terrible headache and starts to cry. 2/10 from me and meaning don't buy this game unless you torture your friend by making him/her play this game for an hour stright.

												I bought this game years ago when it was first relased but my PC at the time was not able to play the game. I decided I wanted to play a stronghold game and decided to finally try this one out since I had it for so long. (I forgot I even owned the game) So I launch he game to find out there is no Skirmish mode.... I really do not care for this because skirmish mode is what I always enjoyed about the other games in the series. Needless to say I did not play that long I really don't care for the story (because I want to play the game with out any interuptions)  and I don't care for the free build mode (it's to easy)... I am just going to put it out there stick to one of the older games it might suit your needs better. I am really disapointed I do hope at some time they decide to release a skirmish mode in to the game.			",101,18,1,23,28,0,15

												If you are looking to buy this game to relive the glory of stronghold 1 or 2 think again.  This game is a step waaay back from the first two.  Although the graphics were much improved everthing else is absolutely crap.  It was full of bugs some of which killed what very little enjoyment i got from playing it.  The pathfinding script is so flawed that your army has trouble negotiating simple terrain.  The AI is a joke.  There is no co op options in the multi player set up.  The building options are clunky  and make no sence.  The maps are all small,  even the so called large ones.  This version make building any kind of keep difficult to the point of frustration because the maps are so small.  The zoom in and out optios are so limited that building become very difficult.  Firefly really shot themselves in the foot on this one.  They made promises about the game mechanics and multiplayer options and never kept them stating they never intended to include them, but the manual clearly states that those options are there.  In fact the Firefly forums for this game are all complaints.  The quit supporting this game and flat out refused to do any more work to fix the game other than making it stable, which it wasn't at release.  considering that the Stronghold series is what put these guys on the map this latest release will likely put them in the poorhouse if not out of business.  I flat out refuse to buy anymore Firefly products because of their attitude toward a broken unfinished game.			",48,0,0,10,21,0,31

												Wouldn't reccoment this game unfortunately.I have long since enjoyed stratigic empire style games such as Age of Empires, civilizations and the command and conquer series, so when I saw this one of sale I jumped and bought it without reading too much about it. The Stronghold series has always been the one that I have been intrigued with but until now have never played. I have heard great review of the first few games, from friends and Articles online but this game is a massive let down. I bought this game for a minimum price but even with this in mind I would stay well clear of this game, I haven't yet played the Original titles so I won't write off the whole series but honestly you can find free and much older games which get this genre right. Hope other people don't make the same mistake I did.			",29,3,0,2,10,0,19

Like bee hives or eel ponds.- Some military management bugs.Overall not a perfect game of course but 6/10 at least. Some people must relax.			",18,2,0,9,7,0,10

												Like Stronghold 2, the mass of patches as of March2012 have fixed 99% of the issues and added additional content. However, this game still feels a bit incomplete on the gameplay side and certainly feels lesser to that of Stronghold Crusader. The graphics are pretty decent, but I would have prefered more focus on gameplay. After all the patches, I'd give this more of a 60/100 as there's still more work to go. Diehard fans will still enjoy this and it's quite difficult too! Not like the strategy in the classic games with so much more luck involved in many more random events.  60/100 is a fair score that cannot increase until the content increases.  They shoulda used the same brilliant story telling method of Stronghold instead of the confusing sketch slideshows and ""thrown into midst of battle"" military campaign levels.  With that the meta could go up!			",568,181,24,59,69,7,108

												I very much regret buying this game. I loved stronghold 2 and the rest of the Stronghold games. But this one was bad.... The online is unplayable (if anyone even plays it) and theres no skirmish mode (You vs. AI) At ALL! I love playing vs the AI on Stronghold 2. Its pretty difficult and fun to just try to build the ultimate castle and army. But theres no mode for this. Id love if there was a custom game mode creator where you could add AIs to verse on a map of your choosing and the settings of your choosing. But there is not. Luckily I got the game on sale. So i didnt get ENTIRELY screwed over. The campaign is okay. But I know most people like to have a competitive experience wheter it be with others online or against an AI. I for one would not recommend you buy this game if you like Stronghold 2 and are thinking this is level up and an upgrade from it. Most things are exactly the same. The only difference is the graphics (which are really great actually). All in all I can exaggerate enough how dissapointed I am.			",69,2,0,12,12,0,8

												Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader were fantastic games. I loved them and spent hours of my life playing them - this game is completely different. Stronghold 3 started off badly with a buggy launch, missing features, and an awkard learning curve. Even after several patches it still isn't enjoyable to play.Micro-management is dull and repetitive, combat is boring to watch and your castles can look ""okay"" at best. The medieval charm of the original games do not shine through in this one, unfortunately. I'd recommend skipping this purchase and getting one of the original games instead, or waiting in anticipation that Firefly Studios don't make a mess of Stronghold Crusader 2 - we can always hope!3/10			",210,54,2,39,49,1,53

												This game is a joke.I'm a big fan of the Stronghold Series but I can not find any single positive aspect in the third part.The new building system is kind of annoying, you can't even set straight walls so there is no way to build a symetric castle.The spots where the walls stick to another are buggy as well.Even the titlescreen looks horrible and contains nothing but a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ yellow background and a guy who is looking at you like a crazy old♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥It is just a bad Stronghold 2 with less features like the Tortureguild, the punishments, the treasury and so on...Tannery is also not included anymore , so to recruit some Crossbowmen you just have to produce Crossbows - that's it.This is taking so much of the well done complexity of Stronghold 2 wich led the player to do more thoughtful actions.Now it is just a clumsy 'cut some wood here, produce this and that there' until i got a little army walking towards to the ugly enemy castle.The campaign is boring and the ''cutscenes'' are loveless images of black and white figures talking about war and revenge.The gameplay itself is uncomfortable, you feel that the engine is not good at all after playing for a few seconds.After all this stuff they also left out the skirmish mode wich have ever been the heart and soul of Stronghold.I am totally disappointed and would recommend to everybody who is thinking about buying this to do not.

												It's not entirely bad game. It's just, it does not quite feels the same as the good old Stronghold 1.I can't exactly pinpoint what is wrong with this game, but it feels more dull and awkward, comparing to the older predesessor of Stonghold. It could be the awkward animations or maybe the lack of zoom or these weird green squares around all of your buildings... Or the complete lack of personality in your population, they become less of a people under your command and more of just... Units you can use as you please. Or maybe it's awkward phisics with projectiles and such. Or the lack of skirmish mode. I dunno, guys. It could be the sum of all of it together, but...I feel like it lost it's spirit since the second part of the series and it never got to be even close to what the first part felt like. And I will say once again... The game is not bad. It's just doesn't feel like that good old game that I used to spend days playing and enjoying every single moment of it.I will not make a negative review of this game, as it is not entirelly bad. It's just... Feels incomplete and more of a game than a whole living a breathing universe as the first part used to be. But I do not recommend you to buy it eighter. It's not worth your time and money.4/10.			",435,59,4,47,45,4,68

												This, unfortunately, is yet another reason that many game franchises should never try to create a third sequel without a complete reimagining of the base game.  Stronghold could have made 3 so much more.  As it is, it seems rushed to the shelf so they could get a paycheck and call it quits.Buggy AI, Unit AND Building caps (Free Build with only 125 buildings?  Really?), and some serious holes in the game itself left a bad taste in my mouth.  Thankfully I got this title as part of the bundle, so I can be happy that I have the other titles to enjoy.

												The very first Sim type game I ever played was the Original Stronghold, and from there I was mesmerized. Then Stronghold 2 came out and for all of its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ storyline, It had a great interactive system. Following the line of games in the Stronghold line there were hits and misses aplenty but none of them were truly God Awful.Until Now. Ladies and Gentlemen I give you, The biggest pile of crap on Steam. The Game that if anyone ever payed for, no matter how small the price, should receive a full return of their payment a written letter of apology from Gabe, and everyone at Firefly studios.You took the orignial game and storyline and gave it a slight ENB setting change. Then you took the worst mechanics from other games, put them in, and left out all of the great mechanics. Why would you cut out the content that made the other games acceptable as continuations to the story?  So that you could fix nothing about the graphical errors or the faulty mechanics of the orignial without having to patch in new mechanics or graphics from the later installments.If The original game had a performance level of 5. Its sequel had a level 8.0 Crusaders 1 and 2  were respectively 8.0 and 7.5 The King Arthur varient was probably a 6.5 but because of novelty became a 7.5And This Game is a 3. STronghold Online is a 2. Everything about this game offends. The cutscenes, the audio, the lack of detail from ANY other game. Oh you can be greeted by your peasants and see their names when you click on them? Not in this game. You can earn honor and influence to purchase estates and create traderoutes between other villages? Not in this game. You can host Balls and Feasts that are measured through the livelyhood of your village?  Well here, were back to basics with Food storages, and Weapons storages. Anything else is just fluff in the medeival era. WHo needs Jousting tourneys or Medeival torture for criminals, who needs Renn fairs to make the villages happy or Mercenary camps to implore new types of troops from across the seas in the holy land, WHO NEEDS A STRONGHOLD GAME IN 2010 WHEN WE HAVE THIS GARBAGE.Sorry Firefly. I no longer want to own any of your products. You're all scum.			",56,9,0,12,9,0,2

												Stronghold 3 is a complete disappointment. The game is devoid of the charm of its predecessors and goes so far as to be a bad game. The battles are a big part of the game but, the AI is nonexistent and moving your army around is an immense struggle making the even a simple skirmish a massive pain. This could be forgiven if the economic gameplay wasn’t entirely broken, most buildings produce too slowly to keep up with a steadily growing demand, you'll find yourself with frequent food shortages despite having more than enough farms. Even the castle building, a cornerstone of the series is a glitchy and counterproductive mess.I strongly recommend you do not waste your time and money on this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played Caesar 1234 This is like those was good back in the day cause of 2D but the 3D ones not so good. In saying that I liked it. It has potential they both do caesar 4 and Stronghold 3. If i had to say which is better to build walls its caesar 4. Walls suck in Stronghold 3. Units get stuck in this and can continue to attack and not be attacked ( 1 guy killed my entire base cause i couldnt delete my stockpile to get to him). Economics suck compared to caesar overall. But I did expect more in castle building. More wall types more gates decorations so on literally i feel like im playing a mobile phone game hey day has more stuff to do.			",52,5,0,7,6,0,4

Posted: December 23, 2013
												It's sad as I was really looking forward to this game, but it's just not fun to play, and it was ruined simply due to a few major factors that killed the game for me (note that I only play RTSs in singleplayer).The first problem that is it SHOULD have built upon Stronghold 2, which was an excellent game that was killed by a handful of crippling flaws (random crippling gong/rat disasters, resources were too demanding for basic units, and bad mission/campaign structures and progression. Instead this time they overcautiously regressed to Stronghold 1, but kept a lot of SH2 flaws and included a bunch of new ones.The engine is actually less advanced than its predecessor in many ways that hurts the gameplay. Firstly, it is very buggy: dying enemies spawn giant triangles that block the screen, and in one mission my keep was invisible. The interface is horrible- unlike the previous games that allowed very simple, versatile and accurate structure placement, this version seems incomplete- placing structures is clumsy, fiddly and difficult, walls are much harder to place OR connect (especially to structures that are supposed to back onto them like the Barracks), and the AI is awful, where the player often loses control for extended periods by sending units onto battlements. Combat is also a pain to organizeThe multi-storey defenses are GONE with plain Strong-hold 1 structures returning (a pity). Yet the gameplay elements that turned Stronghold 2 from excellent to downright bad ARE STILL HERE. Random unpreventable disasters are back (which at least are more managable and less crippling than last time- except for the bears that spawn inside my castle and wipe out my farms). The awful campaign/mission structure in the previous game is back, with annoying and frustrating missions like escorting VERY slow units around, with the first proper defensive mission not occurring until the FOURTH LEVEL (the first mission archers are available too- before then you get your peasants to charge the enemy). Also, while the goofy characters and dialogue from Stronghold 2 are gone, there is simply no characters or dialogue at all- you get a few still-frame comics with a narrated monologue voiceover (by the Wolf and the two heroes only) at the start and end of each mission, and that's it.  One very good positive over the last game however is that lower units like archers no longer require Honour (which was a good idea- but should have only applied to top-level units to make them harder to spam).Overall it's a huge pity, as Firefly had a lot to work with by their previous games, and could have very easily made an excellent game. Instead it feels rushed and incomplete, with far less sophistication than the previous game, and worse, little evidence that the team did much engine testing or gameplay testing before shipping it out. I do genuinely hope they give it another shot, because they DO have the capability to make their next game amazing.			",81,11,0,3,5,0,12

												I enjoyed the previous versions of Stronghold to some extend. Clearly version 2 is the best. Version 3 is by far the worst. Sloppy programming, Units stuck, Dull landscape, Impossible to get stance of soldiers to anything. Insane bias towards computer AI. Expect to have to defend impossible positions and single archers decimating your ranks from 20% greater distance than you can shoot. Expect battles in which even at puny level the amount of soldiers you get to defend or attack is half that what the computer opponent gets. Expect not to be able to rotate the battle field or unseen enemies lurking in trees and no way to kill them. Expect enemies to field entire armies in the time you barely can get 10 villagers to spawn. Sad stuff really. Was a good game.			",7,1,0,3,8,0,4

It doesnt stop there, with most good games you like to have fun without having to stick to the campain BUT firefly decided not to give stronghold 3 a skirmish function so you are left with the campaign and that's about it.....

												Where to start? I was  huge fan of stronghold 1 and crusader instead of build on the progress firefly has peeled away all the polish and good features of the game this goes to show the amount of care put in this game for example there is no longer sound when objects are placed in the stockpile or armour nor is the and animated scene when you click on a peasant or building. Although stronghold 2 had its own problems it made several key improvements to the franchies that included 3d anmation and veiwing inside the keep to see feasts this game was a massive dissapointment even when compared to stronghold 2.

												I had been waiting for the game to come out for about a year, thinking that it was like stronghold crusader and 2. The moment i booted up, my heart sank. It is basically stronghold 2, but buggier and not having anything that even resembles any sort of skirmish. Skirmish had been the best part of all of the older strongholds, and was what i was looking forward to the most, but it is not there. It is also buggy as ♥♥♥♥, with units getting stuck in walls and archers sometimes hugging the enemy while attacking them. I would not recommend this game due to that, and i hope that Stronghold 4 fixes all of that, or else i will not get it. I cant believe that firefly would release it like this. If you want stronghold games, I would definetely go for crusader or 2. Those games were made in 2001 and 2005, and they are much more enjoyable that this.			",132,12,0,6,45,1,19

												Open gameClick TutorialGame CrashsesClick Military CampaignGame CrashsesClick Economic Campaign Game Crashes10/10 best gameIn all seriousness though; I eventually got one of the custom maps to work, and had quite a bit of fun assaulting the community made castle. Unfortunatly it did not last long as the force I was given was very over powered. This game is very pretty and a lot of detail was put into it. I liked how when I box selected units they would do battle cries and chants depending on the number of men I selected. It is just a shame that this game just refuses to play. I could easily have 100+ hours on this game if it would just run. If the game was fixed I would recomend this, even if the devs expressed how they were possibly working on fixing this I would still recomend this. Sadly the devs just pushed the game out and left it to rot. This game had so much potential and hype it saddens me that this will be most likely the last traditional Stronghold game. At least there is Crusaders 2.			",75,1,2,12,15,0,12

												I waited a year to but this game on sale and I'm glad I did. It's was worth the 4.50 i payed for it but it's not worth anymore to me. I played the game for one day. It was fun while it lasted. Not much to do. I see they have Stronghold 2 Crusaders going for 50 dollars and more if you want all the DLCs. After reading the reviews to the game there's no way i will pay full price for that version either. Looks like I'll be waiting a year to get that version on sale too.You can tell the people that made the first couple versions no longer work with the game. With every new version that comes out the game gets worse. If you want to buy the game then don't pay full price because  you'll most likely reget it.			",39,14,0,7,18,0,23

												I personally love this series as Stronghold, Stronghold Crusader and Stronghold 2 were some of my favorite games growing up. I would not recommend this game however because of its clunky campaign and lack of multiplayer integration. It has very limited growth in multiplayer combat/development which frequently leads to standstills while trying to breach each others keep. The connectivity is horrid as well- I frequently am thrown into lobbies with poor connections (i.e. LAG).			",2664,904,109,291,336,33,406

The graphics are ok but I can't keep playing the game normally I like to play a game for 120 hours minimum before I review it but I simply can't play this game if you want a good stonghold game one and two and fantastic games also if you can get the disc of stonghold 2 gold it comes with a fun little minigame.

												Stronghold 3 is not a horrible sequel to Stronghold 2 however it does have a few flaws such as the lack of King maker or any other A.I game mode. Multilayer is dead and a few bugs exist. The recent patches seem to fix most of the problem and the campaign is good. Honestly the graphics are average (much better than Stronghold 2) however it could have been better. Voice acting sounded cheap but acceptable. Stronghold 3 is an above average rts but defiantly not the amazing squeal everyone expected. Buy it if your a fan of the series and if it is on sale, otherwise it's not worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a good game in my opinion. If we compare it to Stronghold 2 it is much the same except this game has improved graphics and castle building. I feel the game is getting bad rep so much so that they may not make a sequel ;_; So where this game primarily went wrong would be the bugs and no skirmish mode. Every game should be modable too! Overall it is like the Stronghold we all know and love without the replayability to it. I hope they make a stronghold 4 with improvements and new features maybe sea/land battles. Bigger battles and support. Or even a world domination kinda like Star Wars Battlefront with the galaxy conquer or similar to the Total War map overview. But before all that a skirmish mode that will be difficult and enjoyable. Maybe with diplomacy even as an added feature for skirmish.			",103,9,0,4,8,0,7

												This game had promis like the past games, but not having an AI for a skirmish mode or Kingsmaker mode; made this game fall flat on its stupid face. 80% of the enjoyment I get from ANY RTS is skermish modes and I know most ppl feel the same, probably not all but most. When most of your player base get that kind of enjoyment out of a game, you would think the makers would have half a brain to add it. I suppose they spent there allowance on getting used to the new 3D style RTS and  it just took too much money, I cannot say for sure but I got this on pakage sale cuz im not a sucker like a lot of the ppl who paid full price. NEVER impusle buy even if ads make a game look good; wait for proper review and THEN decide if its worth your hard earned money. If companys add all this PRE-order stuff that makes you REALLY want the added stuff then the game is probably crap or ripoff OR not done, don't fall for it guys and gals.			",278,37,1,77,31,3,66

												This game is Great! Here's why. User created games! That is what makes this game awesome! Individual quests that you can get off the website or a search. You will have to put the file from the internet into a specific game folder, the web will tell you how, its not hard. New goals to be reached, taking over multiple castles, and some games have a feature that allows you to send armies of choosable size to attack you, and to change other things. Some games are dumb. Some are epic. Find em, download em, and enjoy.  This game is still a worthy play. The ""bugs"" everyone are talking about are the semi-cheats that were removed from previous games, (like building walls and buildings on mountains and unstable ground, and layering castle walls.) The AI has always been very dumb in the stronghold series, so why complain now? Do you want these soldiers to all run their own highly organized black op mission?! Give the cold, wet, untrianed, underaged, malnourished, poorly clothed, diseased, dirty, smelly, soldiers of the dark ages a break would you!  I am bummed tha some of the buildings are gone from stronghold 2, but looking at reviews of that game, these were buildings that had niches to how they worked, and could be a pain. Like catching criminals, and gong farming. I like this game. I hope that more user games get made. After seeing all the nasty reviews there probably won't be another Stronghold.			",17,5,2,5,19,1,25

I bought it 30 mins ago and I will never more play it.And never play games from this series. Which is bad, because I liked the previous Strongholds. But enough is enough.

												Honestly, for what it's worth it was a decent game. There are definitely a few bugs that could use fixing, and the lack of a skirmish mode was disappointing for a long time Stronghold Fan. But the units and buildings are gorgeous, the campaign and story are actually taken a lot further than most Stronghold Games. The new Ranger Unit is really useful as well, among the other new or unique buildings. Really, it just comes back to the lack of a Skirmish mode - Still though, not a bad game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ansich ist Stronghold 3 nicht schlecht natürlich war es nicht so gut das ein ""so großer Strategietitel"" so unfertig herauskam , nunja es war leider so wir können es nicht mehr ändern ! So jetze mal zum Game ! Stronghold 3 wurde sehr gut gepatcht es hat zwar immernoch ein paar bugs aber nichtmehr soviele und so schlimme wie am Release . Die Kampagnen sind in Ordnung machen Spaß .Multiplayer ist leider nurnoch bedingt möglich man findet leider kaum noch Lobbys :/Also wenn ihr euch das Game zulegt oder noch zulegen wollt und MUltiplayer Battles spielen wollt guckt vorher ob ein Freund/Freundin es noch spielt oder spielte (besitzt) , da wie gesagt kaum bis garkeine Lobbys mehr vorhanden sind !

I reccomend this game if you have friends playing it because that always helps pretty much anygame.

												Stronghold 3...... *sigh*Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader were this companies greatest entries into the ""Stronghold"" Series... its been a downhill slide ever since then.Stronghold 3 has ok music, and a passable storyline (that we've all heard before...) but thats not its biggest flaws.BUGS, GLITCHES, and FREEZES however are.  This game feels rushed and unpolished, and with zero response from the dev's about updates or patches, you have to assume there will be none.Several missions have you forced with only a few units to face an entire army of invaders.. you might think there are several ways to win at this mission... you would be completly wrong.. you must complete the mission the EXACT way the developers planned for you to, or you will be totally decimated.. thus taking away the fun of trying your own thing.the worst offender of this is a Castle seige mission where you are given 2 catapults, 1 ram, 15 pikemen, 20 archers, and a couple of archer sheild things... you have to breach a 2 stage wall, and the keep that are totally lined with archers, and about 50 macemen and roughly the same number of pikemen around the keep.   if you dont move your units exactly to required positions (which are totally obvious) you lose... period. (oh look a convenient hill overlooking their castle and its undefended, Wow what luck *eyeroll*)I own Stronghold, S:Crusaders, S:Gold, S:2, and now S:3  and 3 is by far... the worst of them all.  by a huge margin... i wont be buying S:4 or any other stronghold game ever again because of this.  Ive lost faith in the brand and the company now.Just do yourself a favor... buy Stronghold Gold, and forget the rest even exist.1/10 (because of bugs and poor design)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I fully recommend this game, the graphics are amazing, the 360 rotation of buildings adds realism and is quite cool, the random events are mostly exiting and adds uniqueness to this game, i enjoy games like this and i like how there is a 'free build mode' so the kingdom can be created easily and quickly and the fun won't be lost while playing.There are a range of structures and in this game, your status counts; e.g Honor is needed to recruit knights on the other hand the battles are cool with full animation in the battles so the game still feels smooth, i love how if you zoom in closer to the town, you hear conversations of the villagers and the atmosphere of the town feels right, but when you zoom out that sound mutes and a slight wind can be heared creating a full effect of the map, the movement of the villagers and units is smooth and looks really good, the animation of the villagers matches what role they play in the town, for example a farmer would collect his crops and carry them in to his house.i would definetly recommend this game to all.

												I am a long time fan of the stronghold and played almost of the them except the fist game, but every other after and i was stoked for this game with it getting rid of the crap from the stronghold 2. But the worst thing this game did was get rid of skirmish mode. Which was the biggest time sink for me when i played them. They got rid of it. I know they have multiplayer and that's not me. I looked online after i bought this game and no reviews stated that skirmish was missing. So i am here to tell you that if you want skirmish don't get this game. It's still a decent game improving everything else but, now i can't play this game anymore. But i want to			",224,25,1,13,29,1,28

The only difference i see is no Skirmish mode (Even though there is a new battle only mode... which is so you dont worry about the micromanaging of the town and can focus on fighting only (This plus the original mode), the graphics and features are in bigger bulk than the previous versions.Do i like it? Yes. Do i reccomend it? If you want Stronghold 2 with better graphics... Yes i do. However its gameplay is more arcady and streamlined than the original (even though it has more features).

												Positives...great graphics, pleasing ambience, customizable battle situation (frequency and difficulty of AI encounters)things to be desired...Tech & Unit upgrades should be player initiated instead of having a constant full tech tree. Map builder is difficult to useThe pricing of some units such as the (overpowered) Knight are too cheap to enlist.MORE custom maps and dlcOverall great game. ",22,1,1,9,3,0,6

												when i first played stronghold crusader i thought GOD himself had come down and blessed me with such a game with pretty much anything you could ask from a strategy game, i guess there could be some tweaking here and there with the game modes and some more map types , but apart from that its every strategy gamers heaven.so i when i heard about stronghold 3 gold soon to be realeased i had to go and change my underwear i couldent wait to get it , but now ive waited 3 and a half hour for it to download just twiddeling my thumbs to find out that when i launched it it dosent even have a PvIA or skirmish mode i almost cried that was on of the best things about stronghold 2 with the new colonies buildings and being able to take over just small villiages to help your onslaught of the enemy, but now stronhold 3 just consists of more campains and online PvP but dont get me wrong thats all good apart from having to have a graphics card the size of a fully grown male mammoth to actually be able to play a game without it taking 3 years as it lags like mad on a laptop.still i would recommend it to strategy gamers as it hold a different prospective to war with the wide range of unit and bulding to help you get through the day, just remeber to read other reviews and features before buying it.

												Amazing how Firefly can present an extremely tired genre in a manner that feels just as fresh and exciting as Westwood and Blizzard's efforts back in the 90's when RTS first went viral. They've taken Settlers and removed all of the dull and unnecessary ramblings and tangents streamliing a more intense and eventful experience.If only Firefly's marketing efforts were as strong as their craftsmanship as SH3 opens to reveal a dead sign-on to their leaderboards and world-mapped depiction of your labours.Gone the way of ad-supported, HTML5, Facebook fodder they did. No use keeping online interaction in SH3 competing against thier latest endeavors.Multiplayer is still there but without the bells and whistles you woud be lucky to find one server after waiting a good half hour so co-dependents need not apply.Also recommended is Firefly's ""Space Colony"" which can be found on GOG.comPrice Recommended: $15			",1986,518,63,237,141,23,319

It also took 3 years to fix some obvious bugs such as battering rams climbing walls, but at least they fixed them.  I can't recommend this game to anyone unless you really enjoy the [boring] campaign and can pick this up for very little money.			",34,2,1,5,14,0,8

												This game does not deserve the bad rep it has received, there I said it. Yes the game was buggy as hell on release, but the point is they fixed it, the game runs really smoothly now, the graphics is pretty decent, the new features are awesome, especially the random events and weather changes, the story is not bad at all and I enjoyed the fact that you can place and rotate buildings a little bit more freely then in the previous games, the smallish mapsizes are a downside but not a big one.Seriously try the game, and do so with an open mind and without listening to all the reviews out there, judge for yourself and you may find a nice little gem in this game, I rate it 7.5/10			",215,26,1,72,53,3,91

												Atmospheric, challenging and fun - I can't understand why there are so many negative reviews! OK, maybe it was full of bugs when it was first released, but it's not now, so get over it! Sometimes a unit does still get stuck in a wall but it doesn't happen often, and that just adds to the difficulty.I've really enjoyed playing all of the missions and especially the historical sieges. In my view the graphics are far better than in the predecessors, and the gameplay is at least as good as the original, and much better than Stronghold 2.			",0,0,0,0,6,0,3

Pretty much abandoned by its own developers. Firefly has not made a decent product since SH1 and was novelty at best. They have lost my buisness over not creating or supporting a quality product. Representing everything thats wrong with game industry and online publishing (high price for a title, sub par development or effort, released to early to make sales, with half attempts at damage contorl to salvage a bad product which should not have been released.) perfect example of a need for regulation and oversight for consumers.

												Solid gameplay and campaign but wouldn't recommend for a frequent mac user, for the following reasons: constant texture flickering and not being able to withstand large amounts of troops because of lag issues. Still overall a good rts.			",73,6,0,12,10,1,12

												piece of garbage, don't waste your time or money. Plagued with problems and crashed, saving issues. Weak storyline. game has been out for a long time and has 0 support for bugs fixes. Pretty much abandoned by its own developers. Firefly has not made a decent product since SH1 and was novelty at best. They have lost my buisness over not creating or supporting a quality product. Representing everything thats wrong with game industry and online publishing (high price for a title, sub par development or effort, released to early to make sales, with half attempts at damage contorl to salvage a bad product which should not have been released.) perfect example of a need for regulation and oversight for consumers.

												I refused to write a review in order to give firefly a chance to fix the game, after so many patches  (last patch in 2011) I decided to review the game, cause I lost hope in this game, the developers cant fix much really, instead they keep adding useless stuff like new maps & modes for multiplayer (multiplayer itself is still not working well), siege maps (boring to hell)... After you finish the military and economic campaigns there are no much to do, so you will go for free build, where you will build one time and set and invasion (then you wont play it again for sure) so after that you will jump into multiplayer, you will struggle and waste time in order to start the game, and if you succeed you will lag and maybe crash, thats it the game itself has a great potential but it seems a lot of things are broken and will be hard to fix. Stronghold series is unique and I love it, but SH3 is just so buggy with missing features that were avalable in previous game (skirmish for example)... This will be thier last game for sure, untill some developers will come and make us a nice castle RTS/ Sim..			",23,3,0,6,54,0,57

												I’m giving a “thumbs up” to SH3 because, despite its flaws, it retains the spirit of its predecessors and I actually had fun playing it.It helps that you can pick it up cheap and they’ve patched it so I personally didn’t experience any major crashes or bugs. Ok, the odd unit did get stuck in a wall but that never ruined the fun.I found the overall gameplay fine and had no problems with the UI or the economy or the building.  Having played all the older ones this one seems largely similar, which also includes the bad bits, and certainly does things no better. My biggest gripe, that I have to mention, would be the lack of a skirmish mode.  This really limits the amount of time I’ve played it and for a castle building game the story line had too few opportunities to build a skirmish-mode-like castle.So as a fan of the series, yes this incarnation was disappointing and limited, but I’d still recommend it when it appears in the sale, just to get a fix of castle building.

												Ok, here goes, So I have played and loved all the Stronghold games since day 1, so I write this review a bit biased.I love the conept of building a fortress to defend while maintaining an economy.If you find this on sale it's worth it for the sheer experience of another Stronghold game.However, be warned it's challenging, several times I had to restart missions because of a giant band of enemies appearing out of nowhere.  Each mission seems to have a ""trick"" to solving it. If a new troop is introduced you can bet it's used to win that scenario.  So my recommendation is based solely on loving the entire franchise really not this one specific game.If you haven't played any of the previous games don't start with this one.			",28,7,0,6,19,0,6

												I've always liked Stronghold. When I was younger and had Windows 2000, I used to play stronghold crusader a lot. When this game came out I was excited. It is a good game, challenging, and still has the stronghold feel. The only downside I have found to this game is that there isn't a single player custom game maker where you face off against an AI. Nonetheless, a good game worth getting.			",179,31,4,22,24,3,47

												So I made a review a while back. I completely got rid of it and I am just going to get everything out.This game made me cry.I've been a huge fan of the series and well... It's like someone took a huge, smelly dump all over the game, but wiped it off (not well) and said ""Here you go!"" PROS: + Beautiful graphics and animations+ Free build has awesome settings to customize weather and attacks from enemies+ Campaigns are awesome! +Torturing devices are really cool CONS: - The buildings are boring- The combat is just awful- Free build maps are limited and boring- A BUILDING LIMIT. yeah, YOU HAVE A LIMIT ON HOW MANY BUILDINGS YOU BUILD. I could say more but I want this to be quick. it seems like there is a different developer for every Stronghold game. The first one was awesome. Stronghold 2 was amazing and now three just sucks.

												I would like to say that I wholeheartedly recommend this game, however I can merely say I can recommend this game conditionally. These conditions are that you are a Stronghold fan, and that you have a friend who is also a Stronghold fan who you can struggle through the missions together with.In this way there will be dark times ahead, but also cheery times.  From the Bees dying to yelling out ""NOT THE LOGS"" while assaulting a castle as well as attemting to move your units which are stuck inside the environment or buildings.  However there are also moments of hilarity and joy when you finally capture that accursed castle, The Sultana I'm looking at you, or perhaps just a sense of relief that you have finally finished the mission you have been stuck on for far too long.  If I had been playing through this game alone I would have uninstalled this game during Mission 8 and never looked at sultanas the same way again, however, as I knew my friend was going through this suffering with me, we both persevered and triumphed. Always remember, however bad you are, Scarab is still worse.So in conclusion, if you and a friend like Stronghold then I recommend both getting the game, otherwise I would probably stay away from it.

												How is it they can copy everything from the origonal and still produce a inferior product. This game is awfull, it feels like a alpha. Units become permanently stuck on nothing, even more so when they come into contact with anything. Multyplayer has a forced 150 unit cap. The maps the game comes with limits you to 4 players. There is no AI in multiplayer, no coop play. Your units will engage randomly sometimes not at all allowing themselves to be cut down. units can infinitely stack on a point and if that point is on a wall it will take 5 minutes for 60 men to dispurse themselves evenly from that point. walls have 3 break animations. Campaign levels are terrible, AI wont even target your not wall related buildings. Terribly optimized barely runs the maximum of 600 units on screen. Placing buildings is slow and cumbersome and laggy for reasons beyond my understanding. and all this is just the tip of the iceburg. It does a portion of what stronghold one did and carries that portion out with the grace of a beached sea cucumber in a flock of seagulls. Avoid this buy.			",394,67,14,87,46,1,105

												Mac (IOX)I wanted to like this game, I really did. As a avid stronghold fan I was looking forward to it. I had expected something like stronghold two's castel system and stronghold crusaders level of combat difficulty. I got a watered down buggy unfinished product. I'm not sure if they even play tested this thing. One simple expample of its shortcoming is the compleat removal of any type of Player VS AI deathmatch game type, so all those stratagies that ou thought you may like but didnt want to try against human opponents? yea too bad. They also cut out custom senerios as it was called in crusader or user maps as it was called in two, entierly. This used to be one of my favorit parts of these games, being able to just go at it in compleatly customaisable enviorments. Well I guess that was jsut too much for this game.Some of the smaller yet equally annoying things are the loss of the gong and rat mechanics, this is supposed to be compisated for by a large increase of the random events however I ahve no control over wether or not rats eat half my food now, instead of before where I was held somewhat accontable. Additionaly we lost the whole crime mechanic from two, so now if you ahve criminals you had best not punish them or else you will take a hit to the painfully fickel popularity meter.They also cut out much of the difficulty I as able to beat the war and ecconomic campains without ever having to redo a level.... on the hardest difficulty. Firstly since when do we have difficultys in a Stronghold game? one of the best things was that ti forced you to put your best food forward and guided you throught the process of knowing squat about how to run a castel to being albe to take on 4 wolfs at a time (wolf the lord not the animal) secondly while I am what I would call a compitant player, I should not have been able to get through two of the three campains with no deaths on my first runthrough.Overall buggy and far to easy, 4/10.

												I'm giving it a thumbs up not because it's a great game, because it's not. People have posted it's not a stronghold game, it is, just not a very good one. If your a die hard stronghold fan, thank you should explore it at least.The game felt like it wanted to be Stronghold two, where you develop your castle into more of a town, but they left out all the decorations. More so, unlike the other Stronghold's, there isn't one stage where you start from scratch and build how you want to build. Don't expect to build an epic army just to meet another epic army in the middle of the battle field and try to outwitt the AI all the while having another army building. Most of the game is simply surving.  Your always on the clock with a limited amount of days before the task is met or you made it through the attacks. What I didn't like was the limited amount of usage of the higher end units like swordsmen and knights, even crossbow men. Most of the game you use peasents as cannon fodder to protect your spear men. Though they added the ability for the spearmen to do a good amount of damange to soliders by throwing their spears, they are still the weak spearmen we all know.They did add a new type of soilder, the Ranger but since you only get to use the Ranger unit twice I never got the chance to explore the unit. If you look back to Crusaders and even stronghold legends, they have less units. No fighting monks and no mercs like the slaves that can burn down buildings or the archers on horse back. In fact there really is no use for the ""well"".The sieges are way to hard. You litterly have a handful of men and not enough seige weapons. It almost feel's like a puzzle and a touch of stealth when your taking down a castle. The one interesting aspect of the game I did like was the honor system. You buy statues and have varrious special buildings that allow you to throw a party which gives you honor which is needed to use higher end units like knights, swordsmen, macemen, but oddly enough not pikemen. For Multiplayer this is a great effect, it makes it so you just can attack right away like in so many other RTS games. By the time you can build a half way decent army, your going to have to go against the other players castle...But oops, if your lucky enough to find someone online playing, it's buggy once you both get building. I did like the fact that taxes actually were worth rasing and mining for materials paid a lot less which made it a must to have to build your own weapons. Unlike the other strongholds you do build weapons faster.The graphics are better, but not really haven't made leaps and bounds since the orginal. The stronghold series has never been about the graphics. I rather have had the game graphics dumb downed when the game first game out. It's pretty safe to say Firefly is finished with this game despite the few bugs it has. The only good thing that came out of this stronghold was the honor system, which is actually bearly used. Perhaps the only saving grace for stronghold 3 will be if the makers do a crusaders verison of the game. ",0,0,0,0,2,0,0

												This game is broken. Which is a shame because I enjoyed all the prequels so much.Mainly it's the building process that is bugged with the footprints of building jumping and turning all over the place and the whole process taking too long. And closing gaps in walls is near impossible. Can't even adjust game speed for that purpose.AI is totally bugged with soldiers marching right past enemy troops taking blows and not fighting back, no matter what you point or click.Sorry, unplayable.

												Stronghold 3 Gold is a game I want to enjoy but simply cannot. The prospect of building up my own castle and its economy in order prepare for war is an exciting proposition yet the unfinished and buggy nature of the game ruins this fantasy. If you enjoy bland graphics, soldiers stuck in the terrain, awful controls and path finding, and an unusable multiplayer than Stronghold 3 Gold is for you. I know many of you will be tempted, as I was, to snatch this game up while on steam sale, however, I recommend against doing so. It is not even worth buying on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sure the performance is better, but what about the actual gameplay?I very much recomend the previous Stronghold games, with this being the black sheep in the series.Avoid for now, however, I'll be giving it another chance when the developers get off their asses and finish the game!

The campaigns are super short and dont really let you build up your base design it and upgrade it you are very limited and its over before you can even get the really good troops. Nobody as far as i can tell plays online. Skirmish mode is similarily a disappointment there is only one mode that is a free build mode where you can actually build a civilization and design a base and get the really good troops and buildings. However the map is small and you cannot pit yourself against any ai. So im confused on what the point of it was. I would not recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun castle builder that they want to soak some time into.

												It pains me to give a stronghold game a bad review but it really is that bad. If you liked the first one and the orginal crusade and though the second one was ok this game is a further negative progression of that. The controls are difficult and its very laggy on a computer that can run battlefield 3 with ease. the game just wasent put together right from the start it wasent even worht the $8 i paid for it. I am very sorry that this franchise has come to this			",7,2,0,2,2,0,3

												Firefly betrayed my so badly with this game that I will never trust them with any amount of my money ever again.I have been a massive fan of the stronghold games to this point. Stronghold 2 is of my favorite games of all times. This game is terrible. It is worse than anything I have ever tried playing before. Not only are the small number of features in the game broken, but there is a reduced number of features from stronghold 2. They have done nothing to effectively fix any of the problems at all and the game looks and plays just terrible. Units will just walk through walls, not that one should even build walls as there seems to be no advantage to even doing so. Units have been taken out of the game. Most units will just stand there and take damage unless you specifically order them to attack enemies 1v1, in which case they will still only do one or two hits of damage before resuming their meat shield mechanic. The cut scenes are drawn with what looks like crayon or a large #2 pencil by someone who might have taken art in high school. On top of all of this rubbish they have also taken out kingmaker. Kingmaker was the mode that let one skirmish with CPU's all of which had different play styles. This was a ton of fun and pretty much all that one could do after the campagins were done. Now, if one has the nerve to trudge through hours of crap story and broken units, missions, and dialoge; one gets to sit on his/her thumbs and contemplate why the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor decision was made in the first place.I made the mistake of paying 60 dollars for this game. They could have simply re-released the stronghold 2 with an extra couple missions and I would have felt shorted, but content in the long run. The complete lack effort or pride in this game is enough to make one wonder why anyone would have even started on this project. I would now not only recommend not buying this game, but never buying and product that firefly ever produces.  This game is garbage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story is simple, the bad guys have returned in their classic overly zealous kill everything and team up approach as we've seen in other Stronghold games, but this time... well actually this time it's exactly the same as before. You begin with nothing but a small settlement and meaningless objectives and gradually progress across the medieval world growing in strength and defeating progressively strong foes. The story is very linear and there is no tutorial, guess work is what keeps the game a challenge to begin with.I'd really like to say it's a great game having been a fan of the series for years but I honestly wish I hadn't played it. The lack of tutorial or direction for the game frustrated me and despite the odd humorous comment by my adviser, I quickly grew bored. I can't recommend the game but if you do decide to buy it and can get your head around the unexplained and complicated economic system, you could get a good few hours of play from the game. While the previous games appealed to younger audiences, this game is simply too difficult without a tutorial for anyone too young.Pros:•	A lighthearted take on a grisly medieval world.•	Amusing characters.•	Wide range of units and buildings.•	A fairly complex economic system.Cons:•	A linear storyline.•	Lack of tutorial.•	No real advances since Stronghold 2.•	Essentially the same story as the previous 2 games.

												A total dissapointment; no kingmaker, no map editor, no real advancement from stronghold 2 and more importantly: no axe throwers. Visually pleasing but the gameplay is not to par with the previous games. It has been recomended that you buy (or pre-order) the latest installment of stronghold 2 as that at least has more gamemodes and variety.			",34,7,0,5,11,0,8

												I played Stronghold, and stronghold II crusaders..  I just bought the gold version for a few bucks in a sale. I only play the campaigns, and single player, and i found it very similar to the first game. Many of the early missions were direct copies or at least the exact same feel to them, but they had some interesting twists as well. There are some new additions to the game play that were not around in the first version, and that does add some depth, and helps you grow in power and prestigue while you grow your Feudal villages.  I did not come across many bugs, and have a feeling that many issues of the early game release have been fixed. Over all i found it a fun, yet simple castle building game, that really did remind me a lot of the first Stronghold.  Looking forward to seeing Crusaders II, and seeing if they can expand apon this version of the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stronghold 3 does not continue the franchise, it is almost like its a completly different game with a similar name... The main quest line is effectively one big tutorial, i have put a fair few hours of gameplay in and still i cant yet build any trebuchets... infact iv not yet developed a settlement and laid siege on an enemy.All missions so far are pre-determined scenario's, where u either have 100 troops to defend a pre-built castle NO BUILDING watsoever, or you build up a settlement again but this time you can use the one level higher unlocked houses, then u comeplete the mission and so forth, just like a huge♥♥♥♥♥long tutorial.Continous games that you set up yourself, dont bother thinking about it, those dont exactly exist, in the end i spent about 5 hours on the map creator, just to try and make a continous game with an enemy, even that was boring and shoddy...My vote is if you are buying this because its the next edition to the stronghold series, DONT Buy It!... pretend this is a random game with a similar name cause thats pretty much wat it is, if i could get a refund i would			",45,7,0,16,18,1,5

												For the sale price I recommend it.  However, it really was a kidney punch to my love for the series.  The bugs are bearable, but shouldn't be there.  I hear people complaining about crashes/freezes, honestly I get neither.  The major concern I have is the incredibly unhelpful fog, where if you zoom out more than 1/4 of the way you start to lose the landscape (brush, grass etc.) and that is irritating.  The other big one is units, and enemies getting caught in trees, buildings, and walls.Pros:Some UI's were increased from stronghold 2.Much easier and better capability for placing buildings.Graphics (but that should be obvious)Sale PriceCons:Irritating and gamebreaking bugs.Bad unit commands and limited ability to place them.Limited campaign that feels like a monkey had designed the goals.NO INTRO VIDEO!Lack of settings (either high or low settings)They put ""gold"" in the title as if to imply something valuable. (Misleading)Things I was happy to see:A New Stronghold gamesThings I was disappointed to see:The lack of effort put into it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrible game.. I haven't played the other stronghold games, but reading the reviews on this game alone is really saying something about it. Would not recommend it to anyone, still some bugs, most noticably for me is units getting stuck in the walls, enemy units become 'invisible', was only able to kill them by sieging inside my castle ontop of them. No skirmish. I didn't see that till after I bought the game.. would have never bought it otherwise. I wanted to try something new, I've been looking, I chose this and this has left a horrible impression. If you're looking for a castle seige game, look to an older stronghold or find a different game.. You're not getting much even if it is on sale unless you're doing campaign and multiplayer.

												Stronghold 3 could have been great! But by removing the skirmish mode from the other games ruined the game for me, not to mention it ruins this formerly great franchise by destroying what was great about the games in the franchise. Sadly the game has only better graphics and has worse gameplay then the previous games in the franchise. Another thing, for me anyway, the multiplayer doesn't work, period.There is now a limit to how many buildings you can have on the map at a time which kills the ablility to build the way you want.  if you want a better game in the franchise i reccomend Stronghold Legends or Stronghold 2, those are my personal favorites in the franchise so far. i would even reccomend stronghold and stronghold crusader over this, and i really didn't care for them taht much.

												The game itself isn't bad, its the options within it that are lacking. Do not think this is a game you can play singleplayer against the computers like Stronghold : Crusaders. This is strictly campaign (military and economy), free build, and multiplayer. Although I shouldn't say multiplayer because 95% of the time it is empty. The graphics are put together well, and it plays rather smooth. Would not buy this game at the $30.00 price tag, would definately wait until it dropped to under $10.00. Just realize your paying for a campaign and messing around in free build. Overall : A good game lacking in multiplayer access and AI versus you random maps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It has some MAJOR quirks. It's quite poor, to be perfectly honest... but it does still have flashes of the original stronghold brillance. Waves of enemies throwing themselves as your walls as you rain down thousands upon thousands of arrows. In some ways it looks better than ever, in other ways it looks a bit ugly... still, I think building a big castle and loading it up with archers just tips it over the line.On second review, the bugs and problems overwhelm the joy of spamming archers.

												It has some MAJOR quirks. It's quite poor, to be perfectly honest... but it does still have flashes of the original stronghold brillance. Waves of enemies throwing themselves as your walls as you rain down thousands upon thousands of arrows. In some ways it looks better than ever, in other ways it looks a bit ugly... still, I think building a big castle and loading it up with archers just tips it over the line.On second review, the bugs and problems overwhelm the joy of spamming archers. I wish it was good. It wasn't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is basically what happens if you try to force push out a game, undone, buggy  and full of regrets, the mechanics don't make mcuh sense either, they are very clunky, you can hardly even build your castle, obviously defending it is a nightmare, your enemies will ambush you like this - 20 men jump out of a little bush behind your lines, the sky glitches often causing you to not see the battlefield,  all of your units will attack ONE enemy  , but the enemy attacks all of yours , for example yo uhave 40 soldiers ready to throw their spears and they will throw them all at ONE enemy for an overkill and then go in wit hdaggers, but the AI hits all of yoursI WANT MY MONEY BACK this is a disgrace to the stronghold series, why isn't stronghold 2 on the steam shop? oh yeah, it was finished and playable...

												I should have read the reviews. The game is really glitchy. About 30 minutes into playing smoothly and efficiently, it begins to lag to an unplayable level. If i try to change the in-game graphic settings at that time, the game crashes. It's disappointing that the studio is still developing new games when their reputation for quality has been marred by this game. If they're not concerned with making games that work well, then why should consumers hope to trust any new releases?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is full of frustrating bugs that cripple it. They will especially affect the more difficult missions, where you are harassed by enemies, time limits and disasters and have to move quickly. Troops remain stuck on stairs, landscape or between buildings while trying to pass through, forget commands given to them, will take a much longer path instead of an obvious shorter one (which they must be especially guided to find it), will forget to fire when enemy is near and firing on them. Walls will fail to connect and close the perimeter when you build them, leaving you vulnerable just before an enemy attack. Game speed will be ok with a small/medium number of troops and buildings, but will suddenly slow down almost to a freeze when those increase (although this can be caused by my installed memory which is closer to the minimum requirements than the recommended one). Instead of optimizing the game they introduced a (configurable) limit in the number of buildings you can have. Limits aside, some of those bugs do not happen very often, but it becomes especially annoying when they happen. From the graphics point of view the game looks polished but not perfect (just minor problems compared to the rest). You can see that a lot of work has been done on it. It's just that it was released unfinished and has not received all necessary bug patches after release. I wonder if they will ever correct the remaining bugs, since it's been 2 years since release. A lot of people paid full price for it.I bought it in a bundle at a very low price (Stronghold 3 was practically free). So it's about other people's lost money. But there are important things to lose other than money: your time and your nerves. Be aware!			",27,5,2,2,10,0,5

												Pre-ordered the game as i was a huge stronghold fan. When the game came out it was an unbearable mess, so bug riddled it was literally unplayable. I didnt even care for the year 2000 graphics that nearly look worse than sh2, but like i said the game had so much bugs you could'nt play it at all. Month after month i waited hoping they may fix it, but no. Today (27.08.2015) i re-installed it just to look if they done anything. But no the game still looks like its a beta that just left the alpha stage. You can play it actually now, but you feel that its still unfinished. Bradbury milked his customers before with strognhold extreme and stuff. But this game is an absoloute outrage. Do not buy any simon bradbury games, do not buy firefly studio games.

												Well, lets start off on a good note: I do like the graphics. But that's about it. I loved Stronghold 2 and Legends, but this game doesn't really do the series any justice. It appears as if once you finish the campaign, there's not much else you can do besides sieges. You can't do a skirmish like you could do in either of the previous games, and it loses alot of the replay aspect because of this. I've also checked out the multiplayer scene, and there were no games to join, unless I was looking wrong, and I didn't want to start one if nobody appears to be playing multiplayer. That's got to be something wrong with my computer, or something; even a bad game with multiplayer capabilities still has SOME action there, right?			",3,0,0,1,6,0,16

												While I don't have much experience with the Stronghold games, I did play a little bit of Stronghold HD and Stronghold Crusader HD before playing Stronghold 3 Gold.Overall, I thought that Stronghold was quite well done: Pros:  Engaging and fun gameplay in the single player campaignsNo crashes (at least for me)Pretty decent graphics (in comparison to the older Stronghold games)Helpful Tutorial Cons: Slow loading time when first loading into a map, consecutive loads, even into different maps, are much faster, however.No need to build more stockpiles/granaries after the first one because stockpiles/granaries have infinite storage space. (unlike the previous games)Some missions seem a bit tedious (having spent an hour building an efficient castle layout in a very inconvenient map only to have to spam houses and lumber camps at the end to reach some arbitrarily high population count)""Cut scene"" images between campaign missions are black and white. Conclusion: Definitely not worth $30 but if you can get it on sale either by itself or bundled with the Stronghold Complete Pack for 85% off or so, I would definitely recommend it!

I have to admit that Stronghold 2, Legends and Crusader were much better made than this. It is not possible to play skirmish-mode games wich i really enjoyed in the older stronghold games and multiplayer is kinda boring too. The only thing that is better in this game than in the older stronghold games is graphics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Were the orginal games good? Hell ya! This game? Hell no!What happened? This looks like the previous one but with a slight graphics update and a new story which is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥The story is bland and horrible as you just complete some petty objectives and you get no sense of accomplishement. This looks like a horrible downgrade from the last good one.Not worth it.			",110,11,0,21,11,0,4

												Appalling. Should not have been released in the bug wridden state it is in. The game is currently quite literally unplayable because missions won't open. Don't hold your breath for MP or Free Build either. They are both just as broken.MP has sync issues which mean you cannot connect to games, and if you manage to they crash.Free Build I found either crashed or villagers stopped going to new buildings half way through, rendering the game unplayable.As for the Campaigns, Economic stopped offering me missions after mission 10, and Military after mission 4.I have asked on the forums only to be offered work arounds and fixes by Firefly that do not work and over two months after release and countless patches the game remains unplayable.

												Stronghold 3 Gold is a game I want to enjoy but simply cannot. The prospect of building up my own castle and its economy in order prepare for war is an exciting proposition yet the unfinished and buggy nature of the game ruins this fantasy. If you enjoy bland graphics, soldiers stuck in the terrain, awful controls and path finding, and an unusable multiplayer than Stronghold 3 Gold is for you. I know many of you will be tempted, as I was, to snatch this game up while on steam sale, however, I recommend against doing so. It is not even worth buying on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game that seems little updated from it's prequel, Stronghold 2. If anything, Stronghold 3 has no new features, and downgraded features from it's predecessor. The campaign is poor and the new game engine is unenjoyable. The game crashes frequently and the lack of new -anything- means one would be better off purchasing Stronghold 2 for less money.

Why release something like this? They say they've added updates but I just don't see much improvement. Sure the performance is better, but what about the actual gameplay?I very much recomend the previous Stronghold games, with this being the black sheep in the series.Avoid for now, however, I'll be giving it another chance when the developers get off their asses and finish the game!

												Terrible game.. I haven't played the other stronghold games, but reading the reviews on this game alone is really saying something about it. Would not recommend it to anyone, still some bugs, most noticably for me is units getting stuck in the walls, enemy units become 'invisible', was only able to kill them by sieging inside my castle ontop of them. No skirmish. I didn't see that till after I bought the game.. would have never bought it otherwise. I wanted to try something new, I've been looking, I chose this and this has left a horrible impression. If you're looking for a castle seige game, look to an older stronghold or find a different game.. You're not getting much even if it is on sale unless you're doing campaign and multiplayer.

												Having played all of the other Stronghold games by the lovely firefly studios, my hopes were high.  Dashed upon the rocks they were, throwing up at me from all angles of this delectable piece of garbage.  Ignoring the reviews from the other websites and friends that told me what a piece of trash this was, I played anyway.My disappointment is so great that this is the only game I would remove from my steam games list if it were possible.  Flora's fruit farm was a better war game then this collection of heartbreaking ones and zero's that now take up space on my list.  A game that had such promise, and with a great community and die hard fans to back it, has dug its own grave, jumped in it and then instead of dirt, used its own fecal matter to bury itself alive. No wonder Firefly Studios has abandoned this game, they spent a grand total of 300$ and a drunken frat party weekend putting this♥♥♥♥♥♥together, spew it out for 60$, which the fans bought, and then face♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them by the dozens.  Thank you Firefly for showing your fans how much care and effort you put into your new games.  I will be telling as many people that will listen to never buy another game from your Studio again.  P.S. And no skirmish mode?  How much do you like men Firefly?  Because I just got♥♥♥♥♥raped.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

While stronghold 2 ruined the original game, it was still playable, this one is just  terrible. And 2 years after being released it's still buggy and unplayable. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I am also going to boycott Firefly after this...thing... they do not deserve more of my money, I feel like I've been robbed and cheated by them.I paid 50 euros for this, ultimately receiving not even .50s of fun.

												This is a warning to stay away, your money is far better off going into the Stronghold Collection rather than this steaming pile of crap. The missions are redicilously hard for a new user (which I was able to get around because I've played the previous titles), and the gameplay is buggy as hell. Sure they made the game LOOK nicer, but being unable to place soldiers on walls, and having wolves glitch through wall corners destroys any realism the game had.I haven't played multiplayer, but from the BS I'm getting just trying to get through the storyline, I'm quite afraid to even try it.

												One of the most exciting RTS games ever made. Economy matters so much, which makes it more interesting to keep up with others. Advancing to different ages (getting better upgrades) is also very creatively made. You have to get enough honor to advance. There are 3 different campaigns. First is based on attack, second more based on building your city and third..well, I haven't tried it yet but I have to say..I am absolutely loving the campaign so far.Definitely worth the price.

												I was very much looking forward to this game, and actually preordered it before completion. That was a mistake.First off, i remember seeing ""Co-op Campagin"" early on in one of the features the game would have. It did not have this at its release. This leads on to the previous installment Stronghold 2, which was, in my opinion, a catastrophe. I've never played a game with so many bugs, so much that the campaign was unplayable, and I mean really unplayable - The game would simply crash.Looking at the first installment in the series Stronghold. This first one was actually pretty good. There was still an amount of bugs or glitches, but it was playable, and I really liked that one. The memory of the good times I had with the first game, was probably what made me buy this one. I made a mistake...Firefly Studios really screwed me over on this.Stronghold 3 is just another messy, buggy and awful game. The game was clearly not complete when they released it, and it goes to show how good Firefly Studios is. This will be the last game I buy from them, without atleast trying the demo first.

												This game is constantly on sale for good reason. Economy camp was not so bad but still present with bugs (the most breaking one was as I got whole army stuck on one forest tile because they chased one unkillabe bandit who got stuck there = loosing whole army, luckily I was able to produce enough new troops to deal with the bandit camp before time limit ended)Content feels like mixture of Stronghold 1, 2 and kingdoms (control panel, proximity bonus) with nearly identical grphic of Stronghold 2.Economy aspekt works but military and especially castle building (which always was highlight of the series) is by far the worst of the whole series. I stopped military camp as soon as I was required to build a wall - mechanic completely ruined. You build whole sections with minimal freedom + meele troops can again crush through it.It is often on sale with 1HD + 2 and legends (avoid this one too). I took it on sale (80%) only to get Stronghold 1 and 2 for very reasonable price making Legends and 3 free bonus. It is the only way to buy this game without regrets. Ecenomy camp is not as bad but very short.			",64,10,0,20,48,0,62

												I wouldnt recommend this game for the price i would maybe pay 5 bucks for it. The campaigns are super short and dont really let you build up your base design it and upgrade it you are very limited and its over before you can even get the really good troops. Nobody as far as i can tell plays online. Skirmish mode is similarily a disappointment there is only one mode that is a free build mode where you can actually build a civilization and design a base and get the really good troops and buildings. However the map is small and you cannot pit yourself against any ai. So im confused on what the point of it was. I would not recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun castle builder that they want to soak some time into. It was a massive dissappointment to me and i wish i could get my 30 dollars back.			",20,4,0,15,1,0,12

												Multiple issues with ""crazy mouse wheel"" bug and a lot of in-game crashes on windows XP and now unable to play with an up to date Windows 7 system.Many DLC's but the game doesn't work nor updates are being rolled out to fixing these important bugs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played Stronghold 1 & 2 and loved them both, the third one feels like it was rushed to market or something. It has been glichy and crashes almost every time I play it. The castle bulding is ackward and the mouse controls are unintuitive. It could have been a lot better if a few more bugs had gotten worked out.			",5,0,0,0,5,0,1

												If you have the option of Stronghold 3 or any other Stronghold game, choose any other game. This game is in no way like the original games, the graphics may be fancy and enticing but they are not even worth the 4 dollars this game is now and personally 4 dollars is charging way to much for this game and I fell horrible for buying it. Stick with the old games and don't even bother with this one.			",57,1,0,13,12,0,15

												Multiplayer is horrible, just spent 30 dollars on this game only for it to sit in my library never to be played EVER! You can spend your life trying to connect to 1 online match, I want a damned refund to be honost and this game should be taken off steam for being so bad or atleast untill they fix the multiplayer			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have tried to like this game, many times I have tried. We were lied to about this game and 3 years later it still does not live up to half the hpe. I have 7 or different titles by this studio and believe this was just a scam to raise money for the onliner Kingdoms. Not gonna ever pre-purchase ANYTHING from Firefly... Which is sad because Stronghold Crusader 2 is around the corner and not falling for their deception again. Gold edition or not, this title just is not fun... It just lays there like a dog turrrd in the corner..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After all this time and they still haven't worked the bugs out, such as units getting trapped in walls.  They abandoned this unfinished game and admitted that there will be no more patches.  Firefly's attitude toward their customers who have problems with this game has ensured that I will never play another Firefly product.  Stick with the original Stronghold games if you want a bug-free experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not bad, but nto as good as the originol ones. They took some of the godo stuff out and replaced it with other things which i dont think work. Also the storyline is boring and the graphics are pretty bad considering this is a newer version of the game. You almsot couldnt tell the differance between Stronghold 2 graphics wise.

												That game is such a deception, what a pity!!!! And sorry but the graphics are lousy, you can t even see properly your troopes on the wall because everything is dark... I am really fan of Stronghold 2 but the 3 is not the same.			",13,1,0,1,1,0,1
