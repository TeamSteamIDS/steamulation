								I decided that Pluto should take revenge on the other planets for downgrading it.I slammed Charon into Pluto, along with a couple more Kuiper objects to make it bigger.Once it was a little bigger than Mercury, I slammed it into Mercury.Then Venus.Then Mars.Then Earth.Then, I slammed a few more Earths into it to make it larger.Then I put it up against Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.Pluto won every time, growing ever bigger.Something odd happened when I slammed it into Jupiter, though. The two bodies started to orbit each other very quickly, Jupiter slowly getting torn apart into little fragments, orbiting Pluto.Then, Pluto ate all of the fragments.But it didn't stop there.Pluto, even though it was leauges smaller than the sun, flew directly toward it.Upon impact, the sun exploded, creating a massive nebula. At the center of it was Pluto, unharmed.I kept slamming it into suns.Eventually, I slammed it into VY Canis Majoris.Then, lag.When the lag ended, I zoomed back into Pluto, still alive. But something was different.Instead of a supermassive planet/star thing, there was a small glowing dot.Was it a black hole? I don't know.It was no larger than the sun, and glowing a pleasant red glow, but distorted light near it like a black hole.I saved it, and put it into a stock solar system.It immediately ate the sun, and sent every other body flying out into interstellar space at 10000 km/s.I dubbed this cataclysmic object Pluto Nova.10/10 would make Pluto destroy the universe again			",45,7,0,9,14,0,7

								I have privately and publicly alpha tested this game since Alpha 8.3.  I bought the original US in 2009.  The pace of development on US2 is amazing.  I personally have a fascination in space, astrophysics and any science that governs the workings of the universe from particles to galaxies... and the original US was one of the most amazing things I had ever seen...  Even in its now-considered retro theme, it was an opportunity to see all my knowledge, applied, in the universe, for the very first time, in a free sandbox.  Now we have US2, and I cant explain how great this program is.This is one of those games that cannot be matched by anything else.  I have run US2 on several computers, 4 to be precise, and it has run exceptionally on all of them, ranging from potatoes to near 6GHz monsters.  I would say 90% of US2's features have been implemented in this year alone.  This game always make me wonder, ""Imagine US2 next month!  It will be TEN times better!"".  US2 devs are open to suggestions and are quick to respond to your questions on the US2 forums.  The US2 community is like that of nowhere else.It really is amazing how many features are in this game...  I mean, most of them you will rarely use because you are too busy wrecking the universe and smashing stuff together!  The main reason I think people hesitate to buy this game (if they hesitate at all), is because it is in alpha...  Sure, there are a few bugs.  They are not game-breaking though, and the game runs flawlessly on default settings.  Thats why we alpha tested it waaaay before it came out on steam, to get the diamond of US2 as perfect as we could.This really is my lifetime favourite game.  Even in Alpha 8.3, when the devs accepted my alpha testing form, it was one of, if not the most, exciting thing ever.  I was one of just a handful of people around the world with US2.  Now in Alpha 16, you can experience that, but nearly 2x more jaw-dropping excitement and wow-factoryness! (according to the version numbers!).  Every single update they improve the game so much, I sit there, universe sandboxing, jaw dropped.  It is a truly amazing experience to play a game like this, this totally unique game, like nothing I had seen before.A really important thing I would like to mention... If you dont know, US2 developers are working hard on (at some point, soon) adding SPH.  That stands for (S)omething i forgot, (P)article (H)ydrodynamics.  Go have a look on youtube, it is a simulation of the planet in many different particles.  This means it can break up when under tidal stress, and deform awesomely in collisions!  They are going to implement this into the 3-D already complex simulation of US2.  And you thought the game was already amazing!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Universe Sandbox isn’t a game per se; there are no bosses, aims or levels, merely an accurate model of astronomical bodies for you to fiddle with. It’s really more of a toy :O – the virtual equivalent of a configurable orrery, except hugely more complex than any mechanical system.  That complexity is one of the key attractions that Universe Sandbox possesses. Using the vast range of variables and tools at your disposal you can create some enormously convoluted displays of physics, bending cosmic laws to your will out of nothing more than a desire to see pretty patterns form on your screen :). You can move galaxies around so that they tear themselves apart beautifully, casting off clouds of stars into the abyss as part of their death throes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
Introduction Universe Sandbox ² is a physics-based simulator from eight person team, Giant Army. Universe Sandbox ² is, as you’d expect, a sandbox simulation and therefore you can do pretty much whatever you want within the game’s limitations. Would you like to see what happens to our Solar System when the force of gravity is doubled? You can do that! Want to know what Earth would look like after the moon collided with it? You can find out!Full Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.Presentation Universe Sandbox ² is a good looking simulator. While the textures aren’t great if you zoom in right up to them they do generally look good. The models are all high quality and the visual effects in the game are absolutely brilliant. The developers have done a good job at making the game look as realistic as possible without making it too PC power hungry. As well as looking pretty the game’s appearance is functional. The UI is fairly basic and it doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb but it manages to give the user all the information and options needed to enjoy the simulator. You’ve also got the option to have visible orbits, trails, labels etc. which when on give the user a lot of information but when off allow for some great screenshots to be taken.Gameplay I’m not sure gameplay is really the right word for Universe Sandbox ² but I’ll run with it anyway. It’s quite difficult to talk about Universe Sandbox ²’s gameplay as it’s very much what you make of it. For example, if you spend all of your time creating functioning solar systems you’re going to have a rather different experience to someone who mindlessly smashes planets into each other. Those two cover one of the main ways to enjoy the simulation, creating your own scenarios. You’re given access to all of the objects in the game and you can manipulate them however you want to. As well as choosing where to place them relative to other celestial bodies you’re also given a great deal of customisation options for each celestial body such as what materials make up most of its mass or how much mass the celestial body actually has. You can also change what kind of climate planets have through the same menu as the other options or by simply moving the celestial bodies closer or further away from other bodies which have an influence on them.The other way to enjoy Universe Sandbox ² is to simply run the scenarios which the simulator comes with such as an accurate model of our solar system or a collision between two versions of Jupiter! This is really for those, like myself, who just enjoy watching that kind of thing and of course like watching planets smash into each other. I mean, who wouldn’t enjoy watching two planets smashing into each other? There are already loads of scenarios available in the game and more are being added. Like you can when creating your own scenarios, you’re able to do whatever you want with these scenarios too such as add more planets to your scenario or edit the materials a celestial body is made of.Miscellaneous You have complete control over how fast the simulation is, you can have each real second represent anything from a millisecond to billions of years.Universe Sandbox ² has a nice, relaxing soundtrack which fits nicely with calm simulations and contrasts perfectly with huge collisions.The celestial bodies in the game range from small asteroids to supergiant stars and black holes. There are even some human sized objects in the game including the Monolith from 2001.The eight person team consists of a numerical physicist, a climate scientist and an astrophysicist as well as ‘regular’ game developers.While Universe Sandbox ² isn’t too taxing on your GPU you are going to need a pretty beefy CPU to get a good frame rate on some of the more complex simulations.Verdict Worth Purchasing. Universe Sandbox ² is a realistic and interesting physics-based sandbox from Giant Army with good graphics and a lot to do. It may not offer much to your average gamer but for those with a real fascination with space it’s a real treat. It may be a bit pricey so for those average gamers I’d suggest holding off for some kind of discount but if you’re a space nut like myself then it’s worth it.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.

								This is a simulator, not really a game.  If you have a problem with that then please go watch some videos about this before buying it and then downvoting it.  With that being said, this is a gem worth owning, and I proudly bought it directly from the developer before it was even available on early access.-----edit: So many angry people in the comments; sorry you guys can't have a beer with the developer like me.

								This game is a very good reminder of the precarious balance in which the universe hangs. I mean, all it takes is a red dwarf star to s̶p̶a̶w̶n̶  mysterously appear out of nowwhere and crash into the sun in order to cause a cataclysmic event that causes a b̶e̶a̶u̶t̶i̶f̶u̶l̶  truely awful explosion of the entire solar system. This game also makes you appreciate that the sun doesn't suddenly become a billion times more dense and turn into a black hole in which all life as we know it is killed most horribly. And we are most certainly glad the moon doesn't collide with an exact replica of itself and slowly destroy the Earth with pieces of debris; at least until another moon collides with the earth because the small pieces of debris were taking too long. And yet, amidst all this potential destruction, here we are. And I still can't hit Earth with golf balls fired from Mars.Edit: Though as it turns out I can hit Earth with Mars fired from Mars, and if fired with a weak enough force I can hit Mars, with Mars fired from Mars.

								EDIT: Review still remains true, although VR is pretty ok; But difficult to useEDIT 2: It's been almost half a year since I wrote this review, but it still seems true. The development on this game simply isn't fast enough. They've pushed out a few updates but nothing that significant. I'm really hoping to see somthing that allows you to view and control life on planets.Great game, it really is... But on this one I have to write a negative reviewAs I assume, your looking to see if this game is worth it. I was in that position too,  I ignored the negative reviews thinking ""This game looks amazing!"" Not saying it isn't, but there just isn't enough contentAt first it's super cool, after 30 minutes you get a bit bored, After an hour you find yourself just hopelessly creating meteors to create a universe, or smashing planets into each other and it just gets plain boring.So, do yourself a favor, don't ignore this review wait untill the game has more content, THEN and only THEN decide if you want it.I'd suggest  this	 game			",70,10,2,6,19,3,1

								The universe was created in 7 days by our holy entity Megatruck, blessings upon Him, henceforth to be named God.On the first day, God pressed the 'new' button, thereby errasing the Solar system from existence. At first there was nothing, and God said,""Let there be light."" He had to rummage through the star folder. An then there was light, to be more precise a small white star that God had destined to be named, ""Cheese Ball."" And God looked upon Cheese Ball and saw that it was good, made out of Hydrogen and Helium rather than powdered cheddar. God looked upon the area surrounding Cheese Ball,  and figured it to be desolate. And lo, a small circular rock was placed by our heavenly father that circled around Cheese Ball with great vigor. It had a sad existence, useless to life, and was christened with the title, ""Maxwell the firey spacedot."" God had thought it weird to have a perfect circular orbit, so God clicked on Maxwell the firey spacedot's tab and revealed a metric forkton of settings. After twiddling with them for a few hours, and finally stopping that infernal white trail coming from Maxwell the fiery spacedot for some reason, called off the universe and saved it away in a file named, ""srgblga."" On the second day, Maxwell the fiery spacedot's orbit was appropriately ovaloid. God then demmanded, ""There should be life here!"" No one was going to do it for Him, He was God afterall, the lazy trunkbasket.And He should stop capitalizing His pronouns, it's annoying. Stop it. So, he found out Cheese Ball's Goldilocks zone, placed a nice white planet down, screwed with it's orbit, decided the pre-generated name Rxnamien didn't fit this gift of his, and called it, ""Nimrod."" And so Nimrod was, for a few seconds, and then God added water to it's makeup. He waited. Then, God bellowed, ""Why snt there life? Water is the foundation of life as I know it!"" He then accelerated time by a few millenia, slowed it down again, and gave Nimrod a moon, because habitable planets all have moons, right? And this moon, oh what a moon. it was a golden yellow, a shiny, magnificent ball, worthy to a god such as he. Honoring it with the title, ""Dorfff,"" God wondered at the beauty of a night sky adorned by Dorfff.  He then commanded, ""GROW SOME LIFE MEDAMMIT."" and overwrote srgblga and closed the game in a heaveny furor. On the third day, God's still trying to create some life in dis birch. On the fourth day, he finally got an atmosphere, but jack anything else. On the fifth day, God is trying to BALANCE THE GREENHOUSE DEAR ME TOO MUCH TOO LITTLE WHYYYY. On the sixth day, God decided it would be nice to ploomp some gas giants in the distance. And lo, Garumpf and Smorgasbord were born. They were useless, but adorned with moons, ranged from planet sized to are-you-even-trying sized. Time to get funky with their orbits, or so.  on the seventh day, God FINALLY CREATES SUM LIL' CITIES THEY ARE SO CUTE. Despite being blurry dots of white only visible on the dark side of Nimrod, God feels an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. God saves over srgblga, and watches the cosmos he has created. He then gets bored and lobs a red dwarf at Cheese Ball,thus crating a cataclysmic event starting with planets losing their orbit and ending in a supernova, obliterating everything, including the framerate. God closes the game, and eats some pizza. And thus ends the story of God. TL/DR: Read it please unless you don't like short stories about me being a malevolent being creating life and destroying it. 10/10 would cry in joy at the miracle of life and then meniacly laugh as they all burn to spacedust again.

Early Access Review
								First off I definitely recommend this game, but like all games it has downsides.This may be a bit of a read, but where is a good review without its detail right?One of the first things I noticed, when you buy this game that's it, you have the entire game, no special objects I have to buy, if I want to throw a football with the mass of a sun at a teapot the size of our earth, then I can do it as soon as I purchase this game. Which I can tell would appeal to most people.I'll go over my favourite aspect of the game now, but to save me rambling on about every little feature I enjoy, I'll make a list after this. The thing I love most about this game, is the creativity and curiosity this game brings. As I mentioned before; but who could imagine that you can make a football our solar systems apocalypse?! One things this game does  indeed do very well, is catching the interest and curiosity of people, but also allowing quite a fair bit of creativity.As I said before I will now make a quick list of all the other things I enjoy a lot about this game:-Black Holes (you'll spend a lot of your time, if not most of it messing around with black holes).-Watching what happens when our sun evolves.-Blowing up every item in the game.-What happens if's (with the earth especially).-Trying to make another earth from scratch.-Turning a teapot into a sun.-Creating a Solar System.-Creating a very small galaxy.-Messing around with the milkyway.-Making a potential universe descructing object.-Watching the beautiful simulations, with the beautiful music playing.Those pretty much cover what I'll be doing and you'll most likely be doing in this game, but the things is, I know there are some more things in the game I haven't started to look at yet, which I will do very soon; they also keep updating this game, so I am always on the look out for any interesting additions they put in.Alright, so like with every game, it has a few downsides. Here are a few.After about three hours of playing and testing things out, I started to feel a bit bored and I felt as if I had tried everything that is worth doing (blowing up the earth a million times, and putting a black hole at the centre of our solar system). So what I would say the developers is this, perhaps for a future game, or to just make a big update for this one, think about what more content could you add into this game, or how much more detail can you go into with what happens in space, just to add those extra few hours of interesting gameplay; that being said, I could probably play this for a maximum of two amazing hours, creating my own universe, and creating several apocalyptic situations, then a minimum of a week and a bit, of a break before wanting to play and do that all again. A small suggestion for what you could add; add or make a load more options of what if situations, and perhaps more interesting or ambitious what ifs, like what if aliens were real and invaded our solar system, or what if earth advanced space travel so much they were travelling around our solar system as easy as people can get on a bus now. Maybe too ambitious but you start to see my point.A final thing, only small, and not the most important downside, but something I certainly picked up upon, and thought, hmm, would have been better with this; is the whole black holes being the most destructive force situation. In this game, all they are, are huge slingshots. Now, I know black holes do something to do with shooting objects out at incredibly high speeds, but I'm no expert. However I also know, or at least have heard from people who are meant to be experts, that under the great force of the gravity a black hole has, objects that are pulled towards it are torn to pieces by the strength of the gravitational pull; and for a lot of people interested in black holes, this is one main thing they focus on; the destructive power it brings wherever it goes. In this game, as I said before, I only see a slingshot, a bunjee jump, to me, a black hole in this game is far from being as deadly and chaotic as they are said to be by experts. I'm almost sure this is to do with the design of the game, that limits this feature, or to do with the time it might have taken to make these extra small details added in; but considering the large majority who will spend most of their time playing around with black holes; I STRONGLY suggest to the developers, that again, either in a very future version of this game, or a large update later on, that there is some sort of design that let's us all see that truly great power a black hole holds, and how merciless it can be.Those are the two main downsides in this game for me. Although, in conclusion, I certainly recommend this game, it is still fairly new, and having regular updates, (mainly the little fixtures us gamers don't notice very much), but it can give a lot, answer a lot of your curious questions about space, and it is still extremely fun to play. Definitely worth it, and quite frankly, you can never get bored of tossing the moon at earth. Oh, and Developers, if any of you read this, of course, great game, very well done, so congratulations, but also take into account what improvements that I have said could be there in the future.Thanks!

								So i decided to fight global warming by lowering the amount of Co2 in the atmosphere to 0. The tempature started dropping. 2 years later i realised i had created snowball earth so i decided to warm the earth up by shooting the moon at earth. 10/10 would create snowball earth again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								In my first moments with it in SteamVR, I accidentally threw a clone of Earth's moon into Earth's orbit. It audibly and visibly crashed right into the first moon. Not knowing the controls, I could only watch in horror as the exploding mass collided with Earth, decimating the entire planet and turning it into an uninhabitable fireball. Eventually I figured out how to restart the simulation and undo my mistake. Naturally, when I restarted, relieved the Earth was safe again, the first thing I did was throw seven additional moons into orbit and watch the whole thing in slow motion. 5/5 would watch Earth blow up again.

								This program is great to satisfy ones curiosity and is THE answer to all space related ""what if...?"" questions Hey what would happen if the Moon was only 10.000 km away from Earth?Hey what would it need to make Mars habitable?Hey what would happen if our Sun had a small brother?Ahh...I wish this program had already existed when I was 10 years old...So many galactic mysteries would have been solved.The game is for you if you are generally interested in space, planets and solar systems.It is similar to Kerbal Space Program in the notion that you learn a lot while playing it.But unlike Kerbal Space Program you have to entertain yourself, because, apart from a few scenarios, the game doesn´t provide something akin to a story or ""career mode"".Don´t look at Universe Sandbox as a game but as an interactive science book and physics lab where you can play god and hurl around black holes for fun or learn something about celestial bodies by creating your own solar system from scratch.

								I don't think I've ever experienced a game that has made me cry in awe. This game changed that. This is much more than a game. I'ts an experience that shows you just how microscopic we are in the grand scale of the universe. We're nothing, everything and all else inbetween, One simple change and our whole planet ceases to exist. Hopefully this ""game"" opens your eyes to just how delicate, frigaile and unique our very existence is. The universe is a beatiful, chaotic, and violent place which we barely understand. Download this and experience just how small we are. It's humbling. And beautiful. And tragic. And undeniably an example of how a ""game"" can change your whole outlook on the very thing we call life. 10/10			",33,29,2,8,38,0,3

								After my gameplay of Universe Sandbox 2, I decided to write a review on one of the most fantastic games in the universe in my opinion.- Universe Sandbox 2 is a very detailed simulation. It show this in the craters that forms after you collide an object into another, in the elevation as seen by adding water onto the surface of the object, and also in the accuracy on the simulation of gravitational pulls of bodies.- Universe Sandbox 2 contains a simple, efficient design as compared to the original Universe Sandbox. ""Home"" dispays system-included simulations under ""Open"" and also displays templates under ""Create"". You also have a ""Learn"" section where you learn different interesting facts of some interesting or bizzare objects in the Universe. The Properties Menu show the basic information of an object, climate information of the object, and the materials that made up the object.- Universe Sandbox 2 controls the timestep in lagging times. If the game thinks that the frame rate is too low, it automatically controls the timestep slower in order to make your experience with the game better.- The Giant Army is a friendly group that helps your solve your technical issues in Universe Sandbox 2. If you have any problems with your experience in Universe Sandbox 2, the developers are there to help. Just make sure that you post your problem on to either the Steam discussion group or the Universe Sandbox forums and they will (usually) give you a reply within 15 hours.			",23,4,0,2,8,0,7

								So after many countless hours of fun i thought it is time to write a review!The game is well put together and is very instresting and enjoyable the graphics are outstanding and the game itself is very unique! the game is really worth the purchase as its a game to always come back to because you can do so much! it truly is a unqie and terrific simulationOnly downfall is that the game can get a tad tidus and as after a while! you sort of realise that it the game does not get updated that regular which i think is a sham as the game itself is terrfic! I personally think that the next steps would be to add the feature of life, even just being able to see the life created thrive and possible but smart enough to build satalites and other space mechanics! just being able to see if you made a planet that could host life and you could actually see there satilites in orbit as if it was a moon and could see what the object looked like! also being able to see there shuttles created flw towards a planet or moon and would be easy to add as the flight path could look like an object on course to crash into the planet if you know what i mean. This may sound alot to add but personal think it would be a great idea and would add 1000+ hours onto my universal sandbox experince			",13,2,0,1,7,1,4

YouTube™ Video: Universe Sandbox ² [Game Review] 

			Views: 754		

			For more information: http://universesandbox.com/2 ------------------------------- My review of ""Universe Sandbox ²"", the sequel to the 2011 space simulator, developed and published by Giant Army.		

Game: Universe Sandbox ²Genre: Space SimulatorDeveloper: Giant Army Publisher: Giant Army Copy supplied by developer Universe Sandbox ² is the sequel to the 2011 space simulator, developed and published by Giant Army. GRAPHICSThe game has improved a lot graphically compared to the original: there are many more particle effects, better textures, climate changes that affect the look of each planet and also great performance that makes this game playable on basically every system there is. GAMEPLAYIn this simulator, you can move planets, change their properties, spawn supernovas or black holes and see what happens. In addition to what was already in the first game, there is a more user-friendly UI, the possibility to modify the materials and climate of the different planets and many more to be added in the future. But you have to remember that this is not really a game, so you set your own goals: maybe you want to destroy the entire galaxy with a giant black hole, maybe you want Mars to transform into a supernova that burns other planets. The possibilities are endless. SOUNDThey have just added a soundtrack to the game, which is beautiful: it makes all the science and experiments more enjoyable and helps deliver a relaxing experience. REPLAYABILITYThe possibilities are truly endless, and as soon as you get the hang of it, you will start modifying all the different planets just to see what happens. Lovers of space simulators will play this for many years to come, also because the developers are constantly updating the game. I like to think that this is more of an actual software, than it is a game. If you like everything that is related to space, than this is a must-buy. It's a great sequel, and a relaxing game.

								I've wanted this game for ages, pretty much since the day it was released but I finally saved up enough money to buy it for myself. And I've got to say, having played for 3 hours, my first impression is that this is absolutely incredible. The sheer joy of creating my own planets and putting them in to our Solar System, or putting a sun-sized football as a replacement for the Sun. The amount you learn in this game is mind-blowing, and makes you realise the size of the universe. It's almost scary. And of course, who doesn't love a bit of destruction? It's hilarious throwing moon-sized teapots at Earth and throwing one planet at another. If you're not sure about this game, get it. There's nothing like experiencing it for yourself, watching videos has nowhere near as much excitement and thrill as it is to do it yourself. You may think ""oh god I'm spending £18.99"", and so did I. But just think of the incredible detail and the amount of possibilities in this sim. It's in Alpha! The game isn't even finished yet and it's already better than any game I've spent £20 on, by the time it's finished I reckon the possibilities will be endless and the experience will be like no other. For the people complaining about boredom after 30 minutes, remember - it is in Alpha. By full release I don't think you'll ever be bored again!Seriously impressed.			",26,2,2,3,7,0,0

								""The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena"" -Carl Sagan.Universe Sandbox 2 at its core is a mere physics simulator. Simple enough but the vastness of the scale is overwhelming. While quite the fantastic computer program alone, I strongly urge that one would enjoy it with the HTC Vive.  One may spend a moment above the Solar system and marvel at the orrery precision of the paths taken by the planets revolving in the middle of your room, and then fly in on your favorite planet to scrutinize at a naturalistic scale as a true behemoth careens by at a dwarfing 1:1 perspective.  Fire a few asteroids here and there to examine the unwavering momentum of whatever hapless body pulled it out of a straight trajectory, but you will find yourself depositing stars nearby such as Rigel which consider the entire Solar System to be a mere morsel.  There are things out there that are truly and terrifyingly massive.I have always had a passion for astronomy so this game is quite the treat.  My 60-year-old father has also taken to the game with an astonishing fervor so I bought him his very own Vive so he would stop bumming around my place hogging my video games. Alas, I have shown many friends and family members this game, often as an induction into VR as I set up a gorgeous scene and put them game on pause to then have them put the headset on to blow their minds.  My favorite scenario is a few planets being vaporized as they rotate perilously close to a violent neutron star.  I find myself teaching others about ""what the ♥♥♥♥ am I looking at?"" and ""why is it doing that thing?"" and ""this stuff really exists!?"" and ""why is space so damn beautiful?"".  Dispensing moments of pure astonishment has become a past time. I've become the Carl Sagan of my living room as I take people on my Ship of the Imagination to show them what vast ocean teems beyond their small island of which they know.If you hold the beauty of the cosmos in reverence, I suggest you try this game out on VR. Nothing quite compares to having lunch in orbit around the Earth and then releasing a generous salvo of Moons at it and reveling in your wanton destruction. Then you add hydrogen gas until the Earth becomes a gas giant, then a brown dwarf, full star, neutron star, black hole, then grow that black hole until its more massive than the observable universe and then you win the game! Mwuahahaha!!  Who wants to be Space God when you can be Space Devil? The universe is your sandbox.Dad quit hogging my sandbox.			",243,40,5,32,52,3,38

								Universe Sandbox 2 is one of those games whose title describes what you're about to buy.It offers you a complete freedom in creating your own little world and do with it what your heart desires. And that world is not limited to just planets or asteroids, but extends to objects as small as a pair of dice and as large as the biggest galaxy in our universe. You are essentially playing as a cosmological god, creating and destroying; terraforming and making places go extinct.This is one of the best if not the best space games available out there and although there is not true storyline or purpose in it, you will definitely be able to enjoy creating and destroying things as long as you have a bit of imagination.I've used this game as a tool to teach about astronomy, astrophysics and even history and have definitely enjoyed every moment of my time in this game.It is still not perfect and far from being the ultimate space sandbox, but it is as close to the ultimate space game as you can currently get.The team is very dedicated to making this game great and is very quick to respond to bugs, comments or concerns.Give this a go, you won't regret it.Check out my 100s of videos of this title here:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9hNFus3sjE7jgrGJYkZeTpR7lnyVAk-xHere's one of the recent examples where I recreated Skyrim universe using the game:

								This is a very interesting game, especially for those who are interested in Astrology and Physics on a Cosmic level. Despite being fairly easy on graphics and the CPU (unless you go nuts with the amount of simulated objects, time scale, or try to zoom in on a supernova), this will accurately simulate the size, position, movment, mass rotation, general appearance, temperature, magnetic fields, basic composition, and gravitational fields of known stars, planets, planetoids, asteroids, black holes etc. In addition to being packed with pre-made simulations of the Solar System (major planets only, planets and major moons, all moons, or even every known object in the solar system - there is a surprising amount of them) you can change everything that is simulated at will. Alter the positions, rotations, from the size and mass down to the composition and temperature, everthing is adjustable. You can remove and place objects at whim, either standing still or with a predetermined vector. You can even mess with their mass and composition by manually adding material to them - add enough hydrogen to the sun and it will turn into a blue star! The game also simulates collisions between all the objects to a limited degree, considering the scale of the collisions. This truly is a facinating creation that I look forward to seeing grow and develop.			",110,21,4,18,20,0,13

								This is a really good physics simulator, at the same time i feel sad because it reminds me that my one true goal in life that overshados everything, is the fact that i hoplessly crave to be immortal. and being immortal is the key word that motivates my LOSER habit with no friends i live in. I don't wanna die. I love this game so much, but being a pyscho with earth hits me for some reason, it also reminds me months ago i used to have dreams of the moon crashing into earth. 10/10 addictive, fun, It was worth the money.

								So its 11:41 during the night, and I had a fantastic day. Im thinking of so much stuff, but it's time for sleep. What better way to unwind from the day then a beautiful, stunning, relaxing game. I see this game, and look at the photos, and some of the video, and I buy it. I play it for a little while, looking at a breathtaking universe colliding simulation, and then create saturn with an astroid belt around it, and moons around it. I was finally unwinding from my day, relaxing by creating these beautiful, just amazing things, and doing things I could only dream of, and making those things a virtual reality. And the music, its so, so peaceful.I recommend this game to everyone, especaily the people who love space, this game is worth all of the money you put into it, maybe even a little extra.

								I have only played this game in VR, and it is truly an amazing experience. The the scale of these astronomical objects is staggering. Shrank down to 1:1 scale to marvel at the size of the earth/moon. Created a betelgeuse on either side for lighting. After about fifteen minutes, I started to notice that they were getting closer together. Looked away from my little sytstem I'd created and saw space warping around the edges. Flipped out and frantically started flying out as the two stars started to collide in slow motion behind me, walls of nuclear fire closing in from either side. Escaped just before they went supernova, leaving behind a really pretty planetary nebula. 10/10 would use betelgeuse for lighting again.That said, a *lot* of the features have not been implemented or don't work fully in VR, and the tools are really very clumsy-- or example, the dispenser doesn't work very well or very precisely at all, and scaling the view while it's locked onto a planet makes everytthing disappear into the distance for some reason. It's incredibly difficult to actually create anything stable (near-impossible really) and very, very easy to go mad with power and start bombarding everything with moons which is... cathartic, but not necessisarily productive.

								REVIEW:Rated into my favorite 'masterpieces' game category, Universe Sandbox ² is a full-fledged simulator of the universe, capable of showing the player real physics, real science, and a real universe, without asking for too much of your computer.PROS:- Beautiful physics, capable of simulating all of the aspects of the universe, without breaking any laws.- Amazing and inspiring soundtrack.- Isn't capable of frying your computer. It doesn't ask for much.CONS:- If you add too many objects, you're gonna have a bad time.- Can get pretty boring sometimes, maybe because you just don't find what to do.WOULD I RECOMMEND IT?Yes. Absolutely. Go play it. Have fun blowing up tons of planets over & over again.			",42,2,0,2,3,0,2

								Universe Sandbox 2 is a masterfully done game. It's gameplay is deep and incredibly fun, and the graphics are surprisingly beautiful. I would reccomend it wholeheartedly. It does have flaws, but they are minor enough to not hamper my enjoyment.Pros --My favorite part of the game is the collisions, which look and feel amazing. It has never been this satisfying to launch the moon at Austrailia, vaporizing the continent and melting the earth's surface.-The soundtrack of the game is really nice, which is surprising considering it's not the game's main appeal at all.-There's more to do than just collisions. You can create solar systems, experiment with atmospheres, terraform barren planets, and much more. With enough imagination, you can do anything.-Lots of premade scenarios for you to play around with.-Easy to use UI.-It can even be educational, in some cases.-The developers seem to be great people, and communicate a lot with their fanbase.-It's very polished. The framerate is smooth and I haven't encountered many major glitchesCons--It isn't updated very often, but that's understandable for such a complex game.-The soundtrack, while beautiful, has very few tracks. Only about four or five.-The physics engine sometimes breaks down, but only if you push it too hard and often it breaks in hilarious ways.-You may lose intrest after a point, but only way after you've gotten your money's worth.Overall, it's a great game with one or two nitpicky flaws that aren't important at all.8.5/10			",5,0,0,0,8,0,6

								""I'll show you!"" you sputter in rage, spittle rolling out the corner of your mouth. ""I'll show all of you!"" You flee out of the conference hall, clutching your precious work to your chest, tears of shame and rage streaming down your face, as you storm away from the Imperial Society for Impossible Science. (Yes, the initialism is under review pending recent geopolitical developemnts.)Alone in your laboratory, in your Victorian mansion, at the top of the mountain, in the middle of a thunderstorm, and other such idioms, you try to return to your experiments, your work, but soon find yourself lost in dreams of revenge towards your former colleagues. Friends, you thought, though you now know better. Their peals of laughter still echo in your mind. Tormented as you are, you finally reach the conclusion that only the most total, complete revenge will sate you: the total destruction of the earth itself. Life. Pah. If the end product of life are apes that cannot appreciate your brilliance, clearly the whole thing was a mistake. A mistake that you are more than happy to correct.Your newly found nihilistic passions drive you towards this most ultimate solution: to what fraction of the speed of light must you accelerate a common tiny celestial body -- a comet perhaps -- so as to totally liquify the earth's crust? It seems easy enough to calculate. Ah, but how to check your calculations? Brilliant though you are, you have been known to misplace a decimal place here and there, in your excitement. And your lone companion Igor, capable manservant though he may be, and very handy with a pickaxe in a graveyard, is hardly equal to this more intellectual task.Enter Universe Sandbox. Place celestial bodies where you like. Send them where you like. Check your calculations through simulation. Get your revenge. Because wouldn't it be embarrassing if you meant to liquify the earth, but wound up causing only yet another mass extinction?Seriously, this is lots of fun. If you wind up using this program for anything other than destroying the earth over and over and over in new and exciting ways, you are made of sterner stuff than I.It's also great for teaching young kids, at least at an intuitive level, orbital mechanics, the concept of kinetic energy, and why two planetary mass objects, when they bump into each other, behave slightly differently than two small balls rolling across the living room floor.Pro tip: if, upon witnessing the total, irretrievable extinction of all life on earth, your five-year-old daughter asks, ""could this ever happen in real life,"" answer with something a bit more reassuring than ""probably not, but you never know."" That is, unless you like getting up at 2 AM every night for the better part of a month. Sigh.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Good game,the earth got a bit hot from global warming but sea level went down as water evaporated, so I flooded the earth with water, then I crashed to moon into it to which heated the earth up to remove the water and melt the crust, so I removed the sun to try and cool the planet down, the earth then left the solar system into deep space so I increased the gravity by 1000000 so earth was sucked into the jupiter black hole.good game 14/16			",113,42,2,10,34,3,25

								Whether you want to understand how the universe currently functions or want to blow a lot of stuff repeatedly, this game can do both realistically at the same time.More seriously though ,this ""game"" (I'd rather call it something more special than just that, but I can't find the words.) also had a special effect on me, it made me realise how small we actually are compared to everything that is out there. It made me comprehend how fragile life really is and how special we are for being able to say that life as we know it, is precious.Thus, It has personnally enhanced my current understanding of a lot of fundemental phenomenons that I simply couldn't picture properly solely by reading texts explaining them seperately. This game is the big picture.  Just to name a few:- Picturing the Moon cycle- Seeing how the Greenhouse effect affects everything- Viewing a suprinsigly accurate explanation for the formation of the moon- Understanding how two galaxies will eventually collide - Comprehending how gravity plays a role in everything- Many many more.I wish people were as stoked to get this ""game"" as they are for the latests AAA titles. So that another slightly better version would come out each year. And I'd buy it wholeheartedly.			",39,12,0,1,13,0,4

								This game is amazing I have wanted a game like this for ages, since I was a little boy lol. Get kids to play with this game it will maybe have them ask interesting questions that maybe one day they will work toward having an answer for. The other games like this have never been so satisfying, this game is worth every penny hands down! Im sure in the future I will have suggestions and possibly bugs/problems to report, but man o man is this game ever worth the time required to build your own galaxy. O and the fact that you can spawn a black hole.. Astonishing :) please continue succeeding with this sandbox masterpiece in the making!			",52,3,1,9,5,0,3

								Here's how my first sitting with this game went. I decided that Pluto was underrated so I increase its mass and shot a Jupiter at it. It then turned into a ball of fire. Then the entire rest of the solar system started orbiting around it. PLUTO IS THE RULER OF THE UNIVERSE! Pluto then went in an entirely different direction from the newly reformed solar system. I wasn't happy with that so I reloaded everything and I shot what once was Pluto directly at the sun and caused a supernova. PLUTO HAS BEEN AVENGED!In all seriousness, this game shows how cool science can be, and therefore this game is cool and definitely worth your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I had bought the first version back in my dual-boot days (long since over), and had hoped for a Linux verson. The release of this ""squared"" version took me by surprise and delight. The graphics for this iteration are superb and the physics are as good as the first version, if not better. Not for everyone, of course, and while you can smash planets together in Planetary Annihilation, the physics of this sim are certainly better. Creating your very own solar system is a rewarding activity, as is smashing a Mars-sized object into the Earth and seeing if a lunar object results. You won't find a better simulation of, well, anything. VERY highly recommended.			",323,212,0,94,91,2,120

								Universe Sandbox 2 is a great game for people that enjoy astronomy of any kind. It has so much within it that you will probably learn a lot from the game, whether it's new celestial bodies, or how the materials within a planet affect it's mass, water levels, etc. You get to play around with different tools that let you see what really happens when you collide certain objects together, or you can just slow down to real time and study a simulation you've created.Really, it's a great game for anyone that likes space and playing God.

Looking at Universe Sandbox 2This game is just AMAZING! Very realistic, and doesn't glitch much unless you do manual work, or pure luck. The new update is amazing, atleast alpha 19. It added shockwaves (Which look amazing), tidal forces (could make the fragments go everywhere, depending where the forces are really going, and make craters), and much much more! These people acctually work hard on this, and not make lazy updates like some other games (Not counting Valve, because its a team, not the whole company). I wouldn't be suprised if they added a update adding real landscape (I hope your working on that <3) and some other cool thing like seeing inside planets, gas giants, evo(?)planets, suns, black holes, and much much more. I would love if they could add a tool where you can see the break up of the planet via rock, mantle, core, and making the craters much more noticeable. I would also like if you can add a small detial of giant waves when a metor hits water, which I don't expect to be perfect, but nothing is ;). Another thing, can you please make binary systems more stable(?), and make it easier to make triple, quad, etc? That would be very nice, because I want to make a quad system. To end off, I recommend this game like if it was a free, no glitched game where you can do whatever you want, IF you like space, pyhsics, or explodisons.			",27,1,0,0,6,0,6

								This simulator has tackled the complexity of maths and physics, put it into an engine and sells it straight to the customer. The customer may not know about inclination or Kepler's laws of planetary motion but it still somehow gets through as a sandbox to the customer and that has to be an acheivement. We all have to agree, this is a magestic simulator. Dynamics are taken into account at every opportunity and the way the simulator delivers, its breathtaking. It's not even done yet. How simple parameters can change properties from the orbital period to the planetary climate, changing as the orbit progresses or viewing Phobos orbiting Io which is orbiting Earth from the view point of Io. Would recommend this simulator if you want to spend time learning and having fun at the same time. Now, not many games do that. I have been suppporting this series since the first released and supported this one before it was even early access. Universe Sandbox was actually the first ever game I got on Steam.And I do not regret it. 10/10, already has more features than the original game. Get the game and enjoy its bugs now!

I've wanted this game for ages, pretty much since the day it was released but I finally saved up enough money to buy it for myself. And I've got to say, having played for only 1 hour, my first impression is that this is absolutely incredible. The sheer joy of creating my own planets and putting them in to our Solar System, or putting a sun-sized football as a replacement for the Sun. The amount you learn in this game is mind-blowing, and makes you realise the size of the universe. It's almost scary. And of course, who doesn't love a bit of destruction? It's hilarious throwing moon-sized teapots at Earth and throwing one planet at another. If you're not sure about this game, get it. There's nothing like experiencing it for yourself, watching videos has nowhere near as much excitement and thrill as it is to do it yourself. You may think ""oh god I'm spending $19.99"", and so did I. But just think of the incredible detail and the amount of possibilities in this sim. It's in Alpha! The game isn't even finished yet and it's already better than any game I've spent $20 on, by the time it's finished I reckon the possibilities will be endless and the experience will be like no other. For the people complaining about boredom after 30 minutes, remember - it is in Alpha. By full release I don't think you'll ever be bored again!Seriously impressed. ",240,49,2,10,26,2,18

								I have a very deep fetish of space related things. Universe Sandbox 1 kept me very entertained for hours, and though I do not have a ton of time in US2 it is still a great platform for those who have a deep desire to learn. It's been a great tool to use while watching documentaries, reading articles online, and just general experimentation and exploration.The ONLY thing that makes me sad about this game is the complete and total dedication to JUST being a physics simulator.  Look, I know that's the point of this program, that doesn't mean however that it's the only thing it could be used for.  Everytime I've seen a great suggestion on the forums for a feature that isn't specifically space related is, ""Oh well it's a physics simulator, why would they have feature x?""The reason why they should consider features x, y, or z, is that while it's a decent physics simulator, it could be a much more powerful learning tool if they could only stop limiting theirselves with this frame of mind.This has been a retort to all manner of features such as:- Weather- A ""Human"" type feature such as ISS models, or small spaceships- Having places labeled with landmarks (Such as a text box showing Olympus Mons location on Mars)- Even people suggesting a grid system showing a bend in spacetime for the various planets showing their gravitation impactsI wish there was a competitor out that would take advantage of these great suggestions if US2 is not. And it's totally not just so I can plan the destruction of Alderaan.			",340,41,14,53,58,6,64

								The is the most violent game in the universe, literally. You can crash Mars into the earth and watch as the planet melts! So, if you like hurting people, there are suddenly much more catostrophic ways to do it, and for most people, this is just a fun way to screw with physics and see what will happen. Or watch galxies collide in real time, or see what happens when you make mercury out of nothing but hydrogen, or if you add a ton of CO2 to the earth, or when the sun goes supernova, and plenty of other odd things. If Universe Sandbox 1 was fun, this this is ~30,000 times better. If you run out of things to do, find something new, try somthing a different way, there is always going to be something to see.So, what's not to like?(Oh yeah, it's also Early Access, so give it some slack people!

								I can't say this game isn't good, that'd be a lie. It just isn't for me. I've given it multiple shots, and had fun everytime, but lack the capabilites to bring it to its full potential. Instead of having fun with my own little solar systems like I wanted, I just end up getting frustrated when I can't get things to work as desired. Not to the point of it dampening my experience, mind you. This game gives you the ability to destroy entire galaxies, but I want to use it for more specific reasons that I haven't quite figured out yet. If you feel like supporting the devs for Black Hole Simulater 2016, this game might be for you. But don't blame them when you eventually get bored of it. If you love science and especially astronomy, this game is perfect for you. It gives you enough control to make you the puppet master of your own little solar systems, once you figure out how to control them.TL;DRGood game. Destruction is fun, but not fun enough to justify a purchase unless you just want to support the devs. But it is a fantastic learning/science game for those interested.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Do you like astronomy? Do you like space? Do you like smashing two planets together in a fiery explosion? If you answered yes to anything of these questions, then this game is for you! Universe Sandbox 2 is a simulator that lets you experiment on an astronomical level, spawning stars, moons, planets, and pulsars. Create solar sytems (or destroy them), explode stars and watch them go supernova. Its like a star gazing book, except much more fun and interactive. Plus, its real science-y, with accurate data to simulate our own solar system, or a random one... or anything, really. This is a gravity simulator at heart. Orbits, eccentricity, Inclination, velocity, etc. It comes with dozens of pre-made simulations. However, make no mistake, the rest is icing on the cake.Okay, so now its time for more specificity. Features of the game include stellar evolution, climate simulation, full body fragmentation, light pulses, saving/loading sims, bodies, galaxies (galaxies are WIP for right now), and objects. First is stellar evolution, which is the process of stars aging until they die. You could sit there and watch a star for a billion years in real-time until it dies, or just take the easy route and speed it up. Next is climate simulation, this works the best with earth for right now. When climate is enabled for a body in the simulation, the polar ice caps (specifically for earth), you can visaully see snow expand and recede as it obits the sun. At some point in the future, climate should become more fleshed out, but for the most part, the climate feature is a nice touch.I won't go over the whole list, as some are self-explanatory (and there's just too much to list anyway), but the stellar evolution, climate, and light pulses are the main ones, the rest just ties it together, and nicely, I may add. Anyway, light pulses can be ""pinged"" off any object you want in a simulation. Emitting a light pulse from an object will then travel through space. Watching a light pulse in real-time is probably the most amazing. It lets you visualize the speed at which light travels through space. And as far as I know, it is supposed to be accurately simulated, traveling at the speed of light. For light to travel in the ""Our Solar System"" simulation, from the sun to Neptune took 4 hours, just like in real life.  Same with sun-to-earth, 8 minutes. That's awesome!To sum up, if you're a fan of simulator games, and have an appreciation for astronomy, you'll probably enjoy this game/sim. There is no other simulator that does it quite like US2. The size and scale at which Universe Sanbox 2 simulates is in a league all its own. The game recieves regular updates (I was in the closed alpha before it hit steam), and the devs are actively engaged in making it better. They take time to make sure its right. Each update to the game only continues to add to an already amazing simulator! :DNow, only one last order of business: I deleted earth. Why are we still here?- 10/10 would delete earth again -			",43,2,3,4,9,0,1

								I love this playground / simulator!You can witness a ton of beautiful and bizarre objects in scenarios Universe Sandbox 2.The Developer, Giant Army, adds new features all the time, and they're quite cool.One of my favorites is Roche Limits where orbiting bodies experiencing a lot of tidal forces break apart.The number of details for so many orbiting bodies is staggering, yet the simulation appears to run smooth on my rig up to just about any number of objects.The graphics and art are very well done, and the planets, stars, and other objects are very detailed.The game seems like it might be a little challenging at first, but I had great fun in getting suprised with many of the powers and their effects.  There's also a good tutorial, I think.If you like sandboxes, especially sciencey ones, I think you'll find none better than Universe Sandbox 2. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is truly an incredible sequel to what is one of the best simulators on Steam! This program feels more like sophisticated simulation software than an actual game in functionality, but it's incredibly user-friendly and easy to use; I use this game as a very effective visual aid for tutoring, as well as a time killer. The developers certainly don't skimp on their research, as frequent updates reflect some of the most current events in astronomy: there was a simulation of the New Horizons encounter with Pluto as the real deal was making headlines! Explorative tutorials are informative without spewing a bunch of numbers and facts all at once; yet they provide links for further enrichment, as well as pure number-crunching horsepower for those who are curious and want to tweak the gritty details and properties that bind the universe together. It's Early Access right now, but their bugs at this point are few and very far between. Updates are very frequent, and more often than not they include newly added features and simulations.The dynamic graphics for complex events such as climate patterns and planetary collisions are getting better and more refined with each update. This program offers an incredible amount of functionality, is visually appealing, and accompanied with a beautifully ambiant soundtrack. I've never been so relaxed breaking gravity and then playing billiards with all of the planets!This title completely blows its predecessor out of the water! I would highly reccommend for all those casual gamers and science fans out there. More people need to get this title - it has limitless potential for a Steam Workshop feature. For what you get, the game is set at a remarkably reasonable price - definitely worth scooping this one up!			",195,43,1,23,22,1,30

								If you like smashing things, this is a good purchase, I guess.But if you like simulating things, this can be annoying, I can't add nitrogen particles and atmospheres do not contain nitrogen. Gravity may not always work correctly, I also canot edit the orbits very easily to make things slowly collide. Similarly, it is hard to 'terraform'  mars carefully, I end up with a 2 earth mass behemoth, by accident.Admittedly, I need to spend more time in this, but in my first impressions of Universe Sanbox, I cannot help but be a little bit disapointed.

								One of my wishes for vive was games where I could just lay down and watch stuff happen while I wave my hands around as stuff happens listening to dumb music. This is one of those games you can do that with. It's pretty and interesting. It's appealing trying to get a bunch of tiny celestial bodies to orbit a large one so they smash into it as they change colour, or even use the emitters to write stuff in space and see it drift into nothingness.The optimisation is alright, runs pretty smooth until you try to spawn a bunch of stars inside of one another and they explode and everything goes white. White, as any vive user is bound to either know or find out sooner or later, is the least pleasant thing to be bombarded with in VR. It's fascinating though, there's a bunch of pre-loaded scenarios and objects to play with, will give you a few hours of fun to play with.			",143,23,4,15,31,0,24

								If someone would have told me at a young age that when I grow older, I will don the HTC Vive and start throwing around planets and suns and s***. If someone had told me that, when I was like 9-10 then I most likely would go insane and do nothing but wait for that faithful day.Even now I have a hard time accepting that I am currently playing ins space in Virtual Reality.The first time I started the game I did what everyone would have done, bombarded the Earth with its own moon repeatedly, the Earth unsurprisingly exploded into a hot light show, and it was glorious. But then my ambitions grew.I picked the random planet option prepared to spawn a gas giant a couple clicks away. Anyways, my finger slipped, and I managed to spawn it right in front of the Earth which sent it crashing into the gas giant.Before I had time to react the Earth had hit the Gas giant and my computer shut down, the Vive went completely dark; there was no sound in my earplugs, and I just stood there wondering if I just killed myself and everybody on planet Earth because I miss clicked. (This only happened once mind you, haven't had a problem with it since)Anyhow here's the VR verdict:Gameplay: Fun but lacking some functions, would like to design my own planet, sun or most of all create black holes.Graphics: It's an incredibly colorful game, you stand long in awe after putting two planets on a collision course.Smoothness: With a lot happening on the screen at once you may expect some lagging in head movements even on the most powerful of computers.Bugs\glitches: I keep being unable to use one of my controllers at startup of the game, I'm unable to choose anything but the moon. Some issues using the camera when you're trying to zoom out (Rescale), the camera moves you completely away from the planets you're attached to, only happens sometimes.Some of my specs:Geforce 1080 Founders Edition 8GB Ram i7 3,3 Ghz processor			",147,22,6,18,33,2,29

								From the little amount of time i've actually spent using this universe simulator I can already tell you that it is one of the best sims out there to buy if you are into physics and space. You can do do realistic simulations like create your very own solar system, or just make really rediculous scenarios like a baseball bigger then Jupiter colliding with Earth. Either way it's alot of fun and interesting to see what you can create or destroy. Best part of all the developer is active and constantly fixing issues the game has so props to you for that. In conclusion due to all of this I can't see any reason why you shouldn't pick up this amazing space sim 10/10 for amazing concept and actively updating the game			",191,22,4,36,17,0,9

								This is a modeling sim. You can do all sorts of simulation between objects and see how they affect each other. For this I would recommend the game, but this game will not be for everyone. If you like to tinker around and see the cause and effect of things in space then this will be hours of fun.			",59,2,33,2,7,0,0

								OH MY GOD, THIS GAME IS FRIGGIN GOOD. HOW COULD DESTROYING EARTH BE ANYMORE FUN?!?!?! That's right, it can't. But this game just broke the friggin law with how AWESOME it is, I am not joking but this game is worth the money, When you get the game, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T REFUND IT. I refunded it then I came back to it to rebuy it, so don't think about it. This game is omega fun on the other side and there isn't many bad things about it other then gliches, I just like destroying the Earth then turning it into another planet :^)This game is only in Alpha 17, there are way more things that lay ahead of it, and if you see this review when it is the full version, GET THE GOD DAMN GAME ALREADY, THESE GUYS WHO MADE IT ARE A-M-A-ZING.

								Man I'm so sick of all that talk about our stupid neighbour star Proxima Centauri. It's such a wannabe tryhard star it's not funny anymore.So I took a closer look since Proxima Centauri thinks it's so much cooler now than our sun.You know how our sun is huge and shiny and sexy, yeah forget all that and lower your expectations.After I zoomed in like half an hour I could finally see the ""star"", so I started building a Solar Systems with Planets and stuff.Then the inevitable happend, our sun got really mad and confronted Proxima Centauri, oh boy what a destruction.GET REKT PROXIMA CENTAURI don't mess with the best.

There are many different things you can do with this game such as:Teach principals about spaceDemonstrate scale and distanceDemonstrate gravityDemonstrate climateShow how different bodies in space interactBecause of its educational setting it could even be used for projects or lessons in schools while also great for having fun and playing around/experimenting.

I am 100% okay with this, as such a fantastic simulator is worth my money. The developers deserve every penny, and I hope they will continue the excellent work on this amazing sim.For those thinking of purchasing the ""game,"" do remember that it is not a game in the strictest sense. It's a pure simulator, but you can make your own fun, and learn quite a bit while you do so!			",68,13,7,19,24,0,15

 Universe Sandbox 2 I love this game so much. It has so much stuff to do because I use it in class for science because its about the planets of our solar system. I love how you have game with our solar system and we put differnt scenario on the planets like differnt orbit,  rename the planet, fast forwarding years on earth. I hope everyone who gets it get to experince what I learning right now in school.####Pros#### Zoom feature with the scroll wheel and feel like your on the planet. Make the planets your own so you can make meteorite hit and the planet will shrink. Make the planets differnt elements from the periodic tablee H20 and C20####Cons#### Still in beta when will the stable version be out. Music is very annoying.

While I have not played this game for as long as the original (still add a few offline hour to the hours steam said I played) I can tell it's great. Creating your own personal solar system and watching your planets orbit with an amazing score in the background feels awesome. As a science and space enthusiast, I cannot feel less than amazed at seeing my ""experiments"" play out. I have created stars from gas giants, terraformed planets, and watched planets get vaporized.

								This is a sandbox game as the title suggest using physics and fantastic graphics and sound tracks to emulate the universe or your universe.  While many Youtubers will throw moons at planets and call that fun, going much deeper takes a higher level of education. You can build your own solar system from the ground up, drop black holes into anywhere, throw random items into orbit or at planets as well as try to see what happens when you increase the mass of the earth by a couple of suns.  There are no campaigns as this is more of a purely scientific and enjoyable simulation. The control are simple to learn but the characteristics of the universe contents are vast.  Gravity, mass, density, oribtal configurations, rotational periods, atmosphere, core composition, luminosity, atmosphereic pressure, greenhouse gases, and about 500 other options exist that can be modified.  You can turn on or off realism for each individual object and there are about 50 scenarios you can fire up and watch and/or interact with.I really enjoy this game..I mean simulation program.  It's relaxing, the sound track makes it easy to study things outside of the game if you are trying to get something done i.e. learn another language, study a new topic in your spare time, etc.  I'm running on a 27"" iMac with a 3.4 Ghz i5 with 16 GB of RAM and a 780m Nvidia.  I have no issues playing this game and doing anything I want.  No slowdown, no glitches that I can find, nothing.  I'd also like to add I am on a Solid State so that also helps push things along.I highly recommend this for those that are interested in the universe, learning some things along the way, or just want something relaxing to do that doesn't involve hearing a 14 year old rage over a mic or throw his keyboard against the wall due to poor parenting and lack of social skill sets.  Remember, it isn't a game, it's a simulation, and one that is awfully fun too!  Do yourself a favor and give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A much improved version of the first game, it vastly expands the previous featureset and improves the UI and general tooling. A must buy if you loved the first one.But, this game being Early Access, it has some rough edges that I hope will be corrected in the future, such as the still very incomplete planet surface composition and climate simulation. The simulator also still can't correctly simulate things such as tidal forces tearing satellites apart when they cross the Roche Limit, which was something I missed from the first version and I hoped would be implemented in this one.But overall the experience has been very good so far.

								Very pleased to see this finally on steam. I managed to get an early copy of this and bought it straight from the developer before it came out on steam and i can honeslty say that it is a great simulation to play.Create and destroy at will - You will throughly enjoy this if, like me, enjoy anything related to space.There is a load of preset simulations which you are able to view and edit whenever you want and however your imagnation takes you.Universe Sandbox includes complex to simple situations so you don't have to be extremely knowledgable in Physics.. but if you like to make and create complex situations, you are definatly able to. Features would include adding or taking away certain materials from a planet or adding too much mass to a planet to make it a gas giant then allowing it to create its own nuclear fusion to become a star.The possibilities are endless with this simluation/game.If you are by a faction interested in space and planetary systems then this is the simulation for you.10/10 - Watching two galaxies collide over 1 frame to 1 million years has never been so satisfying.

								As the title says this is a sandbox game on universe scale. You can do everything to mess around with universe within the realm where the game engine allows.Graviting, orbiting, colliding, creating/changing something...mass, radious, temperature, orbit, course, velocity, atmosphere, climate, magnetic, materials and so on. Make a pair of earths neutron stars and let them be a binary system and after taking a screenshot just put them into wherever habitable zone of whatever stars and just watch what will happen. If you satisfied, just take a draw a human face or 'lol' in space with anything, who cares?No gun, no killing, no car but no magic and no god as well(but the devs allowed you to be able to spot a teapot somewhere in the universe if you want). It's just a fun counterpart to the real life physics. Someone may not know what to do in this open field at first and need to take some time to get used to but you know that is the beauty of sandbox game.

And it doesn't even pass Neptune's orbit... that made me tear a little, I won't lie.The music is quite beautiful and adds to the immersion and emotion; the prettier picture from the first sandbox also helps as well.There are a couple of things, at least in my only few hours of playing, that I can say I would like to see.Tell us in laymen's terms what some things mean.

So doun't let my review discorage you from buying. get the game and you will have fun (for a limeted time if your like me.)(Edit Dec/10/2015) Thanks devs for repling i hope my ideas down below will help future players enjoy the game my review WILL change to positive as soon as posible when any type of ""feature"" update or when im online to see itEdit dec 15 2015 changed review to positive			",26,3,0,2,17,1,7

								There have been a great many attempts to try and place the universe into a perspective, however, the problem with trying to do so is that humans don't have a comparison. for example, we KNOW that the milky was galaxy is incredibly small in the eyes of the whole universe. We don't however understand it completley. knowing is only half of it, there is no reasonable way to compare our planet to any other without treading into the realms of obsertity or disbelief in the attempt to understand how big everything is. so while i was playing i compared a black hole to a sagitarius A another black hole and my zoom out was incredible. but when you see those numbers like how big it is in our human numerical systems you can't get the hole picture because the software is designed to let you see everything and sure when you go and zoom into the black hole and you see the larger one looming amously over the event horrizon you say "" hey cool that black hole is as big as 10 million of our suns."" but then you look at our son and all it is is a dot in our sky. we can never fathom how big it really is when all we see is graphs and illistrations from a human point of view rather than the real point of view of how big it is. we use numbers to measure how big things are, but we don't imagine how big things really are in the real world because we will never see these things. in conclusion, this game is very well made and extremely enjoyable  but numbers and comparisons to huge things are just not helping people understand how big it is. i give this game a 10/10 ign (sorry for the rant and boring read, these were just thoughts that were bugging me. so it might not be structured as arduosly as a regular paragraph)			",46,10,0,5,6,0,0

								I have played this game both in VR, and out.  It is great both ways.  Lots of fun to tinker around with, explore different and fun experiments in space using all of the objects we're familiar with.  The experience especially comes alive in VR, since you can witness collisions in first-person and stand on the surface of all the great gas giants and whatever else you want.  Even out of VR this provides enough fun and content to easily justify the price.The best feature about this is that there are many pre-set loadouts, from individual planets, to the solar system, to dozens of collisions.  So you don't have to spend the hours to customize and make your own arrangement of things just to see ""what if"" or start experimenting on the solar system.  This to me is what makes the game good.			",78,4,1,10,4,1,5

								First up, I'll put it out there that I don't play this game very much, but not for lack of wanting to do so. It is just a very graphics intensive game whenever you get to the larger scale stuff like solar system simulation with a lot of collisions, and I only recently got the hardware to support more intense play.With that out of the way, I'm going to talk about two different aspects of the game: The desktop play and the VR experience. Firstly, the desktop version is fairly easy to pick up. There are a lot of options of what you can create and do with the current kit, from being a malevolent god raining absolute destruction wantonly upon the universe all the way to being a maestro of the cosmos. Making your own planets with unique elemental compositions is fairly easy if you like to play around with making star systems for fun. The slider options are truly endless, making for an extremely customizable experience. If you don't like building stars and planets from scratch, there are menus with dozens of premade options of all shapes, sizes and compositions.The VR experience, however, is a vastly different thing to behold. You have much less control over the universe, but it is so much easier to navigate and look at the simulation from all angles. The views are breathtaking, and the room-scale experience allows you to bend down to look in closer or walk into the disk of a spiral galaxy and surround yourself in stars. The view is so convincing it feels like I should be able to reach my hand out and watch the stars spill through my fingers like ethereal sand.Now, the reason I call it a VR ""experience"" is that the menus are extremely limited compared to the standard game. The wands feel like there is a lot of functionality that is missing, like being unable to use the touchpads to scroll the sliders to the left or right. The interface itself is pretty buggy, making it difficult to use the wands in a natural, intuitive way. For example, you can scale the universe by using both wands together, but you are completely unable to rotate it along the horizontal axis. Sliders are buggy and unwilling to go in both directions unless you manually point and click at the +/- buttons.However, the most damning thing to the VR portion of this game is that it will not close. To successfully close the game while in SteamVR you have to go to your task manager on the desktop and end the task manually. If you attempt to close SteamVR while Universe Sandbox 2 is still running, the simulator will force the program to reopen over and over until you manually close the sim.My final verdict is that this is a great simulator, but if you are wanting it for VR interaction wait until they have worked out the worst of the bugs. It's truly an amazing experience, but for the limited functionality compared to the base game it is not worth the hassle of fighting to close the application.			",13,2,1,4,3,0,0

								Well, I don't have much to say, I'm speechless for all the right reasons. A game like this has been my dream for years, and now it's actually happening! You can just screw around with planets' climates and gravity and throw them at stars and whatever - and the graphics are fluid, there's virtually no bugs or glitches, absolutely amazing. Hopefully there will be even more new features in future, like the addition of extra materials like uranium to simulate the heat from an internal core, and methane, magnesium, and other chemicals and compounds to simulate chemical reactions and impact the colour of planets and behaviour of their surfaces. The game is already amazing as it is though, it's a gravity and a climate and a massive epic explosion simulator! Seriously worth the price!			",6,3,0,0,7,0,0

								(21/9+10 ign mlg) hitler sim 2016Before my first contact with this game, I had a life, a wife, two kids, a nice house and also a car. Then, I met Universe Sandbox. This game was exactly what I needed to be happy. I am a new guy now. My undies are always brown as I am so addicted that I can't leave my chair. My house has trash and rotten food all over the floor because I can't stop playing this. I am not sure, but looks like my wife went away with my children and my car. I am all by myself now. No time to care about this, tho. This is the most amazing sandbox game ever made. I am still looking for the sand, tho. 2,222 hours in and no sand yet. But I hope it will appear someday. I will keep looking for it.It's the best game ever made. The whole mankind needs to know about this masterpiece. It's a huge universe building tool where you can even make planets crash and bring disaster and death everywhere. This is what I call bloody. If you think that The Witcher 3 or Fallout 4 are the best games ever made, go learn a bit more about games and figure out that Universe Sandbox is the ultimate masterpiece. It's better than sex.I still wonder where the sand is. 10/10 Would ruin my whole life again. No Regrets.*It's not serious, in case you are wondering*The game is pretty fun. Worth buying.

								I'll be honest here. I LOVE science; especially space. In fact I want to be an astronomer. This game is realy cool, and I love sandboxes, but I think there's TOO much freedom. I'm not the kind of person who screams in terror or excitment when two celestial bodies collide together. The game is good in the fact of realism. For example, I learned about a star that's 11.5 km across from playing this game. That is very interesting to me, to learn that a star can be that small, but honestly, I could've learned that anyway, without paying $25 for it. It's just hard for me to stay interested in the game, but whoever's reading this might be different.			",16,1,1,3,3,0,3

								Universe Sandbox is simply amazing. Unlike other games in the space genre, Universe Sandbox lets you metaphorically become god. The attention to detail is absolutely stunning. For example, increasing the sun's gravitational pull will draw earth towards it. As it gets closer you can see the oceans evaporating and the temperature of the planet increasing until it burns up and is destroyed. When earth isn't being consumed by suns, black holes, or teapots (yes teapots), you can see further detail in its rotation such as how all the lights of the cities turn on when facing away from the sun. It gives you a sense of life... before you cause a second ice age. I've just gone on about earth. There's so much more to this game. Want to decrease the suns mass? Go for it. Want to cause a supernova? Do it. Want to collide galaxies in real time? Well if you have the time why not. The game is one of my favorites. If you like space or generally just being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a cosmic level, do yourself a favor and get this game. It's well worth the money. As a side note, if you have a modern laptop, this game runs well on those too due to the superb optimization. My laptop is 7 years old and it still runs well. Alright, I'm going to stop rambling now, but don't leave just yet. Scroll up and click buy right now. Even if you don't have a credit card. If you're a kid tell your parents RobBop demanded you to buy it. In fact bring them here. Parents? If you're here, little Timmy promised to do twice the amount of housework if you buy this game. Do it, you won't regret it.			",50,7,0,6,7,0,1

								The game Universe Sandbox ² basically explains what you'll be doing in its title. Well it is a massive sandbox in which i have yet to find the end of the universe. The game may crash when clearing your universe, but this is a minor issue in my eyes.  Seeing as it is an early access game it is obvious that there are some rough edges which are primarily noticed when overloading the physics engine. This is done by spawning in multiple massive objects while sprinkling smaller ones in between and having them collide while the time is speed up by a significant amount. This may or may not happen more often depending on your specifications.  When talking about the gameplay it is hard to ignore the fantastic visuals (i mean there are so many objects for them to look this good is incredible). The UI is easy to get used to while not forgetting the detailed mechanics. Me not being the most mathematically or physically literate person had to look up different options which i see as a positive, because it means they don't cater to a casual audience and focus on the simulation and freedom which can be accessed by advanced users.  I had a lot of fun so far learning and seeing what i've learned unfold in front of my eyes. I would definitely recommend this game to people even interested the slightest into space and our universe.  			",22,10,0,4,1,0,1

								What I love the most is the fact that this game scares me. It's terrifying! When I look at our solar system, see our planet and zoom out and see more and more things. It  makes my heart jump that there is so much out there. I can barely handle playing on this on a computer sitting down. I bet when I get a VR system then I'll be crying for my mother! But seriously this game is spectacular!It's perfect! just keep on adding more and more planets, moons, galaxies, and etc.			",82,4,0,3,4,0,8

								I wouldn't really consider this a ""game"" persay, it's more a piece of software that you can mess around in, kind of like MS Paint. If MS Paint had a Z-Axis, a Real time universal physics simulator, realistic gravity symulator, the ability to destroy and create planets, basketballs the size of the milkyway, milkyways the size of basketballs, the ability to make a quasar black hole out of something that was originally the size of Texas, the ability to run a REAL TIME simulation of our solar system (I once timed it for 3 hours to see if it was accuarate with the time on earth), and a f*ck-load of other scientific and math that would take to long to write about.

								Was one of the guys who tested this game, it DEFINITELY is a lot better when it released, then when we got it. laugh out loud.Anyway, this simulator is a highly detailed one, ever wanted to heat the moon to the core of the sun? now you can!Want to replace the Sun with VY C.M? go ahead!Ever wanted to destroy a galaxy by deleeting its center, or by placing a black hole next to it? now you can!the ultratastic presequel to the original Universe Sandbox allows you to do anything you want! blow up the moon, launch fireworks off Earth! watch the Moon crash into the planet of your choice in real time!

								Starkiller what? Deathstar who???While I could definitely write plenty about how amazing and unique this piece of software is, the best reviews are truly the countless youtube videos that can be easily found- these can give you an idea of just how much you can do with Universe Sandbox- the imagination really is the limit and the only way to experience the joy of watching earth collide with venus at orbital speeds is to watch it unfold in all of it's destructive glory- Buy this game, you will understand.With the exception of Kerbal Space Program, I don't think there are any other games out there that are as exciting or fascinating to play. 10/10 would recommend to a friend. Buy it. Really. What are you waiting for!?			",32,0,0,7,8,0,7

This also might just be a user based thing, if so, my bad :)Also, if you spawn 2 large desnity objects relatively close to each other, alot of the time they will just ZOOM past each other, and dont even reguard the gravity.

								Loaded the game for the first time. Saw the Earth, the moon orbiting in the distance. The sense of scale was awesome. The globe sat in front of me and I really felt like I could reach out and touch it. I tried. I did not know I was holding another moon in my hand. I did not know that pulling the trigger would spawn it. The newly created satellite slammed into the surface of the Earth which quickly took on the boiling, reddish, molten hue of Hell. Every living thing was presumably killed instantly. I hope they were. I hope they didn't suffer. I hope no survivor is able to make a record of my Great Sin for whatever future life evolves after the Earth cools in hundreds of millions of years.The Silence of the Void is already more condemnation than I can bear.10/10 Would accidentally genocide again.

								I haven't spent too long with Universe Sandbox 2, but I can tell you from the precious time I have spent with it that this is an absolute must-buy if your brain capacity can support games of a grander scale than ""kill the things.""It's a masterpiece. Visually stunning, the planets and stars are beautifully detailed. I particularly enjoy gazing at the Earth, admiring the textures and shadows: it really is that good looking.The physics are both accurate and fun to play around with, I've had endless fun setting up my own solar systems only to make the star go supernova and spawn a supermassive black hole at the centre for the sheer hell of it. It really is a universe sandbox, boot it up and mould space to your liking.The scientific depth of this game is almost ludicrous. Every single aspect of anything in the universe can be observed or changed, and I mean EVERY ASPECT. There's stuff here I've never even heard of, let alone understood. The attention to detail here is astounding.Overall? Wonderful. Looks good, plays well, scientifically accurate and overall just plain fun. It's fun both for casuals who just want to play with the galaxy and explore astrophysics, and it's also fun for hardcore physics buffs who understand every single variable. Congrats devs, you hit the nail on the head in my opinion. I look forward to spending many more hours in this wonderful game :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Do you feel like you want to create a working universe? Or maybe feel like a supervillain that destroys worlds with astroids? You are just interested about space maybe? Do you want to make a teapot orbit mars?Well this ""game"" can do that all, just figet around with values or place a new body in a galaxy and you can have hours of fun.Curently the game is still in public testing, so maybe a lot more will be added to the ""game"" and maybe YOU will have an impact on it, not as big as the impact of the moon and earth, but maybe you can have the same impact as a small astroid on pluto. Who knows? You might have noticed I put the word game in quotation marks, that is because the word ""game"" is very misleading, this is a simulator and a serious one at that.So if you want a simulator of space, then buy this game. I would reccomand waiting till the price drops a bit or if the game is on sale though, because there is not yet enough content (currently) to give you the full price back. But maybe it will eventually.			",80,27,1,29,11,1,7

								I love Universal Sandbox and have had lots of fun with it through the years.  I am glad that I bought into Universal Sandbox 2 to help it's developers out.  No matter what happens with the program, it is money well spent for someone who loves astronomy.  Initially, I struggle with the interface, not that it is bad, it just doesn't feel quite right.  I look for menus at the top of the screen not the bottom (at least in the PC World) and I depend on right-clicking for guidance and fail-safe options when I get lost.  In this program, Right-Clicking does nothing, a major oversight.  There is no obvious way to set the date.  In my way of thinking, that should always be an option since my greatest interest on any given night is how the universe looks from my back yard.  I have ipad apps that do this better and I expect more from a well-developed PC program like this.  This user is not sure why it always has to start on some date in 2014 and moves forward.  The developers were quick to respond to my comments in a very positive way.  That in itself makes me put it on the recommend list.  They are aware of these issues and indicate that they will work to address the program's shortcomings.  Now that I sort of have the interface figured out, there are many fun things to do with this program.  Looking forward to using it as-is and for improvements in the future.If you love astronomy, you will enjoy this if you don't mind a few oddities and rough edges.			",76,13,1,7,27,0,16

								Great VR experience. I've definitely put more time in this than most VR games out so far on Vive. However, the VR implementation seems a lot more limited than the normal version, but hopefully the VR features will become more in-line with the non-VR version with subsequent releases. Definitely recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is really incredible. I have often daydreamed about what it would be like to die and float through space to see, in person, the beauty that is space. This game gives you that sensation in a way only the experiene itself can dmonstrate. This must be what it would feel like to be a God.Cons: The VR version doesn't have many of the features that are available in the regular version. I presume they will eventually be added as an update. Black holes, for example, can't be added in VR mode, but within VR you can go to your desktop and add them into the scene manually and then go back into VR mode and see them. (seems like an easy fix that will hopefully be added in future updates).			",56,11,1,6,19,3,9

The level of detail on each individual body is amazing. The fact that you can control the enviroment, orbit, even rotation is astounding. Not only that, but the visuals and audio is outstanding.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Astronomy in general.			",55,7,0,8,28,0,11

Regardless, it's still an excellent simulation. You will probably spend your first 30 minutes destroying Earth repeatedly. You will be surprised how much fun it is watching your home burn.11/10 would annihilate the sun and burn the planets again.  ",57,10,0,5,8,0,7

 Oh, is this amazing! I have always been fascinated by Space, and everything to do with it. The vastness, the possibilities and the interesting features it has, waiting to be found and explored...Now, while I can't exactly go into space and discover it all, this game is a great alternitive! While, not so much on the exploration side of things, it makes it possible to experience almost everything space has to offer. Want to watch the Moon crash into the Earth, go right ahead. Smash ten, smash twenty, how every many you like. Or, maybe terraform Mars. Get it to the point where it has vast oceans, ice caps and even life! See how similar you can make the planets to Earth...Or, turn Jupiter into a star...Or allow Pluto to achieve revenge by turning it into a Black Hole. It's up to you! I have played and do own the original Universe Sandbox, and I have to say: This Sequal (i guess you could call it :P) just improves and adds to the original, beyond measure. It is an absolutely beautifle game, with increadibly realistic physics and is a great game to constantly come back to. Also, the Music is just perfect. As soon as the music comes on, I am instantaneously in deep thought about what the Universe may behold...(Also, get to smash Uranus ;)  )100% recommend this amazing experience!

								I've spent a few hours screwing around with this sim, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed. To say this simulator is visually appealing is an understatement; its friggin' beautiful. Also, if launching asteroids at planets doesn't excite your inner child, you are dead inside. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Honestly, in my opinion, it's very hard to pin one favorite feature of this simultion down, so I'll have to settle for two. But it's easily the colliding galaxies simulation and the supernova in-real-time simulation. They're both gorgeous and immersive. This game just makes me wish I owned an occulus so I could have the illusion of seeing it from my own eyes. It's genuinely the prettiest game I've ever played. It is simulation perfection. It makes me really think about, and become highly interested in, the cosmos, and for someone who gets D grades in physics, that's a kinda big deal.... ",13,5,7,1,28,0,11

								Yes, it is still in development, but this is a truly incredible simulation of space. Beautiful with mindblowing variability - there are so many objects, so many alterable parameters that no two simulations are ever the same. This is more of an epic science lab than game and a must have for any astronomy enthusiast. Do note that the system requirements to run really complex simulations can easily reach beyond the minimum... but such is the cost of having a hundred moons attack the earth.			",68,3,16,8,13,0,20

								This game was a lot more complicated, and involved then I had expected. I LOVE the dynamic sound track, to me that made this game. Also, I suggest to anyone playing to go to the largest scale, set two rocky bodies on a collision course, zoom in to one of the planets surfaces, and in the final aproach, set the time to scale. Watching worlds collide from a first person perspective is awe inspiring.There are something things that could be improved or added. Like the ability to snap to objects and name or lable them. I had a hard time trying to set up a star/ planet combination. I'd ran into a couple of glitches that sent me across the universe, never to see my planet again. Also, it would be nice to be able to reverse time. Also this game would probably consume ALL of my free time if there was a way to set up or follow an ecosystem. Or have the ability to create life and watch it evolve maybe had a stats bar with the type of life and its progress or something to that effect. Overall; As is, the game is fun. But I can see great potenial in this. I'm excited to see where this goes. That and who ever wrote the music score for this game should get a pat on the back			",43,12,3,1,24,3,7

								This sandbox is a pure scientific game. I would not recommend the game to those gamers who think that science is boring. For others I want to say - the game is incredible. You can use various planets, stars, novas, comets etc. to build the Universe you like. You can also modify different parameters of objects, such as mass, density, angular velocity and many more. I was amuzed when I changed the mass, and it was automatically recalculated into a mass of a bigger object (e.g. mass of the Earth into mass of Jupiter). A challenging aspect of this game - you have to learn physics and astrophysics otherwise you will crash a model in seconds. My respect to devs, you've made a great job.			",41,19,2,5,12,2,5

								This is one of the most visually stunning sandbox (game) I have ever experienced. It really puts our solar system to scale and humanity to scale. The sheer size of some of the the objects in this simulation blows my mind.  The collision effects in this simulation are the best I have seen in any (game).There is something vunrable about tha because whn you collide an astriod into earth it shows how fragile our planet is and how just a little disturbance in the system can completely change earths orbit and its surface. The music really adds a sense of awe and wonder. It also adds a sense of scale. The simulations can teach you a lot about how the universe works and it also shows events that happened billions of years ago which is awesome.One of my favourite thngs to do in Universe Sandbox is putting a star called Betelguese next to our solar system. This star is huge and when I say huge I mean HUGE!. This thing dwarfs our sun. The supernova explosions are the most sprctacular features I have ever seen Anyone who is going to eperience this. Your perspective of humanity may vastly change.For an early access game 10/10. Looking forward for new improvements! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I got this game about a year ago and have not played in a while until I jumped on recently. I used this game last year for my physics class to simulate gravity around the earth and my teacher gave me a A+ and she whould us it to show future classes. The game is a ballence between total awsomeness and education and recomend anyone who like open sandboxes and physics. This game has been in early access for so long. 8.75/10			",37,8,0,2,3,0,4

								You know its a good game when there are 102 positive reveiws and 1 negative review.This simulator is really good. It basically simulates our solar system and what can change if you, well launch the moon into earth or explode the sun and watch the planets fly out of orbit, basically you can start the apocalypse in this game. 10/10 hightly recommend this.

								This is an excellent simulation on the universe. You can set up your own simulation and see what happens or just use one of the many pre made situations. Go for an educational experience as you look at the planet as the temperature increases, as you tilt the axis, or even look at one of 50,000 celestial bodies.Or, say hang it and chuck the moon and the Earth and laugh manically at the destruction!It runs really smoothly has some nice sound design. However they could implement a way to increase the UI size for higher resolutions, running it in 4K and the UI become nigh on unreadable. However this is in the grand scheme of things is minor, I've only played it for about 2 hours today and I had so much fum. Here's a video showing my first impressions:

								Do you have a terrible imagination and little to no curiosity as to how physics works? Do you hate the laws of gravitation and show disdain for the wonders of the universe? Then this game isn't for you. Don't get it.If, on the other hand, you love space, or just really want to make pluto devour the universe: Buy it. This game is wonderful and a fantastic sequel to the first game. The developers know what they're doing and have done a lot of research in order to make this game as accurate as it is. It's a sandbox game, so it's only as fun as you can make it. There's no plot, no main theme, no goal (although the music is pretty great) so go ahead and make the earth plunge into a state of warmth that would surely wipe out all life, or replace the sun with a black hole. You could even terraform mars if you wanted.Best game 10/10 IGN			",444,127,7,58,70,2,81

								The fun you can have with this game is boundless, the game looks gorgeous and it also teaches you something instead of gunning people down and driving fast cars. The simulations are great and the music that plays in the background is brilliant, it's very relaxing to sit back and create your own solar system. But if you feel like causing some mayhem you can always collide galaxies into one another, or launch the moon into the planet (my personal favourite). If your into space and astronomey and even physics based games then you really should pick this up, totally worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Steam essential (>10hr/$) A good pick (2-10hr/$) Worth your time (1-2hr/$)Meh (0.5-1hr/$)Not exactly... (0.3-0.5hr/$)Do not buy. (<0.3hr/$)(130 hours, $25)Universe Sandbox is a game where you smash Earth into Mars, the sun into a black hole, or galaxies together. You can learn how orbits and collisions work because Universe Sandbox lets you play around with various things, giving you dozens of built in simulations and freedom to make and share your own. You play as a god, creating planets or other objects and experimenting: What happens when I throw Mars at Earth? What if I do it at half the speed of light? What if I bomb Jupiter with hundreds of Earths? What if I gave Venus rings? All of these questions can be answered in Universe Sandbox.I recommend Universe Sandbox to anyone who wants a relaxing game about throwing planets at eachother.			",45,9,2,3,17,0,3

								I love the freedom and flexibility of the game. I love how you can hop between planets and learn about their composition and mass. I also love how you can change their properties and see the effects (to a certain extent. hope to see this improve soon). Good job!Delve more into the depths of terraforming planets; effects of global warming, core composition and introduction of organics. It would also be brilliant if storms were to be seen on planets and moons with the correct atmospheres and surface composition. As well as this it would be interesting to see Earth change as the years move on, such as seeing the cities grow and seeing man made satellites around the planet - maybe you could introduce the eventual colonisation on other planets as time progresses, as a small, automatic event. Hey, maybe you could even include nuclear war occuring in some intances or ships disappearing as they enter lightspeed travel - that would be a brilliant little touch!Overall, I love this game, and will be seeing myself spending hundreds of hours with it in the future!

								As someone who majored in physics in college and enjoys astrophysics a great deal, I love this simulator. If they could add a historical geological and biological simulator of Earth, that would make this simulator perfect. You know, show Pangea forming and then splitting apart to form the continents of today and show the Ice Age. And show the evolution of Primates and other animal populations on Earth in their natural environments, at least in a basic way (that might be asking a bit too much). Oh and maybe improve the graphics at close range, they are a bit meh.Other than that, this is so good and it's only in Early Access.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Are you interested in space and physics? Do you enjoy watching the beauty of natural dynamics at work? Then I cannot recommend this game enough. It's physical simulation is very accurate and keeps getting better. You can tweak almost every variable you can think of and see how the simulation changes - or you can just smash things together.Pros +- Super immersive- Visually stunning- Large collection of actual celestial objects we have data on- Collide objects for explosions and amusement or watch incredibly precise and fragile systems do their thing- Actively developed with additions of newfound celestial objects and physical phenomenaCons -- Higher speeds decrease the accuracy of the simulation (which is understandable)- Some visual effects might glitch or not appear correctly			",94,13,0,12,7,0,6

								The game gets old fast. it looked good when i first saw it but it didnt take me long to find out that is all you could do... what the pictures show you. which for a game like this where you learn and discover isn't good. I can prove that because most of the reviews no matter if they are positive or negative, the people have under 10 hours which for a $25 game is bad.			",20,1,0,2,4,0,0

								Absolutely fascinating and a fantastic educational tool for kids.This is a program EVERY science school in the country should have access to.It is really good that you can change things to see different energy releases etc, really fascinating to watch, and if you have a beefy PC like I do, its just sickly awesome.I totally recommend everyone buy this and try this, no you wont get hundreds of playing hours out of it unless your an astrologist with OCD issues, but what you do get is a facinating look at the universe/solar system from a completely different perspective.Watch it on a 71 inch super high def screen.Its like taking the NASA supercomputer and slapping it in your lounge !Cheap and fun and great for teaching kids how things work off our planet, buy it.

								Very beautiful game and awesome physics. Problem is after 2 hours it kind of gets pretty boring after you made the sun and other stars go super nova and flung plantes at each other until it becomes a star then again blows up in to a supernova. It gets old fast. I just dont feel like the price matches whats offered in its current state the price could be about ten less then twenty four. Once this is fully finished I would say it's current price would be perfect. It feels more like something you'd play with in your highschool physics class in its current form.			",19,2,2,9,10,0,9

								Might have bought this as a knee jerk decision. ""Ooooo physics, I want it!""Unfortunately I was a little bummed out with what I could do in this game. After checking out every scenario that came with the game there was a disappointing moment when I realized I didn't want to just fling stuff at Earth and watch the same Micheal Bay movie each time.Adding mass to planets was fun. Turning Jupiter into a star was super cool. Watching moons corkscrew around an orbiting planet was fascinating.Its not that I didn't enjoy this game at all, but I was just a little blind sided by the price considering how little there was to do. Looks pretty though. Maybe its more of a UniverseScreensaver.Will re-review as this game is early access! Maybe I will learn to love it.6/10 would watch Julian moons orbit Jupiter again ",12,5,0,0,8,0,1

								I came to the realisation that Pluto was mad because he was downgraded from a planet to basically a non-existent rock. Pluto wanted revenge.I increased Plutos mass to the size of Jupiter. Pluto grew suddenly.It wasn't enough. I increased Plutos surface tempreture to 3000c. I again, increased his mass, to the mass of the sun. Pluto glowed an angry red, whilst throwing off the orbit of nearby planets. It still wasn't enough.I decided to completely let loose, and I increased Plutos mass to 1000 the times of the sun. Not-so-little Pluto grew massive, consuming everything in his path, and completely ruining the orbits of other planets. Pluto stared at the sun. Pluto drifted towards the sun, in a red ball of anger. Pluto hit the sun, and then...Silence.Suddenly, the sun went supernova, and consumed the entire solar system. All at the hands of little Pluto. 11\10 would destroy our solar system again			",50,1,1,3,5,1,2

								this game some how reminds me how small i am... every sins i've done, every mistake, it just silly that i am is still shame less human being i mean just look at it, for example open the game and try to simulate the making of galaxy like nebula theories, twin star, big bang etc. this game can simulated it smoothly.  if that wouldnt make you think small enough compare universe, try to move the earth orbit slightly, just couple notch and wait what will happen to earth, what will happen to us. we are so fragile. beside this game goods for hit em up, educational, i found that this game has a spiritual functionality. VY Canis Majoris, google it, for those still wont believe how small we are, and act still like fraud to other people and nature. sorry for being emotional while writing this review, great game btw.

								really like this series, i played Universe Sandbox 1 alot and this is huge improvment on the pervious sandbox. base line: its just fun to explore and mess with the solar system and the star charts, like a road map for the universe/ sol system that you can mess up and even destroy with a black hole. the detail to the planets is nice and the climate controls are crazy, such as removing all the water from a planet or raising the tempature and watching the ice caps melt. there are even a few pop culture refrences such as the phantom zone and the monolith from 2001. random thought: its very informative about the galaxy i feel that if i were to get lost in the sol system i could look at some star charts and get back. closing: welp all in all it just fun. would buy the 3rd one. 8.5/10.

								If you're generally interested in celestial bodies, universal physics and space, you will LOVE this simulator, which is suprisingly accurate and detailed for $25. As a continually updating project, with each update it gives you more features to play around with. It has this really engaging environment and atmosphere about it that will just absorb you. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even if you are not it is still pretty cool to cause chaos on a massive scale and watch it unfold. Just get it if you got the money to spare.			",65,10,1,7,12,0,8

								This is just a alpha version and still pretty good. And I firmly believe that the developers will give their best so one day, we will be able to play god and create our own universe where real and conscious human beens will live in. So invest in new hardware cuz you are gonna need it+directx 12. If you do that, then you will be able to do anything you want, just like the ♥♥♥♥ers who simulate our own universe. Imagine, 2 or 3 year from now you can watch the virtual muslims praise you as some kind of almighty being while in real life you are just some fat ♥♥♥♥ who gets off watching simulated people acting the same way as us. And when we finally get our based vr from oculust rift, we will be able to create our own harem within our simualted universe and don't even have to buy those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Japanese dating sims anymore.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								PROs:- This games need to exist- There is not a single objetive or points. Its a pure sandbox- Lots of pre-made simulations- Beautiful. Great sense of scale. Slow music: Perfecto to unwindCONs- Even tho is very enjoyable in its current state, this is far from finished- Glitchy: planets disappearing for no reason, tutorial text covering the options, game refuses to close...- Tutorials are very limited. There are tons of variables on this game. Educational value is very low right now- No community simulations- No current ""known universe"" simulation available where you can zoom in and out. At least I didnt find it- Explosions are horrible: the planets either merge in a perfect brand new sphere or create a crater that is nothing but a 3d model of a crater on the spot of the collision. This means you cant destroy a planet little by little and that collisions dont ""stack""- Time only moves forward. No rewind button- They push you constantly to rate the game. I know this is effective in increasing the number of reviews, but is not okay in my book- Planet details when you zoom in is not bad, but is less that I would like			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I loved this game. Emphasis on the past tense. I was excited to play it and when I was able to it was a ton of fun. But now there's an issue where the initial load screen will pop up and at the bottom it'll read ""starting the sandbox"" and then it'll just stop. No error message. It'll just sit there like that until I click and windows says it's not responding. I don't know if it's because my computer is a piece of crap or what but I looked up solutions and tried most and nothing worked. I don't know what to do now but just warn others that this can happen by writing a review. I bought and now can't play this game. I really hope that this issue is eventually fixed because I want to recommend this to everyone who loves space and physics and such but when there is an issue like this that literally makes the game unplayable I just can't recommend this to anyone.

								Definitely worth the money. It is a great game if you love learning about space like I do. Physics are awesome and the simulations are AMAZING. I really suggest a multiplayer mode where you could build solar systems and do simulations with friends, or even a multiplayer competition mode to see who could make a habitable planet first, etc. Just ideas but it would be awesome if they were in the game.

								This game really shines as a VR tech demo. As a sort of ""launch title"" for the Vive, it fits perfectly. You can just tool around with solar systems and planets and the like, and it's pretty amazing to watch. It's not really a game though, so if that's what you're after then you should probably not get this. If you want to watch / destroy planets then this is the game for you			",601,108,15,61,101,4,77

								Universe Sandbox 2 is a game where you mess around with the universe. It mainly focuses on solar systems and you can make your own and such using random presets. The game is in early access and hopefully the devs will work on it over the next several months. Should you buy this game?I loved to watch videos of this game but was put off it by one particular comment. ""The game gets boring quickly."" I got the game 4 months later as one of my family members said I could buy something as long as it is either educational or physical.The game was not boring. It was incredibly fun and time flies when I play it. The only issue I have is it's a game you play before you go to work/bed. Game sessions are usually over 1 hour for me but that is due to me owning the game for a small time. So it all comes down to this...Buy this game if you love space, explosions, astronomy or just science in general. Avoid if you are looking for a big game with lots of content you can binge on. Do pick this game up sometime though as it is a huge improvement from the first game (which I hated).I don't like to give anything a score as scores are translated differently. I will however give this game one word that I think it deserves. Success.			",80,6,0,10,17,0,15

								Ok bought this to pass time as i recently got fired from work and aint got nothing to fill my days with. I suppose you can have a bit of fun with it, its quite pleasurable to wreak havoc in the solarsystem with massive black holes and bombarding earth with comets and watching the world end. It gets old very very fast though. 30 minutes playtime and i doubt i will be spending much more with this. This is the kind of thing that would be very much worth it if it was free but with this pricetag it is impossible to recomend it.			",74,19,1,11,10,0,5

								It's good, but it lacks content. It was fun for about 2 hours until it got pretty boring. I know it's still early access, but the price is just way to expensive for the content we have right now. Overall, I recommend you wait until this game is finished before buying the game. For now, I give it a negative. But I do hope it improves in the future, and this negative might become a positive.			",16,4,0,2,6,0,2

								Universe Sandbox is a beautiful game which offers numerous simulations of things like our solar system, black holes, and binary pulsars. However, the simulations are (relatively) small scale, as in, you can't navigate our known universe. For example, I expected to be able to zoom out from the solar system and see celestial bodies which surround ours in the Milky Way, then zoom out even further to see what's around the Milky Way. As of now, this isn't possible, though it may be added since the game is in open alpha.Unfortunately, in its present state, this isn't much of a ""universe"" sandbox as it is just a space sandbox. Very disappointed!			",89,21,3,15,7,1,10

								I usually always buy my games in sales, but I couldn't help myself with this one, had to try it, I'm all day watching documentaries about the space and I was expecting be able to live it with this game, but I found a very boring experience, I don't think the planets have enough details and some stuff didnt see quite right (if you put 5 planets together they become 1 planet of the exactly same size?), I played it for around 20 minutes and get bored, I would love to see more information about what is happening and why instead of see the same animations again and again. This game would be perfect if they use it to create documentaries (or maybe allow people to create theirs and share it?), I would buy it for sure. I really wanted to enjoy this game but its not for everyone I guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A glorified n-body physics simulator that's as dull as dishwater and pointless.It's interesting for a few minutes, until you start noticing the limitations of the ""simulation"".Smash Earth with the moon? It's okay--it'll cool back down to clement temperatues a year after turning into a molten ball of fire, and all the continents will still be in place--even with city lights in the night time!Change Jupiter's tilt somehow? Its cloud system will not change or shift with the new tilt.So you're basically buying a simulator where the planets are just textured balls. There's some crude climate simulation for Earth that is just wrong--even with 2C over current global temperatures, we have Europe looking like it did 10,000 years ago during the last Ice Age.The collisions are vaguely entertaining for a while, until you notice that the larger colliding body essentially never changes--it just gets more massive with the same textures remaining.And to add to my bitterness, a refund was refused--so screw you too, Valve. Way to encourage software piracy.			",68,21,2,11,19,0,20

								Maybe this just isn't my type of game, but there didn't seem to be any entertainment in the game for me. It was very repetitive, oh look I smashed a couple suns together and they went supernova, oh look a simulation of a supernova in the milky way. Wait, thats the same simulation with a bunch of dots resembling stars surrounding it.			",34,3,2,1,10,0,1

								It is a great game on VR. My only problem right now with it is that it have some issue with compositor in full screen. Google Tilt Brush does not have this issue. The game only worked twice for me, and rest of the time is is pure fustration in trying to make the game running. I am using Windows 10 at the moment, and I am not sure if this has anything to do with compatiable issues. I wish that if the developer can get hold of this problem, I would rate it high.

								-The solar simulation is lacking, a star will always be 100% hydrogen. Even if it has a thousand years until supernova, even if it is already a stellar remnant - neither a neutron star nor a white dwarf is 100% hydrogen.-There are only 6 ""elements"", or rather things bodies can consist of: hydrogen, water, silicate, iron, organic and dark matter.-Any object can easily be accelerated above light speed.-Any planet or star can rotate as fast as it wants, they never break apart-There is no mass transfer in a binary star system. Red giant and a white dwarf, which are just way too close? No mass transfer, no accretion disk, nothing.-The collision system is glitchy.Right now, these are the reasons why I'm somewhat disappointed in this.			",62,5,3,6,16,1,8

								(VR REVIEW)Ok, so I have had this game for a while and decided to try it out with the Vive. I am not sure how much I payed for the game when I first purchased it but here is my honest opinion. The game is amazing in VR, you can see all of the planets like never before and get a real life scale if you would like. It feels like I am litteraly exploring space but, I played it for about 10 - 20 minutes and soon found myself bored. It is not like their are aliens and you can explore other galaxeies so after a while of playing around you get bored. Overall it is an amazing VR experience but I do not think it is worth the price.			",124,34,3,7,30,3,3

THIS IS NOT A GAMEIn the strictest sense, this is not a game.  It is a toy, something for you to sit down with for a few hours and just see what it is like to destroy Earth, or the Sun, or the Milky Way.This is not something that would appeal to many people.  You have to be extremely interested in astrophysics to even want to buy this title, and those that are educated in astrophysics, you start to notice some issues with this right away such as the lack of space-time distortion near massive objects such as black holes or super-massive stars.  This game is very rhudementary at the simulation of basic physics and does not apply any theorethical rules that we have found to be true in the past decade which is disappointing.Orbits are innacurate, showing loss of velocity on each revolution just by having an abnormal or eliptical orbit.  While unstable orbits can maraculiously become stable (there is a reason they're called unstable, because there is a collision trajectory). This is not true to life and violates the laws of thermal dynamics. The show stopper, was having objects that can move as fast as the speed of light.  The current school of thought says that the more massive an object is, the expodentially harder it is to achieve speeds remotely close to the speed of light.  In essence, the fatter you are, the harder it is to run fast.  The universe has the same laws, which are violated in this ""toy"".Again, this is a TOY, not even a simulator, if this was listed on steam as such I would have gave it a glowing recommendation.  However, this is no game, and is decietful to market it as such because there is no playing field, no objective, no goal.  It is a sandbox with sand -- which is a toy, again, not a game.

Also notice how long this has been in early access including the time before this hit Steam.

However, after leaving some honest comments and suggestions and checked ""dis-satisfied"", the game won't close, not even when I used task manager. After I changed rating to ""Very satisfied"", the game shuts down with no problem.I hope this is a design issue and the Dev can fix those two bugs. Really looking forward to how the game plays.==========================Edit:For the record, I'm usingi-7 6700K @ 4.00 GHz8GB RAMGTX 960 2GBWin 10 64bitThere shouldn't be any problem running this game.

								**I'm going to stress that this is a review for the current Alpha of this ""game"" (toy?). I fully expect to change my review to positive when it releases.**Right now, its fairly limited. Setting up your own systems is much harder than it should be -for me at least- and usually ends in lots of explosions, getting objects where you want them just isn't very intuitive.I wouldn't say the game runs poorly, but it could run a lot better. However, After playing it again recently, I definitely noticed improvement, so I imagine the game will run quite smoothly by release.The number of objects you get to play around with feels a bit lackluster, but that should also be improved. They are also planning to add Steam Workshop integration, which would be more than enough.The game does let you edit a metric ton of attributes for every object in real time, as well as gravity and other such things, which is pretty sweet. If you want to run a simulation with 1,000x normal gravity and an Earth the size of 1,000,000,000 suns, you can do that.In its current state, I wouldn't recommend this unless you're really into astronomy, or just have a thing for blowing up planets. But it definitely has potential to be great later on. I definitely expect to come back to this one later on.(If you like my reviews, I'm posting them all on this hideous Wordpress site now! https://probablysanny.wordpress.com/) ",182,50,1,17,13,3,16

I would love to get a refund, but as a warning to (EVERYONE WHO BUYS THIS GAME) you should play up to the 1 hour and 45 minute mark because it gets repetitive. I couldn't get a refund because this game is basically worth 3 hours of gameplay before you start disliking it. The price is waaay to high for a game like this, even with all the work the game studio put into it. I know there are different scenarios and if you do really enjoy these types of games, go ahead.

								M'aiq will make this following review a compliment sandwich.Pro- M'aiq thinks the stars are pretty.Con- M'aiq has a six-core I7 processor and three GTX-980s in SLI and once he started playing with one ""tiny"" 4.3 million solar mass black hole, the fps bounced between 10-15. For reference, M'aiq runs Fallout 4 and Grand Theft Auto V in 4k resolutions at ultra settings respectively. M'aiq even uses 4k texture replacers in Fallout 4 without issue. M'aiq was not impressed.Pro- M'aiq thinks the galaxies are beautiful. M'aiq thanks you all for reading his review.M'aiq wishes you well.			",39,1,1,5,3,1,1

								Slightly disappointed. Seems to me that the main focus is for ramming planets into other planets (or stars, moons, asteroids, etc.) I watched the Jupiter/Jupiter collision. One is stationary one comes in from the left and rams into the other. Nice graphics. The final object is the same size and for some reason is moving to the left. (???) That doesn't seem right.  I don't see any way to set up a solar system with custom orbits. Sure, I made one system, but all orbits were round and in the same plane. That's not very natural. I don't see how to customize that. I went right through all the tutorials. I can make a pulsar! Ooh. big deal. I see a computer graphic of a magnetized white dwarf. Is that what they really look like? Maybe a bit.I'm quite an astronomy fanatic, but I don't feel I got $30 worth. Of course, it is an early access release and so it could still get better yet. Let's hope it gets a lot better. I don't understand all these thumbs up recommendations, seriously.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I though I would have been able to rearrange up the universe in a kind of god-mode type of scenario, but that doesn't happen. Moreover I seem to be stuck only in the local solar system and can't go anywhere else. I wish there was some type of a refund that I could get, but I guess there is no such thing and I am f***ked.

								Universe Sandbox 2 is great for what it is, unfortunately what it is is a simulation that gets old after about 15 minutes. There simply isn't enough content to make it interesting for any extended period of time. If you do buy this your entire experience with this game will be as follows, crash stuff into other stuff, crash more things into other more things, use a teapot as a weapon of mass destruction, rethink your life decisions, ask for refund. I might give this game a positive review if it costed only 5 dollars or so, but at it's current price I cannot reccomend it.			",47,8,0,21,12,0,18

								Reviews said to get it, so I did, played it once. Unlike many simulators where there's a minimal objective to hit, in the sense that so far I didn't see any minor objectives other than to mess around. I'm past my refund window, so sadly I'm stuck with this. If you're looking for a fun game, this is not it. If you want to throw $25 at your PC and wonder why you did so, then this is your game.

								If you are only looking for a game with great physics I would recomend this game. But if you like playing games with much and good conntent that never gets boring i wouldn't recomend it at all, Defenetly not worth the 22,99€. If it's made to be a sandbox it should have more conntent to gain my intrest to it. I know it would not be a sandbox if this was added but I think it would be cool if they added ´´missions´´. So to the conclusion. This is a great game for abuot 1-2 hours, and 1-2 hours of enyojable gameplay for 22,99€ is simply not worth it.			",28,1,1,1,7,0,0

								I really wanted to enjoy this simulation.  But it's severely lacking as is.  Here are my gripes:#1- Each simulation type is independent of the other.  I was expecting all worlds to have environmental simulations enabled, but they don't.  Only specially designed prefabs (earth and mars I think are only ones?) have the environmental simulation enabled.  There are other simulation setups, but they seem too pigeonholed to really allow for true sandbox tinkering.#2- It seems like the only interesting things I do are collisions and design some cool orbits I guess.  The level of simulation detail in other areas is far too little to make it fun to me.#3- Why doesn't the matter projectile thingy add to a planet's makeup and mass?  Atmosphere mechanics are awful.  I was expecting to be able to add gasses or water to a planet and have it establish an atmosphere, or maybe it wasn't big enough to hold an atmosphere?  All cloud cover looks the same as earths, there is no attempt to model a planets atmosphere, and there is absolutely no detail paid to the amazing amount of atmospheric complexity of gas giants.(these two below are minor gripes)#4- The simulation including all moons (or even our own moon) is a bit hidden, and I can't find a pre-built simulation including all the defined solar system objects.#5- Can't you come up with some way to model multiple star systems realistically?  Would be cool if I can hurl one star system at another and see the results  Maybe pause and group multiple stable(ish) objects together as one mass data point at very far zoom distances so that you can actually build a few systems.#6- The interface needs lots of work.  If I have hundreds of objects on screen, why not (by default) just display the most important trails and orbits at extreme zooms?  Like if I'm looking at the solar system, only the major planets should be shown at max zoom, as I zoom in more, show me smaller and smaller objects or something?  Things get extremely cluttered.  Also, the pause on impact needs a threshold or something and maybe detect an impact a few minutes before it happens so that I can watch or intervene on the things I'm actually interested in.If you like to watch planets collide for hours with predictable identical results every time, you might get enjoyment out of this.  The only reason I personally didn't ask for return from the dev is that it's a very cool project and I'm hoping I can come back to it in another couple years and it is more the fully featured simulation I was hoping for originally.  Also, the devs care deeply for this game which is great news!			",52,12,3,6,39,3,10

								Anyone considering purchasing this ""game"" should be aware:You are about to spend 25 dollars on a javascript physics simulator.  There are thousands of freeware programs that will show you the same things.Space Engine (another freeware program) has far superior graphics, a better interface, and has far better graphics and interactivity.I am certain that the developers will promise you that if you give them 25 bucks to play with their javascript physics simulator, they might give you something better in the future.How long?  I mean- it took them four years to crib enough script from javascript physics simulators to create this sorry thing- do they promise that in another four, they will be able to match what Space Engine gives you now, for free?I regret wasting my money on this.

								I can't create a functional solar system yet but I can sure figure out a way to f**k it up by just clicking on things. Terrorism simulator 2015. 9/11 would be a universal terrorist again.Pros-You can blow planets up with ease, no need for silly nukes, warframes, or deathstars.-Cool presets which usually result in some sort of destruction, or can be modified to cause it with minimal effort.-See how many times you can f**k over the Earth and realize how fragile it is so you can't sleep at night.-Shouting ALLAHU AKBAR when blowing up the Earth is satisfying.-Black holes-Pretty colors when things blow up.-Did I mention destroying things.Cons-Can get a bit laggy at times (but thats probably just me putting an excessive amount of space things for no reason and my laptop cant handle it)-Get mad at the universe or god or whatever you want to believe in because you can't create a perfect solar system unless you use presets or are in fact god.-Makes you fear for your very existance.-A few bugs here and there as with any game but nothing gamebreaking, barely notice them.Overall I would definatly give this game a 10/10 at its current state. Get it if you like to see stuff in the universe blowing up. ",86,10,2,7,8,0,2

								This game is amongst the best examples of merging accurate simulations with beautiful interfaces. A great example of how well everything works is to drop the timescale to realtime, place a still moon in the path of the earth, and watch as the atmosphere burns away, followed by the seas, followed by the earth becoming a molten ball. You can even graph properties of earth as compared with other planetary bodies to see how close this gets earth to the temperature of the sun.			",631,185,16,72,88,6,149

								This game is beautiful. Absolutely stunning. It has great physics and calming music. Great for those interested in astronomy. I havent even played this game for an hour yet, and I have already fallen in love. It doesn't ask for much on your computer, and its graphics are beautiful. It abides to the laws of physics, so you wont be seeing planets randomly shoot into the skies at speeds faster than that of light, therefor you are able to control your craetions without everything exploding instantly. Its easy to get used to, and the tutorial gives you a good explanation of the game. If you're not great at creating, you can play around with the pre-made simulations. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game. 10/10			",12,0,0,0,4,0,0

								 For this to be an early access game, and only in it's Alpha stage I belive this is a great game; even if it were fully released in this state! The game doesn't simuate life growing on a planet or reletiviy since it's in Alpha, but instead has supernovas! And climate changes, and black holes, and even tidal heating!This game allows you to do so much tweaking to the point where you'll sit and ask your self. ""This is only in Alpha?!"" Well yes it is, and I can hardly wait to see it's future updates to see what they add and fix! If you at all like space or science or anything like that, you'll probably love this game!This game has so much detail to it, and is down right beautiful! It highly recommend you look into it. It is for sure worth your time!			",28,3,1,3,15,0,0

								Just bought it, played it for a bit. Gotta say it is a sweet buy, I just had a trippy and eye-opening experience about how space works. Plus I just browsed the community hub, and these developers clearly care about what the user thinks. Some cool stuff I noticed:-Super well polished, menu is clear and stylish.-Cool music, instils a sense of wonder and awe.-Sound effects! Subtle, but appreciated. Zoom into a star while wearing headphones and there is this cool eerie and powerful sounding rumble.-I zoomed around space, found an asteroid way beyond plutos orbit. Googed it, found it was real. Read wikipedia articles about it. Set its mass to be equivalent to the sun.What I am saying is, if you are interested in space and wanna mess around in a simulation of the universe where you have godlike powers over time and matter and 25 bucks doesn't sound like too much to drop for those powers than buy it!

I highly recommend this simulator for anyone looking to learn a little bit about space, as well as play god with space. I really liked the first one, and I fell in love with the second one. Here are some reasons I fell in love:1) This title made me completely forget about the previous it was that fantastic of an improvement.2) The collisions are absolutely stunning.3) Fantastic development team.4) Real time physics sandbox.5) Graphically impressive6) Anything can be in slow motion, real time, or high speed. That is your decision.7) Mess with objects ranging from the size of Pool Balls to Galaxies.8) Huge future ahead.			",34,3,0,2,12,0,11

								The main reason that I got this game was for planetary collisions and explosions... I am satisfied.The only problem that I've encountered is that galaxies do not load for me (well, all that loads up is a collection of stars and a title saying 'not named'. That may be due to the fact that this is still an Alpha, or my own computer's fault). I only really play this game when there are updates, which is pretty frequent compared to other games *cough cough* Overgrowth *cough cough*.			",55,2,1,2,8,1,7

								Send the Moon on a collision course with the Earth, then stand on the surface of the Earth and watch the Moon getting bigger...and bigger... and bigger! It's quite scary! The only limit to this simulation is your imagination, use it to create chaos in the universe and then sit back and enjoy the show! It makes you realize how vulnerable we are on this tiny speck of dusk we call Earth.			",2,1,1,0,24,2,7

								I definitely recommend picking up this game. I got it a while back when it was in Alpha 10 or so, and the devs have been quite good at adding new content with fairly regular updates. I can't wait to see what the full release will look like. Stunning graphics and surprisingly well optimised. I've seen some reviews complaining about the lack of content. Although there isn't an overwhelming amount of content, if you use your imagination, you can create some quite spectacular sims. You want to grow a tiny rock to the size of a galaxy and destroy huge solar systems? You can do it. You want to blow up the sun? You can do it. You want to endlessly bombard Earth with meteorites? You can do it. You want to recreate the extinction of the dinosaurs? You can also do it. The fun is nearly endless with this game.			",67,9,2,9,21,0,17

								This a fantastic space sim. If you would like to blow up earth (or anything else in space) by launching a moon, planet, star, the sun, a black hole or even a giant football at it... YOU CAN do that in this game. Even though i spent %80 of my time blowing up earth and laughing at the weak human race, you could do a lot of stuff with this, especially if you're smart and creative.Also its pretty cheap, so if you have the slightest interest GET IT, because there aren't many games like this in the market and this one deserves attention.IMPORTANT: Here is the thing about early access games: They ALWAYS have bugs... and i had so many crashes with this one. I'm sure more patches and optimisation is comming.			",155,25,4,12,19,3,17

								As a science and science fiction enthusiast, I highly recommend this simulation program/game that lets us play around and discover. It lets us answer our ""What would happen if...?"" questions, see the different scenarios we can create and how they turn out.Keep in mind, every day, we are still learning and our understanding of the universe around us changes over time. As well as the fact this game is in early access. It is by far finished and there are plenty of bugs and glitches we, the community, can help discover and report to the developers so that they may improve and turn this gem into a real beauty.The controls can be a little confusing at first, the tutorials are good but could use a little bit or work (or perhaps more tutorials!) but take your time to explore each function, sometimes there are more options than is immediately apparent.Overall I am happy with this program and I hope it gets the attention and success it deserves.

								My first impression after 43 minutes of exploring this Sandbox:If you like Space(Or planning to be future Physicst as me) - IT IS A MUST. It's really mindbuggling & really opening your horizons about what looks like small dot in the sky. You can adjust anything and I even made huge basketball ball(Larger than earth) to see what's happening if it collides Earth. It's a great way to get your spirit up and your imagination a great deal of fun. You have so many planets, collison courses and so on you can do. It's a great way to learn about the universe. You can really adjust almost important things about planets & physics engine not bad at all.The turtorial is really simple, very fluid and easy to comprehend.The downsize of the game that sometimes it doesn't look as it's in real life. Especially the explosions & how planets/stars really look in life. I think many properties are missing when it comes to this. The Sun's explosion is fantastic, close to be real and also BEAUTIFUL thing ever!There is so many things they should add, even from Star Wars(Death Star) that would really make it awesome.  Last thing on my mind, the 3D graphic is quite simple, nothing special. It's a good thing if you have bad computer. You'll have problems only with too many objects or explosions at once(Getting close to them too).All in all - I LOVE SPACE - AWESOME!			",41,9,0,5,7,1,9

								Universe Sandbox is one of the best simulation games I've played. Being able to mess around with the universe or simply create a solar system and see how it turns out in millions of years is great fun and also a learning experience. I'll be especially excited when the possible simulation of life is added, and I hope that when it happens there will be more options for the planets meant to carry it. I have more to experiment with of course, but I definitely am going to follow this game's development. I don't dislike much about this game, and for still being in development it's a fantastic start. Anything I could critique about creativity limits will undoubtedly be addressed in the future (Like the creation of life on planets).I'd recommend this game to anyone who is curious about the universe and how it works. Also for anyone just interested in messing around in space. It is definitely worth getting, and few people aren't interested in outer space, so it seems like a good fit for most.All in all, it's worth finding out about and looking at. I highly recommend this to anyone I know.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is the kind of game the late Carl Sagan would have had wet dreams about.  You don't even have to do anything in it.  Just view the entire solar system and all the moons and watch the orbits; it will humble you.  Although I do suggest finding entertaining ways to destroy our planet.  I increased the Sun's gravity by 1,000 and Earth shot out of the solar system at .392 speed of light.10/10 will destroy Earth again...and again...and again...			",15,1,0,1,3,0,3

								This is the game (simulator?) I have always DREAMED of having. From nudging two pool balls together in LEO to crashing two galaxies together and watching them get torn apart star by star, the game performs well and satisfies.My only suggestion:Allow us to filter celestial objects in name, mass, radius order etc...But if you've played the first and even enjoyed it somewhat, this will quench your thirst. The UI is different in a good way, yet still very similar to the first, so there shouldn't be much confusion there.Infact, I'm struggling to find a downside to this game, in my honest opinion, it has done nothing but improve since the first.I'm a huge Elite and EVE Online fan, and this game gives me what those games can't. Those games allow me to slowly cruise around the galaxy, oggle at the stars as I whizz past.This game allows me to take those stars and smash them together at half the speed of light.11/10 would definitely recommend. (Even if space doesn't exite you as much as it does me)			",83,5,1,5,16,0,8

I am awestruck by this. Please, please, please support the developers and purchase this title. If you are on the fence about it, get off that fence and come on over to the dark side. Or the light side. You choose, that's the beauty. Oh, you wanna make a pulsar? Cool. Then you want to feed earth to that pulsar? Cool. Then you wanna start throwing black holes around all willy nilly until everything is whirling around in an unstoppable whirlwind of antimatter and teapots? That's cool too.

								A very beautiful ""game"", Universe Sandbox ² is a pleasure to play. Gives everyhing you would expect and more in a sandbox game, things to build, things to destroy, and many, many options. I mean that. This game is great for those who love astronomy and astrology (yes, they are different), and is yet still entertaining for someone who wants to blow things up.FEATURES:Early access, so you still have a chance to influence how the game develops, and may get special access to things later on in the development.Might be the best thing to do ever while listening to music or podcast or radio etc. Seriously, IDC if it is rap or classical music, does very well.PROS:Beautiful and well madeMany options, lives up to the sandbox titleFor anyone, and everyone. All can enjoy this titleCONS:Hard to call a game, more a tool/means of entertainment (aka not typical for steam)(some consider this a PRO)Confusing(even though it is great for people just wanting to have fun, it can confuse both with interface and astronomy)Dependant on you, this ""software"" (I suppose better than game), does not give you scenarios besides a few templates. You have to do everything to make something happen. (can take a lot of time) ",18,2,0,4,5,0,1

								Universe Sandbox is one of the best simulation games I've played. Being able to mess around with the universe or simply create a solar system and see how it turns out in millions of years is great fun and also a learning experience. I'll be especially excited when the possible simulation of life is added, and I hope that when it happens there will be more options for the planets meant to carry it. I have more to experiment with of course, but I definitely am going to follow this game's development. I don't dislike much about this game, and for still being in development it's a fantastic start. Anything I could critique about creativity limits will undoubtedly be addressed in the future (Like the creation of life on planets).I'd recommend this game to anyone who is curious about the universe and how it works. Also for anyone just interested in messing around in space. It is definitely worth getting, and few people aren't interested in outer space, so it seems like a good fit for most.All in all, it's worth finding out about and looking at. I highly recommend this to anyone I know.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Just bought it, played it for a bit. Gotta say it is a sweet buy, I just had a trippy and eye-opening experience about how space works. Plus I just browsed the community hub, and these developers clearly care about what the user thinks. Some cool stuff I noticed:-Super well polished, menu is clear and stylish.-Cool music, instils a sense of wonder and awe.-Sound effects! Subtle, but appreciated. Zoom into a star while wearing headphones and there is this cool eerie and powerful sounding rumble.-I zoomed around space, found an asteroid way beyond plutos orbit. Googed it, found it was real. Read wikipedia articles about it. Set its mass to be equivalent to the sun.What I am saying is, if you are interested in space and wanna mess around in a simulation of the universe where you have godlike powers over time and matter and 25 bucks doesn't sound like too much to drop for those powers than buy it!

That is your decision.7) Mess with objects ranging from the size of Pool Balls to Galaxies.8) Huge future ahead.			",34,3,0,2,12,0,11

								Are you a nerd? Do you wonder how things would be different if Mars was closer to the Sun? Or what it would be like if the Earth had two moons? Have you ever wanted to make your own solar system just to see what would happen? Or maybe smash an asteroid into Venus? Or maybe see what happens when you throw a rogue planet into the solar system? You can do these things are more in Universe Sandbox^2. I found out about this quite game quite accidentally. I had played Space Engine before, and someone mentioned that I should try US^2 if I liked SE. While SE is more of a space-exploration game, US^2 is a sandbox - you can twiddle with settings to see how things change. I guess it's kind of like playing God. If you had that sense of wonder when you played Space Engine, you can get that here too. You can see how planets change over the scale of centuries and millenia when you mess with their climates. You can change Mars' climate so that it has water. The possibilities are endless.This is a great learning tool too, especially for children who are interested in astronomy.Even though it is only in alpha, US^2 is still amazing. If it's so good now, I can't even imagine how amazing the final product will be.			",18,6,0,1,8,0,5

								step 1: Make every dwarf planet 10-1000 times it's mass. (add Nemesis/Tyche and Russell's teapot because why not?) step 2: ??? step 3: Tell the IAU to {CENSORED} Seriously though, this simulator provides mostly accurate information about astronomical objects and beautiful 3d models of the objects your viewing. I wish their were more gravity simulators like this because the only other I ever used was for academic purposes and you couldn't launch object out of orbit. Though I wish they'd feature more exoplanet systems and have more collision setups. However these are just nitpicks. The actual problems have to do with psychics themselves for example if Jupiter and Neptune were moving toward each other at 12 km/s Jupiter would not just swallow Neptune whole leaving a giant crater.

								step 1: Make every dwarf planet 10-1000 times it's mass. (add Nemesis/Tyche and Russell's teapot because why not?) step 2: ??? step 3: Tell the IAU to {CENSORED} Seriously though, this simulator provides mostly accurate information about astronomical objects and beautiful 3d models of the objects your viewing. I wish their were more gravity simulators like this because the only other I ever used was for academic purposes and you couldn't launch object out of orbit. Though I wish they'd feature more exoplanet systems and have more collision setups. However these are just nitpicks. The actual problems have to do with psychics themselves for example if Jupiter and Neptune were moving toward each other at 12 km/s Jupiter would not just swallow Neptune whole leaving a giant crater.

								It's early access, I know, but totally worth the money.Pros: - Scale, holy ♥♥♥♥ing cow O.o from tiny asteroids to massive stars, everything goes, everything is   there. in its size. - Options, options and even more options!  - fully controllable planets and stars, from their rough elemental make up to climate, velocity or    rotation and axis. You're the boss now - Awesome scenarios come build in. a galaxy merger, our solar system in all detail O.o just sit and    follow Saturn and its moons for a while - Soundtrack, few tracks, but memorable and extremely fitting for the onscreen action or lack there of. - No sandbox without tools of destruction. play with the mass of a planet and create a blackhole,    ♥♥♥♥ up a star and see a supernova unfold. or just blow them up with your almighty finger of god :D - graphics, while nothing 'special', it manages to deliver a rather pleasant viewing experience.   and don't get me wrong, it will impress you, over and over againCons: - after the recent update there's nothing I can complain about :)Can't wait for it to be finished. But so far it's been one hell of a ride. and I'll tag along until the end			",159,61,1,22,20,2,25

								I definitely recommend picking up this game. I got it a while back when it was in Alpha 10 or so, and the devs have been quite good at adding new content with fairly regular updates. I can't wait to see what the full release will look like. Stunning graphics and surprisingly well optimised. I've seen some reviews complaining about the lack of content. Although there isn't an overwhelming amount of content, if you use your imagination, you can create some quite spectacular sims. You want to grow a tiny rock to the size of a galaxy and destroy huge solar systems? You can do it. You want to blow up the sun? You can do it. You want to endlessly bombard Earth with meteorites? You can do it. You want to recreate the extinction of the dinosaurs? You can also do it. The fun is nearly endless with this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is an amazing game for an Alpha release.   First off, the colisions alone are worth getting this game, but the heat and gravity physics are also pretty good.  It isn't perfect, but hopefully it will improve over time.  I recommend this game heavily and I think it's a good investment.			",87,8,0,17,22,1,29

								Just bought it, played it for a bit. Gotta say it is a sweet buy, I just had a trippy and eye-opening experience about how space works. Plus I just browsed the community hub, and these developers clearly care about what the user thinks. Some cool stuff I noticed:-Super well polished, menu is clear and stylish.-Cool music, instils a sense of wonder and awe.-Sound effects! Subtle, but appreciated. Zoom into a star while wearing headphones and there is this cool eerie and powerful sounding rumble.-I zoomed around space, found an asteroid way beyond plutos orbit. Googed it, found it was real. Read wikipedia articles about it. Set its mass to be equivalent to the sun.What I am saying is, if you are interested in space and wanna mess around in a simulation of the universe where you have godlike powers over time and matter and 25 bucks doesn't sound like too much to drop for those powers than buy it!

								Fantastic simulator just waiting to quench your thirst to unleash your creativity! I highly recommend this simulator for anyone looking to learn a little bit about space, as well as play god with space. I really liked the first one, and I fell in love with the second one. Here are some reasons I fell in love:1) This title made me completely forget about the previous it was that fantastic of an improvement.2) The collisions are absolutely stunning.3) Fantastic development team.4) Real time physics sandbox.5) Graphically impressive6) Anything can be in slow motion, real time, or high speed. That is your decision.7) Mess with objects ranging from the size of Pool Balls to Galaxies.8) Huge future ahead.			",34,3,0,2,12,0,11

								The main reason that I got this game was for planetary collisions and explosions... I am satisfied.The only problem that I've encountered is that galaxies do not load for me (well, all that loads up is a collection of stars and a title saying 'not named'. That may be due to the fact that this is still an Alpha, or my own computer's fault). I only really play this game when there are updates, which is pretty frequent compared to other games *cough cough* Overgrowth *cough cough*.			",55,2,1,2,8,1,7

								Send the Moon on a collision course with the Earth, then stand on the surface of the Earth and watch the Moon getting bigger...and bigger... and bigger! It's quite scary! The only limit to this simulation is your imagination, use it to create chaos in the universe and then sit back and enjoy the show! It makes you realize how vulnerable we are on this tiny speck of dusk we call Earth.			",2,1,1,0,24,2,7

								My first impression after 43 minutes of exploring this Sandbox:If you like Space(Or planning to be future Physicst as me) - IT IS A MUST. It's really mindbuggling & really opening your horizons about what looks like small dot in the sky. You can adjust anything and I even made huge basketball ball(Larger than earth) to see what's happening if it collides Earth. It's a great way to get your spirit up and your imagination a great deal of fun. You have so many planets, collison courses and so on you can do. It's a great way to learn about the universe. You can really adjust almost important things about planets & physics engine not bad at all.The turtorial is really simple, very fluid and easy to comprehend.The downsize of the game that sometimes it doesn't look as it's in real life. Especially the explosions & how planets/stars really look in life. I think many properties are missing when it comes to this. The Sun's explosion is fantastic, close to be real and also BEAUTIFUL thing ever!There is so many things they should add, even from Star Wars(Death Star) that would really make it awesome.  Last thing on my mind, the 3D graphic is quite simple, nothing special. It's a good thing if you have bad computer. You'll have problems only with too many objects or explosions at once(Getting close to them too).All in all - I LOVE SPACE - AWESOME!			",41,9,0,5,7,1,9

								This is the kind of game the late Carl Sagan would have had wet dreams about.  You don't even have to do anything in it.  Just view the entire solar system and all the moons and watch the orbits; it will humble you.  Although I do suggest finding entertaining ways to destroy our planet.  I increased the Sun's gravity by 1,000 and Earth shot out of the solar system at .392 speed of light.10/10 will destroy Earth again...and again...and again...			",15,1,0,1,3,0,3

								This is the game (simulator?) I have always DREAMED of having. From nudging two pool balls together in LEO to crashing two galaxies together and watching them get torn apart star by star, the game performs well and satisfies.My only suggestion:Allow us to filter celestial objects in name, mass, radius order etc...But if you've played the first and even enjoyed it somewhat, this will quench your thirst. The UI is different in a good way, yet still very similar to the first, so there shouldn't be much confusion there.Infact, I'm struggling to find a downside to this game, in my honest opinion, it has done nothing but improve since the first.I'm a huge Elite and EVE Online fan, and this game gives me what those games can't. Those games allow me to slowly cruise around the galaxy, oggle at the stars as I whizz past.This game allows me to take those stars and smash them together at half the speed of light.11/10 would definitely recommend. (Even if space doesn't exite you as much as it does me)			",83,5,1,5,16,0,8

								There aren't enough synonyms for beautiful, because this simulation is all of them plus more. My cat was sitting next to me, and when he watched this, he turned into a fullgrown griffin. I am awestruck by this. Please, please, please support the developers and purchase this title. If you are on the fence about it, get off that fence and come on over to the dark side. Or the light side. You choose, that's the beauty. Oh, you wanna make a pulsar? Cool. Then you want to feed earth to that pulsar? Cool. Then you wanna start throwing black holes around all willy nilly until everything is whirling around in an unstoppable whirlwind of antimatter and teapots? That's cool too.

What I got was a game with soothing, beautiful (and slightly repedative) music in which you can either witness the destructive beauty of the universe, or have fun being as sadistic as one can be shooting asteroids or the moon into the Earth over and over again. And, while a liitle tricky, making a solar system from scratch and seeing it work is very satisfying.And the game isn't fully released yet! Can't wait.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A very beautiful ""game"", Universe Sandbox ² is a pleasure to play. Gives everyhing you would expect and more in a sandbox game, things to build, things to destroy, and many, many options. I mean that. This game is great for those who love astronomy and astrology (yes, they are different), and is yet still entertaining for someone who wants to blow things up.FEATURES:Early access, so you still have a chance to influence how the game develops, and may get special access to things later on in the development.Might be the best thing to do ever while listening to music or podcast or radio etc. Seriously, IDC if it is rap or classical music, does very well.PROS:Beautiful and well madeMany options, lives up to the sandbox titleFor anyone, and everyone. All can enjoy this titleCONS:Hard to call a game, more a tool/means of entertainment (aka not typical for steam)(some consider this a PRO)Confusing(even though it is great for people just wanting to have fun, it can confuse both with interface and astronomy)Dependant on you, this ""software"" (I suppose better than game), does not give you scenarios besides a few templates. You have to do everything to make something happen. (can take a lot of time) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's like playing pretend except better. Much better.			",269,60,4,36,37,3,42

								A fun and interesting way to destroy and create, on a universal scale. Playing this gave me chills as I watched the earth spiral away into space as the sun exploded, and as it cooled down to -25 Degrees. This game is a cool way to spend a few hours every so often to just mess about and create something amazing.This game will be amazing when it has more in it, but is still a fun simulation to play.This game is for those who love to build and destroy, and to those who love everything to do with Space.

								I've been playing this for quite a while now and I have to say, I'm impressed. I thought the first one was brilliant but then they added this with a new destruction engine and all sorts of other things, I really do reccomend it to people interested in space and people who just want to recreate ""Deep Impact"" or some other movie where the Earth gets destroyed quicker than the Golden Gate Bridge in a monster movie. There are many simulations to try out including super novas, black holes, planets and colliding galaxies. Although, as an honest player, it can get boring once you've ran out of ideas on what to do but that's only after many hours of playing and creating. Personally, this game is one of the best god games I know of. Another program I can say is a very good and beautiful space simulation is ""Space Engine"", it has been greenlit but you can get it now on the website ""www.spaceengine.com"" and it's completley free.

I highly recommend this to anyone who:1. Loves simulation games and the universe2. Loves to explode things in the name of SCIENCE!!!!!!!!!!3.

								This game is beautiful, fun, and so well made. I feel bad for all of the people who wrote reviews saying they got bored with the Universe after only a few hours, it shows an immense lack of creativity. Yes, you can crash planets into each other, you can blow up the sun, you can crash stars together, and I can see how some people would get bored if that was all they ever did. Did I do some of those things when I first started playing? Yes, because it's fun and funny. You want to know what I did after that? I changed the orbit of Saturn's moons to draw them in closer, causing their orbit trails become bright, colorful rings as they mixed into the debris of Saturn's rings. For good measure I threw Russell's teapot into orbit tooI created a binary solar system from two Sirius B's, with Iapetus and Venus in orbit around one, and Mars and Dione in orbit around the other. I watched a simulated span of 27 days cause Iapetus and Dione to disintegrated and spiral outward into the blackness. I saw emptiness fill up with sparkling lights from the remnants of those moons. I watched Venus begin to heat up till it glowed brighter than the star it was orbiting, and Mars fill with fire leaving glowing streamers in the wake of it's orbit.There is so much you can do with this game, so many ways to create and destroy, infinite possibilities in the vastness of space, only bound by the limits of your imagination.

								Steam says I have played for 1 min. I have player for a few hours, The game is really fun but it kinda gets boring after about 2 hours. The concept is cool but the game just looses its wow factor after a little while. Although blowing stuff up is really fun, its not like fun fun. You get the game and then you blow up planets. It gets boring quick. There are no gamebreaking bugs ive seen so far. But the game just gets boring after you have gone thru all of the simulations. I wouldnt ever pay $25 for this game. If there was more features like controlling life on earth and whatnot I would be more intested but the game gets old after a while.

								I could never afford the telescope that would focus clearly on the rings of Saturn, or even focus on the bands of Jupiter. Happily this is the compilation of all those wonders of the solar system, and the galaxies beyond I have always hankered for.Chock full of data about real objects in space, truly immense distances and time scales traversed with the sweep of a mouse, so many questions I had not the wit to ask, have been answered in this armchair space explorer.Awesome, because it shows what is known to be out there. But also allows us to create models of the 'what if' kind, so injecting some creative fun into the serious baseness of astrophysics. Someone needs to suggest it to Chuck Lorre & Bill Prady for inclusion in the Big Bang Theory, those nerdy MIT guys would know how to really bang the rocks off this ultimate sandbox!

								I can't create a functional solar system yet but I can sure figure out a way to f**k it up by just clicking on things. Terrorism simulator 2015. 9/11 would be a universal terrorist again.Pros-You can blow planets up with ease, no need for silly nukes, warframes, or deathstars.-Cool presets which usually result in some sort of destruction, or can be modified to cause it with minimal effort.-See how many times you can f**k over the Earth and realize how fragile it is so you can't sleep at night.-Shouting ALLAHU AKBAR when blowing up the Earth is satisfying.-Black holes-Pretty colors when things blow up.-Did I mention destroying things.Cons-Can get a bit laggy at times (but thats probably just me putting an excessive amount of space things for no reason and my laptop cant handle it)-Get mad at the universe or god or whatever you want to believe in because you can't create a perfect solar system unless you use presets or are in fact god.-Makes you fear for your very existance.-A few bugs here and there as with any game but nothing gamebreaking, barely notice them.Overall I would definatly give this game a 10/10 at its current state. Get it if you like to see stuff in the universe blowing up. ",86,10,2,7,8,0,2

								There is no creation at planets of the moon. A binding only to a star, at creation of new system in general an unclear binding in anywhere. There is no opportunity to recreate completely model even our solar system. For me it is the biggest shortcoming. Balls for golf and other garbage (allegedly objects) is in my opinion nonsense of developers.Full simulation at them didn't turn out.RUS:Отсутствует создание у планет лун. Привязка только к звезде, при создании новой системы вообще непонятная привязка в никуда. Нет возможности воссоздать полностью модель даже нашей солнечной системы.  Для меня это самый большой недостаток. Мячики для гольфа и остальной мусор(якобы объекты) - это на мой взгляд бред разработчиков.Полноценной симуляции у них не получилось.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								When i try to make the moon orbit the earth in the simple solar system scene and it just rides next to it i wonder how accurate this really is.. even with correct distances unless the earth is still and not orbiting a star (or any planet) the moon of said planet will most likely just ride next to it instead of orbiting it. still fun to run planets into each other though but space engine is better and free.

								I played the original Universe Sandbox many years ago, and was amazed by how well it was made, especially for a 2011 game! And this game leaves the first one in the dust. This game is amazing, ever wanted to launch the sun at Earth? Make Saturn into a rocky Earth-like planet with water? Go ahead. This game never fails to excite and entertain me with its endless possibilities.I'm very impressed by it's climate control and it's 3D lighting system for the continents, and how launching things at the Earth actually causes a crator to fill in with water, making it very realistic. I also like to freeze Earth over until it get's to -60 degrees and all the lights go out at night (they probably froze to death, or the worldwide power shut off because of the cold.) Thank you for making this absolutely stunning game!			",37,9,2,3,18,0,1

								Didn't play this game for a long time yet, but I feel like it definitely deserves an upvote. Compared to the first title, this game is highly performant and full of details. It's very polished and works like a charm. Although I'm not a Master of Astrophysics, the physics seem very accurate and on point. With the large amount of content at hand, your possibilities are only bounded by your imagination. Despite it's ""Early Access"" status I haven't found any crucial bugs yet. No ""Early Alpha Access Possibly 10 Years (Never Finish) Development"" crap. You're buying a full game with (hopefully) more stuff to come. This game needs to be played. You're worth it.

								First of all, this game is amazing. If you're a fan of space this is a must-have for you. It's incredible how detailed and full of amazing features this simulator is, how well made it is also, everything from the physics engine to the planet models to the way they would behave in an enviroment you can make all by yourself, how you can change anything about a cosmic object, it's speed,  it's mass, what elements it's composed of...What would happen to an Earth that is slightly tilted 5 more degrees inside of our Solar System? You can observe the changes in weather it would have because you can also see it get more snowy on some parts where it usually doesn't snow. It's details like that make me go ""woah... I can LEARN so much from thiiiiis"".This simulation game truly makes me happy. Space is awesome and this game makes you be part of it and even play god inside of it. I'm being serious, if you're a fan of space, get this game, you won't regret it.			",18,1,1,3,8,0,1

								Universe Sandbox² is amazing, it is the best and one of the only space simulators avalable to the public. The graphics are brilliant (providing you dont have an old computer/laptop), the music is just relaxing and fits with the simulator and the experiance, of just sitting there amazed by what is possible is phenomonal. Best of all, it is incredibly accurate. All of which are attributes make it more realistic, as well as the choice of engene and the simulated physics. There are absolutely no improvements possible, other than engine updates. You should definitely buy it. If you havn't got much money, buy Unverse Sandbox, if you do have more money, buy Universe Sandbox² and if you can afford it, I would recomend that you buy both. If your'e going to give money to someone, make sure it is to people who work for it, to make everybody else happy. It is an experiance, that you can't forget. Good work guys! :)			",7,0,0,0,3,0,0

								I only played for a little bit, before bed last night, but here are my thoughts.I play this entirely with the Vive, so I'm not sure how deep the simulation aspects are in the ""Normal"" version.As for Vive, it seems that your options are limited to spawning celestial bodies like stars, planets, and moons. You can launch them, or you can place them, and all bodies have gravity. If you place a planet near a sun, it will get sucked in and explode. Likewise, if you launch the planet around the sun, with enough velocity no less, it will make an orbit and continue on that course. Suns near suns are fun, do enough of them and you'll create a super nova that expands into a giant nebula. My framerate started to dip a bit, when I exploded a few dozen suns and made a massive nova or three. I'm using a GTX 980, for the record.I have yet to figure out how to make black holes or more complex systems, and I'm not sure if that's even possible yet. Here's hoping.What's here so far is pretty relaxed and simple, but it's also very engaging. If you're at all interested in astronomy, you'll be fascinated by Universe Sandbox 2. If you've played the first one, you'll know what to expect, and you'll be pleased with the extra work they've put into this one. If you're looking for progressive mechanics and stuff to hold your hand and show you how to do everything, maybe not. This title is less of a game, more like software. It's a true simulator, and it does what it intends to do very well.The music is also pretty nice. :PAll in all, I certainly recommend this title, especially if you're an HTC Vive user and you're looking for something to blow your mind.Here's hoping the development continues on this and we see even more wonders to immerse ourselves into.

								To say that this game is everything I wanted of it would severely undersell it. It's fabulously executed, and the soundscapes are especially lovely. Collisions are dramatic and destructive, which is pretty fun. You can view your creation from the surface of any body involved, which has led me to some truly lovely views. Planets keep track of what they're made of, so you can try to terraform stuff, and it'll tell you how Earth-like your planet is, as well as how likely to support life it is. All around, it's a fabulous game.10/10 would try to terraform Mars and accidentally drop it into the sun again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So I started simple- I like watching Solar Systems form for some reason, so I simulated it on a small scale. I spawned a random rocky planet, then spammed in about 50 different small moons, all of the same orbital path. They, of course, exploded catastrophically, causing a large shower of fragments to be sent off into space, and eventually left the one true moon- Orde, as well as a somewhat dense field of fragments. Then I turned to terraforming. I had finally got the planet to look good, but then a fair amount of the fragments of the satellite field crashed into both the host planet and Orde, leaving large craters in both. Eventually, the Planet cooled down, leaving Orde (3.3x Moon) entirely bathed in fire. Couldn't figure out how to put it out, so I thought making it bigger might help. Nope. Orde crashed into the Planet, causing another large explosion and a shower of fragments. Eventualy settled into what I called the Orde Pseudo Star, hurdling through the void. Set it to 0 Velocity, and started over. Things progressed, and I had a nice system going. Then Orde began to move. didn't notice, but then it ate the closest planet, and so I was like, what the heck, might as well blow everything up. Turned all the mass into hydrogen, which turned Orde into a star, and it ate everything. Turns out solar systems are a lot bigger than I thought. This is why I don't have nice things. I turn them into stars and then they consume everything else in existence. Gr8 m8 r8 8/8 Would consume universe accidentally again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I enjoy how this game tries to simulate real space physics without needing a powerful computer (mine's a 1.7 ghz cpu and works pretty good). I'm eager to see what new content will be offered in future updates.			",64,8,0,0,4,0,1

								so i was messing around with jupiter, putting a couple earth sized moons around it, when they started colliding with each other. the fragments of earth started to orbit jupiter and the fragments collided with each other. thought it was pretty neat, so i did it with lots of small moons, and they created A LOT more fragments. very interesting to see the fragments form up into bigger fragments and eventually dominate this jupiter system. then i threw uranus into it.tl;dr buy it			",34,0,0,6,2,0,1

								This game is so very awesome in every sense of the word. The Universe is your plaything as you create black holes in the center of Sol, launch Mars at Earth itself, and form galixys to try and sustaine. This game does have a learning curve to overcome but is well worth the effort as that is part of the journey. I would highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Especially if they are as impressed with learning and the Universe as I am. Thank you game devs so very much for putting in the time and effort into such a wonderful concept. You did not forget to be awesome.Best Wishes,Dartanion.			",31,4,0,15,8,0,2

								I absolutely love this game. I'll keep this review short: Want to blow up Washington DC because you know one way or another the USA is effed? Send a giant rock at it. Want to blow up Canada because they have it so good and your current country of living sucks, and you are jealous? Send a giant rock at it.Want to just end the Earth because you are sick of everything? A couple options: #1, Send Ceres, the Moon, or any hugely massive body at Earth. #2, Make the Sun go Supernova, (even though it is physically impossible in real life for the Sun to naturally go Supernova, for a multitude of reasons) and watch the earth vaporize.Want to mess with the orbits of planets in our solar system? Just send a new Jupiter careeening through the system at an impossible speed, and watch the chaos!Want to see what happens when a bowling ball hits the earth at many many times the speed of light? You can do that.And last but not least: Do you just want to marvel at the beauty of our solar system, watch planetary collisions, or see the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy collide in real time (it's really boring, but you can if you want)? These are just a few of the many many things you can do In Universe Sandbox ².I cannot recommend this game enough!			",81,6,1,10,12,0,16

Just view the entire solar system and all the moons and watch the orbits; it will humble you.  Although I do suggest finding entertaining ways to destroy our planet.  I increased the Sun's gravity by 1,000 and Earth shot out of the solar system at .392 speed of light.10/10 will destroy Earth again...and again...and again...			",15,1,0,1,3,0,3

								Excellent sandbox/simulation of the universe. The game can really help put into scale the size and beauty of it all. It's crazy that something this great is still in development, as it seems like release quality. On top of that, they are sending out updates on a frequent basis. Can't say enough good things about it.			",14,2,0,2,4,0,7

								One of the easiest programs to lose hours to and subsequently more than worth the purchase. It's a wonderful tool for visualizing and comprehending usually lofty concepts in a hands-on way.You can throw the heavens around not unlike a god- a very destructive, amused god. Need I say more?

								This simulator has everything. You just can't get that satisfaction of destroying planets, its inhabitants, and entire star systems with the click of a mouse button anywhere else. The physics engine is surreal, the visuals and seeing time and space unfold in front your very eyes in your cataclysmic simulations is just magnificent. The CPU usage is quite the odyssey, lets just say I am fortunate enough that my PC did not burst into a hyper nova after trying to run a simulation  with over 5000 moons orbiting Earth. All I have to say is that they managed to pull off quite an excellent game, can't wait when the other updates are released.

I didn't even get Universe Sanbox, because when I found the game, Universe Sanbox 2 was already out, so I can't tell any diffrence between the two. Highly recommended game			",50,7,0,3,16,0,0

								I tried it for 3 hours 9/11/16. The text entry fields didn't work consistently. For example, in the Climate Lesson it highlights the Rotational Period box and prompts me to type ""1d."" Nothing changes in the selcted field for any keyboard entry, though on the fifth time restarting that lesson I was able to type ""1."" I had similar problems with the graphs and the time step (how fast the simulation runs). Exiting the game, one is prompted to provide feedback. That box consistently accepts text input, but it is not a large box and it overflows its interface rather than making a scrollbar. When it does so, both feedback fields become unresponsive and one has to start over. So I had about the same experience I could have had watching videos of the tutorials, though there I wouldn't have wasted my time fighting the interface for $25. I requested a refund because the reason I wanted it now was to show it to science teachers I supervise for their classes this school year.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is amongst the best examples of merging accurate simulations with beautiful interfaces. A great example of how well everything works is to drop the timescale to realtime, place a still moon in the path of the earth, and watch as the atmosphere burns away, followed by the seas, followed by the earth becoming a molten ball. You can even graph properties of earth as compared with other planetary bodies to see how close this gets earth to the temperature of the sun.			",631,185,16,72,88,6,149

								I really enjoyed this game. However I will admit that when I first got it I was bored of it after a couple hours or so of playing. As they continue to bring out updates, they are adding more and more interesting things to do in the game. Before purchasing, you need to realize that this is a simulation, not a story driven game, also it is in early access, it is not meant to be the game of the year. It is a little bit more expensive for what it's worth, but it is easy to see that time was put in to making this game and the developers want to deliver an amazing simulation experience of our universe, and I appreciate that. The graphics are beautiful and the physics of the game are astonishing. It is safe to say this game is out of this world ;). (Pun most definitely intended) I absolutely recommend purchasing this simulation and I look forward to future updates of the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As a Microsoft Developer & support person, an Apple anything you can think of, a retired IT Operations, Programming, Systems Management, etc. for Walmart, ARVEST Banks, Texas Commerce Bank, Washington Regional Hospital, & numerous other companies, an Independent IT Consultant, IRC Administrator, and general computer person going clear back to the old IBM S/360 days, I rarely ever have to buy software.  I made an exception for Universe Sandbox 2. It is downright the best piece of code to come out in a decade. I did Mechanical Engineering at University of Texas & University of Arkansas, Aero-Mechanical Engineering at University of Arizona, and amassed around 1000 credit hours in my long student career. Along the way, I took enough credit hours for minors in Physics (astrophysics and subatomic physics being my favorites), Math, & Computer Programming. I would love to see the commented code & underlying physics, math, and numerical solutions for this program. It does multi-body orbital mechanics so well and so fast it blows my mind. Actually, I suspect I know exactly how its doing it, but when there are hundreds of bodies involved, its simply amazing. For $25, this is a must have program. If you use your intuition and the included teaching (under Open), anybody can learn to blow up anything in the Universe, from galaxies down to minor planets, comets, etc., see Planet 9, and quite literally make the Universe your sandbox. Its amazingly simple to use, with quite intuitive solutions; make a guess & you will probably be right. And it makes an awesome scree saver, too! Get this app! Buy it! :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I love how variable the textures are for the planets, as well as the beautiful stars! I also think that the physics in the game are a lot of fun to simulate and never lose interest.I think an option to create your own planet from the get go (just using colors and such) would be VERY fun. I love what the simulator is so far! I also think a more specific movement system (as in the camera) could be useful, as just using the mouse can be cumbersome at times.Very good game, I love everything about it, and hopefully some new features are added to make it even better! Lovely choice for people interested in space or want to be.			",59,12,0,7,9,0,2

Possibly the best sandbox game that I have ever playedFor those of you who don't know it, Universe Sandbox 2 is essentially an interstellar sandbox where you can create everything you want, ranging from planetoids and asteroids to black holes and hypergiant stars, and then put things in orbits - or launch said things at each other. When I first saw videos about this game - and its non-Steam predecessor, Universe Sandbox - I got a very general first impression: Explosions. Take a thing, add thing (at a collision course with a high velocity), get explosion. And from what I saw, the explosions were great, as were the collisions - especially in US2, the game I shall focus on. I was sold. I had to get it. And so I did.Of course I started with blowing things up. How could I resist? I started off with crashing Deimos into Earth, more precisely into the eastern US seaboard (thanks, Obama). I then proceeded to crash the Moon into the Pacific Ocean. Rest in peace, guys. But I didn't stop there. I threw what was left of Earth (a flaming ball, basically) into Jupiter. Then I threw Jupiter into the Sun. Then I threw the Sun into a bigger star, which also mumbo-jumbed the planetary orbits and sent Saturn, Neptune and Uranus into the deep unknown. I ended my destruction spree by crashing the largest star known to science into the second largest star known to science. The resulting supernova would have made Michael Bay ♥♥♥♥ his pants. And yet, I felt that something was missing. The destruction was fun, but it didn't feel like it had a purpose. So I left my pretty screwed-up solar systems behind and opened a new simulation. I added a Sun-like star into the centre, and then experimented a bit. I added a Mercury-ish planet which got pretty hot, a Jupiter-ish planet with many, many moons and an Earth with lots of water. The Mercury planet disappeared - it probably got destroyed by something that wasn't a moon, the Jupiter planet gobbled up its moons and all the water on Earth point 2 had all its water boiled off. So I tried again. I created a new solar system and did what I could to create functional orbits and planets with reasonable distances.What happened next was unexpected. As I finished setting up moons for my gas giant affectionately named Camillus after my crush, I looked at it's grand silhouette from the perspective of one of its natural satellites, decorated by the other orbiting moons. The sight filled me with awe. There are few games that can make me cry tears of awe, but Universe Sandbox 2 is a worthy candidate. This is not a joke.When you do what you can to destroy what can be destroyed, you feel a bit like a brutal god, and that is indeed very fun. But when you successfully create an Earth-like planet and watch its chances of life increase, when you watch the moons of a gas giant in orbit, when you gaze upon the mightiness of VY Canis Majoris, then you simply realize how amazing the universe is.And that is what this game succeeds at. It doesn't tell a complicated story, it doesn't give you a mission, but it gives you a beautiful understanding of our entire existence. And it does so beautifully. To make this look a bit more like an actual review, here's a paragraph on the things about this game that are good and bad. Good things? Very scientifically accurate (yes, I am a nerd), especially when it comes to physics. Great graphics, generally very beautiful when it comes to aesthetics. Very diverse when it comes to things you can do. Great randomization options for atmospheres, visuals, density and lots of other things. Oh, and all the other things I mentioned. Bad stuff? Only minor bugs, mostly related to sounds and mechanics. Could have some more minor objects like satellites, and more variation in asteroids. Oh, and I guess the black holes and ring dynamics are kinda screwed up at this stage. However, that is all which I consider bad about this game. And seeing as this is an Early Access game, I have full faith in the development team that they will sharpen the game to create a flawless experience.Essentially, this is the best sandbox i've ever played. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a star system to create (and hopefully not blow up).9.8/10 ",9,1,0,3,3,0,0

								This game is amazing.Not only are the team always active and helpful, they also answer to negative comments to get feedback!WHAT OTHER TEAM DOES THAT!?!?!?!?!? (Don't answer that, I know there is probably others)Not only is it a fabulous team, the game itself is far beyond what I would expect for an early access game. It is very innovative and I can't wait until it is done!However, I have some negatives for it. For instance, being able to create your own planets (I am not sure if this is in yet) or being able to edit the colors and other things related to more customization. I am also confused on the controls using a gamepad (which I hardly use for this game) but it could be useful for people who prefer controllers.Other than that, I don't know what else to say so far, but I may update this later. I can't wait to see where this game goes, and I'll be glad that I am apart of this journey!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is endless facination no matter how much brainpower I want to apply.  I can mindlessly destroy things on an interstellar scale, build delicately balanced systems of carefully climate-controlled worlds, or just randomly place a hundred planets and see what happens.  I’m constantly amazed by the precise, accurately modeled orbital mechanics which somehow manage to not crash my computer, as other high-quality simulations tend to do.  And the detail is absolutely breathtaking.			",11,1,0,2,4,0,2

								Mess with orbits, destroy everything, eradicate life on earth, grow objects mass until they collapse, spawn black holes, watch the orbits of Jupiter's 63 moons, the possibilities are endless and if you really enjoy space this is the game for you! If you don't care much for space or don't know a lot about it this is a good way to learn about the universe. If your more on the destructive and creative side you can smash planets together, galaxies together, and even create supernovas and black holes by crushing massive stars together. There's no limit except for your imagination.			",57,2,0,4,4,0,2

								 If you like fiddling with space and watching different scenarios unfold (like the destruction of a planet), this is the game for you. Also the amount you can learn of this game is stunning, and if you like learning things about space this is something I recommend The game may be in development but it has a lot of great things in it already, and should give hundreds of hours to do for someone with different ideas to try out and simulate...or to just spam stuff and see thing explode. You can change a lot of settings in different menus, although you might have to look things up for some of them with the amount of complicated physics involved (who would've guessed, in a game about space nonetheless). But hey the settings can stay as they are, and moreso the game is all about creating a scenario you want to see, and watching it happen either correctly or going wrong horribly with eplosions everywhere.

It's very polished and works like a charm. Although I'm not a Master of Astrophysics, the physics seem very accurate and on point. With the large amount of content at hand, your possibilities are only bounded by your imagination. Despite it's ""Early Access"" status I haven't found any crucial bugs yet. No ""Early Alpha Access Possibly 10 Years (Never Finish) Development"" crap. You're buying a full game with (hopefully) more stuff to come. This game needs to be played. You're worth it.

								This game/software is really mind blowing. And the rendering is very pleasant as the menu is very ""eye candy""... it has something a bit like Star Citizen hud in its design.The music is very calm and fits very well. Making the whole experience very agreable and relaxing.Few points, it's still in alpha stage, creating galaxies is still buggy. But the game performs well. It runs like a charms on linux and I even think it natively runs on linux since few weeks as most of other games use a wrapper which slows down computation.So I wanted to point that out.I receive update regulary, to me the development is going in the right direction.Ofc if you re not interressed in astronomy or physics you'll be bored after a little while.In my opinion the price is a bit high. I bought it in discount... It seems devs don't plan to offer discount very often.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Definitely reccomend it, such a great improvement over 1, with so many new features.  A lot still needs ironing out, mostly in the control scheme and some of the features (such as planet temprature) needs to be able to update automaticlly. But for early access its well put together, and the supernovae feature is the best. Overall no major bugs and awful pretty and just fun. Can;t wait for updates and to see where this goes!

								This is a significant improvement upon the first Universe Sandbox. Not just visually, they seem to also have tweaked the code to calculate for much more accurate orbit predictions; especially when it comes to unstable systems or running custom systems at a higher time rate.The interface is not too complicated to learn, however the learning curve is higher than other video games in general. That's to be expected considering it's not exactly a game in the same sense as other video games.8/10 unstable orbits ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I only played for a little bit, before bed last night, but here are my thoughts.I play this entirely with the Vive, so I'm not sure how deep the simulation aspects are in the ""Normal"" version.As for Vive, it seems that your options are limited to spawning celestial bodies like stars, planets, and moons. You can launch them, or you can place them, and all bodies have gravity. If you place a planet near a sun, it will get sucked in and explode. Likewise, if you launch the planet around the sun, with enough velocity no less, it will make an orbit and continue on that course. Suns near suns are fun, do enough of them and you'll create a super nova that expands into a giant nebula. My framerate started to dip a bit, when I exploded a few dozen suns and made a massive nova or three. I'm using a GTX 980, for the record.I have yet to figure out how to make black holes or more complex systems, and I'm not sure if that's even possible yet. Here's hoping.What's here so far is pretty relaxed and simple, but it's also very engaging. If you're at all interested in astronomy, you'll be fascinated by Universe Sandbox 2. If you've played the first one, you'll know what to expect, and you'll be pleased with the extra work they've put into this one. If you're looking for progressive mechanics and stuff to hold your hand and show you how to do everything, maybe not. This title is less of a game, more like software. It's a true simulator, and it does what it intends to do very well.The music is also pretty nice. :PAll in all, I certainly recommend this title, especially if you're an HTC Vive user and you're looking for something to blow your mind.Here's hoping the development continues on this and we see even more wonders to immerse ourselves into.

								I reccomend this game, my reason why will be explained.Where to start? Oh I know the game is a very fun space based simulator as the title suggests. Some things I really like about this game is well.. It has a very realistic engine and very fun stuff to do. What I mean by that is: it doesn't have limitations that you hate, it has a very free feeling nature to it. For example if you want to launch the moon into earth, Go ahead! No one cares destory the earth all you want. Also I like how you can create your own simulations..The only problem I see with this game is that, There is no workshop.. What I mean is it would be awesome if you could create your own simulation then upload it to the community for others to download, modify and enjoy!Any way Those are some of the reasons I would recommend this game to you.

								This game is so much fun just experimenting with that you just get lost in it. If your not very savy when it comes to nerdy stuff it can take some getting use to. I am 100% happy that my money went to the development of this game because the future of this can be amazing. I must warn you that if you have a low end computer it will have a hard time running, given some time you will find your threshold and be able to maintain it by lowering speed and other settings. 10/10 would let the Moon crash into Earth and make our Sun go Super Nova again.

								If you're looking to test out a theory, or just have a good time this is your game. Universe Sandbox 2 combines the unlimited power of god, great graphics, and fast physics to make an extremely fun sim game. Want to see what Earth looks like after Mars hit it? Or what happens to jupiter when you increase its mass and density untill it becomes a black hole			",34,0,0,3,8,0,10

								This is absolutly fantastic! Spend my first hour tryin to apply some momentum to the sun without destroying the solar system. When that didnt work I started screwing with the suns gravity what caused some planets to fall into the sun. The sun did not like that apparently because went it off in a supernova. Now theres only dust left. 10/10 would screw with physics again.			",365,129,17,28,58,3,37

								This review applies to the HTC Vive experience.I really wanted to like this. I've always loved space. And I'm giving it a thumbs up for effort and novelty. Unfortunately my computer wasn't quite up to running it to its full capacity, so I wound up returning it. A Demo would have helped me know that before needing to purchase / refund it.The VR interface is kind of confusing, but other than that it was an interesting thing to try. I don't know if I could have gotten 25 bucks worth of use out of it though, even if my computer was powerful enough to run it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As an early access game, (honestly, even if it were a full release game), this game takes the cake.I love the precise info you can get on planets, the general customizability, endless creative options, and all the physics. Pretty much whatever you want to do from messing around with black holes more massive than the Milky Way, to finely tuning your very own stellar systems, it's pretty darn fun.It could have some improvements, and some things seems slightly odd, but none are major, and it is still early access.One such oddity I've found is many objects moving several trillion times the speed of light, which seems very inaccurate. As for improvements, long/latitude lines could be better, with actual degree labels. Surface view looks a little odd because of the ground textures, but that probably doesn't matter too much. It would also be endlessly cool to actually walk around on the planets you make. A way to measure surface distances on planets and stars would likewise be very useful, and especially a tool that tells you the length of daylight at certain coordinates on your planet.TL;DR: Just buy it, it's awesome. Space + God Powers + Explosions = Win.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is an incredibal game that I recomend you to play however- a note to the developers, there are a few downsides to the game. firstly the shape of the planets never changes when it is hit by other planets while in reality it would then eventually go back into a sphere . secondly the color of the atmosphere or surface of the planets would change. instead of the continents on earth being in the same place they would after 100's of years. Also according to the theory of general relativity all the planets in the solar system are slowly moving inwards to the sun(to the center of gravity) so after so many of thousands of years the planets would go into the sun.

								Absolutely love Universe Sandbox but the VR support needs work. The fly movement mechanic is awkward, there's no search function, and I don't seem to be able to set up solar systems as easily as I can in desktop. It's just a little less flexible. For example I don't know how to make a stable circular orbit, there only seems to be the lauch option which you can set to orbital velocity but you're still eyeballing the direction and position. Lastly, scaling seems unpredictable as to where I'm going to end up (usually too far away from where I wanted), I feel like scale (and possibly locomotion) could benefit from a smartphone style ""pinch"" and ""pull"" mechanic. Perhaps holding the right grip buttons move space, the left grips adjust time and using both grips scales space.Definitely recommend for desktop use but would really love to see some better VR support.

								I wouldn't write a review, but it asked me to.I can't deal with it, man. Space. ♥♥♥♥ing space. I learn something new about space every time I open this sim and it's just ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. I feel like a six-year old in a candy store with a blank check, only better, cause instead of candy it's supermassive black holes and pulsars and neutron stars.I don't know, maybe you have to be some huge space and science nerd to appreciate it, but if you have any recreational interest in those things, hooooo boy, this is worth it and then some.I cry when I go stargazing with no light pollution on a new moon because I can't handle space.

								Great game/simulator. Love being able to visualise what happens in our solar system. It is also very interesting to mess with the planets and see what happens, usually nothing good, but it is cool to see the explosions or to see a planet drift of into space never to be seen again. I was also quite suprised at how well this plays on a low end computer. Great job.			",61,10,6,12,6,1,5

								Buy this when it's on sale. It's in alpha. Needs more time to mature but will not disappoint you if you haven't already blown up galaxies. Needs better chemistry, nuclear, and terraforming, which is what they said they're working on right now. Wouldn't be disappointed if they added a module where you could fly around your system in a faster than light spacecraft.* I reccomend playing with a special friend and a couple beers; guarenteed to get pance off of science oriented people.+ Real orbital mechanics+ Realistic nuclear physics+ Complete control of the solar system- Needs better temperature colors- Needs better planitary explosions			",28,2,0,4,9,0,2

It's the only space control (call it whatever you want) simulation in the steam right now other than it's predecessor which is an old version of the game.Definitely recommend to anyone who loves astronomy and have an interest in learning them or simply to turn the pluto into a black hole and suck every planet of the solar system.

And then   repeatedly   hit earth with moons, planets, and asteroids and pretending that the world is in chaos and calling to their loved ones.   THEN   tried to make pluto a planet but instead created a star which eventually collapsed into a black hole and destroyed the solar system.   AGAIN.

								Pros: It's great fun to see what would happen if you made the sun 10x hotter or plopped a black hole in the center of the solar system. That doesn't even scratch the surface of what you can do in this game/simulator. You can search for any stars and exoplanets you can think of that  are listed if you can remember the scientific names. You can straight up explode heavenly bodies or try to nurture them in their habitable zone.Cons: May get slow and stutter in some areas if there is too much going on and your PC can't keep up.  Fun for hours. 10/10			",48,9,0,8,2,0,1

You truly feel like a god launching planets and moons around, soaring through the solar system, watching galaxies swirl together. The sense of scale is so impressive, from colossal planets to palm-sized solar systems that almost have a tilt-shift feel, this is a great demo to show people who are less experienced in actual games			",95,38,4,7,40,2,20

								This ""game"" is incredable! I say ""game"" because it's more of a simulation program but it's amazing. If you like space or just science in general, you'll absoluately love this game. It's so fasinating to see what could happen in certain situations and see what the outcome is. You'll also learn a lot  while playing this, it gives stats on each planet and you can see what it looked like years ago or way into the future.Kinda wish the graphics were a bit better so it looks even more realistic but still has decent graphics.Highly recommend!

								i popped in a new mars in the habitable zone of the sun and terraformed it but while building a star cluster apparently a stray mimas i placed without realizing it caused a domino effect that toppled enough planets, including mars 2.0 into the sun, causing it to explode, obliterating the solar system. not even mad. found a glitch that lets you create infinitely larger and larger pulsars inside one another using the same sized star, obliterating the solar system, again not even mad. i wanted to see how big i could expand the map so i shot spica off into the distance at light speed. it started to slow my time rate down so i tried to drop some black holes in its path to stop it ( as i didnt yet know how to just hit the delete key ). upon impact, spica stopped but rebounded the black holes off at 14x the speed of light. i celebrated by converting the sun into a black hole, obliterating the solar system. i have waaaay too much fun trying to find trying to find glitches and overly complex methods of  large scale destruction in this game			",43,0,0,4,5,0,2

								I only played for a little bit, before bed last night, but here are my thoughts.I play this entirely with the Vive, so I'm not sure how deep the simulation aspects are in the ""Normal"" version.As for Vive, it seems that your options are limited to spawning celestial bodies like stars, planets, and moons. You can launch them, or you can place them, and all bodies have gravity. If you place a planet near a sun, it will get sucked in and explode. Likewise, if you launch the planet around the sun, with enough velocity no less, it will make an orbit and continue on that course. Suns near suns are fun, do enough of them and you'll create a super nova that expands into a giant nebula. My framerate started to dip a bit, when I exploded a few dozen suns and made a massive nova or three. I'm using a GTX 980, for the record.I have yet to figure out how to make black holes or more complex systems, and I'm not sure if that's even possible yet. Here's hoping.What's here so far is pretty relaxed and simple, but it's also very engaging. If you're at all interested in astronomy, you'll be fascinated by Universe Sandbox 2. If you've played the first one, you'll know what to expect, and you'll be pleased with the extra work they've put into this one. If you're looking for progressive mechanics and stuff to hold your hand and show you how to do everything, maybe not. This title is less of a game, more like software. It's a true simulator, and it does what it intends to do very well.The music is also pretty nice. :PAll in all, I certainly recommend this title, especially if you're an HTC Vive user and you're looking for something to blow your mind.Here's hoping the development continues on this and we see even more wonders to immerse ourselves into.

								I've been smashing moons into planets, planets into planets, planets into stars, and stars into stars.  It's like being in a brutal Nova documentary.   Speaking of which, supernovas cause severe frame drops.  Some of the animations are too much for a single GTX 980.  I have two, and hope that one day soon devs will provide multi-GPU support.   Either that or I'm going to have to get a 1080ti when it comes out.The TARDIS is a nice touch, but I can't yet fire it off along with many of the hso objects.  Roll on beta. ",17,17,2,1,8,0,0

You can quickly make things bigger or smaller, and the scale is there.  You just feel it.  If you have VR, you know that some things just make you smile and laugh a little because something cool just happened.

								Great simulation and very educational. If you`re interested in astronomy in any way then this will appeal to you. I liked the fact that it`s a genuine sandbox and you can set up your own scenarios. (To see the effects gravity has on our own solar system for instance, -basically if you add just one extra planet in the wrong place it`ll affect the orbits of the whole system, & the Earths temperature and climate etc. -It makes you aware of the knife edge our whole planet and ecosphere is balancing on).I also liked being able to write my name across Africa in molten lava by shooting tiny moons at it....:)			",213,27,18,8,64,1,26

								To say that this game is everything I wanted of it would severely undersell it. It's fabulously executed, and the soundscapes are especially lovely. Collisions are dramatic and destructive, which is pretty fun. You can view your creation from the surface of any body involved, which has led me to some truly lovely views. Planets keep track of what they're made of, so you can try to terraform stuff, and it'll tell you how Earth-like your planet is, as well as how likely to support life it is. All around, it's a fabulous game.10/10 would try to terraform Mars and accidentally drop it into the sun again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Blown away by this game! The ability to look at earth when you create a supernova 93 million miles away and see earth go through the changes really gives you a better understanding of the power the universe. Throwing a hypergiant star into a solar system and watching the craziness is pretty cool. A lot to create and a lot to destroy.			",25,10,0,0,6,0,0

								So, have you ever wanted to watch hummanity die beneath a endless rain of small asteroids, teapots, Monoliths, and when those fail,  eventually resort to a rock the size of the average  sjw's ego? Well, if you have, go for it. The only problem is, the lights are pianted on, and will keep coming back even after sjw rock liqufies all of north america. But, I suppose, the game wasn't made for operations on that scale (although,  I will admit that there could be some work done on the biosphere simulations, and that a better tutorial would be appreciated). This is game for people who want to drop entire solar systems into black holes, then make solar systems out of black holes orbiting an even bigger black hole. It's great fun8/10.

								Awesome sim! I've wanted something like this since I was a 10 year old dreaming about stars and planets. It's crazy in depth with physics and is still extremely user-friendly.

Great stress reliever and simulation game at the same time. 10/10 would recommend to anybody even remotely interested in space.			",57,4,0,4,6,1,0

								I only played for a little bit, before bed last night, but here are my thoughts.I play this entirely with the Vive, so I'm not sure how deep the simulation aspects are in the ""Normal"" version.As for Vive, it seems that your options are limited to spawning celestial bodies like stars, planets, and moons. You can launch them, or you can place them, and all bodies have gravity. If you place a planet near a sun, it will get sucked in and explode. Likewise, if you launch the planet around the sun, with enough velocity no less, it will make an orbit and continue on that course. Suns near suns are fun, do enough of them and you'll create a super nova that expands into a giant nebula. My framerate started to dip a bit, when I exploded a few dozen suns and made a massive nova or three. I'm using a GTX 980, for the record.I have yet to figure out how to make black holes or more complex systems, and I'm not sure if that's even possible yet. Here's hoping.What's here so far is pretty relaxed and simple, but it's also very engaging. If you're at all interested in astronomy, you'll be fascinated by Universe Sandbox 2. If you've played the first one, you'll know what to expect, and you'll be pleased with the extra work they've put into this one. If you're looking for progressive mechanics and stuff to hold your hand and show you how to do everything, maybe not. This title is less of a game, more like software. It's a true simulator, and it does what it intends to do very well.The music is also pretty nice. :PAll in all, I certainly recommend this title, especially if you're an HTC Vive user and you're looking for something to blow your mind.Here's hoping the development continues on this and we see even more wonders to immerse ourselves into.

								Destroying humanity as we know it is great.For a few hours at least. Once destroying humanity gets boring, you can start fiddling with the other planets in the galaxy and learn that life in our solar system is like walking on a tightrope, one piece of the rope breaks, and everything goes hurling into nothingness. You can see our world, our solar system, our galaxy like never before with this amazing game.Outside of our galaxy, you can make your own custom body of planets, suns, whatever you feel like. Heck, you could have a black hole for a sun if you felt like it. You can build (and destroy) anything you feel like. If you don't feel like building yourself, there are hundreds of preset levels, my personal favorite being the galaxy colliding level.The music is beatiful, and calming as you explore the infinite blackness of space.The graphics wouldn't really be a problem, even if they were bad, but the visual experience in this game is breathtaking.Should you buy this game? Well, it's not exactly ""fun"". If you like adventure and shooter games and are in it for the challenge and fun, then no. But if you like exploring the galaxy or calmly watch as planets soar by, then yes. I absoloutely love this game. It is, in my opinion, it is well worth buying.10/10, would cry at the beauty and fragileness of the galaxy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is a ton of fun, it could still use a bit of work though, for example,for some reason the earth doesnt cool down after being hit by a few asteroids, even after millions of years, and the sun mysteriously disapears. Another issue is that rings dont interact with other objects, which disapointed me because i wanted to make a giant cylinder of rings and use it as a shield to stop an asteroid. One other issue, theres no ""detonate planet button"" which made me sad, i wanted to turn the earth into an asteroid field but the lack of explody button limits me. In all seriousness, this is an amazing game!			",61,4,0,13,13,0,12

								I am in love with this simulator. Replay value is unlimited and the possibility go through the roof. Defiantly recommend this game for both fun and tinkering as well as seeing how things work. I am trying desperately to create a working Binary System. Just having a few problems with orbital decay.

								I'm surprised the game comes with VR compatibilty, and it actually makes me want to buy one of these devices, so the developers quite achieved something here. Also I'm just blown by how beautiful and accurate it is, and it doesn't even require a heavy config to make it fluid which is the most attractive thing about the game. This is a must-have if you are just a little bit interested in space, anything about space, because really the ""wooaah""-potiental it has is huge!Full controller support would definitely be a plus! Also I'm not the most knowledgeable in astrophysics, maybe you could put some documentation in the game, that would be my obsession for the next several weeks? months? maybe years I could get stuck in it with a VR headset and some acid.

								This game is so very awesome in every sense of the word. The Universe is your plaything as you create black holes in the center of Sol, launch Mars at Earth itself, and form galixys to try and sustaine. This game does have a learning curve to overcome but is well worth the effort as that is part of the journey. I would highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Especially if they are as impressed with learning and the Universe as I am. Thank you game devs so very much for putting in the time and effort into such a wonderful concept. You did not forget to be awesome.Best Wishes,Dartanion.			",31,4,0,15,8,0,2

								Space is so beautiful and so cool, like who doesn't love space. I just starting watching YouTube and I saw a gamer play this game. I thought ""Hey why not watch him?"" That video blew my mind. I was like in a heartbeat, ""I want it."" It was early access at the time so it was more costly, but didn't matter. I started and opened every simulator. I have an empty simulator and creating my own galaxy and taking care of it like it was my child. If you love space, if you love creating things and seeing what happends when you make actions, This game is perfect. It is also complicated, but WORTH IT! :)			",28,2,0,0,6,1,0

								You are a God. The God. The Ruler and Controller of the entire universe. Create Planets, destroy them, do whatever you like. The possibilities are virtually endless in this game. You can make your own universes and toy with space and time however you want. Make planets bigger, spawn/drop in/create existing planets, suns, black holes, etc. and manipulate them to your will. Make them bigger, smaller, denser, have more mass, anything. However, this game doesn't come without it's disadvantages.You need to have some standing and/or existing knowledge beforehand or read up a little on gravity, relativity, etc. or you might get a little frustrated as your planets might not do exactly what you want, and may just end up colliding into each other, and go full on supernova. But, if that's exactly what you want and you don't care, GREAT! Then this is the game for you. You will absolutely love this game, even with it's price.			",8,1,0,0,2,0,0

								Great game/simulator. Love being able to visualise what happens in our solar system. It is also very interesting to mess with the planets and see what happens, usually nothing good, but it is cool to see the explosions or to see a planet drift of into space never to be seen again. I was also quite suprised at how well this plays on a low end computer. Great job.			",61,10,6,12,6,1,5

								a fun and educational game with a lot offer. it looks beautiful with amazing graphics for the sort of game it is. it runs well too which on a laptop like mine is mind blowing(it is a very sporadic device, it some times works some times doesn't )one problem I do have is the placement of the chart button which it is very easy to hit by mistake. this can be very irritating  and has led to the destruction of earth a few times(not as bat as it sounds don't panic) it would also be nice to see more info on the planets like a bio for each maybe. (heck for custom made planets have it so you can write your own) over all a fantastic game. and grate for learning about the universe and then blowing it all up just cos.

								I tried it for 3 hours 9/11/16. The text entry fields didn't work consistently. For example, in the Climate Lesson it highlights the Rotational Period box and prompts me to type ""1d."" Nothing changes in the selcted field for any keyboard entry, though on the fifth time restarting that lesson I was able to type ""1."" I had similar problems with the graphs and the time step (how fast the simulation runs). Exiting the game, one is prompted to provide feedback. That box consistently accepts text input, but it is not a large box and it overflows its interface rather than making a scrollbar. When it does so, both feedback fields become unresponsive and one has to start over. So I had about the same experience I could have had watching videos of the tutorials, though there I wouldn't have wasted my time fighting the interface for $25. I requested a refund because the reason I wanted it now was to show it to science teachers I supervise for their classes this school year.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								i like the game, its great, but i would like to see more realism put on to the planets detail and the eveolution of life on said planet, like when you go into first person i would like to see a realistic planet details like physical features like moutins and canyons but most importantly i want to see life on these planets if made habitable and each life for the planets are randomized.  but other than that the game is fine mabye some realer lokking galaxies would help but thats fine.but i would also like to see more realer impacts of planets, stars/ galaxies and etc like debre explosions and etc.but whats most important for me is that you should have a simulation where you get to see the birth and death of a universe like make your own universe and controll it and see it give life and go through so many beatiful tranformations and see the ulitmate death of said universe like you get to controll what the universe is like, what lawas of physics you want and dont want and make entirely new ones.

								This game is amazing. It is beatifully stunning, perfect for any space lover (or anyone), and beatiful without a HTC Vive or Oculous Rift (did I spell that right?). Universe Sandbox 2 also let's you do anything you want, e.g make two galaxys collide, blow up the sun, create a planet, create a whole solar system, crash Pluto into the Moon, and many more. Don't even think, just get this game!			",16,5,0,0,6,0,0

								I don't have an HTC Vive, but it seems like the VR experience could be a very strong point in the game. I also like the perfection of this game, it offers everything someone could wish of a game like this, just perfect.This seems like the best universe simulator out there, so do what you have to do, keep updating, improve VR and the other new mecanics, and that's pretty much it.

The graphics are beautiful. The sound and music is stunning. The possibilities are endless. This game mixes creativity and destruction elements expertly, to create a perfect space sandbox. The craziest thing? It is still early access! This is the best space game I have ever played. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.			",27,6,0,6,4,0,1

								universe sandbox 2 is really intresting. Theres a lot of variety ranging form asteroids, planets and even black holes.

I mean, why would you make your own simulation and not other peoples simulation. If that was added, it would make the game a lot intresting.			",11,0,0,0,1,0,0

								This simulation program shows much promise and is constantly improving. My favorite aspect is the ability to create Earth-like planets and recreate settings from Science Fiction. I also like how virtually any parameter is editable.I hope in the future simulation of plate tectonics is feasible. And maybe even a feature in which planets with a high life likelyhood add a green overlay that starts on the coasts and gradually comes to the center of continents, leaving some deserts.

								This simulator has everything. You just can't get that satisfaction of destroying planets, its inhabitants, and entire star systems with the click of a mouse button anywhere else. The physics engine is surreal, the visuals and seeing time and space unfold in front your very eyes in your cataclysmic simulations is just magnificent. The CPU usage is quite the odyssey, lets just say I am fortunate enough that my PC did not burst into a hyper nova after trying to run a simulation  with over 5000 moons orbiting Earth. All I have to say is that they managed to pull off quite an excellent game, can't wait when the other updates are released.

								So far, I enjoy this a lot.  Some knowledge of orbital mechanics and how large scale physics works is helpful in playing this game and getting the most out of the simulation.  It is not required, though.  You can always learn just by playing the game.  There is no goal with this game, it's just you, you're thoughts and whatever you can dream up, and frankly I love it.  It's so very relaxing after a long day, it's so very satisfying to change the way a planet works, and actually watch as your changes reflect on the surface and statistics of that planet, moon or star.  If you're interested in space or science, or you're looking to learn and teach yourself about them, I recommend this game			",286,30,2,40,46,0,35

								It is a unique tool to understand the workings of the cosmos. And now, it looks even better. I really like it. Only a few games, though this is more educational than a game, have made me audibly gasp and ooh at my computer screen like this one has. The development team has really done something great here.

								I recommend this title but know this.First off this is not really a game in my opinion. It is the definition of sandbox. There are no goals or end game. Your enjoyment will be completely dictated by the following1. Your imagination2. Your interest in the science of AstronomyIf you don't feel you have these qualities then it's likely that after 20-30 minutes you'll just find your self continously throwing planets and stars at one another. While this can be fun one can only blow up the Earth so many times until it gets boring. This is the type of sandbox that requires you to think ""What if..."" and then set up the scenario. The fun, for me, is in observing how bodies interact with one another. Really getting a sense of how everything in the universe is in motion at all times. Visually seeing how mass and gravity are intrinsicly tied to one another is very interesting to me. There are so many paramaters to tinker with it can be overwhelming but very rewarding if one spends the time experimenting.Experimenting is really what this sandbox is all about.Don't expect a manual or path to follow. The tutorial only gives you some basic ideas of what can be done, and as of this review is still partly bugged.Do expect a great learning experience and cool physical simulations that can inspire one to think about the scale of the universe and just how small we are.

								 If you like fiddling with space and watching different scenarios unfold (like the destruction of a planet), this is the game for you. Also the amount you can learn of this game is stunning, and if you like learning things about space this is something I recommend The game may be in development but it has a lot of great things in it already, and should give hundreds of hours to do for someone with different ideas to try out and simulate...or to just spam stuff and see thing explode. You can change a lot of settings in different menus, although you might have to look things up for some of them with the amount of complicated physics involved (who would've guessed, in a game about space nonetheless). But hey the settings can stay as they are, and moreso the game is all about creating a scenario you want to see, and watching it happen either correctly or going wrong horribly with eplosions everywhere.

								Mess with orbits, destroy everything, eradicate life on earth, grow objects mass until they collapse, spawn black holes, watch the orbits of Jupiter's 63 moons, the possibilities are endless and if you really enjoy space this is the game for you! If you don't care much for space or don't know a lot about it this is a good way to learn about the universe. If your more on the destructive and creative side you can smash planets together, galaxies together, and even create supernovas and black holes by crushing massive stars together. There's no limit except for your imagination.			",57,2,0,4,4,0,2

								This game is amazing.Not only are the team always active and helpful, they also answer to negative comments to get feedback!WHAT OTHER TEAM DOES THAT!?!?!?!?!? (Don't answer that, I know there is probably others)Not only is it a fabulous team, the game itself is far beyond what I would expect for an early access game. It is very innovative and I can't wait until it is done!However, I have some negatives for it. For instance, being able to create your own planets (I am not sure if this is in yet) or being able to edit the colors and other things related to more customization. I am also confused on the controls using a gamepad (which I hardly use for this game) but it could be useful for people who prefer controllers.Other than that, I don't know what else to say so far, but I may update this later. I can't wait to see where this game goes, and I'll be glad that I am apart of this journey!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game/software is really mind blowing. And the rendering is very pleasant as the menu is very ""eye candy""... it has something a bit like Star Citizen hud in its design.The music is very calm and fits very well. Making the whole experience very agreable and relaxing.Few points, it's still in alpha stage, creating galaxies is still buggy. But the game performs well. It runs like a charms on linux and I even think it natively runs on linux since few weeks as most of other games use a wrapper which slows down computation.So I wanted to point that out.I receive update regulary, to me the development is going in the right direction.Ofc if you re not interressed in astronomy or physics you'll be bored after a little while.In my opinion the price is a bit high. I bought it in discount... It seems devs don't plan to offer discount very often.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Really, it's just astonishing: not only to see such a beautiful, intricate, and basically FANTASTIC rendering of humanity's current working understanding of the cosmos, but to be able to run it on your computer at home (and cause all sorts of ellaborate, crazy mayhem, on all kinds of time scales...)... I mean, just ""WOW."" ... It just stuns me that such a beautiful rendering of our understanding of the cosmos can be purchased for 25 bucks... It's got the whole frigging universe in there just as a starting point... you get a majestic sense of time and space... its chaos, scale, symmetry, mysteries, marvels, phenomenon... and you can see it either as the vast and endless expanses of oblivion, or as the comically small billiard-table encapsulation of our water-droplet of existence... Either way, it's frigging awesome when you start making inconcievably humongous alterations or adjustments by say, distorting the orbits of planets by spawning humongous stars and then making them explode... (my personal fave, though, is simply being able to see the speed of light from our sun, rendered at scale... before exploding the sun and destroying all life as we know it, hahahha!). Super Highly recommended.			",563,105,8,44,41,3,48

								Let me clear up some of your possible doubts of this game. 1 : 'My system might not be able to handle it.'Response : I'm running Toshiba Windows 10 with an AMD A4-5k APU with Radeon HD Graphics. 1.50GHz. I have 4 GB of RAM but only 3.45 of those are actually usable. It's a 64x, but really, it's a fancy work laptop. In no means masterrace PC gaming console. I ran this game at 64 FPS on the highest graphics with (I didn't care to count, but there were a lot) tons of Mercurys crashing into each other destroying everything. 2. There doesn't look like there's much to it.Response : Space, dude. You can do anything you want to do. 3. Expensive.Response : I got this game for 20 bucks, and am thoroughly pleased with its preformance. Want it at a lower price then what's offered? Just wait a bit. Good ol' Gabe will set you up with something nice. 4. WHY ARE YOU STILL DOUBTING THIS GAME BUY IT IT'S WORTH IT.			",18,0,1,0,5,0,0

								Mess with orbits, destroy everything, eradicate life on earth, grow objects mass until they collapse, spawn black holes, watch the orbits of Jupiter's 63 moons, the possibilities are endless and if you really enjoy space this is the game for you! If you don't care much for space or don't know a lot about it this is a good way to learn about the universe. If your more on the destructive and creative side you can smash planets together, galaxies together, and even create supernovas and black holes by crushing massive stars together. There's no limit except for your imagination.			",57,2,0,4,4,0,2

								The overall realism is absolutely fantastic. Especially the galaxies and their star clouds mixing together.However, certain things just disappear when colliding, like a star and a black hole, or anything with the smaller objects. It would be great if those collisions wold be more realistic (black holes sucking strings of stars away, the Utah teapot smashing when anything hits it, etc.)Overall an amazing game. 9.8/10 Definitely reccomended.

I absolutely love the terarforming aspect; trying to make a life-sustaining moon or planet is quite tough.  The music (ambient) fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly, it's very relaxing.

								I bought this, because ever since I was a child, I had been interested in what lies beyond our sky. I always loved looking at images of the planets, stars, supernovae, and every time I could, I would look into the sky to watch the moon and stellar constellations. When I started Universe Sandbox 2, I looked at the tutorial, and started with a simple solar system.Two seconds later, the whole solar system blew up in a supernova because I made Jupiter have the mass of 500 Jupiters. Later, I reversed the solar system, sun still in the middle, outer planets inside, inner planets outside. Two seconds later, the whole solar system blew up in a supernova because I made the sun have the mass of 1000 suns.10/10 playing all the time(and If you're not so much into blowing up the solar system, there are also a lot of simulations you can watch. Also historical ones like halley's comet in 1983 or fictional ones like the star system of game of thrones, it's really fun to watch)			",9,17,0,15,13,0,3

								This is truly wonderful.  I was going to say that it is a truly wonderful game, but it's not really a game.  Unless you are talking metaphorically like ""life is a game"".  This is a hardcore simulator, but made to be very accessible to the average user.  Truly well done.While the vast majority of my feedback to this game is positive, I do have one major complaint - There is no setting I can find to disable the music.  Which is fine if you are going to open this game, play it for a while, and not do other things by alt-tabbing to other windows.  Or if you are very picky about the music you listen to this might be an issue for me.  Not that the music isn't good - which it is.  It sets a certain Space-ey vibe and it works.  I just wish I had the freedom to turn off the music from the settings menu.Now back to the positives...I could go on for several more paragraphs about how wonderful this app is and what a remarkable aid it would be not only to astronomy students and Planetary Astronomers (they have had access to stuff like this for years to decades) but this allows anybody in the world, with no prior knowledge of astronomy or science, to dive right in and ""Play Dice with the Universe"" as Einstein said.The power of exploration and experimentation that Universe Sandbox 2 puts into the hands of - basically anybody on the planet - is truly a wonder to behold and I am so thankful to the developers to putting this into my hands.

								This sim is for the truly geeky...I love it! Immediately hours disappear as I play with orbits, change velocities and add objects to the solar system just to watch what happens in decades, centuries or millennia. It's fascinating. There are a couple of things to understand...Only one real issue, and that's understandable. The tutorials do not teach you to play the sim. You get some step-by-step on some of the interface, they help but most of it you have to figure out by exploring. Frankly, I don't think most of us would sit through a full tutorial any way...it's more fun to start lobbing stars around and see what happens! Lots and lots of fun!			",16,38,0,12,5,0,10

								A huge, just a huge huge improvement over Universe Sandbox.While Universe Sandbox was cool for a bit, it honestly could get kinda dull after a while. The planets were more like floating pool balls in space that you would knock together. However, with Universe Sandbox 2, scientific accuracy and realism helps a game rather than hindering it! (sorta)Have you ever wanted to simulate what would actually happen if global warming progressed quickly?Have you ever wanted to create a second Ice Age?Have you ever wanted to blow up the Sun by throwing another Sun at it?Have you ever wanted to cause a supernova by thowing an explosive probe at Betelgeuse?Have you ever wanted the Monolith to orbit Earth?Have you ever wanted to watch the Milky Way and the Andromeda collide - in real time?Have you ever wanted to recreate the scenario of Majora's Mask?Have you ever wanted to make the Moon as big as Jupiter, suck the inner rocky planets into it and turn the sun into a black hole to throw away the evidence of mass planetary murder?Have you ever wanted to throw Pluto at the Earth?Have you ever wanted to see what would happen if Halley's Comet actually hit Earth?Have you ever wanted to play God in an infinitely sprawling sandbox of space?Then this is the game for you.

								I recommend getting this game just because you can change the mass of a star to be greater than all the mass of the universe, you can also set the radious of a star to be greater than the size of the universe. Oh, and you can destroy the earth in many creative ways. My personal favorite would be slowing down the games speed to much less than a mili second and launch a pool ball at the earth at trillion of times the speed of light, grab some popcorn and enjoy the end of the world to a ♥♥♥♥ing pool ball.

								This game/software is really mind blowing. And the rendering is very pleasant as the menu is very ""eye candy""... it has something a bit like Star Citizen hud in its design.The music is very calm and fits very well. Making the whole experience very agreable and relaxing.Few points, it's still in alpha stage, creating galaxies is still buggy. But the game performs well. It runs like a charms on linux and I even think it natively runs on linux since few weeks as most of other games use a wrapper which slows down computation.So I wanted to point that out.I receive update regulary, to me the development is going in the right direction.Ofc if you re not interressed in astronomy or physics you'll be bored after a little while.In my opinion the price is a bit high. I bought it in discount... It seems devs don't plan to offer discount very often.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Definitely reccomend it, such a great improvement over 1, with so many new features.  A lot still needs ironing out, mostly in the control scheme and some of the features (such as planet temprature) needs to be able to update automaticlly. But for early access its well put together, and the supernovae feature is the best. Overall no major bugs and awful pretty and just fun. Can;t wait for updates and to see where this goes!

Possibly the best sandbox game that I have ever playedFor those of you who don't know it, Universe Sandbox 2 is essentially an interstellar sandbox where you can create everything you want, ranging from planetoids and asteroids to black holes and hypergiant stars, and then put things in orbits - or launch said things at each other. When I first saw videos about this game - and its non-Steam predecessor, Universe Sandbox - I got a very general first impression: Explosions. Take a thing, add thing (at a collision course with a high velocity), get explosion. And from what I saw, the explosions were great, as were the collisions - especially in US2, the game I shall focus on. I was sold. I had to get it. And so I did.Of course I started with blowing things up. How could I resist? I started off with crashing Deimos into Earth, more precisely into the eastern US seaboard (thanks, Obama). I then proceeded to crash the Moon into the Pacific Ocean. Rest in peace, guys. But I didn't stop there. I threw what was left of Earth (a flaming ball, basically) into Jupiter. Then I threw Jupiter into the Sun. Then I threw the Sun into a bigger star, which also mumbo-jumbed the planetary orbits and sent Saturn, Neptune and Uranus into the deep unknown. I ended my destruction spree by crashing the largest star known to science into the second largest star known to science. The resulting supernova would have made Michael Bay ♥♥♥♥ his pants. And yet, I felt that something was missing. The destruction was fun, but it didn't feel like it had a purpose. So I left my pretty screwed-up solar systems behind and opened a new simulation. I added a Sun-like star into the centre, and then experimented a bit. I added a Mercury-ish planet which got pretty hot, a Jupiter-ish planet with many, many moons and an Earth with lots of water. The Mercury planet disappeared - it probably got destroyed by something that wasn't a moon, the Jupiter planet gobbled up its moons and all the water on Earth point 2 had all its water boiled off. So I tried again. I created a new solar system and did what I could to create functional orbits and planets with reasonable distances.What happened next was unexpected. As I finished setting up moons for my gas giant affectionately named Camillus after my crush, I looked at it's grand silhouette from the perspective of one of its natural satellites, decorated by the other orbiting moons. The sight filled me with awe. There are few games that can make me cry tears of awe, but Universe Sandbox 2 is a worthy candidate. This is not a joke.When you do what you can to destroy what can be destroyed, you feel a bit like a brutal god, and that is indeed very fun. But when you successfully create an Earth-like planet and watch its chances of life increase, when you watch the moons of a gas giant in orbit, when you gaze upon the mightiness of VY Canis Majoris, then you simply realize how amazing the universe is.And that is what this game succeeds at. It doesn't tell a complicated story, it doesn't give you a mission, but it gives you a beautiful understanding of our entire existence. And it does so beautifully. To make this look a bit more like an actual review, here's a paragraph on the things about this game that are good and bad. Good things? Very scientifically accurate (yes, I am a nerd), especially when it comes to physics. Great graphics, generally very beautiful when it comes to aesthetics. Very diverse when it comes to things you can do. Great randomization options for atmospheres, visuals, density and lots of other things. Oh, and all the other things I mentioned. Bad stuff? Only minor bugs, mostly related to sounds and mechanics. Could have some more minor objects like satellites, and more variation in asteroids. Oh, and I guess the black holes and ring dynamics are kinda screwed up at this stage. However, that is all which I consider bad about this game. And seeing as this is an Early Access game, I have full faith in the development team that they will sharpen the game to create a flawless experience.Essentially, this is the best sandbox i've ever played. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a star system to create (and hopefully not blow up).9.8/10 ",9,1,0,3,3,0,0

								This is a beautiful sandbox that I had no idea existed. There's so much physics involved that it makes my head spin, but overall with the presets of amazing builds there's plenty to play around with for beginners. I think the interface needs more refindment, hover-over states to help player understand what each little command/adjustment does. I only had to press buttons to understand or see what's going on, sometimes you don't even see what's happening, becasue of complex physics. Time scale needs improvements, I had no idea of the time control. As this is still in early beta, I hope it gets even more amazing by the end. I loved the different collisions, explosions and gravitational dances. Definitelly worth every penny.			",18,15,0,3,16,0,5

								I bought this, because ever since I was a child, I had been interested in what lies beyond our sky. I always loved looking at images of the planets, stars, supernovae, and every time I could, I would look into the sky to watch the moon and stellar constellations. When I started Universe Sandbox 2, I looked at the tutorial, and started with a simple solar system.Two seconds later, the whole solar system blew up in a supernova because I made Jupiter have the mass of 500 Jupiters. Later, I reversed the solar system, sun still in the middle, outer planets inside, inner planets outside. Two seconds later, the whole solar system blew up in a supernova because I made the sun have the mass of 1000 suns.10/10 playing all the time(and If you're not so much into blowing up the solar system, there are also a lot of simulations you can watch. Also historical ones like halley's comet in 1983 or fictional ones like the star system of game of thrones, it's really fun to watch)			",9,17,0,15,13,0,3

								If this game was real life, there wouldn't be much of a Universe left to make a simulator/sandbox of it.10/10 would destroy everything I ever knew/loved again.			",20,2,0,3,6,0,0

								The beauty shown through the simulators that we can create or experience inside of this program are unlike any other that I have ever had the great pleasure of encountering, including those which I have helped animate and model. This is not a game, this is dynamic and interactive art and for all that are concerned, merits the acclaim of masterpiece. 11/10			",53,8,1,9,8,2,15
