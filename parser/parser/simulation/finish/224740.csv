Early Access Review
								*edit* October 2016: Game launches out of Early Access.  I'm still here.  Want some idea what the game is like?  Look here:


YouTube™ Video: Clockwork Empires Beta 51: Probably More Than you Want to Know 

			Views: 996		

			Clockwork Empires officially entered Beta with the release of Revision 51. To celebrate, we take a special comprehensive look at what makes the game tick.		

Or here:


YouTube™ Video: Released Today, Just What is Clockwork Empires Anyway? 

			Views: 6,838		

			Just what kind of game is Clockwork Empires, anyway? For a slightly older (and better produced) video I created on the occasion of Clockwork Empires entering Beta, check this one out:...		

*edit* January 2015: So I first wrote this way back in August 2014.  I've stuck with the game, and it's development has interested me enough to hold my attention to the present day, January 2015.  I've even gone and made a bunch of YouTube videos, which I'll link  - those should give interested parties a good idea what actual gameplay is like.


YouTube™ Video: [1/4] Revision 34: Artifacts, Idols, and Airdrops.  More Clockwork Empires. 

			Views: 2,718		

			Clockwork Empires was updated to Revision 34 last week. Major changes included Naturalist behaviours, neat things pertaining to mysterious idols, and some new things for workshops.		

August 2014: My Hours Played don't reflect my actual play time; I've been loading this game directly from the .exe (which is a thing you can do, and which more Steam games ought to do, I'm looking at you, Skyrim).  Also, sessions that crash apparently don't get added to your Hours Played.  Expect crashes, this thing isn't even in Beta.*edit* Apparently they do count!This Early Access offering is a good example of the way Early Access should be done - the game itself is only nominally functional - there is currently no save function, for instance, there are still many bugs and crashes, and the interface is undergoing constant revision.  Many planned features have yet to be implemented, and the game itself could stand some optimization.  *edit* I'm testing the 'internaltest-' build which has, among other things, a save function.  It crashes more than it saves, but still.The value of an Early Access game is the opportunity to participate in feedback that will shape the direction of the game.  Submit suggestions, tweaks, typos, bugs and playability experiences to the Devs.  They've shown themselves to be very responsive, and actively solicit player feedback (on the Gaslamp Games forums), and the whole development process has been the model of transparency, with weekly Dev Blog updates and a Twitter presence.Clockwork Empires has a lovely aesthetic, and great potential, but it's nowhere near finished.  Wait for full release (projected to be ~9 months) if you want it feature-complete and polished.  I'm in it because the Development Blogs are great, the Devs are active, and I enjoy contributing my 2 cents worth.This is a game on the same shelf as Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Spacebase DF-9, et al.  It's a city builder sim; there's no direct control of your citizens, who you direct largely by creating jobs and juggling priorities.  The setting is a sort Victorian-era English colony; your soldiers wear red coats and wield muskets, your menfolk sport glorious handlebar moustaches, and your colonists (literally) gossip about things like the Monarchy.  It's brass, elbow grease, laudanum, dodos, and cabbages everywhere.  You already know if this stuff appeals to you or not.Also appearing: fishmen, dark cults, insanity and ritual murder.  Still in the works, tentacled horrors, secret geometry, and Lovecraftian modules for your Lumber Mill (!).If you do get this game, get involved in the Dev side or you're missing a great opportunity; check out the blogs, read the forums, share hilarious stories about mass starvation and game-breaking bugs.p.s. I forgot to mention cannibalism.  Cannibalism is always hilarious.  I don't know if fishmen count as cannibalism, but I'm pretty sure your fellow colonists do.p.p.s Read the system requirements.

												I honestly thought Gaslamp Games wouldnt abandon this game after its lackluster launch. I was wrong. Even with the success of Dungeons of dredmor behind them, they still took the easy way out. I doubt they made a lot of money from the game. But they simply dissapeared a few months ago. Last time one of the developers was logged into the game forum was on December 6th...Edit : There is strong evidence that Gaslamp Games actually no longer exists. Dbaumgart has moved on to differnt projects( linkedin.com/in/david-baumgart-02560320 (Gaslamp Games Juli 2008 - November 2016)) , Nicholas Vinning twitter bio has changed to ""I once made games, it was awful."" ( https://twitter.com/nvining ) Thats two out of three founders presumably already gone. The only one that might be still with the company is Daniel Jacobsen. ( https://twitter.com/citizen_daniel ) But he would be by himself.They all couldnt be bothered to tell the supporting community at Gaslampgames.com forums about this. Thats just bad form and poor treatment of loyal customers who supported them throughout the journey.			",413,163,7,121,50,2,104

												The game is not bad, but it's not ready to be out of Early Access. It's still buggy, laggy, and just lacking polish in general. The HP Lovecraft theme is great and the gameplay is good, but this game is not finished. I'll change my review if or when it's REALLY finished.			",353,49,4,45,19,4,26

												This game has a good concept with some very nice theming, but the execution just isn't there.  Anyone familiar with Dwarf Fortress will recognize a lot in this game, and you will hear ""Dwarf Fortress"" here a lot because this game is heavily derived from it.  Persistent ""characters"" with their own traits that influence and are influenced by the world around them.  Material harvesting and workshop orders predicated on a limiting factor of work hours available, with those work hours being influenced by worker happiness.  All good concepts that make the base for an engaging little game.It falls short in how it tries to turn these things into a fun game.  It tries very hard to be Dwarf Fortress with a nicely animated graphics package, but it is chained to an all too linear progression system that makes the game drag along at a miserable pace.  You must build a workshop to make another workshop.  You must make planks to make bric-a-brac to make decorations to make better habitations to make it possible to get more workers.  It does this with a very unintuitive set of menus (almost as bad a learning curve as Dwarf Fortress) and a wretched UI that makes Fallout 4 look like Master of Orion 2.It tries to do all of the ultra-complicated Dwarf Fortress interactions, but it just doesn't have the complexity right or the coding to make it all work together.  Granted, in Dwarf Fortress any system seems to lag when the computer has to take into account the wetness of each toe and finger of 100 dwarves when it starts to rain, but CE doesn't even get a fraction of these things running at once.All of the random or sort of random events that take place require you to have certain buildings built and functional to avoid a horrible outcome.  But by the time these events pop up, there is no way you can have such a thing in place unless you have ignored all of the other needs of the colony.  You can't prevent X from happening because you need building Y, which must be supplied with good A and B to function, and thes goods can only be made with ingredients C and D in workshops G and F.  And if you can get that stuff up and running, it's because you've neglected to build a kitchen and all of your colonists have already starved to death.  It's a flow chart of damnation.The micromanagement of keeping the settlers fed/sane/protected/happy is unpleasant and cumbersome and prevents you from doing the exploration, discovery, building and horrible death stuff that is interesting.The take home is that it just isn't fun to play as it stands now.  With massive changes to pacing, UI, and such it could be an enjoyable little game.  It's not there yet and it will take a lot more work to get there.  It needed a LOT more playtesting (ask your gaming parents what that was if you don't know) before being released for money.  I paid retail and feel burned by it.  Not ""No Man's Sky"" burned, but I got suckered by the DF aspects mixed with the victoriana theming.It's a game and games are supposed to be fun to play.  It is not fun to play.			",22,6,0,6,12,0,13

												Update January 18th, 2017Devs have gone silent now for 7 weeks, I had a feeling this was going to happen due to the sudden release of the game and missing a lot of polishing and minor features. Overall, its playable, the bugs/issues do get more apparent late game. On sale, its worth putting some hours in but I doubt you'll sink in over 30hrs total, read below for the rest of the review. The community has taken this lead of silence very negatively as you can see on the store page. Out of Early AccessDeleted previous review. This game has come along way but here's a quick overview to anyone interested in buying:Resource Management Sim: This game does really good in this area. If you enjoy these types of games this one is a great add to your library. Lots of resources and end products to produce with lots of oversight.Survival/Battle: It's in the game, its okay, still needs a lot of work/polishing but its there. Doesn't take much effort, just numbers and influence on the tech of the guns they are using. Town Building: This part still needs work, feels slightly clunky still and there are no ""roads"" as of yet (no speed bonuses to movement) which will get somewhat aggravating as your town gets bigger since the ""slowness"" of the villagers will become more apparent and start to effect production. Pros:Excellent resource managementTown feel and layoutQuirky back storiesLots of depthCons:Villagers still don't seem smooth or have liquid flow to them, lots of pausing (thinking) between tasksNo speed bonus to villagers (aggravating mid - late game)Optimization is good but there is still much to doOverall, controls and UI still feel clunky/not smooth unsure if optimizing will correct thisOverall: Descent game, worth face value and definitely if it goes on sale. It won't disappoint at all but leaves you hoping for a bit more polishing of the game itself. If this game isn't polished by 4-1-17 then I'd give it a ""Okay"" thumbs up.			",18,6,1,9,22,0,6

Early Access Review
								At 439 hours played I have to say that this is my favourite game on steam. I just love it. Yep it is not finished. Yep major bits are not yet working, yep there is still quite a way to go.But it is funny, charming and bonkers. It has lovely animations and background flavour text, cubes of flesh and sausages. I am 51 and should really be getting on with my life but keep clicking the damn play button even though I have seen everything in the game many times. Some eldritch facination keeps drawing me in like a dumb cultist to some sleeping horror bemeath the waves. I have watched the game grow from something that barely works at all to something that sometimes works a bit. But beware my review as I thought Towns was really good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game doesn't feel, for lack of a better term, done.As of 12/2016, at least, it feels like it's missing some very basic, very important things. For example, you can build walls, but cannot order your soliders to guard the walls so problems tend to walk right in anyway. In fact, it's very difficult to get your soldiers to do ANYTHING, other than 'All of you go to this location ASAP, wander around for a minute or so, and then go back to just doing whatever.'The UI also needs a better way to give information to the player. Like, some kind of colony overview sheet, that will tell me if any workshops are out of materials and track food production vs. consumption. I love the setting, and the basics are solid, it just feels radically unpolished to have already come out of EA.			",158,66,1,46,49,1,37

												UPDATED POST RELEASE: Significant improvement to game overall. Hardly any bugs remaining and the game is functioning as I would have expected. Of course this is not the end of CE. There is still much more content to come! Really pleased with Devs.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATED REV 42E: The Devs have been focusing on bug fixing and mainly changes within the User Interface and Farming area of the game. The U.I has had an overhaul in terms of the character selection menu and information panels. They tell you more about each character, their mood, emotion and progress towards desires. Each character's current effects now show bars as to how it affects their mood within these panels.The Farming and Kitchen has been addressed in a sense that instead of mass lists of recipes, the vast majority of standard food you can find, gain from hunting and farming has been condensed into a simple ""Make food"" job where the colonists will use any standard type of food they can find. I much prefer this because it is at the end of the day what you order anyway, all food you can.Militarily, the barracks function and NCO has been fixed so they now properly train into Regular troops from militia. Overall, not a bad update at all however as I have previously stated, the game is very much playable and more of the game ""content"" in that regard, new items, clothing etc, should be coming in the near future because it would seem most systems are now functioning as intended and have been fixed.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATED REV 41D: Constantly changing and evolving, CE is more stable than ever. So many changes in the latest builds from REV 38. The majority of issues have been addressed to the state that you can pretty much play for however long you like. Once you start getting larger populations however you may still encounter the odd bug or issue. On that note the Devs are reaching what I call the last loose ends. Fixing the remaining issues that people encounter and adding in the systems left.The UI has been updated massively and there are various new systems in place such as the events which are now much more refined. There is a starting property ownership system in place which is going to be built on to eventually include owning clothing, various objects and so on. The workshops have been overhauled and recently just added in is the new Military Barracks which replaces the old system of training. You assign a Military Officer or Militia NCO to the Barracks and he/she will start to train troops into Regulars. The favour system has also been recently amended. For example you can now recieve a prisoner work group which will assist your colony doing various tasks for 3 days. Many now have a time frame. The squad of Regulars led by an NCO also assist for 3 days (or is it 5?) for example.All in all a lot has changed to list, including minor changes but the game has made substancial progress certainly.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATED REV38  : So much has changed since my last update. This is now Clockwork Empires in the Official stable gameplay stage now. You can play without any major issues, no crashes or that. They have added removal of buildings, planning changes, new User Interface elements and refined Combat mechanisms and A.I for colonists and elements alike. If you were following this previously, then now is a pretty good time to join in the fun and development of Clockwork Empires.The team is constanly updating it, each update bringing much better features and now that all the bug bashing has really been done, it is content that is being brought in. Cults have been revamped, basic diplomacy is now functioning with minor factions like bandits and so on bringing all sorts of events that your decisions can affect your colony and how long it survives. Far too much to list but the future of CE is very bright indeed! UPDATED: REV33: By far the best update that has been implemented. Now with complete re-designed mechanics and Graphics, the game runs certainly, much smoother and MAC support is now in the works with basic features working. The game has came a long way from the past 2 builds and with new features such as bandits, new animals, refined combat and economics and UI the game is definitely coming together. Again I would still be waiting a couple more before buying but in terms of my level of ""playablility"", that stage has almost been reached. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review:While this is Early Access.......very very early. I have to say that this game has huge potential. The developers are keen and very open and the game itself is the perfect management game for those who loved traditional city builder games crossed with a bit more things to do such as combat, defence etc.It is based during the Colonial-Early Industrial period and already the developers have nice features set out. The game itself does have a sense of humor thrown in and the like such as having to fight off Fish people and all sorts of creatures. In future they plan to add bandits and all manners of factions and allow you to ally, trade and conduct diplomacy for your newly starting colony. There is also a map set out what looks like it will be a sort of campaign style base in which you choose where you would like to set out your next adventure for the Empire and start to form new colonies.The artstyle in my view fits perfectly along with the current mechanics which are currently implemented it really does look and function well. If you play it you will see just exactly what this game could offer in the near future and even now.The game is one of a kind and unique in so many ways. If you don't mind investing in such games then by all means take it into account but if you want a finished product then you will have to wait. I would say another month or so and this game will get better and better......hopefully :) It really is up to yourself but I can say this certainly. If you decide to invest your money in this EA game. You will not loose out. The Devs are like PA Devs in that sense but even better. They are constanly interacting with community to fix things, release experimental build updates pretty much from 2 days-1 week. Really are making significant progress and fast.EDIT: And I was correct when i said a month or 2. Saves are practically on the table with loading now as are basic defences. Many fixes and performance improvements to allow smooth running of the game and ruled out majority of crashes. Now they can finally give it a few weeks, start working on the games mechanics and content more rather than bug fixing. For now anyway :D---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------On that note: The team plan to adopt a monthly update schedule which will release major build updates to the public. If you would like to assist in testing or just mess around with it early then they have an opt in ""experimental branch"" which as it suggests is ""experimental"" but enough to keep you playing. I can see the team relating to Prison Architect in that sense as they always keep the community interested and up to date and these guys are constantly fixing and addressing issues with their game so very active :DAs I am constanly testing the Experimental builds which are updated regularly with new things to check out and suggest, I will be updating this throughout each build, or when I can :)			",94,15,0,22,34,0,28

Early Access Review
								As a fan of games that allow the player to start a civilization from a small group of people, it felt like a no-brainer to keep an eye on Clockwork Empires, and when I was given the opportunity to review it, I gladly accepted the challenge.Without any further delay, I present to you my review of Clockwork Empires.GameplayFrom the moment you start the game, you'll know that something is being done right. From the well-designed menu, to its enjoyable graphics, Clockwork Empires is a gem in the making. Your job is to start a colony, and to do so, you're given a certain amount of colonists and some materials.The wonderfully written tutorials will also provide you the necessary knowledge to build according to your colony’s needs. While building, you'll also have to keep your colonists happy and well fed, as well as safe from all hostile units, such as the dreadful fishpeople.The graphics are really enjoyable, and the scaling used on certain objects/units will certainly create a laugh or two.To accompany all of the above, some nice music is put to good use, leaving the player relaxed and ready to build a new empire. Or get his whole colony destroyed by the fishpeople.Pros Excellent tutorial, with some humor to it; Wide variety of materials; Groovy graphics; Enjoyable soundtrack; Well designed crew micromanagement; Large maps with plenty of resources; Detailed tabs with resources available, current jobs/actions being performed, and even an event log.I've decided to add a ""Neutral"" category, as they aren't gamebreakers, but could improve the gameplay if polished.Neutral Sudden change of background music can sometimes be annoying; Could use a couple more tooltips, mostly to tell the player where to get whatever is missing in the city; Once in-game, the only way to go back to the main menu is by closing the game and restarting it; Could use a delete option on the saved games, considering the files are somewhat big and you can't overwrite them; The characters don't stop moving when you pause the game; The AI could be improved, since characters don't stop moving while hauling/exploring, even if they're being attacked, and they also seem to choose a random table/place to go drop something.Keep in mind the game is still in Early Access (EA), and the ""Cons"" mentioned below will, certainly, be tweaked and/or polished as the game gets more and more updates.Cons Excessive amount of hostile units from the very start, although sometimes it's bearable; Lack of ""Game Speed"" function makes the game boring at times; Inability to remove/cancel pretty much everything.VerdictI'd give it a 7/10 Considering its EA status and it has an active development team, the game is bursting with life, and you can expect it to be a lot more polished by the time it gets its full release.

												I respected the devs a lot. They were releasing a lot of updates in EA with really slick, amusing blog posts. For years as they developed it I sat on the sidelines not buying it. Then when it was getting close to release and there was a sale on I bought it. Then they called the game 1.0 and not long after they seem to have broken up and all gone their separate ways but not one of them had the common decency to write a single word telling us this.The game is not done, they are still selling it as done. Really angry.			",1954,770,78,323,277,18,414

												I have been playing the early access version for some time – steam reckons 60 hours.I wanted to love it – the initial concept really appealed (steam pipes & drive shafts connecting your building! distinct colonies spread around the map! mysterious things going on! 4X-gameplay! interesting personality stuff!), but the game doesn’t really feel like it has lived up to expectations.What we have now is a fairly generic – albeit pleasantly whimsical – strategy game without much depth. Its basically the same game as something like Warcraft 2, except without the Orcs – i.e. you just build farms or workshops or whatever on your fixed-size-map and keep getting new peons to chop down the trees or work in the mines or whatever until you get bored and start a new map. I was able to get sucked in and play for quite some time just trying out some ideas etc, but ultimately there is not much replay once you’ve worked out the “optimum” design for your colonies etc.Sorry Gaslamp. I really wanted to like it. Sure I’ve got my money’s worth for 60 hours but I was hoping for more and was really surprised to hear it was exiting early access considering it was “missing” so much of what I was waiting for :(			",93,17,6,5,35,0,19

												Well, this is disappointing.I'd been following the development of this game on the Gaslamp Games blog for ages, and bought it as soon as it went Early Access. Kept testing almost every version, and still reading the (genuinely well written) blog of the game development process. Liked the early access stuff, and was quite happy with how new stuff was being added and bugs were slowly being fixed.Then suddenly 1.0 came out, and... there were still a lot of bugs everywhere and many features felt half-finished at best. I guess they ran out of money or something?One more blog post about them working on a bugfix patch, plus some more features.Then the devs disappeared.I'll change my recommendation if the devs actually ever re-emerge and patch this game to a state it deserves to be in. Until then, thumbs down from me.			",173,84,1,47,30,1,31

												Short review:A basebuilding game with a fun theme, cool events and a great squad system. Unfortunately, monitoring inventory and building stuff is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥due to a very unhelpful UI.I would not recommend this game unless you are a huge fan of basebuilding games and you are very sure the UI won't be a dealbreaker.--------------------Long Review:Good:- Events that pop up are really fun and make you feel like you're in a Lovecraftean world.- You really feel like you're building up a town- Overseers + laborers squad-based system is a great way to manage your population- Dev is actively working on patches to add content and fix bugsBad:- Right clicking moves the camera around instead of bringing up a context menu.- Huge gunfights in town and everyone just shoots like the buildings' walls aren't there. Kinda breaks the illusion.- Minor bugs like two guys trying to level one terrain spot get stuck in an up/down loop, or animals getting stuck in a building and making it hard to click stuff, lots of little stuff like that- (edited) Feels like you can negate most dangers by using tech to ""solve"" events and becoming friendly with all factions, game could use something to add pressure/tension at that point. Harder biomes / expeditions don't really change how the game plays.Ugly:- (edited) If you are building something and missing mats, about 20% of the time it either tells you the wrong mats or pretends you do have the mats and just doesn't build it.- Can't see resources without clicking into a submenu and clicking filters. And you have to check this constantly to see how your colony is doing, for example to catch when your supply chain is generating a given resource too slowly.- (edited) Serious performance issues as your colony size scales up, starts around 40 colonists and gets real bad by about 75 (removed crashing complaint, 3 crashes in 44 hours isn't that bad imo)- The UI does a very poor job guiding you through the process of building objects. There are multiple issues here:--- When you choose something to build, the UI only tells you what workshop makes the item. Each workshop can have 4 or more workbenches that each produce a subset of items, so you still have to figure out which bench to use.--- Figuring out which bench is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ To see what each bench can make, you have to click on each one and scroll through their list. And if you haven't built every bench and you can't find what you want, you have to keep building benches trying to find it.--- Items you can't build because you need to research them look exactly the same as stuff you can actually build. So you might build every bench and scroll through every item and still not find what you want.Suggestions on how to fix some of the major issues:- Instead of having tooltips say ""Made in Metalworks"" have them say ""Made in Metalworks Smelter"". Just saying the bench would make everything so much more clear and save a ton of time and frustration.- Make it obvious when something can't be built because it hasn't been researched. Put a red X over it, make it a different color, put it in the tooltip, anything!- (edited) When I'm missing a component to build something, make sure the UI tells me the right thing.- Maybe this one isn't so simple, but it would be really nice to be able to toggle resources or categories to show permanently in the UI ala Gnomoria, especially when the full submenu does such a poor job of filtering things.I really enjoyed the world and the gameplay elements.  But games like this revolve around building stuff and monitoring your inventory, and it is disappointing that the UI handles those tasks so poorly. Between that and the slowdown (you can hit 40 population quite quickly) I've decided to set this aside until some of these issues are patched.As stated above, I would not recommend this game unless you are a huge fan of the genre and you are very sure the UI won't be a dealbreaker.[edited 4 sections for accuracy after playing a bit more]			",494,119,7,96,89,4,87

												Clockwork Empires is one of those games that I really really wanted to be good. The basic setting, the fundamental idea behind it, is nice. But as is often the case with these Early Access titles, the actual execution crashes miles away from the intended target and then slowly sinks into the ocean.Let's get the good out of the way first, because honestly, there is less pro than con in this case.Settlements do feel sprawly, once (and if) you manage to grow them. You are quite capable of building a very nice looking settlement with some planning. The very basic presentation is also done okay. There's occult events, fish people running around and the ocassional cult going on. House design is up to you, meaning that you get to customize how your places look. It gets fidgety and micro intensive from time to time, especially in larger settlements. But at least you can make the houses you build look somewhat neat.And then we get to the bad. And boy, where to begin.Let's start with the difficulty. Now, what you WANT from a game like this, is balancing growth, people's needs, and safety. Basically, the guy in charge should need to juggle the three to slowly, but surely, expand his little backwater Innsmouth to a decent settlement. The game stumbles over the first one, ignores the second and finally descends, maybe even fittingly, completey into madness at the last one.On easy embarks, the game lacks any sort of challenge and is basically just ""My little Lovecraft"". Enemies are barely present, and if they do deem your citizens worthy of getting buggered, they will get obliterated even by the most basic of militaries. As an introduction, that would be fine. Gives you a little playground to learn the ropes in.Then you go up to medium, and suddenly you are getting OBLITERATED by countless bandit raids. The very first attack on your settlement might be done by more Bandits than you have Dudes to start out with. It's also completely possible to spawn with a couple big animals nearby, that kill some of your folks before you even build your first house.After a couple tries, I realized the best way to actually defeat those odds is just to spam housing. Basically, get as many disposable scrubs in your settlement as possible, and then just drown the enemy in bodies. Yes, the game literally FORCES you, to build a big, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, low quality settlement with as many people as possible, just to survive. It's the only strategy that really works, and it turns the early game into a tedious, boring nightmare.This COULD be remedied, if Defenses did anything and actually offered a strategy to your security. But you can not give your military orders beyond ""Go there"" and then praying that at least half of them survive. And dont count on it, the AI has the survival instinct of a suicidal sloth.So the combat part of the game is a total wash. What about the economy then? Well, the path finding and stockpiling mechanics are awful. People will sometimes pick up random things and carry them into the woods, possibly as a distraction for the invading bandits. They will stack items in a way that could NOT be any more inefficient. With some items being picked up and dropped multiple times, which is especially infuriating for food and raw materials. Your workers also have set schedules and working hours. Working hours that start out minimal, until you make your populace happier. As we established, since the only way to survive on anything but easy is to spam unhappy dudes, your guys will do a MINIMAL amount of work, accentuated by the fact that the inefficient pathfinding and buggy mechanics will sometimes mean your guys will literally do almost NOTHING troughout an entire day.And this applies to everyone. The baber is supposed to be the guy that heals your wounded citizens. Now, for that to work, he needs to be in his workplace and the guy that needs patchin' needs to be there as well, of course. I stopped counting how many times the barber stopped working the moment a very wounded soldier stepped into his place. Or the other way around, people doing unimportant busywork at low hp, while the barber stands in his shop doing nothing.Same goes for workshops. Stockpile management is barely present. And if those ressources are too far away, it's completely possible for a craftsman to spend his entire shift carrying three pieces of wood to a workbench, producing one chair, and then stop working again.Finally, the Overseers being asigned Labourers thing is a cute idea, but ultimately utterly meaningless if not an outright hindrance. In my mind, you should obviously have more labourers than Overseers, and they should be easier to get in large quantities. But firstly, there is very little reason to actually have a large labourer force, as most workshops require one or two at most, and second, the amount of work required to build labourer housing is only minimaly less demanding than just getting more Overseers.It would've been better to just not assign labourers at all and just have them help out wherever they are needed. It would have made stockpiling less of a pain and reduce the general amount of micromanaging motherf**ery you have to deal with every single moment. Maybe stuff would actually get done that way.Then we have nonsensical restrictions on Workshop buildings, increased by getting more Overseers. Making the early game even more frustrating since you cant build all the critical buildings you need, unless, you guessed it, you spam even more unhappy people into your crappy town.I could go on, but why bother. The game should not have left Early Access. it's plain and simply not fun in it's current state. I'd guess it would need a couple weeks of constant patches, adjusting and even some changes on very basic levels to be even considered ""Okay"". And there has not been an update in over a month. Honestly, skip this one and check back in a couple months, to see if anything changed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								The world's finest cabbage farming simulator.I'll say up front that at this time (8/15/14) it is still rather bare as a game and there are still engine bugs to be worked out. If you are wanting a polished full featured game hold off on buying this. However I've been involved since closed testing and have seen wonderful improvements and the foundation laid for many exciting game features over the last several months. The developers are passionate, experienced, and active in the community. Getting in now will let you help shape this fabulous game, and of course let you enjoy it now.Many games hype what they hope they will be and have to scale back often leaving fans disappointed and skeptical about any games previews. Gaslamp Games have been hyping what already exists in Clockwork Empires. Many of the features are rough around the edges and a number are not included in the current public build (8/15/14) because they are not yet ready for prime time but they do exist. The talk of colonists having personalities and memories isn't smoke and mirrors. Once all the pieces are polished and come together Clockwork Empires will delight and horrify you. It is a gem, rough and unpolished now but full of promise. And the developers release rapidly and responsively so you will not be waiting months for news. One week in closed tested we had 7 days that saw three full new versions (with significant changes) as features came together and they responded to tester feedback. While that was a very busy week they have a track record of consistent and fast updates.			",155,26,0,42,19,0,41

												-WARNING-  game has been abandoned, DO NOT BUY, DO. NOT. BUY. the game is dead with 0 word from the Dev's, I don't know what happened, I even spoke to one of them and he seemed like a good guy.. something must of happened behind the scenes but none of them have the guts to stand up and say ""Look, its over, it won't be continued"" no.. instead they give us silence, the game is dead and so is much of my respect for gaslamp studio's Alright Iv thrown about 30 hours in now over a few weeks and I think I can give a fair opinion on it.. the game is alright, it has the essential qualities it needs to be this style of sandboxy-sim buildy-strategy game but it has a few big issues, 1 : the game has no grapics settings or ways to modify the settings without knowledge of manipulating the games hidden files and documents, 2: the tutorial is borderline worthless  (((The new tutorial is better but I (since I know how to play) can't get a feel for how much more useful it is but it is at least improved on the original))) 3: The game is quite buggy 4: Removed. **Crashing has been made more stable and one of the causes of crashes, the trade office, has been fixed so I have removed the complaint of instability** 5: The game comes with alot of issues of game design, flattening terrain is essential but is so slow and time consuming that you'll be stunted and possible lose the game because of it, enemies are very tough and as of the current patch you cant equip new weapons, so invasion forces, bandits.. fish-people attacks, they will face you using basic pistols and likely wreck you because of it, production lines are slow and not well explained, leading to wasted resources or a lack of basic items needed to collect more basic items (stone.. where are you in my hour of need? )6 (the big one)  : the price.. now they have added a price cut for the duration of the beta-branch being launched but I paid full price for the early access version (which I am fine with) but the price is still far too high in my opinion for something that was in alpha, when its finished I can say the price would be reasonable but as it stands with the issues above, I can't reccomend it.TL/DR   The game has the basics down, has the heart and soul of a good game and has a Dev team commited to making it better but right now, the price, the issues listed and the over all feel of the game.. as much as I badly want it to finish, to work out and be great, I couldn't recommend it to a friend for fear they'd be wasting their money... as it stands, I can't recommend it right -now- but I will be editing this review over the coming weeks and hoping my opinion changes.

												Game very much not ready for release.  Same as Dungeons of Dredmor, the team's previous game. However, DoD got a LOT of free updates and cheap dlc over time, so there is still hope. Right now however, do not purchase. Maybe in a year this game will be playable. Right now the devs have fallen silent for a month, so there is some doubt to that.EDIT as of 13/2/2017:It seems that Gaslamp Games has lost its core members without actually making any of it official. There seems to be virtually no hope left for this game to actually get any more updates.			",77,30,0,17,6,0,14

Early Access Review
								I purchased Clockwork Empires back in July of 2014 on their website for $30 and I got a steam key too. I knew that the game was nowhere near finished, but I was excited to try it anyways. After all their previous creation, Dungeons of Dredmor, was a pretty decent game -- so I had faith that they'd do a reasonable job on this one. A cozy Steampunk-Themed Citybuilder/Survival game with Dwarf Fortress inspirations, that's right up my alley! However the game was absolutely riddled with problems, and I don't mean glitches/crashes/bugs (which it had hundreds of), I mean core, fundamental problems. The interface is extremely clunky and nothing felt intuitive. No hotkeys for building modules or foundations, no quality of life features. The camera moves at a snails pace vertically, but warp-speed horizontally. Escape and Right-Click never act as you expect them to in a city-builder-esque game. Guess what the module-rotation hotkey is (Hint: It's not R). Guess what the foundation cancel hotkey is (Hint: It's not Escape).Micromanagement of your colonists is fairly tedious too. These people somehow lived full lives without your help, but now without your orders they will literally stand around until they go insane from hunger and eat each other. They won't even try to go hunt wild animals for food without your precise guidance. Colonists work in crews, under an overseer, which is sort of a higher class citizen than your generic worker. You need to make sure your workers don't bite off more than they can chew in terms of jobs by isolating what each work crew is allowed to do. For instance, you want to make sure they don't cut down 50 trees and run out of food while they do it; you want them to only chop down a few trees and then immediately put that lumber to use. Otherwise you'll have a giant stockpile of lumber and no food. ( I guess you could theorhetically use it to make coffins for all your soon-to-be-dead colonists? ) Overseers randomly pick a task for his crew to do, based on what he's allowed to do, but you can't tell an overseer ""I need you to do exactly this"". He'll just arbitrarily pick something to do, which is why you must constantly manage what jobs are available to make sure they don't overdo one job and ignore another (like cutting down 50 trees). If work crews are stationed in a particular building, they will only do jobs associated with that one building... and if there are not enough jobs in that building and too many workers, you'll have a lot of idle time. This is honestly just the tip of the iceberg. For better or for worse, Clockwork Empires has a lot of depth when it comes to managing your  men.In a game like this, there's two ways to do it properly. Option A: allow you to control every little aspect as much as you'd like. Give direct orders: move here, do that, build this, kill that. Micromanage each individual exactly how you please and they will obey commands like a robot. Or, Option B: focus on macromanagement. You're like the Queen Ant and you tell the workers what do. I want a house here, a farm there, and I want these trees chopped. Well unfortunately Clockwork Empires doesn't operate like either of these, instead it's more like Option C: manage an insane asylum of murderous cannibals. Well it's been about 2 years since then. Here's the part where I tell you ""but all of that is all fixed now, and the game is great!"", right? Actually, everything I wrote in those paragraphs above still applies today. It's a bit better now, but still riddled with fundamental issues. I actually just played right before writing this review and the game crashed on me. Sure, the game has more features and things to build (I think), sure it's a little more polished around the edges, and dozens of game-breaking bugs have been fixed... but the game is still cumbersome and unintuitive at it's core. It still crashes (A lot). The game still doesn't have hotkeys for buildings or modules, which are extremely important. Why are they putting this off for so long? The game would be a lot more playable if it had proper controls, I think that goes without saying! The config.xml file allows you to change the few hotkeys that do exist, but when I tried to change WASD to arrow keys, they didn't work at all. (The developers said they're working on fixing this keybinding problem, but it's been 2 years since I mentioned it so... who knows).Another issue, and this one really worries me, is that the game takes a very long time to save and load. For a game that crashes non-stop, you really want to auto-save every couple of minutes, but because saves take a long time to complete... it's quite a dilemma. To make matters worse, you cannot select how often the game auto-saves (I checked the config.xml file to be sure, there's no option for auto-save interval), I think it's like 10 or 15 minutes by default, not sure... but losing even 10 minutes in a game like this makes you want to quit entirely. Since auto-saves are essentially a pop-up window with no warning, it's very easy to accidentally crash the game by trying to do something while the game saves. I've learned to take my hands off the keyboard and mouse entirely whenever I see the save window appear. Maybe I'm just being impatient, but I feel that optimizing save times should be a priority for the development team right now. The last thing I'll mention briefly are the games visuals, sound and overall theme. They're fantastic. This game has a lot of style and you can really see that they had a clear artistic vision when creating this game.So, ultimately, is Clockwork Empires worth buying? Maybe some day, but not right now, and not anytime in the near future. Time cures all wounds, so I'm sure that if the developers keep at it this will be a fantastic game one day... but it's also possible that they will grow weary of the project and try to get it as bug-free as possible, then move onto something else. A lot of these issues I've described seem to be issues with it's foundation, problems with the way the game's code was written, and might not ever be able to be fixed. That worries me, mostly because I WANT Clockwork Empires to be an incredible game, because I love these type of city-builder/resource-manager/survival-horror/dwarf fortress-style games.Rating: N/A, game needs a lot of work			",41,5,0,3,10,1,9

								I'm voting this up only because the gameplay is actually really good. But I have to stress this game is bugged to hell. It crashes every 10 - 15 minutes, you can't save, so you basically always lose your progress, and if you pause sometimes the workers don't recover from it. A long way to go before we can call this a working game. I've logged  a few tickets, but the game is good in terms of gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Great management game with a pinch of Lovecraftian feeling.Do not expect a comleted game though... the last update made it more convenient but managing your colonists is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ as they often seem to wander around randomly, not following orders or stopping all the time to do something else.In game descroptions are vague, many times it is not clear what an item, building does, what is the connection between them, or some ingredients are still a mistery for me, what are they. (you only see an icon of a red fluid but not even its name)Controlling armies is hell, all you can do is to set a rally point where they will go or not, thus combat is very clunky.But despite all of this cons, it is an overall enjoyable build but I really hope they chisel it much much more. The devs are quite active, the game has a very nice atmosphere, I definitely recommend to play it but with a big disclaimer that if you want a finished, seamless experience, rather just follow the game for now.

												Wonderful game that's been abandoned unfinished.It -is- playable but it has serious problems with omissions/bugs that make some features unusable (or require manual patching to fix them) and SERIOUS slowdown/optimization problems that hit you around mid-game.Devs have been in communications silence since December 2016 - most of them have confirmed that they are no longer affiliated with the studio, Gaslamp Games, but NOBODY HAS COME FORWARD TO EXPLAIN. No 'sorry guys, we're bankrupt' or... well, or anything!The game still has great character and is playable to an extent, but sooner or later, you will bog down to unplayable levels of lag, or realize that features for late-game management and expansion are missing.Buy it on a deep sale to experience it, then mourn what could have been.

Early Access Review
								Ok, straight off let me say I really really like this game. I love the concept, love the art, just really love this game. What i don't love is the game breaking bugs and glitches, however there is great news, its in Early Access, so these will eventually get ironed out.  Now this isn't my first Early Access rodeo, I've gotten burned by some games on here, and I've found some real gems as well. This I really believe will end up being a big hit for the type of game that it is. They just need to get past the usual issues that come with developing a game. And considering the regualr updates I've seen this team roll out, I can say that this won't be one of those cut and run type titles we all have heard about or worse. So know that if you are considering investing in Clockwork Empires you won't be wasting your money.Other than that I'm sure you have already looked at other reviews, pics and vids, and already have a good idea of what kind of game this is. What you may not have gathered is the awesome sense of humor and just the odd otherworldly attitude that this game offers. Which, if its indictive of the story, will just be awesome. Even if your not sure about purchasing it yet, put it in your wish list and keep an eye on it. I have a feeling that this will be a must have game in the near future.			",44,22,0,21,20,0,14

Early Access Review
								I would definately pick up this game when it's finished.In alpha it's a whole pile of heart break. After 30 some odd days and 35+ Settlers the game crashed. No big alpha is alpha, and unlike most games the Devs do actually pay attention to comments and reviews. I just DIED inside after losing such a great colony. If you don't mind some early bugs and balance issues (basically alpha in a nutshell) then give it a go. Just don't expect everything to be perfect just yet.On the subject of bugs, since the Devs read this and respond. I may as well throw down some of the things I've come across after a good day of playing.Bandits EVERYWHERE!I love the bandits, the whole Idea is a great addition, especially those bandit camps full of goodies. But too much! During one very short playthrough I had already fended off some fish folk twice, and bandits 3 times. After I watched the walking tank take out the last of my armed forces I admitted defeat. The the same basic thing happened a few more times. I'll be honest, I did rock some notepad plus in the events folder and tone down the number of bandits. It seemed to help make it a bit more balanced. If I was lazy and let the armed forces do their own thing I would still take casualties, but with some decent planning, a few clutch land mines, and fortifications. I managed to hold the line.KILL THE RICH MAN!Sadly after discovering that the upper class was doing nothing to contribute, and THEN discovering that they were also distracting my workers. I was forced to execute my entire upper class population. I'm sure their are big plans for them but damn they are mighty useless. During a situation where everyone needs to pull their own weight, it was just not appropriate to have them around. I mean come on! This is a frontier colony! What are we going to do with Capitalists and Poets!?No Chair for you!I had to basically make the choice of not building chairs or tables. They basically broke my production chains. The time it would take for every citizen to walk to the food stuffs, and then all the way to whatever random table they decided was good. Compared to the time it would take to huff it to the stock pile and scarf it down right their simply made it worth it to save my wood for other tasks. Hunting Bug Maybe?For whatever reason my citzens would not hunt. Maybe a bug, maybe just that game. But whenever I set them to hunt they would drop their current task and remain idle. If I removed hunting from their tasks, they started working again.I pick things up and put them down!Every once and a while a work crew will decide that the building they are working on requires a dance. They begin to pick up logs, then move them to another stockpile spot and drop them. Then begin the process over again. I've also observed them doing it with planks while assembling modules. Usually the same plank or log. Need an ability to cancel/delete/remove anything. The only real game breaking aspects of the game is the inability to say delete the job to build a refinery that seems to bug, or remove a module that's in the wrong spot. Or tear down a building all together. Remove a stockpile. farm, etc.Remember the game is still in alpha, so if you pick it up. Take some notes and send them over to the devs. The game can only get better that way.			",94,13,0,19,44,0,47

Early Access Review
								A game that puts you in charge of establishing a colony for a steampunk British Empire in a world full of Lovecraftian horrors?  Despite my first thought of ""Mwahahaha! Thank you, Great Cthulhu!  Take my money!,"" I decided to show a little restraint and kept an eye on Clockwork Empires for a while before making another Early Access impulse buy.   At $30.00 I found it rather pricey for an Early Access game as other reviews have commented, but I finally decided to give it a try.  Clockwork Empires is still very much a work in progress, it's features a mix of the impressively well done (production chains function far more smoothly than in games from bigger developers, yes, Tropico franchise, I'm looking at you) and desperatly in need of attention (the Load function appears to be a placeholder and it's just plain ugly).  One thing I found particularly interesting is the colonists personality traits and observing how they influence behavior.  Those with the ""Morbid"" trait, for example, seem more likely to eat ""Long Pork"" (it's people, yes, your colonitsts can engage in cannibalism) even if there is other food available.  Based on the regular update history and developer responsiveness in the forums, I believe that this game will get finished - although it may take some time given the features that haven't been implemented yet - and when it does it will be a great game.  It is most definatley playable in it's current state, which I'd estimate at about 40% if the developer ultimately implements all the features they've hinted at.  A lot of the other 60% is going to be polish.  If you're interested and can afford it, I'd go make the $30.00 investment in supporting developement.  The game as it stands is already capable of providing hours of delightfully twisted fun, but then again I'm the kind of person who laughts while I watch the local wildlife maul my colonists.

												I love city builders, particularly the ones that borrow heavily from Dwarf Fortress, which this certainly does. But wow, this is still Early Access, not a final release by any means. This shouldn't even be like halfway through Early Access yet. Lots and lots of crashes, weird quicks like, I had a colony with 1 person left. They trigger an event saying the colonist is suspicious of their fellow colonists. The other colonists might be members of the occult! All zero of them. Lots of other weird glitches as well as a tech tree with obnoxious progression. Things that ought to be near the base of the tech tree are late game and so on. Play Rimworld instead. Or you know, Dwarf Fortress.			",1071,294,15,173,222,4,256

												Abandoned by the developers. Read about it in the Steam forums for Clockwork Empires. Its a decent game, but its not finished. A lot of missing information you have to research online to figure out. Some bugs. Unknown if modders will be able to get their hands on the code and finish the game.Down voting it because they still have it up at full price. Get it 50% off or more.			",26,5,0,17,13,1,20

Early Access Review
								ALPHA 46 revision review: (TL:DR Still a little buggy, still needs more content/gameplay tweaks, but I like it and feel like I got my money's worth of entertainment)This game is still not done, so please keep this in mind.If you like other, similar games in this genre (e.g. Dwarf Fortress, Banished, Stronghold, SimCity, etc), then you will find gameplay elements in this game to enjoy: stockpiles, resource management, supply chain management, town building, base defense, etc.If you like to play early access games and find bugs or OP stuff to break the gameplay, then you'll have fun doing that in this game.If you like games with a bit of a learning curve before you figure out how to min/max everything, then you'll probably enjoy doing that in this game's alpha state.If you don't like bugs and the occasional crash, then those will annoy you in the game's current state (although it has improved leaps and bounds very quickly, and I can only see it improving even more in the future)If you think the graphics suck, then I can't really help you there.If you get easily frustrated when things don't turn out OK, then this might not be for you.Should you buy it? It depends how disposable 30 bucks is to you. I feel it was worth it, but again, you are basically playing to beta test a game. I, however, find elements of that to be entertaining. Some of you will not. Make sure what kind of person you are before buying. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								So, i'm a fan of city sims and time-management games in that genre. They're really fun, and ridiculously time-consuming. Clockwork Empires is a great addition to my collection of those. It's got a lot of survival aspects, and the game is really customizable in play.First, you've got two- technically four - kinds of settlers - which, i'd like to point out, are all unique; i've never run into two settlers that look EXACTLY alike. There's always some little difference, at the least. Anyhow, a total of four types, technically. Really there are two: Overseers and Laborers. Overseers are further divided into three types: Regular, Skilled, and NCOs (Sergeants). Regular overseers have no special skills, and most starting options just have these. They're useful overall, and the majority type of overseer you'll get, so yeah. Then Skilled overseers start with one or more skills that are higher than the others. NCOs (Or Sergeants) come prepared to be soldiers. You normally only get one when you start the game. Otherwise, you need to make a barracks and assign a regular work crew to it; eventually that overseer will be skilled enough to be called a Sergeant.Each settler - overseer or laborer - also has traits. Characteristics which make them unique - and they really are unique. Some traits are beneficial, others can be detrimental. But it helps you figure out who would be best working in what job, which is really nice. Say an overseer wants to be a farmer, or is a pioneer (Like working outdoors). Then you'd assign them to be a farmer. If they like doing paperwork, assign them to the diplomatic office or make them a scientist. It really helps give you a way to streamline and enchance production capabilities. Laborer's also have traits, but they rarely make an impact; laborer productivity is mostly determined by overseer productivity.Your best strategy is making sure your overseers are comfortable - but you've still got to take care of everyone, or you'll have people going on strike, cults forming, and/or people killing each other. Early game can be difficult, but once you've got enoug farms to support yourself, it's fairly easy to just keep upgrading your support base to slowly accomodate more and more people.Once their basic needs are taken care of, you've got to focus on comfort, and focus hard. Services like churches, pubs, and fancy foods make everybody happy, and both workshops and homes need to be properly decorated. Otherwise, your workers and overseers will slowly get angrier and angrier. Eventually, they'll come to work less often, and for less hours. Then, if it gets worse, or just doesn't improve, they'll eventually just stop working. It can sometimes be ferociously annoying, but the dynamic of it is just fantastic. And yes, it can be counteracted; eventually, they'll get it out of their system, and come back to work. It'll repeat all over again if nothing changes, though.Combat in the game can be...frustrating, at times. Only your NCOs and laborers assigned to their squads will ever fight. Otherwise, your people just run away as fast as possible - which is often equal to the speed at which they're being chased. Then they stop to find direction, and take damage. And the process repeats. So it can sometimes get frustrating, especially if your NCO has been killed, or you don't have a barracks, or such like that. But otherwise, it is fairly nice; though your troops wil ldie easily against Obeliskians. Just saying. I'd advise using at least 2-3 squads per group of them.Overall, the game is amazing. It's not quite gotten finished yet; there are still bugs, crashes, and some lag problems to be addressed. But overall, the quality of the game is that of a finished product; it could just be polished and refined to make it an even better finished product. If you're looking for something well done, and you don't mind the occasional crash, i'd recommend Clockwork Empires.			",166,23,2,61,62,0,95

												As much as I liked this game when I got it, there is stuff that needs MASSIVE tweaking now (stuff they tweaked to make it better and failed miserably). You cannot choose how you want to embark anymore, they make the choice for you with where you choose to embark. Not something I like. Now you don't get an NCO at all but have to build barraks and lose one of your overseers to do it. You don't get a decent number of laborers to start with regardless of how you start. The crops are per area and don't grow fast enough. There are fewer choices now.You get attacked early. I got attacked by bandits and fish people at the same time lost 75% of my colony. I went back to a previous save and tried to make sure I had enough people to fight. I still lost most of my colony. I went back to an even earlier save. Then I gave up. Currently my game stalls. It just stopped in the middle of play and will take 3-5 minutes to come back. The toons will move a few feet and stall again. They really should have delayed the release until things were worked out. Right now, I cannot recommend this to others. Unless by some miracle someone comes up with a trainer to get past the crap.I haven't played in a few days. I'm too frustrated. I went back to playing WoW because that frustration is easier to deal with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This should have been the perfect colony building game. The concept was genius, the setting brilliantly unique.What we got throughout was a buggy nightmare with half implemented ideas that were a shadow of what the Devs had in mind. I can only assume that the sales weren't as good as they had hoped for and it was better to call it a day than bring it up to its full potential. It was released from Early Access half finished and much more shallow than anticipated.Of all the Early Access 'coulda beens' this was the one that I am most dissapointed it did not make it. Alas.** Edit Review** - My assumptions seem to have been correct. The Developer has essentially exploded with all the major players in the development no longer working for Gaslamp Games almost immediately after the hash of version 1.0 and release. Tragic, dumped out of Early Access way short of expectations.			",41,10,3,10,34,2,33

												Needed a few more updates to be ready (especially since the last couple of patches post-release introduced bugs that make the game unplayable for some and a lot of the late game content is very buggy), but it appears Gaslamp is no more.Damn shame, it was shaping up to be a great niche game, but it seems like in the end a lot of design and business decisions didn't work out.Can't say I'm too pleased with the absolute lack of communication though. The company seems to have gone under without a word, after actually announcing that they were working on another patch months ago, which is disappointing considering their track record up until this point where they'd been very open about their goals and development process.

												Buyer beware, not worth the money. The state of this game will serve as proof that it's developers were likely more interested in profiting off this over-priced unfinished science project through release date hype rather than actually finishing the game. I purchased this back when it was in early access and I regret it now. I will grant that this game has come a long way since my original purchase. It was unplayable when I first bought it, however, this game still crashes and it suffers from what I would consider to be a host of design and development flaws. There seems to be no real focus on what they were trying to develop. The UI and control scheme is clunky and unplesant. The resource chain makes no sense. This game feels like the developers just wanted to try and develop a bunch of sim/management game features and this is the end result.Every time I attempt to play this game my game essentially ends right around the time I need glass, because sand is virtually impossible to find and its pretty much essential for progressing into later stages of the game. From material I have read from the people developing this game, they seem to be masking a disinterest in finishing this game behind the guise that ""this is how its supposed to be."" I have read blog posts about problems they seem to be aware are in the game (Including the sand thing) but years later those problems still exist in the game, further adding to my suspsion that this waste of money had no direction, and just benefited off the stupidity of people willing to pay for an unfinished early access game. The idea of a lovecraftian horror element twisted into a simulation/management game sounds like a cool idea, unfortunately this is a terrible manifestation of it. Shame on you developers for charging so much for this trash, I will be boycotting whatever garbage you continue to produce.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Followed this game for a while (pre release) and really loved it.

Early Access Review
								This game is smashing fun and a tasty treat if I may say so! Jolly great fun!My first game was like this:I had a food problem until I toggled on hunting on for all work crews, the bison herd of 10 got turned into bloddy bits and eaten raw by the starving hungry people rather fast. Quickly ran out of food and had to provoke a fish people attack by stealing their egg to get extra food in the form of fish person steak. It was a success at the cost of half the colonys brave  people, but the remaining colonists fed well in cannibalistic feasting on their dead fellow colonist so that helped with the food problem. The last 13 people was 40% solders so it might have been possible for me to have had a food industry based on fish people flesh. But sadly the game crashed as I tried to cram 8 beds into a small house. Great fun! Its shaping up to be a tasty treat if I may say so!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is not finished, period. What's one of the most fundamental principles in a colony management game? Logistics. What is essential to logistics? Roads (or equivalent infrastructure). CE, as of it's 'release' build, has no road implementation. It's buggy. It still crashes to desktop with alarming regulairty. It still has significant graphical complaints, terrible AI & pathfinding and what appear to be memory leakages. All of the promise shown in the initial teaser has been binned for the sake of shoving out a '1.0' that is feature incomplete, lacks charm, still has a placeholder UI in many areas. None of the intrigue present in that teaser has made it into the game during it's EA 'journey'. This will be the last time I buy anything in Early Access; it is too easy for a developer to over-promise and♥♥♥♥♥♥away their budget, apparently, and then decide that Official Release is an acceptable emergency button to push for advertising & a new round of purchases when they run out of cash. I expect this game to meet with middling to terrible reviews and burn away whatever goodwill Gaslamp had earned with Dreadmor; such would be a well deserved fate, too.			",19,3,0,7,6,0,15

Clockwork Empires sends players as an agent of the Victorian empire to a new land, to oversee a new colony. As you often will in town-builders, you slowly build up and tech up, working the land and trying to survive while improving your settlement and keeping its residents happy. There’s a touch of The Sims in that, a bit of Dwarf Fortress, with people having their own personalities, interests, and mental state. All of which may be adversely affected by the eldritch powers in this strange land.Gaslamp Games’ take on colonization seems pretty routine on the surface. But once you dig (and unearth mysterious artifacts), you’ll find out that things are not quite as they seem.Clockwork Empires is still buggy, and frustrating, but manages to provide something very fun and satisfying for the right kind of player. There are no easy way to play, but perseverance will be rewarded.THE GOOD- Exciting consept- Great graphics- Rich lore- Lots of resources, production chains, & buildings- Has Fish peopleTHE BAD- No grapics settings- Still buggy- AI is frustrating at timesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			",109,25,0,18,59,0,23

												tl;dr Game is majorly under developed. UI + AI sucks, and the whole game is kind of a drag to play tbhGaslamp games made on of my favorite roguelikes in Dungeons of Dreadmore. It was an increadiably rare beast of a game that made a much more accessable and easier game, while keeping all the elements that make roguelikes appealing. Because of this, when it was announced that they would be making a colony simulator game along the lines of Dwarf Fortress, I was excited. Maybe they can take a game that like other roguelikes had been seen as impenatrable to new palyers, and make it accessable, while still maintaining many of the elements that made dwarf fortress compelling.Well, the short answer is no. I bought the game at the first early access release, and while it was bearly a game, I saw where it could go with work. It does not meet any of those areas I felt it could go. Firstly, the games social ""class"" system, which I originally thought was a cool idea, actually takes away from the game. This is because middle class ""overseers"" are the only ones that can actively perform tasks, and the lower class ""workers"" are only able to assist in the tasks that the overseer they are assigned to is doing. This ultimatelly means that the lower class citizens feel pointless as without an  overseer they wonder mindlessly around your colony doing nothing, taking up resources and beds. Secondly, the game originally promised a personality and social system, where people could become friends and the traits would perhaps clash with each other. In reality, I have yet to see a single person make a friend or enemy, and the traits by and large are just window dressing. They seem to have next to no actual bearing on the gameplay, bar from a few annoying exceptions that make your colonists just randomly go made for a day, and then go back to normal. It feels tacked on and pointless. There is a happiness system in game where a well decorated work and sleep environment will make people work for longer hours, but again it feels pointless, or just unimportant. All tasks get done, so it just becomes a nuisance that slows down the entire experience for no obvious reason. Thirdly, the whole game feels clunky and unfinished. Whether its the slightly weird looking buildings, to wardrobes going through the floor, to colonists acting more like robots that people, the lack of roads and so many other issues, the game feels like it needed 6 more months or possibly even a year of development before it would actually feel fun. Right now it feels like you fight the UI and AI to get resources for pointless projects that provide no satisfaction. ",168,32,7,35,45,2,61

								The game is unpolished, weird, and highly amusing. In other words, exactly what you'd expect from Gaslamp Games, the company that brought you the wonderful Dungeons of Dredmor, which was also unpolished and weird in its early days, and highly amusing even today. The dev team has been hard at work and it shows. Each update is a significant improvement to an already enjoyable experience. This one is well worth your time and money.			",83,58,0,30,31,2,47

High levels of jank and a long slog at the beginning, similiar to gnomoria or towns.

Early Access Review
								Great promise, would reccomend down the line. However the only reason I play it is to help contribute to that progress. It is still barebones.At the moment- No graphic settings- Frequent crashes and freezing (far better than it was)- Very buggy (for example a lot of things will either be unremovable or leave unremovable highlights on the map even after cancelling)- AI is frustrating a lot of the time, even after putting in effort to work it out (which is not explained in game for new players or in a simple format) - Tutorial is far better than it was (still contains occasional bugs and mistakes) and help buttons explain the UI well, but still leaves a lot of the more unique and complex mechanics for you to work out yourself (the interactions between overseers and workers for example)- One speed setting (including a pause feauture), might be an issue for some players.There has been a lot of progress but I cannot enjoy playing it as a game in its condition. From what we have, the final product will hopefully be amazing, as long as they focus on optimisation/quality of life mechanics, aside from all the additional content they are adding at the moment.

								Even in its early form, I love this game. It's incredibly charming, and has a lot of potential. Some of it is a bit clunky right now, but it has improved in a few short weeks from earliest access to the early access release on Steam. Save games are a bit unstable, but a welcome addition. It is shaping up to be a really fun city builder/simulation game, with a dark sense of humor. The genre is really lacking these days, so it is a welcome addition. I don't regret jumping in at earliest access for a moment, which says a lot considering a lot of early access games have been a complete money grabbing bust.			",270,75,10,74,94,1,49

												I bought this game when an RPS article announced that it's out of EA soon. Sadly, I didn’t like what I saw. Yes, the premise is fantastic. But as a management game, I disagree with its paradigms.Say you want to cook food. You build a kitchen. In the kitchen, you can build stoves – those serve as workplaces that can be used by an Overseer and his assigned Labourers.And then you learn you can’t queue production up. At all. At most you can set one product and the number you want (I think there’s a “forever” option as well). But you can’t queue up production at a single workplace within a building. This is especially daunting when you need to manufacture things like furniture and crafting stations – good luck remembering what else you needed when the previous item finishes.Several workplaces are a solution? They are not free, and who knows how workers prioritize between them.It’s unpleasant to manage, and for me that kills a management game. I stopped playing very early as soon as I realized that. Decided not to refund (my fault for not researching the game thoroughly), but still left unsatisfied. Back to Rimworld for me..			",319,162,6,65,79,5,61

I was so excited for a new Dwarf Fortress-alike, I bought the game Day 1.  I had a call while doing the tutorial, came back finished the tutorial, started trying to play for real.Game's not done.  Looks terrible, runs terrible, interface is awful, game is worse than Dwarf Fortress in every way.  Would have refunded it right then and there if I could but I ran over due to stepping away.

								I bought this game when it first came out, and let it sit for a while, and I come back pleasantly surprised!The devs have clearly put a lot of consistent work in, and the game is steadily fulfilling the promises made when the game was announced. I'm happily building my latest colony to greatness (while keeping my colonists from sucumbing to Cultish Influences and [REDACTED]) as we speak.As to the recent negative reviews, one person appears to be in a spat with the devs over 1 (one) mechanic which is at absolute most a minor inconvenience (and indeed is designed to be that way), and the other has so clearly not learned to play or paid attention to the game that I'm shocked they had the confidence to write a review.Clockwork Empires is a great game now, and by playing it now you can invest in an even better game to come!

												I can remember when this game excited me.  So much promise, so many cool ideas, so much to look forward to... and ultimately so much disappointment.  I've been fooling around with it for ages, and have go to say that the 1.0 release is a real letdown.  IT'S NOT READY.As it is though, it's not bad, and if a newcomer tries it out without all of the hopes and expectations that some of us had during Early Access, maybe they'll be just fine and dandy with it all.  That could be you.  If so, go for it.But not for the current price.For the record, I don't recall where I got the game, but I sure as heck didn't pay $26+ for it... and you shouldn't either.  It's not finished, or it sure doesn't feel finished, and given what you get I'd suggest a reasonable price tag would be in the $5-$12 price range.  Anything more and you've overpaid.This needs an in-between rating... maybe a ""Meh"", 5/10.  Depending on the updates and support that the devs give the release, there could be very nice things ahead... but that's one of those ""show me"" situations where I'll have to see it to believe it.  Until then, MEH.			",861,262,40,128,166,13,170

Early Access Review
								I've been playing this game for under a month (a few weeks before it officially went into Beta) and I did a LOT of research before purchasing. I had been looking for a game like this and I'm very meticulous for my research and my pickiness, ask my husband. =P That being said...the video had me hooked...the campy, dark humour with a Lovecraftian tone?! I ended up watching player made video's and decided, despite the higher price, I NEEDED this game. No regrets. Bugs and all I love it! The Dev team is constantly working on things...even on the weekends...and with colds. I've gone through a slew of patches with them. I'm doing the experimental patches, to hopefully help catch some of the bugs. These guys are working their tail feather off, and I think they are getting unjust reviews here. Hence, me reviewing...which this is my first game review, that's how much I am loving this game. The community on their official site forum are really awesome folks, haven't run across a ""troll"". A bit of teasing on my lack of lingo, but I'm okay with that, heck I expect that. It is all in good fun. One of the things I did notice on reviews was ""slow"" pace or the need to speed up the in-game time. I don't think that would work...it is, afterall, a Time Management game. You have to actually play the game, set the tasks, don't over assign so the poor little colonists just get all bottlenecked and confused. I have no patience, again ask the husband, but this game has my focus. I did step away for a bit and didn't pause, came back and well it wasn't pretty...bandits and fish people attacking and slowly eating my people. One by one. It was funny to watch. Yes, I'm twisted. Why this game appeals to me so much. Another thing, it is early access, still. Which means you will have to restart, there will be bugs...big company games release full games with more bugs than this one has now...For me it was well worth the price. Oh another really cool thing with all the restarting I've done...not one single game was the same. Not even remotely. It's a mystery bag full of twisted fun. I highly recommend this game for those that like a good challenge, are willing to work with the issues knowing they are being fixed as FAST as the Dev's can and are a bit twisted...liking and/or loving Lovecraft is just a really awesome perk.

												Quite like towns.... minus the developer cheating you out of your hard earned cash and then pretty much telling you to ♥♥♥♥ off.... These guys are currently doing it right and in the two updates since I have started playing they have been more than helpful and acceptive of the players feedback. This game is more than just a Towns ""Clone."" With actual animated combat and a much more diverse set of things that can go wrong. The game revolves around you expanding for the Queen. Dropped off from the airship into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you must begin making your mark on the world. There are dangers all over the world from fishpeople and bandits to forgein empires. Building is quite gratifying and when your troops hold off a raid of enemies it does give a smile. Then if your people are hungry they can have a few Manwiches and get back to work. If you are on the fence continue waiting. If you wish to support Gaslamp then HOP RIGHT IN! Help shape this game to be the dark humorous experience that it will be.Update 12/09/15 This game continues to impress me with awesome updates that just continue to get better and better.Update 03/19/17 This game is in a playable state. The developers cut their goals quite short and haven't even patched the bugs created from the final version. Sad, I had great hope for this game and the things they had planned for development. In the end I find myself mixed on it. It is a good game albeit a bit buggy at times.			",92,12,0,29,23,0,24

												I was so hyped up for this game when I found out about it so I grabbed it when it hit early access and enjoyed it despited the many bugs and crashes it had.Sadly It still crashes sometimes and many of the bugs from the early access are still there.also it has lots of micromangement to a unneeded level such as rallying your troops over and over again to then same place to get them there.Alot of this stuff could be fixed and I feel the could be room for so much expansion like the occult stuff it would be cool to have your guys set up an occult church.But as the game is  now there doesnt feel like there's enough and with all the micromanagement thats needed it's hard to just look at your village and say that everything is working smoothly.I'll probably still play it but I can recommend it as it is sadly.maybe if they continue to work on it I will.

								Been playing this all through Early Access and feel like I've barely scratched the surface of Clockwork Empires and can't wait for the release and any future updates! The setting is right up my street, I love how the colonists are built up with their traits and memories. It's lovecraftian, it can be funny, it's engaging and building up a settlement while navigating the events that crop up along the way is great, there's always several things you want to do and it's your choice what you act on with the accompanying results yours to own!The developers have been great with patches and support and Clockwork Empires has flourished in Early Access.

												I want to be able to recommend this - the initial idea was excellent, but the end product (at least out of early access, GLG do have a strong history of post-launch support with Dungeons of Dredmor, so I'll update this if things change) is pleasant enough, but lacking in depth. Just about everything has been done better elsewhere. You have no real motivation to give a particular damn about individual colonists.If you're looking for a colony simulator where anything and everything can go wrong for all sorts of bizarre reasons, Rimworld is still a better choice here in my opinion, and has far superior moddability, workshop support, depth and sense of ""individuality"" of your colonists. It's also only asking for $3 more than this.Tentative ""yes"" on sale, would not recommend at full price unless further patches add a lot more content.			",302,84,2,123,90,4,117

												I followed the development of this, and bought on launch day.  Sadly it runs badly on my machine, the UI is unresponsive and lacking standard things like edge scrolling with the mouse.The game's graphics look like they need another round of refinement.  Graphics aren't the most important part of a game, but if I am going to stare at a screen for 10+ hours, it should look better than this.			",140,48,0,44,19,1,73

Early Access Review
								(I've bought this game on May 4th 2016 and it is September 9th 2016 at the time of writing this.)During these 4 months I've had a couple of enjoying runs with the game. Some features are being added and development is moving at a normal pace I think.Even after 85 hours with this game unfortunately I cannot recommend it at this point.Even though there have been multiple stable patches and fixes in these 4 months, some basic game-breaking bugs are still there. As a developer I'm not very encouraged by the fact that these game-breaking bugs are simply not addressed. Like for example the Stockpile bug - delete any stockpile and the game immediately crashes.And even though it was fun to progress on each separate run (even before the 2X speed setting), it got to a point that I'm simply too frustrated. I spend 4-5 hours to build a good colony with a good balance and then things start breaking down around me. Why? Because a certain building simply stopped working: the sims are there, the materials are there, modules and everything are fine, but it simply stopped working. Now you have to demolish a building and re-build it. Then something else breaks down. Then an important item is bugged and cannot be produced no matter what, so you can't progress after that. Rinse and repeat.So even though the concept, graphics and overall gameplay are nice, I'm just too tired of starting game after game just to hit an impassable wall caused by bugs.If the game ever comes out of Early Access - consider buying this, but until then get Rim World.

								It's acutually quite fun, allthough the glitches are everywhere and half of the game are placeholders, plus the optimization is quite awful. But seeing that this game is in Earliest early access and isn't ANYWHERE close to finished development, i'll let it stand. Maybe it shouldn't have been put on steam this early seeing as it crashes every 10 - 15 minutes but the game is still quite enjoyable and is only going to get better once the bugs are fixed and a menu screen is added.

								Game is in Alpha but playable for me. I do the experimental build. I had a few issues with bugs but the Devs are quick to respond and that's what Alpha is all about. Also the updates seem to pack a lot of new stuff in which is great I can see progress is being made. I do not reget buying in Alpha, it is a ton of fun and the bugs don't take much away from it. I do wish when your colony got big there was less lag when you get in colonists the game does slow down quite a bit but still playable. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a sim/city builder with a different story line.			",18,44,0,53,17,0,20

												This is a fun, unique little game, until you hit the mid-late game where fustration sets in and never goes away. I have waited patiently for a fix to come out, but the studio seems to have gone quiet. Even their website is incomplete (community portal link does not work). I have the recommended PC specs, but the game starts lagging mid game, and there is nothing you can do to speed it up. Your settlers will just walk in place for a few seconds, then move one tile, walk in place for a few seconds, move another tile, etc. It seems to go in spurts as you will have a dreaded 15 second wait for a couple of minutes, but then the wait usually calms down to 3-6 seconds of waiting between tile movement. Overall, it is a fun game, until you get besieged by the lag. I can only recommend buying this game if it goes on sale for $5.  ",3,2,0,6,8,0,6

Early Access Review
								For the bugs in the game, it is alpha, ignoring those and unfinished features.  I have played on the experimental and main braches.   (50D and 50F)First off, the price is a bit high for an early release, however I think in some ways they make up for it by their working on it.  Several releases come out a month, and not just little tiny patches to fix bugs.  Ofcourse this means they have more bugs, but it also means they will finish faster.The game has a lot of promise and with the development speed I believe they may meet the promise head on.Right now the game is a bit bugy, a bit slow (both in game play and things like save/load).  The later could be solved by using binary files instead of zip, the game play could be fixed by imposing traditional 14 hour work days of the time period (they stand around a lot, lazy freaks).  :-).I have to say the content between 50D and 50F are significant enough that I believe the content in the end of times will be massive.  Who knows maybe I can start building duragibles for my soldiers to fly around and attack those fishy freaks that keep bringing me caviar.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Played it for about 30 minutes and it crashed 4 times...so...maybe not.I don't really want to give this a negative review, but being as it was taken off of Early Access and they probably will not fix much if they brought it off early I would wait until it is more stable.

								I like the idea of this game; a group of colonists you can micromanage into building a new settlement in a lavish resource filled world, but watch out for the bandits and fishpeople. This game has a lot of great potential, as far as strategy sandbox games go. But just when you think you're getting into it, it crashes, and it happens a lot. There is still a long way to go before it reaches the final product stage but it may have a lot of potential. Rev33 gets a 5/10. Playable, not worth the full ticket price.			",37,35,2,19,33,1,14

The core gameplay design has steadily gone downhill over the years, in my opinion, bordering on pure tedium at the expense of fun. Numerous bugs, glitches, crashes, and UI problems are also still present in the latest 'release' version of the game, many of which have been around since the earliest days of early access.Someday this may become an amazing product worthy of your time and money, but that day is not today.

												When game developers thinks their game has been build enough to go from early alpha to Full release you would think that it's because the game is full on developed and no longer has any problems. This is not the case. Not when we are talking Clockwork Empires. The game is very interesting and brings a lot of interesting mechanics that I really like, but the game is far from Full on release. And it's a pity to call it full on released. The game feels like it lacks a bunch of stuff, it crashes A LOT, the AI is not fully developed and some mechanics is not working like they should. In my video I'll try an anwser if this game is worth your penny

												I enjoy this game quite a bit.It scratches that colony/city-building itch quite thoroughly for me, and each playthrough turns out completley different depending on what the game throws at you.Think Dwarf Fortress and Banished,  except with an easier learning curve.Its kinda how they used Dungeons of Dredmor to ease people into the roguelike genre.The UI and layout takes a little getting used to, and even with all the helpful tooltips and tutorials, theres still a handful of things that aren't immediatley given or explained to someone new to the game, which may be a little frustrating at first, but you get more and more of those ""Aha!"" moments as you continue to play and watch your little colony burst into flames and the colonists begin to literally eat each other.Its extremlely satisfying.Having seen this game go from what it was to what it is now has been quite an adventure, and i'm looking forward to another 100+ hours.

Early Access Review
								This game has problems. I hate to start with that, but I must, because as of now (32B) it is buggy, sometimes broken and incomplete. That said, this is EARLY ACCESS, so it should not be complete right now. If they were to sell it as a full game in it's current state, it would suck, but that is not what it is. As early access, it is great. It has some fantastic ideas, great art style, and tons more on the way. The devs are also fantastic, everything they do, they post, and are quite open with how the development process is going. If you are curious you can go check it out at gaslamp games.com. They are supportive of the fans and, more importantly for early access, take ideas into acount and try to make the game better. As of now, it is fun, but broken, once it is fixed and complete, this could be a great game. I am talking three number hour counts. Once you figure out the game ( not much of a tutorial right now) it is hard, but not unfair. It does not bash you over the head with random sudden problems and go ""deal with it"" like other colony sims. ( I am looking at you, tropico tornado). If there is a problem, it is either a known one that you can prepare for to stop it, or, you just did not keep an eye on the cultists. Building is also great, because you can build you building how you like, and decorate them how you like, so you don't have the good old thirty identical houses thing. It's great fun, and looks to be better once it is done. Also don't let my low hours fool you, I got earliest access, so played that, and also steam is doing weird things as far as keeping track of hours goes. Also when you people get hungry, they don't just die, they resort to cannabalism. how many other games do that? and fishpeople, giant beetles, cultists, eldritch horrors, poets, drugs, alcaholism.......

												TL;DR  Don't buy this if you are coming from their main site and see the promise: Linux support coming soon.One of the few I have regretted getting in early access. Worked fine under wine with the windows version, and on the Steam page at the time Linux was supported. Okay, give it a try.Played the game, had tons of fun. Figured this would be one of my favorite.  Soon after buying it, Steam no longer works with wine, so had to wait for the official support. Okay, pretty patient.Almost two years later, After numerous promises ""we are working on it"" with sparse updates on the thread, it no longer looks like support is serious. Instead of just telling us we are working on it, why not just admit, we paid for a game we will never get to play again?Was fun while it lasted, but really, why drag it out and lead us on?  I get the idea deadlines are more important than bug fixes, that promises aren't important. We say what you want to hear type.  The promised support was ""almost got it, just a few bugs"", ""need log files"", test this... then absolutely no communication except to respond to ""Are we still doing this?"" with ""will work on it after release.""Has been released.  Thread abandoned.  Finally had to give up hope.  I like the idea behind this enough that I probably will keep seeing it in my games list and checking for Linux support. I won't be able to help myself.  It won't be too often though.			",79,50,0,9,9,0,11

								It's a great game, it's rather slow and methodical but it has a ton of charm and getting a big colony going is really satisfying.  It's been in early access a while, but the developers are great and make frequent updates with at least one major update every month.  This isn't their first game, so you can trust they won't abandon this.Thirty dollars is pretty steep for the game in its current form, but soon it will have enough content to be worth that and more.

												This game would be easier to fix if it hadn't declared that this was a 1.0 release. As is, imagine Dwarf Fortress, but instead of being frustrating in a fun way, being frustrating.The Good-The lore is actually pretty fun, and I wish there was more of it instead of this game.The Bad-Welcome to a menu system evidently created by those who dealt in the so-called alien geometries-Your colonists have a very ""if I feel like it"" approach to tasks, which makes production borderline impossible-Despite the Lovecraftian influence, this lacks two major factors: real stakes and any sense of real fear or despair. A well regulated colony can deal with foreign invasion or eldritch attacks incredibly easily in the early game, and the fishmen pose no real theats to a well regulated milita.-The jobs menu is as obtuse as humanly possibletl;dr don't buy this game until stuff shifts because at this point it's not a finished game in any sense of the word			",104,13,0,18,15,1,20

								Really not yet (at least as of 18 August 2014).  Really not for this price.Gameplay is very similar to Towns.  You have the same basic DF-lite build-your-production-engine-even-though-you-don't-directly-control-anyone kind of experience.  There are what appear to be enhancements to the Towns model in the social class system and the work crew composition, as well as an interesting improvement in the way buildings can be customized and extended.  There's no third dimension, which may prove to be a terrible mistake or may prove to be a brilliant simplification.  There's also no documentation or tutorial, so you're sort of left to figure out what all of this stuff actually means yourself.  It's also sluggish and prone to crashes, the UI's full of TBDs, and you can't save your game.  The style is engaging, the artwork is promising, the gameplay seems like it will eventually be tunable into something both fun and challenging.  It's worth keeping your eye on this game.  But it really only works sometimes, if you don't look at it too hard.  And it's not a real game yet.You can't blame them for turning to the Early Access model.  I mean, that's money you don't have to pay back after you ship, why wouldn't you do that if you could?  But the 30 dollar price point's going to generate a lot of buyers' remorse.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Initial thoughts on this game are its clunky, slightly buggy with certain tasks like leveling/flattening the ground where one guy would come and level it, and a guy next to him would come and level it again which made it unlevel so the other guy was like F YOU and he levels again, and it was a constant leveling battle to see who would last the longest. Neither of them got tired and I imagine they both had the will power to do it forever if they had to.The gameplay part of the game is ok, but it all just feels clunky and not polished, its slow progress, hard to understand whats going on at first. They need to work on that. Can I recommend it now? Yeah probably but only if you are able to look past bad animations, clunky buildings, odd task assigning, and such. It works, but in a not very efficient way.			",120,19,5,22,62,0,19

												UPDATEIgnore this game. Dev team seems to break up and abandoned it. Move along, son.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a message for the developers of this game.GAME IS NOT YET COMPLETE! I had TONS of fun with it (as you can see from my playtime in just 1+ day) but at a certain point it just becames tedious with all the stupid, basic bugs and glitches.I will change my review to POSITIVE if you guys fix these issues:1. As usual with every unpolished 'Dwarf Fortress' concept game : some of the workes WILL NOT carry out some of your orders.2. A glitch where if you try to put some modules, sometimes it'll not register to the work queue BUT the module blueprint will be VISIBLE and CAN'T BE DELETED. I wanted to place some chairs in the barber and it didn't register. It just leaves a un-deleteable blueprint of chairs, which is ugly.3. Game crashes when there's too much going on - game is CLEARLY UNOPTIMIZED. Once I experienced a multi-event where my colony is invaded by LOTS of SOLDIERS, attacked by a HORDE of fishmen spawned by CULTISTS, having four steam knights arrive from the empire AND help from some additional empire soldiers. When all of them spawned, the game crashes to desktop. I've reloaded my save, same thing happened. I've tried several times and finally the game gets past the crash.4. UI flow not smooth enough. A lot of unneccesary clicking to exit windows, etc.5. Glitches, glitches, glitches. Items dissapearing, peeps not doing work, NCO sent to investigate air crash didn't do so and the work queue just goes crazy because of that.FINISH YOUR DAMN GAME. IT'S AN OVERWHELMINGLY FUN GAME AND IT DIDN""T DESERVE THIS KIND OF RELEASE			",41,7,0,16,19,0,21

								For an early access game this is very fun to play!!Yup it has some bugs - but it has Developers working on them - no really they even read the forums!!!Yup it isn't finished yet - granted if it keeps its pace it will be Freaking Fantastic!!Pros: This Game has active dev cycle with player inputThis Game has active players and dev working together - Likely to be vaporware is less then a few of the other games I payed for :)Clockwork Empires is a fun twist on small city building with cults :) cannot wait for this to happen in game!Cons:Costs a lot for a alpha - so don't buy it - wait and see if you would like it when completedIt does crash - and sometimes gets buggy - report it - they read and state where that bug is in the fix listUses a ton of resources on the computer - again i heard they are fixing this issue.. Side note - if you find a bug - avoid it - and report it - sounds crazy right - but I play alphas to give input and help to make a game better - assuming dev listens to me - AND they do!! (the developers i work with in RL listen less to bugs that are reported)Sum it up - Fun Fun Fun - did i mention cults??Great Dev interactions - better graphics then most alphas!! Still buggy and crashy - which no one is saying it isn't this way - yay the pain of alphas :)			",66,9,0,12,38,0,47

												The core gameplay is fun and entertaining, but unfortunately the current bugs, lags and frequent crashes outweight the joy that this game provides.As of now, the development of the game is halted and devs are silent. Because of this i cannot recommend this game. Especially not at that price!It's a real shame. A game that had a lot of potential ends up like this.			",56,5,0,10,16,0,9

								Game definitely isn't finished but the updates have been getting exponentially better. These past few updates have made the game worth playing and if you're the kind of person with some patience for bugs I would definitely recommend it. Things worth knowing:- It feels like there is enough content to get a good story going but the lack of a fast forward feature means it takes a while to get moving-There's a lack of building/module descriptions so be ready to look at the wiki every once in a while-The devs have a great sense of humor and make significant updates regularly-I've only had a couple of crashes and no game breaking bugs since last update and the autosaving keeps me from ever losing much progress.

												I read about Clockwork Empires oh so long ago in some PC games magazine on a flight to Las Vegas. The article interested me so much that I sought out the game and purchased it as an early access game.I know early access is full of glitches so I waited and waited and waited and waited and waited for the CE to be declared complete. Wow was I disappointed when I opened the game up and saw that the same bugs, glitches, and EXTREME LAG were still present from the early access.What have the devs been doing this entire time? The game is lags so much that it is unplayable. As of now, I would NOT RECOMMEND this game. However, I still have hope that one day prior to the apocalypse Clockwork Empires will be playable.

Gone, the features that were promised in earlier versions? implemented with more proimises on the way. The Gameplay soundtrack that i enjoyed last time i played? Tweaked to make it better! In short the game has made alot of progress since its debut, and theres still more to go. If Early access games should take inspiration from anywhere this is it.

								Controls are clunky and menus still need a lot of work, but the game is actually shaping up to be great in comparison to a certain other that I pre-ordered (Folk Tale), which abandoned most of its ambitions. This game had a small release and barely anyone knew it was for pre-access and guess what, it was the right thing to do: it was atrocious when I bought it (I was one of the first), but it's molding to be a feat of a game.

Early Access Review
								Strongly suggest to anyone that enjoys world building city building colony managing simulation style games. This is definitely a slight twist of those genres but it is addicting.Keep in mind too after reading some negatives- there are bugs in this game sometimes, they patch them quickly and new bugs arise sometimes. This game is extremely complex compared to others of its type. You would be amazed with the character depth on this game. But people saying things STOP WORKING or WONT BE FED , they are not playing the game correctly. Keeping happiness in your colony is EXTREMELY hard and takes a while to figure out. When your colony is unhappy they will not work, thus it truly makes it feel like the game is way buggier than it is. There are a few crashes here and there, I am not denying that. But people going into despair or anger is the biggest cause of negative reviews on this game. I assure you of that. If you keep peoples happiness high (which you wont do for a few runs at the game) you will succeed in building a colony and having it last. If you dont however, they stop working, cults arise, fish people attack, people die, people starve (because your kitchen wont cook, your foragers wont forage and your hunters wont hunt obviously)Its a very challenging game, there is a lot more to it than meets the eye. It is very in depth. I have 111 hours on it and I still go ""OHHHHH"" all the time.**** My review really does not change from EA to post release. I wish there was a bit more late game content, there gets to a point where you kind of feel like there is no reason to keep a colony alive, since the early struggles are the bulk of the challenge. So towards the end of games when you are like ""well I dont really have much left to do"" I liked to build a couple steam knights, and just insult every other faction and have them attack me, kinda made it seem like I had something going on. Dont get me wrong, by the time you get to feeling like I stated above, you will have played enough to get your moneys worth EASILY (unless you are a typical steam cheap♥♥♥♥♥who thinks if you pay more than 3 cents an hour with a game you buy that you got robbed and the game is automatically worth a negative) the late game content is never an issue though in the first 50-75 hours of play, you wont get much late game in 50 hours in this game, its gonna take you 15 hours to have figured out how to start a game and get the stuff you need up and running before day 20 - itll seem impossible but you need to figure out how to have a church by day 20... It will take you 50-75 days on your first run if you keep everyone alive that long, its hard. Also, this game still doesnt have as many bugs as people make it sound, people still are posting negatives about colonists not being fed etc etc, its not a bug... You have to put decor inside the homes and workplaces to keep people happy, you have to feed them nicer quality of food to keep them happy, you have to make sure they have a place to sleep to keep them happy, and if you dont the game is going to feel broken because the carpenters wont cut wood the builders wont build the miners wont mine the farmers wont farm and the cooks wont cook. This game is far less buggier than people give it credit, I havent had a crash since it released (people have had crashes, I personally have not) and also, this game is a 3d game, there is to my knowledge no other game of this genre that is in 3d? (I know there are games probably in this genre that are 3d, but I cant think of one with an open map, tasks assigned like this, just a rimworld/DF style colony builder where it is in 3d, which as you know rimworld will bog down a bit when you have a bunch of colonists, so this game isnt going to run like rimworld obviously, it runs a bit slower and at times can be clunky in the late game) I'd urge people to give it a chance, just look through the reviews and note the one thing you see with almost every review whether positive or negative, they all put 20+ hours into the game (and usually 40 or 50+)... They all liked it to play that much- you'll get enjoyment out of this game, it is really unique and thats why, youll have your frustrations, but youll get your moneys worth when buying this game if you are on the fence about buying it, if you like the genre youll like this game. Just make sure to put some rugs into your homes and workplaces :) And it will take a couple play throughs and failures to have a good long playthrough where you dont die, there is a learning curve to it.Take care			",2,2,0,0,17,0,5

								This is one of those times where Steam needs a ""Mehhhh?"" thumbs rating.Bear in mind that this game is still in Beta so things are always likely to be changed from when this review was written.This is a really good idea for a game, it has a solid idea and is something I'd really enjoy playing, so why am I not recommending it?Firstly, this game is super slow, not just gameplay wise (I don't personally mind that so much), but the game just chugs. The fact that there are no options to either reduce graphics or gamemap to potentially speed up gameplay is a real downside to the game. The other problem is that the recommended processor doesn’t give the actual speed, just a processor; I’m not a computer whiz so saying “Intel i5 Processor or Equivalent” really means nothing to me, so I don’t know if the problem ultimately is my game or my PC.Secondly, the game is just too hard, and not in the good challenging way. My colonists are getting super upset because I can’t provide proper food, because I can’t build a kitchen fast enough, because bandits keep coming to wreck everything. If the game is going to make it slow to start things up, it should give more leeway before the enemies start making things difficult. I don’t mind having to work to get things up and running, but it is just down right frustrating when I can hardly get things started before bandits come to curbstomp me.Thirdly, the UI/issues commands needs some work. This is probably related to the first point of the game being very slow for me, but trying to drag an area of the map to set commands, before clicking to do something like “Cut Trees” is far more frustrating than it needs to be. Either the drag box doesn’t encompass everything I want or, more often, the command doesn’t process as I have misclicked what seems one pixel away to cancel the command. It’s a nice idea with the radial command wheel, but I think have a simple alternative as well (i.e. being able to select an object in another dialogue box to issue commands) would go a long way to solve this.Another point to briefly mention is that other reviews have mentioned the poor tutorial; it wasn’t great but in all honesty I never really use tutorials, I am a firm believer that a game should be intuitive enough for me to be able to pick it up as I go a long, and this game seemed to do that.However, all criticisms aside, this is a game that has the potential to be really fun. If you’re browsing these reviews and thinking if you should buy it, I’d recommend putting it on your wishlist and following updates. If you’d like to give it a go, wait for a sale to pick it up then, otherwise this is a game to really wait for the devs to patch a few problems.I should stress again that this game is still in Beta, so don’t take this “No” recommendation as a sign to steer clear. If I could I would give this a middle rating.  ",29,15,0,50,67,2,48

 Great Developers. Great Upcoming Game. I've been on and off this game since the time it launched on steam. First impressions were so-so until I saw the level of support they, https://www.gaslampgames.com, were actively giving, which is true to this day. The Lovecraftian aspects of this game are what originally drew me in but the humor, Steampunk, survival and quirkiness I found appreciative of as well. With each colonist having their own memories that affect their behavior which consequently affects their interaction with other colonists, sets the stage for an interesting unique gaming experience.Remember that the game is still Early Access so it is NOT FINISHED. You may experience problems here and there, but the level of support and the playability of the game at this point along with the Lovecraft deserves this thumbs up.			",275,50,1,37,52,1,61

								Cabbage, fishpeople, cults, frontier justice and doomed colonists who have no inkling that mucking around with the Old Ones is not a good idea.  This game has fantastic potential and I have been an avid fangirl since 'earliest access' was made available.  Yes, there are lots of bugs (this is early access!), but the developers are great in fixing issues, actively respond on forums and have a brilliant sense of humour (vitally important in a game such as this!).  This game is well worth supporting.  Every time a new build is loaded, I cannot help but to fire up Clockwork Empires just to see what has been changed and so far, those updates have been coming weekly.

Early Access Review
Day 1.The empire has sent out us and other groups of colonists to remote savage lands. After an uneventful journey, we have arrived by steam-powered airship, in the middle of an untamed and remote jungle, teeming with exotic wilderness and unknown wonders. Our dozen or so colonists muddled around aimlessly, having not thought this far ahead. As an afterthought, supply crates are then dropped from the skies, all of them bursting on impact with the colonists’ heads.Day 2.None of the colonists have recovered from concussion yet. They lie on the ground, conscious but groaning, with fallen barrels of sausages and piles of bricks and timber still strewn on top of them. Some lizards occasionally wander past, chasing the jungle foul. One of the lizards ate Geoffrey’s face.Day 3.Finally, the remaining colonists have recovered and are set to work building a carpentry workshop and dumping Geoffrey in a ditch. They consumed the remaining food. Without any other accommodation, the colonists packed into the workshop, which was little more than a wooden box, and slept in a pile. Samuel Applebottom did not quite fit, but seemed content to sleep in the open doorway.Day 4.With no food remaining, the colonists constructed a makeshift kitchen and a chilli farm. Master Chef Tobias Blunderdash was appointed as the cook, and given the perpetual task to make all of the food from now on, using chillies as the only available ingredient.Day 5.The chilli farm was raided by giant beetles. Without a qualified naturalist among them, the colonists did not know how to respond to these happenings. A few ordinary sized beetles appeared to emanate out from the large beetles. Suddenly the cogs clicked into place in the colonists minds and they sprung into action, stomping on the small beetles with great enthusiasm. The large beetles however, remained a mystery, and were simply allowed to proceed. Once the farm was cleared, the large beetles consumed all of the kitchen’s carefully prepared food, only to suddenly die of food poisoning. It seems Tobias did not have any cooking knowledge whatsoever, but thought he would “wing it”.Day 6.Starving, and with no food remaining, the population began searching for mushrooms in the jungle. Fortunately, this group of settlers was still unaware of the dangers of unknown poisonous mushrooms, and were happy with their free meal. Sally Oldenburt immediately died, but we calmed the remaining colonists by explaining that she died of eating too few of the poisoned mushrooms.Day 7.A group of bandits led by a Ned Kelly impersonator arrived, setting up tents randomly on top of the empty chilli farm. Suddenly noticing that they set up their camp in the middle of our camp, and becoming embarrassed, they offered us a deal – they will leave us alone if we occasionally let them take items from our stockpile. Since we do not have any military yet and literally have no supplies, this was accepted. The bandits were pleased nonetheless, and spent the rest of the day slapping the colonists for amusement.Day 8.Something unspeakably horrible emerged from the swamp on the edge of the campsite. It was vaguely humanoid, but it had the gills of a fish, and it peered at us with dark beady eyes. Dripping with swamp mud, it shambled closer to the shuddering colonists, who were paralysed with fear. The bandits were equipped with firearms, but they were terrible at aiming – accidentally shooting one of the colonists, Clive Baker. He dropped dead, but at the instant which his corpse hit the ground, the fishperson lept forth and devoured it, leaving behind only a clean white skeleton. Incensed by the taste of human flesh, the fishperson let out an urgent gurgling shout, and soon two more fishpeople came bounding in from the jungle swamps. The bandits put up a valiant fight, killing one of the three fishpeople, but they were outmatched. All of the bandits except their armoured leader remained. The bandit leader wore a metal can on his head, which the fishpeople were hitting repeated with clubs. The bandit leader was forced to flee into the jungle – greatly slowed by his injuries and the weight of his helmet - but otherwise safe. We could hear the clanging gradually fade as the attackers followed him far, far away into the distance. We picked up the dead bodies left behind in our camp and processed them into sausages.Day 9.Geoffrey has returned. His former friends greeted him normally, as if nothing had happened. The initial conversations were somewhat awkward, trying to avoid the topic of why they let a lizard eat his face and then left him for dead in a ditch, exposing him to the physical and mental trauma of being abandoned in a supernatural jungle alone for a week. He seemed to take it well. He even invited some of them to go on a picnic, insisting that in particular they should bring “only their fleshy selves” to participate in a special meal and he would do the rest. What a nice fellow, offering to do all the cooking work.Day 10.The colonists have not returned yet, since they left with Geoffrey for a nice picnic in the jungle somewhere. A replacement colonist arrived, a ‘hale and hearty’ obese chap called Reginald Gunderfist. Sensing by smell that there was food to be had, he went out in search of the others. Soon after, he came running back, hysterically screaming at the top of his lungs, “There is no Cog!” He jumped off a cliff overlooking the ocean.THE END……?----Despite the amusing concept, the reasons for negative rating cannot be overlooked:- The game is unfinished and full of bugs. This might change over time but might not, and reviews should not be about what the product might be.- There is no endpoint, apart from repeating on a couple of different biomes.- The full pricing is completely unjustified for what this is.

												TL;DR - Too much needless micro via a UI that could do with some refinement.  (I suspect the tester pool was a bit limited - UI is the kind of thing that's hard to test for since you need to keep pulling new blood in to get their reaction, and eventually you run out of people you trust with your game executables)I've spent 116 minutes staring at this thing, and I'm still not out of the tutorial.  For a start, I managed to pause it near the start without realising and spent five minutes wondering why resource gathering bars were going so slow.  When you don't know what to look for, a bit of darkening round the edges of the screen and a red ""PAUSED"" in the top left corner aren't very helpful.Things started trucking along a bit better once I figured that out, at which point the next issue started to get annoying.  You can set a production to maintain a certain level of stock for produced items, but this is done at the bench level, not the building level.  You can build multiple benches to get round it, but the additional level of micro gets a bit annoying when you have to cancel a stock maintaining build order to produce another decor bench because your only decor bench is keeping your bric a brac levels maintained.  And then you need more room in the building for all these extra benches.Which hits the big one that took my poor little noob self over half an hour to figure out - I expanded a building, and somehow my carpenter overseer got stuck inside the building - a cot was blocking the door, and he and his team were stuck inside.  No ""I can't reach where I want to go"" messages, no warnings the cot was placed to block the door.  Just a seemingly working building with people inside.  (Did I mention it took me a couple of minutes to figure out the door placement requires the blue square on the outside of the building?  I sat there trying along all the walls, rotating it to face the blue square inside, convinced I'd built the building in a position where there were no valid door positions...)At the point I gave up, I had finally figured out that I needed to individually set a build order for every piece of decor.  Looking through build items, I realised this was a recurring theme beyond some basic stuff.  I'd read the message near the start of the tutorial about that, but assumed it meant I didn't have the resources to build more than the basics, not that I'd have to set each thing to be built by hand before it could be placed.Which is where the UI comes in to bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥  Right clicking to centre the camera is even older than right click and hold to scroll and having it as a camera control means you can't right click to cancel out of something.  What kept driving me up the wall was having the tutorial message windows disappear when you click away from them - so you have to memorise the entire sequence of UI commands, or click each step then reopen the tutorial to see the next one.  Sure, it's not a big deal, and it's only going to be annoying the first time before you learn it all...  But that's your new players that are having the issues, the ones you haven't convinced TO stick with it yet.  It's probably also only an issue for those like me who have trouble remembering a long sequence of commands to input into an unfamiliar UI, because you have no mental reference for what you're doing and it just gets tuned out by your poor, overworked brain as a series of ""Find the BUILD button, then find the thing, then click the thing, and do the thing.""* * * * *Enough♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and moaning.  Complaints by themselves are just an annoying whining noise that have very little value.  Addressing my ♥♥♥♥♥ing in order:  Hard to tell game is paused if you don't know what to look for?  PAUSE THE ANIMATIONS.  That was what made it take so long for me to figure it out - everyone was still hitting trees and mining rocks, or standing round being idle.  If nothing had been moving, I'd have clicked a LOT sooner.  Possibly move the PAUSED text to the centre of the screen.So many benches needed!  Have production queues at the building level rather than the bench level, with a priority queue system.  A warning from the building that an order to maintain stock at a particular level has failed would be good - automation that stops automating without telling you is not a good thing.  Reducing the micro management level by automatically adding a build order for an item you have placed somewhere at the production facility that will produce it fastest would be handy.  I realise that stock level control is probably meant to be a big part of the game, but at that level of detail it just gets annoying.  Fast.Dude stuck inside building!  I shouldn't have been able to place a cot that blocked the door.  The dude who was stuck with nowhere to go should have been at least trying to communicate the fact he was stuck to me.  I couldn't find any way to remove or move an item once placed either, so I've got a cot that's great for drunks - need to throw up in the middle of the night?  Just roll over, open the door and vomit outside, without even having to get out of bed!UI horror!  Excessive mouse travel for a start - build buttons down the bottom, finalise/cancel out of build mode up the top...  Mouse edge scrolling would be nice, as would movable windows that remember where they were the next time I open them.  WASD for screen movement is nice, MUCH better than arrow keys and keeps the hand near ESC - probably why the right click is a camera control function rather than a cancel.  I didn't even reach the point where I was comfortable enough with the UI to start using keyboard shortcuts - I really do hope there ARE keyboard shortcuts.			",131,16,3,37,51,2,74

												Unfortunately, gaslamp overstepped themselves. Sad really. Since the last update, communication from GLG seems to have stopped entirely. From what the community has gathered, the company has either been dissolved or gutted with three of it's main people leaving. Even more unfortunately this leaves us, the customers, holding an overpriced and unfinished product. It doesn't look like a case of ""TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN!"" Rather, it seems to be a case of ""WE HAVE THE BUDGET! PUT IT ALL INTO DEVELOPMENT! WAIT! WHERED THE BUDGET GO!?"" Very sad, since GLG had a great deal of integrity, all things considered. They just stretched themselves too thin and aimed too high. Ambition should be tempered with realism, if it isn't, you end up with projects left unfinished with an inability to complete them.And so clockwork empires goes dormant and sinks, yet another unfinished hulk on the seabed of the early access ocean.[OLD REVEIW]See below for developer response. It's not a bad response. In fact it is the kind of friendly response I expect from gaslamp games.I like gaslamp game, and a steampunk dwarf fortress clone is a cool concept, but for 30$? No... I'd rather buy gaslamps other game with its expansions (dungeons of dredmor) for three of my friends. It would cost about the same. The main issue is that Clockwork Empires is a glacial game in which nothing you want to get done, gets done. A friend of mine told me to not assign lots of tasks all at once, but even with one job that needs to be done, it just doesn't get done. The reason for this, as I see it, is the ""work crews"" system. None of your colonists will do anything that another work crew has decided it wants to do. If you want them to cut trees, only one crew will do it while the others sit on their thumbs. Building a workshop? No, not if someone else is doing it. The only place where this system works is in the workshops themselves. The work crews will dutifully attempt to fulfill whatever task you set them within the workshop you have assigned them, BUT they won't usually do anything except work within that workshop and even when they are assigned the workshops they tend to do the tasks you set at a fairly casual pace. Another issue with the work crews is the overseer. Each work crew has one. The overseer is basically the leader of each work crew. Even the military squads have overseers (called COs). Why is this an issue? Well, losing one of your workers to a bandit attack is no big deal, except that it will slow the work crew down a little. Losing the overseer though means that the workcrew is immediatly disbanded, leaving all the workers in that workcrew jobless. Workers who are not in a work crew DO NOT WORK. They don't do a single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing when they are not in a work crew. This is mitigated in military squads by a recent change by the devs which makes military squads automatically assign a new CO when it dies. By the way, you can't create new work crews. You need to wait for overseers to immigrate and then they start new work crews. This game would be fine if it weren't for the work crew crap. If every worker had his or her own will and could do tasks independantly of one another, but they can't. In Dwarf Fortress, losing is fun. In clockwork empires, losing is often tedious and frustraiting. Why? If it weren't for the work crew mechanic, you might actually be able to prevent whatever it is that caused you to lose.The graphics are nice, and the music is appealing. Hell, the controls are way easier than DF or other DF clones. but the workcrew stuff makes Clockwork Empires far too tedious. All the flashy lights, pleasant sounds, and simple controls in the world will not make up for bad gameplay though, and at 30$ you are really better off buying something else. I'll throw this in the bin where I put other massively overpriced games.			",306,56,4,44,28,0,26

Early Access Review
								Not recommending until: Save Features, fixing common crashes, and smarter workers. Remember this is Early Access though.PROS: Great and open developer who is constantly updating both the game and development blog (http://clockworkempires.com/development.html). Playable up to 2 hours before crash. Witty and fun gameplay with indepth economy/crafting system. Game's price will not decrease.CONS: It took me about 9 hours to exhaust the fun of this game. It probably would be a lot less if it didn't crash constantly and had a save feature. The game is a mix between Banished and Sims if you've played those. Combat AI is pretty good but workers fail to properly prioritize and pick up tasks (I.E. letting crops fail, not helping other work crews, etc.). Buildings are easy to place but hard to edit during placement (sometimes crashes on renovation too). Population and supplies mostly come in the form of ""Immigration"" and ""Colonial Ministry"" events that are somewhat random and frustratingly slow at times. Once jobs or objects are ordered, there is no way to edit them. The price won't increase upon release so no harm in waiting until it's better.			",82,4,0,7,19,0,28

								OK , I dont usually  buy  early access games. But I had to try this one the art baited me, the mythos caught me, and the game play reeled me  in. You  play a colony leader you must survive and make firends with or  kill and eat fish people. Wait  what FISH PEOPLE, oh yes  fish people, weird oblisks, strange madness causing items, and wierd black stones. Cultists  bandits and forgieners all want  your power.  Its is challenging and I have to say  addicting  played for  over 12 hours striaght yesterday normally only sims or civ make me do that. The devlopers  are working hard at  this point and every thing I suggested or discussed  was responded to quickly. I look forward to more improvments  and of course those can only continue if people play  and suppotrt  the  game . So come on people  BUY IT , test  the waters, swim around, and spend your boring summer days when it's too hot or too rainy, or you can't sleep cause the old ones will eat you, playin and helping  improve this game. I hope they also  add a help support the game  add a buy your name into the game feature where you can add a name into the colonist random nameing matrix  for $ because I would love to have  people I know  pop into my  colonial world . All in all a great start guys  lets keep up the good work !			",17,15,0,34,41,0,19

Early Access Review
								This early access game is fun and interesting, but there are definitely a few bugs that need to be ironed out before release. Apart from no audio during my first game (restarting fixed this), the actual gameplay seems to work pretty smooth - no gamestopping bugs. The tutorial did an ok job at explaining the basics, but it still needs more explanations on how the game works.However the interface still needs a bit of work, where some buttons simply have no use, and some orders are kind of repetitive. Still, the interface works, and the game is playable already in this state. The biggest problem I found is how little you can see about whats going on in the colony. Colonists are ordered in work teams, but aside from counting them, there's no easy way to find out how many they are. And there's little visual distinction between them apart from their fancy names. This made it hard to figure out who was doing what, and micro-managing becomes extremely tedious. The game is very flavourful, and there's lots to do. It's a hard game that plays quite differently each time. I can't really recommend getting this early access version, but I definitely think the finished game will be worth every penny!

								As you can see, I don't have nearly enough hours logged to give a detailed review.I agree with most of the positive reviews mentioning the dedicated community friendly dev team, the charming writing, and the addictive gameplay. Oh, and the graphics are impressively detailed for a modern colony builder. Here's a little stiuation from a recent game:I had decided to make friends with the local Fish People, because why not? Everything was going along just fine before the Occult Inspector showed up. Turns out they're not too keen on Aquatic Eldritch Abominations, so he whipped out his flame thrower and went to town. One particular flaming fish man walked into the dense woods beside my colony and started a massive forest fire. This in turn woke up a pack of sleeping Ancient Tentacled Stone Constructions known as the Obeliskians, who rampaged through the town until finally getting blown up by my military and exploding my food stockpile (yeah, I keep gunpowder and ammo next to my food, got a problem with that?). Several colonists nearly starved as a result.They of course went a little sideways - renaming their workshops things like The Putrid Fungal Eatery. One of them actually went around examining dead bodies, which made her simultanously happy and desparing. Why? She had a morbid trait.*Things were dicey, but I thought I could recover for the most part. That's when the cultists showed up - a Fish worshipping cult, of course. They spread rapidly, worshipping at their infernal shrine, until my scientist suggested whipping up a ""cure"" for everyone affected. Great! I thought. Turns out I didn't look closely enough at my scientist. He was a cultist too. This cure of his turned out to be a ""fishy potion"" that only accelerated the transformation process and and made things worse. At its core this game is a ""juggling 20 chainsaws at once simulator"". Some may call it micromanagement, but that's a little reductive IMO; it's more about having to decide what you CAN manage, and hoping what you don't doesn't come back as a building sized Obelisk to level your colony.*I once had a criminal with the DOOMED and CRIMINAL traits call for an airdrop of stolen goods. The crate dropped on his head. He called again. Same thing. This happened several times until he finally died.) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								This game is quite enjoyable and I'm sure many have already in other reviews specified the same pro's that I would have included in this review. To say I don't recommend this game isn't implying that this game should never be bought and supported through it's development. As an everyday gamer who expects a finished product, you will end up disappointed. Clockwork Empires is realistically ambitious for what is to come. I will point out the cons of what should be worked on/improved/fixed to create an absolutely fun and intriguing game in the future.  Con's Not optimized well at all so despite an I7 processor and 12 GB of RAM, this game has a low framerate averaging around 30fps. Can't delete the building plans of placed Gabion fortifications. Also can't remove buildings as well once they have been placed and built. I have personally experienced issues with soldiers not always responding to bandit threats near my settlement, I assume this is because they attack and there is no notification deciding what to do with a raiding party of bandits.I've found that the difficulty of fighting opponents isn't too hard as their frequency is either not often enough or the mental stress is has on my settlers is minimal and easily removed with a single bottle of beer. Also this is a preference, having at least two story buildings would vastly help with customizing buildings and developing a more realistic atmosphere to the game.As a development to the previous point, colouring buildings or modifying the actual structure after a building has already been created would help.Once I have over 10 work crews it's painstaking to try and find a specific crew if I wish to view their skills to assign them to a different job. So possibly when the search bar appears to select a crew for a building, there can be a button that will directly view the crew.Despite the low fps and jittering of my fellow settlers, the most brutal experience is waiting for my game to finish saving. A glitch I've noticed is that once a high population has been reached, when people go to bed sometimes they will simply stay standing while sleeping right beside the bed.When the mouse is hovered over the day counter, it will always say ""Day 1"".Conifer tress will appear in the ocean and sand areas. But as a personal message to the developers, I hope this helps in any way. Thank you for the effort you've put into making a Lovecraftian game. I enjoy it very much and can't wait for all the additions you plan on giving the game. ",137,21,1,38,37,0,43

												<1/30/2017 UPDATE POSTED AT BOTTOM>It's Spacebase DF-9, if it were set on a planet with Steampunk humans and occasional lovecraft references (that being said, the developers have proven to be much more involved and caring than Doublefine.) Enjoyable to expand your colony and build things, but the game's pace can be extraordinarily slow. Everyone walks at almost all times, and there's no fast-forward. Everything in this game is an investment of time and patience, which is good-ish in that there's something about it that keeps you interested, but the AI just isn't there yet to ensure that workers actually WORK. They really need to work on optemization, AI, and a bucketload of random events and content. Also the addition of roads, lights, and fences would be nice.Anyway, it's early access, and fairly satisfactory for at least a few hours... And I just realized now while typing this that the price is $30. I'd reccomend this game if you're excited about it, just wait for a sale.6 to 7.5 out of 10 or so.UPDATE: 1/30/2017Well, the game's still very poorly optemized, but it's more functional than before. The work system has been simplified, and many issues with workers simply standing still until they die have been fixed. Work gets done now for the most part, and there's even an option to speed things up to 2x time! On top of that, there's an options menu! I personally wish they would add roads, or optemize the game. The game is very laggy even on a 64-bit SSD with 8 gigs of RAM. Developers, If you ever see this review, know that I like this game but I find the poor performance a sufficient deterrent to keep me from playing the game for an extended period of time.If you really want a number, I'd say 7.5/10, wait for a sale and play on a good gaming computer. If they fix the performance I'd bump it up to an 8/10 at least.PS: I find it hilarious that the game crashed in the pre-game configuration menu while I was AFK. What exactly caused the crash? I don't get it. (It was an out-of-the-blue crash, not a trend.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								 As of now, Clockwork Empires is still alpha and as such is missing a lot of the features one would expect of a game in it's genre. However, each update sees a slew of improvments and features. The game plays out EXTREMELY slow. As a matter of fact it's more of an idle game at this point than anything else. While buildings take forever to build and characters move sluggishly without the much needed addition of more time controls, you are given random events that you must respond to depending on a few factors of your colony such as your prestige. If those don't keep your attention, checking in on your colonists may. Each little person has a full panel where you can check every thing about them including their desires and memories. The latest update gave them ""mood bars"" which includes a gauge of how sane your characters are at any particular time. Keep a close eye on them, and you may even see your little people start a cult bent on what? ... Well nobody real knows. Clockwork Empires is all good fun, really. That is until you watch your entire colony gorge on each other's remains. And then it's just a really morbid good time. 10/10 would sacrifice to Cthulhu again			",19,12,0,20,27,0,5

								Being in very, very early access I was suspicious. This game is incredibly fun, and  I find it exciting to see what the company has layed out for the game's future.I like Sim City and Ceaser 3, so this game is my style. While there is no instruction and some learning is necessary, I find it worthwhile. The art and humour are my two favorite elements so far. At $30.00 Canadian it is insanely expensive for a game that has a long time before being done, but hopefully my 30 bucks will speed that up. I am confident that this title will blow me away.I've played for a few hours already, and love the ""feel"" of the game. The music is really dynamic and fitting. The player will see a farmer start jigging in the field, yet another citizen will be arguing with a soldier about the monarchy. Many interesting elements are going on, and as the beurocrat in charge you only influence the outcome. You do not decide it. My only real concern is how nothing is focused as one scrolls the screen, which irritates my eyes.Mine the metal, make the pipes and weapons. Grow the pumpkin, make the stew. Your followers have different prefernces, histories and political affiliations, which determines what they do more than you.			",5,2,0,3,4,0,2

								Updated 9/19/2016So i sank my teeth into the newest build and let me tell ya im in love with it! they added a 2x button which lets you get past some of the not so eventful parts. The implementation of weapon lockers is brilliant because it frees up more stockpile space instead of having 24 pistols laying aroound(That no one wants or needs) , it also adds a uniformed feel for the military squads. The cult events keep things engaging as a thriving colony can be turned upside down by the pestellence known as occultic heresey and must be purged immediatlely to avoid more damage . (chapels are a must) Still kinda miss the days when your colonists would become cannabals. Everyone likes cannabals. If your on the edge about getting it i personally would recommend it. ive put more than enough time in game and have stuck around though most of the builds ( some were unplayable for me but were fixed) this is by the most stable build ive tried and im far from dissapointed. Keep up the good work Gaslamp Games!			",98,5,0,15,21,0,53

Lovecraft stories lately, so the events in this game are very topical for me.While this game could use more polish, they've spent a lot of time tweaking gameplay to make for a fun experience for their players and it shows. If you check out their dev blog, you can read up on their thought process regarding all the changes they've made. I'm quite impressed and enjoy reading them!If you're a fan of the city-building genre, I highly recommend you give this game a shot. It's a great addition.My colony was going great. I almost had a barber shop! Then a recently formed cult decided it should summon unspeakable eldritch horrors during breakfast! Now everyone is either dead or crippled with fear. 10/10 would have breakfast ruined again.			",105,17,0,12,20,0,18

												EDIT: Had some time to try the game a bit more and I feel people should know that it's glitchy as hell.♥♥♥♥♥♥ pathfinding, unoptimized UI, and poor task assignment clunkiness seem sort of fair with an early access indie type game. But the game crashing and fundamental stockpile problems seem pretty numerous. Alongside with late-game stuttering once you build a large enough population.I had fun roughly 70% of the time.Original Review:It's clunky and relatively bare-bones but it's a fun settlement builder.Good if you want to build a town with production chains, with a lovecraftian/victorian/steampunk twist.Similar to Banished or Planetbase, though on a more ""zoomed in"" scale complete with colonist moods and behaviors. The humor is pretty grand, too.You harvest crap and use it to craft more crap. Your colony grows and you need to fend off hunger, despair, and occasional fishmen incursions.If you've played Spacebase DF-9 before Tim Schafer ran off with the cash, this is basically the steampunk analogue to that.

												I have played this game since it first came out on open alpha release. A lot of people have been writing that this game is unplayable, crashes constantly and has billions of bugs still and that simply isn't true. When I first bought the game years ago, it was impossible to play, but now I can happily spend hours and hours building up my little colony without any issues. There are still a few things to work on, and if you want to help with that I advise you go to the gaslamp forums as they seem to be used a lot more actively than the ones on steam. If you're on the cusp of buying this game and you have the money to spare, I would really recommend it, but don't expect a vast city builder. This game is about micro management and SLOWLY building yourself up, planning so as to keep disturbance down until you have a strong military. It's a clever and unique game, and I love it. Props to the developers!			",26,4,0,13,30,0,3

												the game mechanics are awesome, very interesting indeed, but, it keeps shuting down at any time without previous warning which makes it extremely anoying to play in the end. What a pitty, the idea and general frame of the game is worth much better performance.			",3,3,0,6,16,0,21

Early Access Review
								First of all, I want to say thank you to the developers; and to avoid boring everyone with my praise, I will leave it at this: Clockwork Empires brings me great joy and I constantly look to the gamelapse to see if new content and articles are written.Now to the suggestions:I am not a tech guy, in fact I am taking the BAR soon, so my line of expertise is so far from game development that I wouldn’t dare scrutinize things I cannot understand. Instead, I want to limit my input to conceptual matters based on my love for H.P. and the macabre in general. 1.	RNG: One of the best parts of this game is the RNG, or as I understand it, inability to break the game (not terribly) by exploiting. My main suggestion on this matter is to expand SUBSTANTIALLY is this department.a.	Add more variables to the variables. You are all on the right track, by implementing things like “should we kill the crybaby who doesn’t want to keep the suspicious goods” or “only teach the fishpeople not to damage crops.” However, it seems as though there needs to be more choices and more random occurrences/events within the colony (we can call them pop-ups for now). Even something so, seemingly mundane as “Jon Smith has been harassing Jake Doe by waking Jake up to try and get him to leave the cot. Usually Jon proceeds to harass until Jake gives up the cot in favor of trying to fall asleep on the floor unmolested rather than in a cot being constantly berated.” (Sorry that was a longer description than needed, but I hope you see my point.)b.	We also need more difficulty in the game…I am not entirely sure how or even where to increase the difficulty—but I definitely am NOT suggesting that it become more difficult to gather resources or take longer to turn nodes into bricks. Instead, I mean there should be more difficulty in what events occur. As some others have mentioned, I can currently get way too far in the game without anything bad really happening. Even the Obelisks only killed two of my people before leaving, never to be seen again. It’s not that I feel having a totally random event kill your entire village in a frequent manner is a good idea, but I try to think in terms of the entire premise of H.P. Lovecraft’s mythos and world. This is a world of doom and the never ending struggle against the ancient ones (and more as you all know). It just doesn’t seem like the game is difficult at the moment. As a last point of clarification on this issue, I DO want more difficulty, in part, as a result of RNG; but in a form akin to Call of Cthulhu tabletop games. I suggest that the developers act more like GameMasters of CoC and don’t allow players to go 30 or more days without consequence and little decision making (that likely leads to consequences).P.S.: Yes, this is a copy and paste of my discussion. I did this in hopes of Developers and other players will read it and chime in.			",50,12,0,7,8,0,11

Early Access Review
 Clockwork Empire A fitting title for a game where you build up your own colony.  Introduction Clockwork Empire is a Dwarf Fortress-esque game. The game has been out for a couple of years, it feels like and I've had it for a bit. It's an Early Access title, so it's been worked and refined over the years. When I first played the game, it was dreadfully optimized, buggy to the point of being unplayable, horribly interfaced, and just plain bad. It had potential and, thankfully, it's been reaching for that potential for years. Let's start with the awesome parts of the game: The Music: Clockwork Empire (CE) has an amazing soundtrack. The tones in music really set the stage for an adventure out in the wilderness of unexplored, potentially hostile lands. The little bleets of rustic music during the day while you're watching your pioneers explore and work does well to capture the up-beat feeling of the game. When night time falls, however, the music turns ominous -- foreboding about the future as your settlers sleep in their homes. When the unnatural and unexpected happens, the music fits those themes just as well. The music is iconic and will get stuck in your head. The Setting: The setting is pretty interesting. Set in an alternative universe (or so it seems), you are the mastermind of a batch of settlers. Despite your domain being whatever environment you choose, you have a sense for a larger going-on in the world as events pertaining to your Empire continues on. You get a sense of being just a small cog in the giant Clockwork Empire. Little messages, mini-events and stories that happen reach you as the Mastermind and you get to understand a bit more of the world geo-political stage, but there's always a feeling of not quite being a part of the higher decisions. Ultimately, you're just a manager receiving an inkling from corporate, but you don't know how or why -- you just do as you're told. Environment/Exploration Although not being the most lifelike, the environment is vibrant, with many differing biomes, animals, other factions, and natives. It has this air of the unknown, just as the music sets and the two compliment each other well. The animals look goofy when they move around haphazardly, the ores and other precious resources are just oddly placed most the time, but the colours and the artistic detail make it pretty nice. Overall, not the biggest strength of the game, but it is an interesting part of it. The People/Traits This is part of the game's throw-back towards Lovecraftian writing and experience. Each individual has their own traits, inclinations, preferences, and socialize with one another on different levels. These preferences and aspects of individuals are somewhat fluid and can change for a multitude of reasons (such as a traumatic fishmen raid on the settlement or something). In fact, this also applies to the natives (fishmen), and the local bandits and other colonial factions. It's an interesting mechanic that can be both hilarious and infuriating. Now that we've discuss the good, let's discuss the bad! Gameplay/UI The game is as creative and driven as the player. There are many ways for one to build their community or settlement and many ways to interact with the world around it. However, this relies extremely heavily on the randomization of the world. Since the map is so integral to gameplay, when it is randomized poorly it can really make for a boring or tedious run through the game. Allow me to explain:When the game generates a map, you can pick from an area on that map, a biome or sector. This sector itself is randomized as well. So when you pick an area, it generates the sector you play in and then you may start ordering your people around. However, it seems like most the time you're spending, at least in the early game, revolves around clearing the terrain so you can even get started building your settlement. Raising the land so it is even just takes forever and you'd think settlers would pick a place a little more suitable to start their place. Then you have to cut down a million trees and so on so forth. Sure, this seems like the Dwarf Fortress/Rim World experience, but the amount one has to do it is just inordinate. Then comes the User Interface. The UI started as a clunky, messy, incomplete and broken part of the game that was confusing and difficult to use. That's why I stopped playing the game at first. Upon returning, it has improved immensely. It's now organized and better situated but its position, provides basic information about the building and why it matters. However, the information along the top bar and the clunky feeling of moving around the map detracts from the enjoyment of the game. The save is extraordinarily intrusive and gives a reminder of the poorly designed save-system which holds your entire progress for quite some time.I am a big fan of building things up in these games, but it's been watered down over the years. Before, you had a chance to meet the natives and came onto the land with a soldier for protection (I even remember when there was more than one soldier). Now it feels like the beginning was watered down as an easy solution for the sector randomizer giving the surrounding area around a settlement poor terrain. If the sector around a settlement was better ""picked"" by the settlers, that would have alleviated have to spend most of the early game just setting up for it and doing tedious work. I'm sure others enjoy this boring, slow gameplay, but that just wasn't for me. The AI makes the gameplay infuriating. Even though they've come a long way (they don't stand around and starve themselves to death anymore), the AI still refuses to function at times. Commanding them to do♥♥♥♥♥♥felt very slow before they actually went to work, opting to just stroll around aimlessly. They will also just throw stuff into the stockpile randomly and then another settler will put it in the right place. The AI just place and  then  stack the object. The enemy will make beelines through your soldiers, disregarding the dangers of those soldiers and attack your civilians. Your civilians will then run ten miles away, leading this conga line of soldiers, bandits, and sometimes angry natives until everyone dies. The AI also has huge fits at times, going delirious and killing one another for small slights or minor incidents.  Upcoming Content (Namely Multiplayer) The big draw-in for me regarding this game was its premise and that I'd be able to play it with others if I'd like. However, after two years there hasn't been much in the ways of updates on when big, promised changes will happen. Multiplayer has practically been untouched for months on the development page of the CE website https://clockworkempires.com/. Other functions such as vehicles and, new animal behavior and other such entities also haven't really been added or expanded upon and the Steam release date states Oct. 23 (or something), 2016 to be the release date and these huge aspects haven't really been addressed. Arbitrary Game Limitations The game recently updated to a better world map that a player could choose to play on any point of it. However, recently the developers of the game chose to block off the majority of the new biomes until the player reaches arbitrary numbers (number of population), thus limiting the game for absolutely no reason. If they had chosen to reward achievements with gameplay improving aspects or new things that a player could build  per session  would be much more rewarding than removing content from the player. A serious gameplay blunder; it could only get worse if the developers asked money for this practice. Conclusion The game is okay. It can be fun, and that  can be the most of the time, but really, that fun can be swamped by a challenging UI			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Fun city builder/steampunk/survival game at times, but highly buggy and most things in the game at the time of this writing, alpha 42A, do not work as intended.Given enough time, patience and proper bug fixing this will be a great game. I have yet to play one game that has ran smooth for more than a couple hours. Crashes are frequent, building modules bug out, colonists do random things, items are lost... etc. It's an alpha. Not worth the price tag, catch it on a sale, or if you're a fan of early releases. Great dev team that listens and patches frequently. Current state 5/10Potential 10/10Hope this was helpful.Cheers.

												Game was fun in early access. Then they changed the UI design and I stopped playing as often. Later, I came back and found I could get past that because the devs had stuck with it and kept updating. The game had gotten content rich and felt like it had depth for long sessions. Release struck me as a surprise because at the time I remembering thinking the game needed another year (at least) in the oven. Since then, nothing. Game had been abandoned and left to die as a failed project. It was fun, I wish they that stuck with it. I feel the niche this game was made for needs more quality games. Stay away. Gaslamp is done and not a word of apology. Abandoned :(			",86,22,0,11,12,0,26

								What is Clockwork Empires?It's really in the RTS category, in my opinion.You're managing resources of labor, materials, and leadership.Managing also includes which buildings and modules to build. Summary: already played enough to realize current value and future value.Pros:* supports different levels of challenge* wide variety of starting locations and load outs* frequent developer updates* engaged developers* graphics are fun* fish people steaks* only game I've ever built graveyards in.* frontier justiceCons:* still in beta - crashes enough it might annoy folks* it can be overwhelming if you're not good with organizing resources* No quit to main menu <- annoying but wth?

								3/22/15I've been watching/playing this game for awhile now. For most of that time a medley of things kept me from really getting into it. Whether it be giant beetles attacking my settler with the fish peple on map start or bandits spawning with my settlers, settelers stopping to admire the machines while they slowly starved to death, things seemed to be set against me to actally enjoy this. That actually all changed with the latest patch. Bandits now take a few days to start causing terror, workers will actually do thier jobs and not stop, plus it doesn't lag so terribly anymore until the higher settler counts. Like 50-60. All in all it's a great time now until the game crashes on you, but there's still a lot of bugs and issues that still need to be fixed.I would still say that you should watch some lets plays and read more reviews before buying it so early.  I persoanlly don't regret it.			",218,27,3,31,22,0,24

								I will recommend Clockwork Empires only to the people that know what beta testing is like. I like this game but it can clearly be seen that this is an incomplete and unfinished game. I noticed immediately that there are only 2 video resolutions to choose from and no ability to configure the preset keyboard and mouse controls. Game play and saving are slow. Graphically it's got a nice art style and I look forward to seeing the interface and visuals improve.  Like others have said this has tons of potential but buy in its current state only if you're prepared to be a paying game tester.			",84,6,0,17,16,0,7

												I've been playing this game in early access for around 480 hours. Love sandbox games. Now here's the thing: last October (2016) it was suddenly announced that the gamewas about to be officially launched. The sad news is - the game was nowhere near ready. The developers were tinkeringand tinkering, constantly inventing new mechanisms, abolishing existing gameplayand while hunting bugs, introducing new ones. Then, about a month after the release date, a total blackout. We know that 3 maindevelopers have left. We don't know if anyone is left working there, they havebeen completely absent from the website and forums. We (the people who havedone the bug finding and reporting) have the impression that the game is nowabandonware. Abandoned Ware, if you want. I personally like the version they left us with a lot less than version alpha 0.3 - there's a lot less sandbox, a lot more 'must dos' and 'can't dos'.  A lot lessoption to specifically select items and open an context menu, and generallythey have thus made life much harder to get off the ground, some of it throughpretty absurd conditionalities. A lot of early content like interaction with the fish people and adventures in the science laboratory has just been taken out with out any reason or explanation, leaving the game the poorer for it.Even so, I say: give this a shot -but for crying out loud, do not pay the full pricefor this game. It isn't worth it. Get it when it's on a $5 special on Steam. If youpay full price, you'll probably end up angry and disappointed to have boughtwhat really is a partly broken beta version of a wonderful concept that's goneoff the rails.			",7,6,0,8,6,0,4

Early Access Review
 Introduction After playing this studio's previous entry and liking the aesthetics and tone (Dungeons of Dredmor), I was pleasently surprised that they have since been working on another game that follows similiar themes but was a RTS instead of a rouge-like. Intrigued, decided to place this game on my wishlist and see how the development would pan out. After more than a year and finding myself pining for a new RTS to play, decided to give this entry a go despite the price tag. A decision based on research and seeing the company was committed to continous development and fixes based on player feedback. Comparing this to how other Early Access games are treated by their companies, this bolstered my confidence, ultimately resulting in a purchase.However of course, this being an Early Access game, the game itself is not without it's faults and I will try to give an balanced view to the current state of the game as of it's latest state: Build 52.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Actually Playing  Graphics Aesthetic-wise the game doesn't use high polygon graphics with models and textures looking a little on the muddy side but does it's job well enough to easily identify what you're looking at. I rarely found myself being confused by what a item was based on looks alone, unless it was a new item I haven't encountered yet. Music The current iteration of the music loops through a few tracks which have a nice spooky, ethereal feel to them, very much in line with the overall lovecraftian feel of the game. The music on/off function in the options didn't work for me, so if you want to silence the game while you listen to your own tunes, this is not currently possible in the current iteration of the game. Controls Controls are done with the W, A, S, D keys to moe left, right, up and down the map by default, E and Q keys rotate the camera. Wasn't a problem for me but did read a review earlier where someone expressed their displeasure at the lack of mouse-camera control scheme so might be negative for you depending on your preference.  Gameplay As for the gameplay itself, it's fairly typical of entries into this genre with the game starting out at a location of your choosing and whatever starting loadout of populace and supplies you choose, from there it's up to you to build up your settlement from working with wood and foraging for food to creating metal plates and pipes and growing your own form of sustenance as well as creating a militia to fend off foreign threats.The game itself is quite fun and you can easily lose hours of your life dedicating to building up your populace from humble beginnings however there are a few points you have to consider before you decide to buy into this Early Access.1. The pacing of the game is significantly slower than other entries i've tried in the genre. It can take you up to 2-3 hours to get your first couple of houses built, crops to reach their first harvest and to have a working carpentry and kitchen with new workers and overseers trickling in a very gradual rate. Workers and overseers seem to take forever to get anything done with the populace just walking at a very casual almost plodding pace and I found myself alt-tabbing out of the game often because they were either asleep or it just felt it was taking too long for something to be built because the game wasn't clear on what a worker was waiting on to fulfill a order or what task they were working on instead.An example of this was when I was waiting for some iron ingots to be made, which required both Coal and Hematite, both of which i had enough for but for some reason despite neither being on break, my overseer of the metalworks decided tidying the store for the upteenth time was more important with the other worker off talking to their friend.2. Unlike other games i've played in this genre, your typical overseers and workers who carry out your orders and fuel the economic and technogical growth of your operation have shifts which they stick to, working typically for most of the day with needed rests in the middle and end of their shift. They can work extra for longer shifts if they're happier and this current iteration is a marked improvement over earlier builds of the game where downtime was more paramount but is still a point of contention when talking about the game's pacing.Consdering these points, I'm afraid i'm going to have to agree with those who believe that a speed-dial option would be nice, although it can be peaceful and almost tranquil to watch my current settlement carry out their lives, I found myself falling asleep or alt-tabbing out the game to keep my attention engaged. The game's slow pacing is a sentiment I have seen repeated in other reviews. Bugs 3. Bugs. It's Early Access so they are to be expected and just like how programming typically is, for every little thing that is fixed and added, another bug rears it's head. The game can end up crashing entirely and there are weird glitches where stacks of resources are left and forgotten when construcing buildings, items being stuck in mid-animation e.g. when being picked up/placed down in stockpile as well workers/overseers picking up and placing items down continously as if they're stuck in some loop. Typically problems start cropping up when the population start getting past the 45 people range. Encountered another bug where a total of 2 workforce was sent to man an mineshaft and both work forces just disappeared so that was weird.Despite these flaws, I do still find myself coming back to play this game: a testament to the developer's vision but if you do pick up this game  and your patience is like mine, you may find yourself feeling frustrated starting a new map and realising it's going to take another 2-3 hours to feel like you're getting anywhere and the plodding pace of your populace is going to make you feel like getting up and making a cup of tea.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In Closing To sum up, I'd say do give the game a go if you feel inclined, with few entries of RTS's of this type at the moment and the lack of feedback and apparent development from other games in Early Access i seen on here, it seems Gaslamp Games is committed and in for the long run with Clockwork Empires with them consistently pushing out fixes and updates every month.The community surrounding the game is also positive with little flaming and ban's going on which seems to speak volumes about the company's attitude, so if you haven't been deterred by the negative points I listed and want to support a company that seem committed to further development of this title then go for it I'd say. I do plan to keep the review pretty up to date as more builds come out, changes to my review will be made as applicable.Thank you for taking the time to read my review if you got to the end and I'd be happy to reply to any comments,  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THIS REVIEW IS REALLY LONG. TLDR: I recommend it.The thematic:In my last game, a colonist framed a fishperson for the murder of an occult inspector from the mainland.I was nurturing some of my colonists with a bit of an eldritch bent. A handful of beetles now and again seemed a small price to pay for religious freedom! One of those stodgy old occult investigators was sent from the Parentland to root out any nefarious activity. Ugh. Between you and me, and I’ll deny it if anyone else asks, but I told Zora Bronzehewer it might be best if the investigator had a little… accident. Those mainlanders can be so clumsy pulsing dark daggers. So Zora goes out to deal with this investigator, and stabs him a good one, and he flees right into a fishpeson. Now, I’ve got to give him due credit – even injured by dark energies and knowing he had no chance, that investigator did his duty by queen and country and flame-roasted that fishperson on the spot. His finally report (written on the fly, while likely bleeding out), forgot to mention Zora’s dagger. Officially, the investigator had died in line of duty, bravely protecting us from the dreaded sea horror. Unofficially, well, if anyone else saw Zora walking away from the two bodies, they were smart enough not to bring it up.The Good:*	Gameplay is rich, and satisfying. You feel accomplished when you look at some sprawling colony you created.*	Details detail details details: EVERY colonist has a set of hopes and dreams and goals and memories. They affect the way that person moves in the world, including the people they interact with and how productive they work. For someone else, they may get a kick out of making sure they don’t make a drunkard run the public house. For me, I’ll put her there just to see what happens. The best part about the details is that they influence the game but they aren’t game-breaking. Micromanagement at the individua level isn’t necessary, but it’s there if you’re into it.*	Graphics. I dare you not to look at the animation of the little fox barking at a colonist and not zoom in to appreciate how cute it is. Or not to laugh the first time you see someone “dance with frantic joy” or walk somewhere while Maddened. The graphics only get better when [REDACTED]. (But, ok, the water looks really bad).*	Lots of events and stuff to do. I can’t imagine someone getting bored of the options in game unless they’re already bored with other aspects. *	You can make your colony as ridiculous or as structured as you want. I’ve spelled out my name in buildings. I’ve also created uniform row housing that would make brutalists proud.*	Colourblind mode. Thank you.*	META: The devs of this game are very decent human beings. They’re aware of the “issues” in the genre and time period they’re working within, and they have constructed an experience that lambasts the silliest part of the Victorian era without celebrating the worst bits OR leaving them in there without comment for “accuracy” purposes. If it matters to you, Gaslamp are good people.*	META: Devs are accessible and there are a lot of tools in game for bug-chasing, due to its time in early access. Speaking from Early access, I’ve had bugs I reported fixed within a few hours and pushed to a build.The Bad:*	The pacing can be slow. It’s a sim game, and your people all have stuff to do. Sometimes you’re stuck watching your people do their thing and waiting for more colonists to arrive / jobs to complete / etc. There’s a lot of satisfaction in seeing everyone scurry around at your whim, but it can get old if you just want them to finish building cots or whatever.*	The hows and whys of flattening terrain are strange. I still haven’t figured them out. *	Overwhelming. There can be a lot to take in at once, and you need a few games to comfortable with all the options. This is especially early in the game when you don’t necessarily have the necessary workshops and people set up to do anything about it (like foreign offices or vicars). It’s kinda fun in its own way, but there can be a lot on screen at once with you not really being able to deal with any of it.Final Verdict:It’s really fun and all of these detailed randomized people have the potential to create both a very rich colony simulator, and very strange stories (like Zora and the Investigator).There’s lots of reviews that talk about the game not being “Finished”. It’s not, in the sense that there’s still a lot of room for growth and potential. But right now, the game is already well equipped to tell stories, and occupy you for hours. The stability is pretty good and it’s going to get better. (Heck, it’s already more stable than most AAA games are on launch, fallout 4, xcom 2, etc). If I had written this review 6 months ago, I wouldn’t have recommended it. I think it deserves to be out of Early Access now, as the game itself is complete. I know the devs will continue to add content (Look at their previous game – Dungeons of Dredmor, which had 3 expansion and free content updates throughout).This is a fun game! You should buy it!

												Absolutely gutted. A clunky, unpolished RTS-lite and I sadly have to say it's really not worth playing. I managed nearly 4 hours and it's just a mess. Imagine if you will, taking a fantastic idea, eating it, digesting it and during the digestion realease an early access, people go wild and the hype train leaves the station. Then instead of the train arriving at a beautiful, polished, fluid, love-craftian affair, they slowly poop out the half digested mish-mash of ideas.It's slow, it feels sluggish and the mechanics, while interesting and unique in concept are meek in practical application.Should you get it?Well that really depends on your ideae of ""worth while"". Like all forms of art, it's subjective but there are things we can all agree are bad design or poorly implemented, for instance; an unintuitive UI, poor performance and while conceptually it works on paper but the practicality of having these great ideas formed in video-game format just doesn't work at all.Don't do it. It's been abandoned like the baby of a prom night romp, in a dumpster.			",560,141,11,105,90,6,116

												It saddens me to say it (because I really liked this company's first title and liked the concept behind this one) but this game is garbageNot only does it have one of the worst interfaces I've ever encountered (For one, it's nearly as inscrutable as the interface to Dwarf Fortress, but in a game that lacks anyof DF's depth. Secondly the UI contains bugs that make it difficult to use even the parts that you've figured out), but it was also a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get it to work at all, I had to go in and manually mess with my video card settings (not the game's graphic settings mind you, my actual videocard that is supposed to be supported) just to get it to run.

												I really wish I could recommend this game. It has fish-men, mysterious artifacts, interesting storylines. I played it in early access and I was really looking forwards to the final version.Unfortunately, the Mac version is seriously unstable. I can't get past midgame because it just keeps crashing. As far as I can tell from the game forums, the devs decided to prioritise new experimental content rather than delivering a stable Mac version, and it looks as if things have fallen apart at Gaslamp so I'm not expecting to ever get a finished game. Disappointing; it could have been so much better with just a little more work.			",0,1,0,1,1,0,2

Early Access Review
								Personally, I find this game to be rather enjoyable.  The concept is fun and dynamic enough to create some interesting stories for each playthrough.  I would like to see some changes:- Pathing needs to be fixed.  It becomes a hassle at times for characters to get to appropriate work stations, and sometimes get confused.- Improving AI job selection and ranking work sites.  Currenlty there's no way to guarantee what your workers will do unless you painstakingly micro manage what work sites are available for them.  For example, it'd be nice if I could rank the importance of building a house over a carpentry shop or kitchen, or if I want stone mined over clay if both sites are selected.- Create another 'job' title for workers.  Set workers to specifically clean up messes or clear terrain.- Creating more infrastructure.  It would be nice to decorate my village a little.  Place roads, build lamp posts, etc.  This could even fall under the job to the workers who clear terrain.I can think of far more, but I'd really like to see this game put more emphasis into growing a user's town.  I feel that 'job rankings' and additional 'jobs' can help to alleviate long bits of code for specific tasks and really simplify what the colonists can do.			",45,2,0,8,8,0,27

								This is a colony-builder of impressive depth and flavor.  I should note that this game is in beta, and as such crashes are still an issue.  Autosaves every ten or so minutes allieviate this somewhat, and I believe the game is engaging enough to play despite the crashes.  It's also worth noting that Gaslamp Games has an impressively active forum over at their site: www.gaslampgames.com .  The forum recently completed its second Community Colony, which ended in complete, unqualified success and in no way ended in flames borne of heterodox spirituality.Edit - formatting			",104,19,0,14,10,2,5

								While I do need to say, it IS early access, and not without it's bugs, the devs are pushing patches and fixes like Cthulhu dishes out cultists. ANY time there has been an issue, a dev is asking for a save file, or info for a fix, and it's usually done in a day or two. I have never seen a company on point like this. As for the content and game itself, let's talk about me instead for a bit.I have the attention span of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gnat on espresso. I am also a game ♥♥♥♥♥. I will literaly download any game, especially if its cheap. I bought this full price (3 days before the sale, but I have no regrets. it's worth the price.) and it has kept my attention quite nicely. The hidden gems of content, the dark humor, the canabalism. It's like playing ""The Sims"" with Hanibal Lector and friends. I know there will be several people calling me a fan boy among other lovely juvenile names, but It won't  bother me, because I will be too busy playing this hidden gem to see those comments.

												Biased review incoming.Huge fan of Gaslamp games since the early days of Dungeons of Dredmor.Been playing this game on and off for several years and watching its development.Seeing lots of complaints on how ""lazy"" the AI is.  The AI isn't that lazy, but there are systems in place that if you don't notice them, they will appear lazy.  For example the overseers and workers all take breaks during the day.  The happier they are, the shorter breaks they take.  How do you make them happy?  This partially depends on the individual, they all have quirks.  However, there are things that will make all of them happy in general.  Things such as safety (well-armed militia), workplace quality, housing quality, food quality, and public services such as a pub and/or church.Also assigning more tasks than there are roaming (not assigned to a building) overseers, then it will feel like nothing is getting done.As I said earlier, I've been playing this game a long time.  I don't remember having to learn the fairly complex UI because at one point it wasn't that complex.  But that made it too difficult to get things done.  I know it has a steep learning curve, but every failure helps you understand how to do it better next time.  Entire population wiped out by bandits?  Should have worked on militia earlier, built more homes, or taken them out first.  Run out of food?  Make production more efficient by putting the kitchen right next to the farm, or build a naturalist's building and have them hunt for game.There are many routes to go in this game, most are up to personal preference.Also, the game has a pause button (spacebar) during which you can manage multiple things while the game-time is frozen.  Abuse this power.Bottom line:  If you have the time and patience, this game is great for long-term entertainment.  Enjoy the tongue-in-cheek nature and don't take it too seriously.

								I greatly enjoyed Dungeons of Dredmor and so I picked up this game as soon as it came out of Early Access. It had promise in early Alpha, but wasn't satisfying over the long term—not unexpected, since it's an Early Access game.I just tried Clockwork Empires again (Beta 54C), and the improvement is MASSIVE. The game is rich and satisfying, with an interesting late game, many different routes to success once your colony stabilizes, and increasingly-difficult combinations of biomes (maps, basically) that open up for replayability and challenge. The overall artistic style of the game comes through very strongly and positively, The delightful Gaslamp Games sense of humor is evident throughout, and manages to stay fresh through several replays, which is a particularly difficult task for any 'funny' game. And most importantly, the simulation feels good, and responds well to good player decisions (a big change from early Alpha.)Definitely recommended.			",5,4,0,6,2,0,3

								This game has fantastic potential. HOWEVER, as of right now, the $30 pricetag is absolutely ridiculous. Half the time saving the game crashes it, trying to utilize any of the functions in the game crashes it, and playing it for more than an hour crashes it. I realize that yes; this is an alpha, and it's early access. But you don't slap such a high price onto such a badly unfinished game. The AI is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and unfortunately there's nothing particularly negative that happens with the Lovecraftian elements as of yet (which I know will be implemented later).When the game is finished, I'll be more than happy to give a review again, but as of right now, I do NOT recommend purchasing it. Wait until there's more done.*edit on 1/19/15*: Having played the game some more at the request of the developers, I attempted two times, got about an hour to an hour and a half in each time and it crashed. There were multiple problems attempting to cancel items and buildings, and despite assigning jobs, villagers would sit and talk until they starved a few times. As of right now - for me - it's still a bit too buggy for my tastes. Again, has wonderful potential, just right now I find it unplayable.			",144,50,1,27,21,0,11

												Rather great, entertaining game. Biggest problems are needing a little polish in places, which don't make it unplayable, just sometimes are mild annoyances.Edit: Since my review, it seems the company has gone out of business. While the game is officially ""released"", it's stil lacking reatures that were promised. Which is sad, but the community patch that's in the works seems to be trying to finish the game. So unless you don't mind waiting for the community patch, I really can no longer recommend this game.			",272,108,7,90,77,3,119

Early Access Review
								Inspired by reading a certain article about Early Access Games, I thought about Clockwork Empire and my oppinion of it.In general, as the thumb up indicates, I recommend and support this game. It is though very early in developement. The general concept is similar to other tactical, economical simulations game. Their gratest imrpove though is the idea of not having individuals appointed to all kinds of jobs by the engine, but to have a whole group do the tasks as one. This brings in the dynamic and speed often missing within the games, also it organizes the order of jobs and economoics.The idea and setting of the game is also one I highly appreciate, for it promises to become a very well done steam-punk game, whereof there is way too little on the market in my oppinion. At least in this sort of genre, mind you. Already there are a lot of interesting mechanics in the order of production and economoy to be seen in the early access, and I look forward to see what else they might include.Then there is the studio and their individual personallity, mirrored in the story and character of the game. Their humor is awesome and I loved it all the time when playing Dungeons of Dreadmore. It is because of this former game that I went into early access with a lot of trust and faith in this studio! They might have chosen a more tricky set up of a game here, but their idea - or the one I see from the game - is that of a semi mysterius-industrial culture simulation game, with a lot of humor. Thanks to that I see an interesting game evolve here, that will have lots of things to offer for people who enjoyed to play Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Facturio and the like. At least, in my point of view. Like other Early-Access Projects they do well on including content step by step and simultanously balancing and fixing or repairing priviosly included stuff and mechanics. Also the game-concept itself can be viewed as object-oriented. That is important on a perspective of game developeing: Since it is OO, they >can< take concepts and content of the game and put it into a later phase of the developing. Where other games might fail because the developers have too much to synch at the same time and write together, here there is the option to evolve step by step, which is crucially important.Again, this is just my oppinion, based on what I see as a player, without having actually peaked into the code yet. For anyone interested, all you as a buyer need to have is pacience. So far I had a good nose with my picks, and this is one that will grow slowly but steadyly. Though personally I already highly enjoy playing the game (despite minor crashes and bugs I can ignore), for those who have higher standards the game should have grown enough latest by the end of the year. So far they keep going with their monthly updates, which is a huge plus, so they might be even quicker.To the devs: Keep the work up! You're on a good way and it's definately worth all the trouble! Best luck and finances!			",145,36,0,26,36,2,49

SummaryI had very high hopes for this game, but unfortunately it is not what I expected at all. It feels like another Dwarf Fortress clone with decent graphics and a nice style, but is very buggy, development of your settlement is very limited, and if odds are against you, you might not even be able to play the game at all - for a long time I used to have a bug that prevented me from playing at all - unless I've set a patrol zone (If I recall correctly) for a person to guard, the whole world was black as if there was a very dark night. This game is basically an epitome of wasted potential. It could have been great, but was abandoned before it was allowed to spread its wings. For shame.What works1. Graphics are decent, feel quite lovecraftian, and obviously way better than Dwarf Fortress.2. Steampunk theme is pretty cool.3. It works as a settlement builder - you can build a decent village, although nothing more. What doesn't work1. It's main problem is storytelling. RimWorld has great storytellers with many different difficulty settings to choose from, allowing you to really customize your experience. In Clockwork Empires it's either very easy or insane. There is little in the middle.2. Constructing is tedious when compared to Dwarf Fortress or RimWorld. I really prefer the top-down graphics as they are more clear and it is easier to design things. 3. You can't build really impressive fortresser or cities like in Dwarf Fortress. I know that the game won't handle as many objects but still, I don't like the scale at all.4. Game left early access way too early. It is not finished, not polished at all, and really lacks when compared to RimWorld or DF. 5. The price is not adequate at all. It's way too expensive for what it really is. Dwarf Fortress, on the other hand, is completely free. Should you buy it?Definitely not.			",70,60,7,45,108,1,58

								I commend this game. BOught into this game for ""Earliest access"" I have seen just about everything, from the ground dissapearing to watching the fishpeople dance on the beach. It is crazy how you can't control the people individually but can only give orders for how you want the world built. THe game has made ""GREAT PROGRESS"" since I bought into it a month ago or so. It will crash. I am running a 4770k I7 overclocked to 4.5ghz with ram at 1866mhz and the game crashes my friends. I have temp spike to about 70 sometimes because Clockwork empires makes the computer work to produce how many things are going on at one time. Love this game to death. Ready for some more things to evolve in here. I keep sending my searcher out to eliminate the fog of war, very hard to see how big the world actually is. SOOO MANY THINGS TO DO!!

Early Access Review
								I've been following CE for a few years now, and feel that Beta 55 is where the game's finally hit its stride and is a clean recommend for any fan of city ""managers"" in the vein of Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, Gnomoria, and their ilk.The pace of the game is steady, as you start from a small batch of overseers and workers and build up your colony. Add more housing to support larger work forces, build new workshops to create the supplies needed to create those houses and generally push your colony forward in a smooth pendulum of expansion and solidification.In the later game, CE introduces more of its eldritch themes, bringing cults, arcane horrors and THINGS MAN WAS NOT MEANT TO KNOW to the fore, adding not only new challenges, but entirely new content to the game as you progress in a way games of this genre rarely manage. And that, right there, is one of the key draws for me: it has a solid late game.Note, there are still some visual gacks, the AI can be a bit silly at times and first-time players can have a hard stretch figuring out exactly how to proceed, but all of these problems have been ruthlessly whittled down to ""annoying"" as opposed to ""crippling"" by the tireless efforts of the Gaslamp Games crew, who have been very open, transparent and responsive through 55! beta releases.Good game with good devs. Highly recommended.

												I waited a while to get this game. I was worried after reading the reviews that I would be frustrated and disappointed.Steam Sale to the rescue.This Game IS SO MUCH FUN!Yes it has its problems. Like the game glitching out during a random event here and there, and sometimes your colonists can be so sloooow. BUT even with its problems, I can't help but have fallen in love with this game. Your colonists are quirky, the technology is deep but not too deep to get frustrating, and it's fun to see how each colony will be different. Will you build a barracks on startup or will you wait? A church or not and let the dark forces run amuck. I love the random events (reminds me slightly of RimWorld which I also love, but feels much smaller in scale), though at first I thought they were game destroying moments and got a little frustrated. Then I realized I could come back from them, and it made it all the more fun to figure out how best to deal with the events and what techs and buildings you needed to make survivability easier!I do hope the game gets updated for bug fixes and maybe a few streamlined features (Or at least a tutorial that gives you more information on how to build certain things/research. Maybe an advanced tutorial.) As it sits, this is a fun little game and definitely worth the discounted price. And if I had know how much I would have loved it I probably would have paid the price in full.			",41,23,0,33,68,0,28

								Does it have Issues, yes, it's an Early Access game!We paid to have a constant access playable copy and to be able to have our opinions heard, we are helping them set this puppy up!  Gameplay is, dispite the Tutorial reel, a ""good Luck!"" thing.  With the game randomly choosing to do things like give all sldiers no bullets, and never spawning any Sulfer nodes, you have to rely upon the grace of the home land for your ammo.And I'm ok with it, if it would give you something for everything it took...It's brutal, your going to lose a good bit until you find what works, and then you'll delay the inevitable rise of a new thorne.  The Colonist AI is dumb, not in that ""ha ha, your an idiot"" way either.  I've lost Colonies to starvation when I had scads of food, I've started the game under attack by ten raider groups and fifteen fishmen!  WHen you loose a Overseer the people are just useless gobs that wander until they get cut down by a bandit, a fishman, or a cultist...And mind you, I like this game, however I'm not going to sugar coat it, this is not a casual game, if you click wrong or misplan once, there is no take backs.  Miss an option and it is gone forever.  I won't say that is part of the apeal of it, because it's not.  I like the quirkieness of the setting, the trail and error aspect, and the emphisis on groups over individuals.I do not like the raider rushes, the missing gear every game, thje predictable cult formation five minutes after game start, and the cultists always taregt overseers first.  With no undo option you will make mistakes you must just accept, which is kind of anoying, why bother with Pause based build it yourself styled building if once you click a location there is no way to undo the mistakes (just as if you diod it without pausing.)But again, you have to accept that your going to get this kind of thing in an Early Access game.  They offered us Research and other cool toys down the road, and I cannot wait for it.  I paid because I want to help them make this game better, so I and others can enjoy it.  I paid because I belive in that kooky colonial  dream, and I want to ride this crazy train where-ever it may go!So rather than pout because it's not perfect, put on your big kid underoos, and grab your gear, it's Colonial  time!Tell the devs the issues and thell try to solve it, or explain why it's an inteded effect rather than a seemingly random thing.

												Wasted potential does not even begin to describe this game. This thing is really buggy and has been just wrecked.  I really am not asking much, I even gave Maia (the game) a pass on it's bugs because most things actually work and are fun.    I really do not understand what happened during the development of this game but they took a fantastic concept and just created something that is poorly implimented. There are many games though that do the same basic concept so much better...  I really wish I could recommened this but as it is this is one of the most dissapointing games ever.  Could have been great but instead marred by a lazy implimentation with a terrible user interface and crashes to desktop.			",209,58,4,63,74,0,85

								I play a lot of early access, and this is very, very good.  Reasonably stable, with a good autosave and already great complexity after only a few hours play.  If you liked Tropico, you will love this, as it is back to the good bits without too many of the later bad bits Tropico added.  Do not be put off by the more Lovecraftian elements, as they are charmingly implemented.  I thought it was a bit expensive for ea at first, but I would say it is well worth the money, and I am by no means a dedicated gamer.  Buy it, and be a part of the development of this beautifully rendered and, after the first hurdles are overcome, nicely complex game.			",13,6,0,3,14,0,1

												I've been popping into this game every update for the last year or so, this is how Early Access is supposed to be done. Communicated and dedicated updates. Sure crap got broken, but it was still in development its to be expected. I'm not really a steampunk sorta guy, I enjoy the setting well enough but I just wanted a village builder similar to say Banished and I got it. The humor is tongue and cheek and perfect and the game has a surprisingy amount of depth to it where I keep discovering crap I had missed during previous play throughs. @ 140hrs in I'm pretty confident in saying I enjoy the game and can recommend it to those that want a smaller scale Banished with a sense of humor. Is it perfect? Hell now, the people can be idiots, the combat can be a bit goofy but honestly it just adds to the charm a bit.			",246,25,1,40,78,2,70

								17 October 2015 Review:The game seems to have had some changes, but not sure if for the better or worse yet. I still find the AI to be unpleasant. I left the game running by itself for an hour telling them all to cut down trees, mine rocks, build buildings. I came back and hardly anything was built, nothing had been processed really, and some trees were cut down and some rocks mined. I also witnessed one of them picking up a block of clay and putting it down, picking it up, putting it down in the same spot for 5 minutes straight...All in all, I'm not highly experienced with the game but its current state pushes me away from playing it. It's mostly attributed to the AI, but the rest of the game seems to be coming along fairly well.19th Feburary 2015 Review:Shows alot of promise to be a really fun game. At the moment, I recommend only buying the game if you want to check out the style of it and the gameplay. I do not recommend buying it for playing it, wait for more updates or better yet, out of EA. At the moment it is still far too buggy (eg animals trapped in buildings, colonists geting stuck on trees) and sometimes unresponsive (eg exploring, wont hunt animals).			",136,37,3,19,66,0,27

I'd also like to be able to zoom out (the minimap isn't implemented yet either.)It is shaping up to be a really great builder, the Early Access is working out, and it is a great presentation overall (love the EA updates with the themes.)[update:  fixed a typo]			",2417,975,98,284,358,28,441

Posted: January 13
												Ok well, here is my 2 cents. I bought clockwork empires before release but not as early as some other people. I am going to recommend this game overall but with one major caveat. Onwards to my review!The concept is brilliant, a colony sim in a Lovecraftian steampunk nightmare. The concept is delivered well with plenty of building options, other denizens of the area to either destroy in xenophobic genocide or merely tolerate, a resource system that is a breath of fresh air in comparison to the traditional groups of nodes or tunnelling into the earth directly. The crop system appears to be missing alot however if you spend a little time with the diplomacy you will find that allied trading partners may bring the option to grow other plants from other biomes along with your own research in the laboratory. The science aspect is developed yet simple however leaves too much rng for my tastes with the initial research options, i feel a more traditional tree similar to the Civ games would be more suitable however, but still using the 3 focuses to make it a decision whether to subjegate using advanced military might or develop your money making power with cash crops and dominate in the diplomacy arena.Combat is simple affair with equipping your squads with different gear as you unlock and craft it and then either letting them patrol the general area or directing them to specific points, possibly having the choice of equipping individual squad members with different weapons .I know I am making suggestions but bear with me, The biggest problem with this game is the restrictive manpower assignment process. You have overseers or foremen and labourers. You assign an overseer to a position within a production building and then assign labourers. Any work that is being carried out will be completed but lets say your carpenters are finished work and are just loafing around but your farmers require more help getting the crop in this season or the colony requires a tidy up then the carpenters will not do anything other than what is in the order queue for the workshop. To solve this I would say that maybe having clearing and land flattening common to all trades but so low on the priority list that it is used as filler when they have nothing better to do. Some people have a problem with the fact that the game has released with either not enough content, or not enough of this that or the other. I feel that the negative reviews are doing the opposite of what the possible intent may be. I am reccommending this game on the fact that with continued support then only then can it grow. I enjoy playing this game and do not wish to see it die like so many other indie productions, however the community has been burned by too many time wasters and is now over critical of any independant producers by expecting games that require nothing more added to it at release, look at bethesda and fallout 4 when that released, EA with simcity, AAA producers make mistakes yet they have the monetry backing to weather a community backlash. Indie producers do not, and require a different form of criticsm, one where as a community we still recommend the hard work but still temper it with helpful criticsm.I appologise for the review turn rant but one of the biggest reasons indie games fail is because the community kills them. Why continue putting blood, sweat and tears into something to be put to the steak and burned.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Steampunk city builder without ... steampunk ... and cities.First let me say I love gaslamp though and their support during EA has been stellar. With one major patch every month and a blog post detailing the grim reality of game development every week.However after so much time in early access, the game sadly fails to live up to the original promises and expectations.Main issue is that they have been bogged down by core engine issue for so long in alpha it delayed a lot of the actual features and gameplay implementation.Also game design of the game has seemingly never really be set in stone, resulting in lot of back and forth on core gameplay elements, the result being it’s not quite clear what kind of game they want to be.It has elements from survival management games like Rimworld, some production chains principles from Factorio, it borrows from Anno with the needs of the populations. But it’s neither of these game and fails to implement the borrowed concepts in a cohesive and compelling gameplay.Where the game falls short the most is that despite being adverstised as a steampunk game, the steampunk elements are still nowhere to be found except minuscule details and references.

Early Access Review
								Clockwork Empires is a Victorian based game (not really steampunk) where you drop a bunch of orders, and watch helplessly as your lazy and stupid colonists do their best to mess with them. And then complain.It is an excercise in frustration, where you will spend more time yelling at your screen instead of actually playing, due to the lack of control on pretty much everything. To the point you might regret this game is not about micromanaging and the tedious associated.And that's the ""gameplay"". Then you have another kind of frustration when dealing with an UI that seems to have been made by Bethesda. For consoles.And when you are ready to close the game, having accomplished nothing but to raise your own cardiac stress, the game will crash for you. Usually when saving, as a big FU.And that's if you are lucky and have a ""normal"" play. Most of the time, it will bug so much, you will not even enjoy the usual frustration, but instead enjoy another kind.I know it's an Early access, but the amount of major bugs is staggering, and a lot of them are pretty much guaranteed. Some of them are gamebreaking. In 13h~ I had an entire colony broken because of a bunch of them (IE unplayable).CE is probably the most realistic town sim game ever. Sadly, having to deal with lazy idiots who will not listen is not really funny.10/10 would enjoy the frustration of being a city leader again. Now I understand why they have grey hair and cardiac issues relatively young.			",69,12,0,24,16,0,23

												This review is a tricky one to like, the gameplay i enjoy but it lacks polish, performance droops the longer the game runs, the fact the devs have abandonned a game so close to he finish line is what pushed me to put it down as negativeI wish steam allowed neutral reviews as i didnt want to give this a negative or positive reviewI put 8 hours in and had a great 8 hours, was it worth the price i paid back on EA? no compared to other titles, but 8 hours for £24 when compared to other actitivies is a bargin.buy or dont buy with caution, research and make your own desicison on all the facts			",210,36,2,43,60,0,92

												I played this back when it was still in Early Access, eager to have a new city builder to try out that perhaps didn't take itself too seriously - I love a little humor in games. That said, when I played it, it barely functioned - bugs were everywhere, AI was broken, and your colony would very quickly be attacked when you had just started out - leaving you with barely anyone to actually build a colony with. The game needed some polishing, so I decided to wait and watch to see if the issues I'd had were addressed. That was easily a year ago. Unfortunately, it seems the game has not had it's many issues resolved, and instead seems to have even more problems than it did in Early Access. I wish I hadn't purchased it now - it had so much promise but it seems that the developer has failed to deliver, and instead rushed to release. Lately, with 2 months of silence there are grumbles that the game has been abandoned by it's developer, too. In it's current iteration, I cannot recommend Clockwork Empire. If the overwhelming issues are ever addressed I'd be happy to reverse my review and recommend it, but until that happens, I would recommend potential buyers spend their money elsewhere - this will only frustrate you.

								Clockwork Empires is an early-access colony management game. Although still in development, the developers have paid a lot of attention to making the game stand out with interesting Theme Hospital-esque base building mechanics and cult backstories in your colony. The game is always improving at a very steady pace, so it is worth your money if you like what you see in videos.			",87,16,2,18,23,0,25

												This is a slow-paced, sedate builder game. It feels more close to games like the Settlers, Anno or Banished, rather than to Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. I think the mixed reviews might be coming from people who came in expecting a DF-like game with procedural randomness and free-form megaprojects but instead got... well, a builder game.You spend most of the time in this game setting up workshops, figuring out supply chains, optimizing the workflow in order to ""unlock"" new buildings, new products and ever more complex production chains. You build in order to grow and build some more. There is some combat and random events (Cthulhu-like) but those feel like extra flavour, a fun little aside to spice the bulder part a bit. They're not the core of the gameplay.So in summary: You will enjoy Clockwork Empires if you like the city builder genre and enjoy a slow experience of building and optimizing.			",31,25,1,14,11,2,19

								It's off to a great start, it's basically a city builder with a Lovecraftian twist. Now when I say I reccomend it, I do not mean now. It's more just a show of good faith in the direction it is going. Needs much fine tuning (obviously because it's Early Access) as well as it needs a touch more content. I hope for more variation in possible starts (currently only two option avaiable) and I hope for more spooky content. All in all I just want more reasons for me to dread every night and day. It has the Lovecraftian elements but I don't quiet feel much of it other than the obvious things. I would suggest that weird things happen more often as well. Buy it when it's ready unless you want to contribute to it's development then get it now.			",176,32,1,50,53,0,85

												A quirky little simulator, Clockwork Empires is a ton of fun, and one of those games that you can play for a very long time. Like Gaslamp's last game, Dungeons of Dredmor, it offers a ton of replayability, a bright and offbeat aesthetic, and excelletn player support and communication. Hopefully, like Dredmor, it will have years of free updates and community mods lavished upon it. You start a settlement in a strange new Victorian world, try not to starve, improve the lives of your colonists, and slowly grow your camp into a thriving town. Deal with local fishpeople as you see fit! Meddle in the affairs of foreign empres, either trough trade or violence! Same goes for bandits and those with dissenting ideas! A lot of the joy in this game comes from the ant-farm appeal. You tell them what needs doing, but these little colonists run around having lives of theri own, full of strangeness and emotional turmoil. It's a joy sometimes just to let things run and watch them go about their business, getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by their boss, going to the pub to calm down, gossiping with their friends and then having to run for their lives as an eldritch horror tries to rip their face off. The other joy is the level of freedom the game gives you in terms of construction. The entiire world is deformable, meaning you can alter all the land to suit your needs. You can also build just about any building shape and size you want, and fill it with whatever assortment of gear it needs to run or to be a bizzare trap for it's inhabitants. While there are still some rough edges in the UI and AI, this is a complicated labor of love made by a very small, very hard-working team. It is definately feature complete and ready to play, but you can be sure that it will only be improved over time. Gaslamp Games stays with it's games, and does right by the people who play them. This in a big and ambitious step for them, and I hope you'll give it a try. I did, and it's made it's way into my heart.			",148,69,2,12,10,1,10

								An interesting take on the dwarf fortress inspired build up and avoid disaster genre, the developers are dedicated and are slowly but surely with each passing update bringing their vision to life. I've been playing on and off with early access and with each update and build the game slowly is building up it's own identity, and considering how dungeons of dredmor turned out I have a feeling it will only get better from here on out.

												I am recommending this, but only for certain people. You need to know going in that this was a very ambitious game, and while they sort of pulled it off there is a lot that they didn't get to, and it does feel unpolished. There's a lot wrong with this game, but I actually do love it, and I feel that I will keep coming back to it for a long time. Particularly if it is updated. I think the reason this game has turned out the way it has is because the devs waded into uncharted territory without a map. They get a lot of points from me for doing something different. A lot of what has been done is very innovative, and if you are a fan of this genre you will love playing with the highly customisable workshops, houses and special buildings. It's great fun drawing a blueprint for your carpenters workshop and deciding where everything will go - you feel like you are building a colony from scratch rather than just planting down premade buildings. The work crew system is unique and while I have a few issues with it, the idea is good. You have a supervisor who can employ up to four people. Those four labourers will join the supervisor on whatever task they are assigned to (you do this based on their traits and skills) and their effectiveness is determined by a few things including the skill of the supervisor, the buiding quality... and probably some other nebulous thing I haven't figured out yet. From that example you can probably see that you need to invest some time in order to understand the complex systems going on. It's not obvious. This is for people like me who actually enjoy figuring that stuff out and find it really satisfying to understand a complex system enough to be able to build something thriving.What I want to add to all of the reviews so far (including the negative ones that make good points) is that there is huge potential for fun here.  If you took a look at Dwarf Fortress and thought you couldn't handle figuring it out, maybe skip this. If the reason you skipped Dwarf Fortress was solely down to graphics, hey, this could be a gold mine for you.			",92,98,5,48,48,3,36

												The game features randomly generated maps in different biomes with no overall objective, other than survival and expansion. While the interface allows for multiple ways of finding information (like building queues), being able to queue up multiple projects on the same module would be helpful. In addition, being able to search for resources on the map would be a welcome feature. Overseers perform as managers, working in a building or picking available tasks (like chopping trees, foraging for food, or mining surface rocks) on a specific daily schedule; laborers are attached to an overseer and will automatically assist. Each colonist has extensive memories of past events that dictate their levels of happiness, despair, anger, and fear, which in turn affect their ability to work. Colonists will also level up at specific skills they routinely perform, making them better at their job. Raw resources are collected from the landscape, grown in farms, or mined. These are processed in different buildings on various pieces of equipment; the building layouts are custom designed by the player, allowing for different plans based on current needs and giving a more varied look to the colony. Multi-step production in Clockwork Empires is interesting, although the steps and equipment required for make a specific good may not be intuitive. Other factions in the area may be friendly or hostile; trade can be initiated to secure goods that are not plentiful at your location, and enemy factions can invade your colony. Strange beasts roam the landscape and terrorize the colonists, and cults may form when citizen behaviors warrant them. While the early game is fairly repetitive (the same initial structures are used every time) and some aspects of the user interface could be improved, Clockwork Empires is a very compelling management game thanks to its distinctive theme, detailed citizens, customized building layouts, multi-step item production, and hostile environment.

Dev - I can confirm the issue regarding Rally points displaying Place plant, also when you rally they stand around and dont seem to attack until the rally is over and they can move freely again?A challenging economic sim, mixed with a bit of strategy aspects in a decent blend. I look forward to seeing where this game leads in the long term.			",32,11,1,20,21,0,10

												Dont buy unless the Devs get serious about actually making a game not just selling an idea.  Excellent Unplayable Game.  Constantly Crashing during battles or high population moments.  I would understand and be patient with the level of bugs/glitches and crashing if it was early access, but in a released game the level of issues is just totally unacceptable.   I found Prison Tycoon series and others to be less buggy but equally as frustrating.  Took 2 years to get to this point and a good game only gets you so far if you can't play it past a certain point.I'll stick with proper companies in the future not weekend warriors programming from thier basement putting out half a&*^'d concepts.

								This review is for the Agurust 2015 version.The game is based on a familiar permise: start with a handful of colonists in a wild place and make it more hospitable. The XIX century/steampunk setting is fun and the key elements are present.State of Early access: the game appeared on EA in August 2014, and honestly at the time was not really much of a game, with only barebones of the experience present. However, progress has been steady. The devs have a clear roadmap of their project and regularly update he game, adding the mechanics that they promised.Today, the game is solid and fun, though there is clearly still work to be done before release.Overall I would recommend it if you are a fan of the genre or if you like steampunk.

								Quick updates and the devlopers really seem to listen to feedback. Unless you simply won't buy an Early Access game this is a safe bet for seeing a good game develop.			",321,113,3,67,46,4,85

												I have to break a lance for clockwork empires. First i have to say that I am full of understanding for the reviews which are negative cause the technical stand of the game. But I am not a professional writer for a magazine so i have the right to post here …….. everything. So, keep in mind this short and positive review is for H.P. Lovecraft Fans who have enough money to spend more than one game/month. Why to play: -	Humour (very British with a small Canadian influence)         o	Your colonists are getting crazy if their homes not cute enough or if they dream of so-called “fishpeople”                ( there are no fishpeople, you nw that, but your colonists are …. superstitious). Their mind will suffer when                they are very hungry and took the wrong decision in connection with corpse and lack of food.          o	Their social behaviour in front of the dangerous and violent surroundings they are all in. You should think                teamplay is the key for the first colonists in a new and strange world. But mankind works …….. differently. -	Violence (yes, it could be also in the “humour tab”)         o	The good news, you need not strain your certain by killing Indians. And there are no so called “fishpeople”.                But anyhow, dt let your colonists eat caviar!!!         o	Bandits. You knw, the next judge is probably thousands of miles away. And there are muskets!!!         o	Prussians. Öhm, äh, I mean Stahlmarks! Another faction in the game. You have to decide if you fighting or                diplomating them. But hey, never trust people using Ö, Ä or Ü`s in their vocabulary. -	Science (and this point is really very close to violence)         o	It is so impressive what a very intelligent person is able to find out, just equipped with a blackboard.                 Unfortunately, your colonists are not so smart. But you will see.          o	Science and faith dt match (in my stahlmarks opinion). But your colonists, well, we talked about the               superstitious-thing. And so they mixed it up and the outcome is, drum-roll, surprise: illuminates cultists. Is it buggy? Yes it is! Is the graphic up to date? No it isn’t! But it is original and quaintly (I googled this word and decided to like it). It have character. Buy it. Nw. Or in a stahlmarks language: Stillgestanden! Richt Euch! Zum kaufen des Produkts, Aaaauuuuuugen rechts: Kaufen!!! ",111,23,3,49,119,2,99

												The game, as in the gameplay itself is very good. The best I've played in years when it comes to this kind of genre actually. However as most people are saying, the game is a bit glitchy and buggy. And there's little to no graphics options, and the game starts chugging when your colony grows in size, even as primitive as the actual models in the game are.Also the water looks weird.--Graphics--Other than that, I myself think the game looks great, the artstyle and textures are easy to look at and conveys the information from the gameworld that you need for the most part. It is also surprisingly detailed texture-wize and all the different resources and furniture have distinct models.The GUI is 4 out of 5 I think for this kind of game. Lots of tooltips and easy to distinguish thumbnails and menus. However there are a few instances where some improvement would be appreciated. For example:-The minimap have no indicator of where your camera is, and does not rotate together with you. I don't know if this is a gamedesign decision or not, but it's certainly abnormal for this kind of game. You get used to it after about an hour of playtime, so it's no big deal.-I find it hard to manage overseers and their workplaces when I get a good number of them. Comparing Overseers and finding their stats are cumbersome in some instances. Also the scrollbar sometimes snap back when scrolling through your people, so you can't scroll down the bottom one before it snaps back up to the top. This can be bruteforce-fixed by pausing the game. And it doesn't happen often.-It would be great with more visually distinct tooltips explaining that something has to be researched before you can build it.The game really needs some graphics options though. --Gameplay--The game is somewhat difficult, your guys can die really fast if things get out of hand. I'm sure if you read up on the most effective ways of building your colony it will be much easier, but figuring all that out is the fun of the game IMO.The game feel very deep and varied compared to other games. Not only in the same genre, but most games I play these days. There's 10 times more value here than say SW: Battlefront. For some reason that game came to mind.The progression is interesting and fun. You don't get all your stuff at once and have to research and get the correct resources before you can build specific things. Which is something I enjoy in this kind of game. Compared to say Prison Architect which I think did a poor job in that department. You have to do this all while avoiding all the dangers that surround you in this newfound land. Looking around at the map and observing the details is not only fun, but helpfull to your gameplay. Most of the things that your colonists experience in dialogue boxes can be seen in some way in the world. Like Cultists setting up a shrine nearby, so if you see a lot of candles in the forest, that's probably where they at.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Even with it's glitches and crashes I've had a fun 24 or so hours with this game, and I'm not 10% into the game from what I can see.Here are some of the unintended features, bugs, glitches and crashes and other technical stuff that may detract from your experience. I myself did not care much, but I really hope the devs fix it up. It will probably be much more enjoyable.-Every so often the game just hardcrashes. I can't find any patterns to it, so I have to spend 30 seconds looking at youtube while it starts up again.-Saving the game takes a bit longer than I would like. I don't expect it to be instant, just a bit faster.-During my first time playing, my laboratory glitched out on an event, and became unusable, I couldn't even raze the building, or get my overseer unassigned from it. So I wasn't able to research anything. It became very confusing to me how to get stuff (like steel) That you have to research.- Skeletons and bodies are difficult to click on.- When placing walls, (military walls- I forget what they're called) sometimes I can't remove them before they're built.So I have to dismantle them later.- Water looks horrid. Just flatten it. Flatten it out of existance so you wont have to look at it.-Sometimes carpets disappear into the floor. It still gives its effect though. ",179,24,2,21,20,3,40

Early Access Review
								I bought this game just after it came out on Early Access. It proudly displayed the Multiplayer tage on it; because it promised to have Multiplayer. So that's why I bought it. NEVER BUY AN EA GAME EXPECTING IT TO RETAIN FEATURES. Because without my knowledge they decided to cut multiplayer at the beginning of the year in a casually named blog post nobody saw. This is why amatuer developers should not make distant promises about a game they plan to have in development for two years. Because it ends up just dissapointing everybody involved. I played a recent build and it was a sickeningly far cry from the game I had paid for. There is no mystery or suprise to this game anymore, it's just a house building simulator now.Here is how the entire game works: You build workshops and assign overseers so that they make materials to build houses. The houses raise the arbitrary head count limit so that you can build better and more houses. If you ever have too many workshops your rate of progress sinks because of the overseer system, so before you can even start expanding you have to build a bunch of houses. So even though there are only four kinds of resource production buildings it takes hours to build them all! AVOID THIS GAME, IT'S NOTHING LIKE THEY PROMISED.			",307,39,5,54,54,2,120

												WOW!  So fun!!  I usually don't write reviews - but I had to let people who are undecided about buying it know how much I am enjoying it.It is NOT hard - the guided tutorial when you play walks you right through it.  NOTE; BUILD ""ASSEMBLY WORKBENCHES"" IN THE CARPENTRY AND PUT ONE IN EVERY 'WORKSHOP' (except the Chemical Workshop).  This allows you to build your ""Brick Ceramic Kiln"" etc.  I have not run into a single bug!  My colony is at day 60 and plays smooth and bug-free (as near as I can tell).  I  only have a Intel Q6600 - but I do have a GTX950 that helps I am sure.You know it is an addicting game when you wake up and the first thing you want to do is play.Bottom-line; It is a STEAL for only $29. P.S.  If it seems your peeps are not carrying out your orders, just give them time.  They seem to like to loaf and chat with others a lot - heh, just like where I work!Enjoy!			",6,1,0,4,3,1,11

Early Access Review
								Quite entertaining for what it is, the AI still needs some work but I'm confident Gaslamp will produce a winner with this title. I've kept an eye on this game for awhile, but I hadn't bought it until it went on sale when they released the first Beta patch. It's not the most intuitive game in the genre, but it presents the world with style and more UI polish is something that will come in time. The creatures in the world, the writing and the variety of options are impressive. I have read a lot about how some of the AI traits evolved, for example when they first started experimenting with the playable alpha they realized that alcoholics were actually good soldiers, because they could forget the horrors of the battles they had been in.For those who are familiar with Gaslamp Games previous work, Dungeons of Dredmor, they will know that Gaslamp cultivated an enthusiastic community and embraced their work after the game was released. I am confident that Clockwork Empires will be the same way after it reaches 1.0. This project is far more ambitious, but the game is already very playable and entertaining.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played it a bunch in alpha a few years ago. Game is released and still has most of the old bugs I ran into all those years ago, some of which I even personally reported on the forums. Very laggy after a few minutes of gameplay. AI is still unresponsive and slow. What a pathetic ""grab the cash and run"" attempt this turned out to be.If the universe was fair, these people would be sued and the customers would get their money back. That's the risk you take buying alpha games I guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My Review:+A great city builder that is more immersive in the daily lives of its citizens, you play a bigger role in what goes on than other games like Banished.+Very satisfying in doing even the small things like building houses/structures+Robust faction system that helps carrying the game into end-game+NPC's have their own personalities and so it is fun to watch them grow- Game is incredibly slow to start out, even at 2x speed the first few days really drag on.- Micro managing your citizens can become a pretty daunting task when your town begins to really grow.Verdict: For sure worth checking out and buying, the devs put a ton of work into this game and it deserves to be recognized.My video review:

												This game is not as complex as Rimworld but it still have large amount of contents that satisfy me, and I'm not a type of person who would choose to play one game in a genre for my whole life. Each base-building games give me a different vibe, that's why there are many FPS titles and gamers don't pick only one perfect game to play.Here's what I think about Clockwork Empires in 1.0 versionPros- large amount of contents- 3D models with nice animations (many people always complain about this game graphic, but I can't think of any base-building games that have better graphic than CE)- colonists have feeling, needs, personal history so they feel more like a person to us  (many games in base-building genres don't have this mechanic so they look like mindless drones)- many kind of biomes****Improvement since my last review****- The game world is not quiet anymore (but still lack of natural sound ambient)- overall animations look smoother now- UI is quite polished- I think I heard some new music in game - AI seem to be smarter, now they do every jobs they are supposed to do- Building constructions seem to be faster than EA versionI think it's good enough to be release as 1.0 versionCons- NOT ENOUGH random events in early game, it's going to be repetitive experience if every colony starter stage is the same.Early game in CE should be more random, and overwhelm with craziness like what we've experienced in Don't Starve.The world in Clockwork Empires is full of craziness but it comes too late, Rimworld doesn't have supernatural things like CE but it never feel boring because every start in that game is full of random events.- Sound and Music volume slider should be included in in-game option, not in the game launcher. Other smaller developers can do this, why can't you? tbh I think this game have less impressive music among other base-buiding titles. Retro Pixel Castle is a smaller game, but it has much better music.Also I don't think I ever heard voice from female colonists, while I can hear from the male one sometimes.- No method to dismiss colonists that you don't like- Biomes need to be unlocked. While we can choose to play at any biomes in other base-building games, CE want us to unlock it by completing some requirement first, I don't know where they get ""hey, let's make our game have more limitation than other games"" idea, but I don't like it.DLC WISH LIST Dark World or Underworld biome  - I want to see my colonists try to settling in the home world of cultists' god. It's should be extremely dangerous, and full of strange things happened.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								ok this game has promise BUT currently as it is there does not seem to be any point to it, resources dont allow you to develop anything, and the trading does not let you pick up resource you are sorely missing.  The population cap stops you from doing anything significant to try and grow your colony and the fact you can NEVER EVER feed who you have ensures failure.  Currently the game consistantly crashes, but that is the least of my problems with it the biggest issue being that you get the feeling the developers have no idea what they want the game to be.  A further indicator is the lack of current updates which gives me the feeling even the devs have given up on it.			",30,3,1,8,28,0,22

								Had promise, now it's in a death spiral. The developers have incorporated an unkeep mechanic into the game such that one has to continually produce a series of 'repair trunks' and then make sure enough overseers are available to perform building maintenance using these trunks. This particular mechanic simply does not mesh with all of the other aspects of the game and throws a wrench into the entire operation. The sad part is that the developers are clearly devoted to maintaining this aspect for some reason, and as such are going to sabatoge the entire game with it.			",72,19,0,45,5,0,15

												I might get flak for this, but I'm saying it nonetheless.As it stands, Clockwork Empires is what it should be - a beta goaded into release by the fanbase nagging Gaslamp about it.It's fun for me - looking at what my colonists unearth, what kinds of conflicts may happen between them, what names the RNJesus comes up with, what eldritch abominations lurk around, what is the seventh mine layer - it's fun.The game can be a bit dull, and the symptoms of being a teeny bit underbaked are all there, but for something that spent about two years in what the devs specifically called Pre-Alpha, it is a completely normal, middle-of-the-road experience.There is potential in Clockwork Empires, and seeing this game go under would be, simply put, sad.

								I had written a bad review before the new updates. Which has now been delete so as not to confuse.The game is challenging but is a work in progress. Since the new updates it is becoming not overwhelmingly difficult which does mean a far more enjoyable and relaxed game play.There are still many improvements that many players have mentioned in forums and disscussions which I'm sure the developers have been keeping track of.The main ones are:- Slow/sketchy gameplay after reaching about 80+ population- Population capped at 100 (Believe this is going to be resolved once colonists start claiming houses thus being able to multiply)Some of the recommedations I think would be good in next update:- Resources; Once the kitchen is built and work crew assigned. Food cooked here should count more for decreasing hunger in colonists. Thus helping to lower the chance of running out of food.- Trading with Allies and Neutral Tribes- Colonists that are armed (such as hunters) can also help army defend colony- Limits to how big you can build buildingsThere are other little peeves but they'll probably be teethed out as these improvements are made.All up Clockwork Empires is starting to become a game I can see myself enjoying and if you like management/Stragety/Building games then I'm sure like me you'll see the potetial of this game and where it's head.

								I am absolutey loving this game at the moment , of course there are alot of things that could be fixed though : 1) The AI of the colonists , they seem to not protise anything.2) Fix the cancel job button , the cancel button does not work >:/And many more bugs and issues .I would reccomend this game to anyone looking for a nice slow paced town building game which settles in a some what realistic but buggy as hell world xD			",98,16,0,22,53,0,27

												This game has creativity and inspiration in huge quantities.  The interface can be obtuse and there can be confusing bits, but it definitely delivers on the promised drama of trying to keep a colony alive in the face of Strange Things.  I am having a blast with it and I recommend it highly, especially if you are a Lovecraft nerd.			",88,27,0,13,22,0,26

								Build a colony from humble beginings to a mighty sprawling city. Set in a steampunk, victorian colonial world with a darker side.A daunting amount of options lie within this little gem, fully customizable buildings and in depth colonist management combined with varied and colorful personalities makes for a very personal and interesting expirience with every play.Now this on it's own would make for a great little simulation game...but as with any genre in my opinion this one's spiced up by a touch of lovecraftian and otherworldy horror as you fend off fish people and try to keep your colonists from worshipping the old gods and outer beings that haunt there dreams.Or allow there worship...Highly reccomended.

								Edit 20/10/15:So after following development for a little while, I feel that I may have been a little harsh.I never had any doubt that the team were both talented and motivated as I thoroughly enjoyed DoD, but felt that CE was out the door a litle too soon, albeit in my view from the outside.Since buying the game I've seen a flurry of interim patches that address a lot of both the newer and longstanding issues, and the next major patch should hopefully fix a huge gripe of mine (as in not make the military as useless as a paper condom).In light of what I've seen I'm changing my review to a positive, with the following caveat;This is still early access, with a team that aren't afraid to muck about under the hood with regularity and gusto. Things will and do break, but there's enough here now that it's an enjoyable experience, at least for supply chain afficianados like myself, at least those who bear in mind this is still in heavy development.I never had any doubt this would be a great game at release, it's finally got to the stage where the journey is fun too. Original:Can't recommend at the minute, game has potential but it's just too damn buggy to really enjoy as of yet. GLG really need to lock down what's already in game before adding more content,			",285,86,10,104,202,5,160

The devs are really working on this with a lot of passion and humor, so just wait it out for now. Unless you'd like, just like I did, to support the developers and speed up the process, get it now and wait for beta.It will take some time to be finished, but the way in which the game is developing is superb.

												If Sims 3 and Banished were to have a baby this game would be it.   It is a tower defense city builder where you have to keep your villagers happy enough to get them to build and defend the city.  This game is challenging, even on easy mode.Fairly slow paced,which is good and there is enough going on to keep you interested.Recommended for owners of Sims 3 and 4, Banished, Gnomoria, Towns and Planetbase.  You should find some comfort here in that these games all have the same ""feel"" to them.With that said, I would caution you that the tutorial isn't very indepth (which I believe was intentional by the developers).  It will take you a few play throughs before you will begin to learn how to survive the game.			",154,18,4,43,45,1,35

								currently i would not recommend anyone buying this game, despite the fact its in early access, the game you are buying this early is not much more than a teaser..the game concept is great if your into these sort of games, but after playing for 10-20 mins the game will most likly have crashed on you, trying to save the game a 2nd time will usually crash the game while you save (not recoverable) or using many of the more delicated featurs.while many featurs are fustrating to use (such as placing building areas but being unable to delete areas you misplaced) they are ofc only part of the early access lackings.but overall the price is way to high for a product this unstable, after all you are helping promoting there game, not vice versa.I did highly recommend saving your money for a month or 2 before reconsidering buying this early access.

								This game is the worst case of pay to test I have come across in a very long time. I purchased it several years ago and was extremely disapointed by not only the glacial progress being made but the lack of any real roadmap for the game. Major features were release into beta and completely scrapped a week later. A great example of this is farming which must have been pointlessly rebalaced at least 100 times. The beta patch history is an aimless list of wasted time and I'm shocked that they are calling this 1.0 when major features like the chest building maint system was created. added and scapped not two patches ago. It looks to me like the devs have run out of steam and are just arbitrarily saying here take this mismatched incomplete random product because we are done. This game is a dream that didnt make it and buyers should prob avoid it			",26,19,0,29,25,1,33

Early Access Review
								Alright, this game is in beta supposedly, and according to the developers is nearing full release. It's an indie game and costs about 1/2 as much as the Witcher 3. So is it at least 1/2 as good a value as the witcher 3? No, not even one tenth. Is it polished enough to issue it as a finished game? No. In fact I would dare say it's currently in alpha. It's broken and rough, for instance if you go into the options menue you risk being overwhelmed by the plethora of choices, such as music; On or Off. That's right, On or Off. Do you want to change the volume? No problem, just exit onto the main menue and... Oh wait, you can't, you need to exit the game, then restart it, and THEN on that starting screen you can change the volume. But not much else. Every time the game loads, you're pretty much past the point of certain that is has crashed again (nothing moves, the music stops), and THEN it starts.Betas can work, as long as you've got a somewhat stable and solid setup. Clockwork Empires combines the helplessness and slow♥♥♥♥♥pace of the Settlers with a grueling difficulty level close to that of Banished. The AI or AS rather, is what you find yourself relying on, yet it fails again and again to complete even the simplest of tasks, creating bottlenecks and downward spirals for your colonies. I've seen them wasting days picking things  up and dropping them, picking them up and dropping them, again and again. And you wonder why that vital building project isn't being built, that's why. I've seen them pick up resources and then heading out into the wilderness to gather more of said resource. Because whenever I go out to gather stones, I always bring some heavy boulders with me, because why not. It only gets better when said colonist gets spooked by some wildlife, drops the resources in the middle of nowhere and runs back home empty handed. The cooks finish meals only to gobble them down the second after and just, wow. I could go on.There's no prioritizing certain projects, unless you want to pause every other project, and even then with a work crew assigned to do just about everything, they're still mostly Idle, chatting away, and eating ten times their body weight, doing pretty much everything except the one thing you need them to.In 10hours, I've played 2 Colonies. Only 2 you say? Yes, because this game is SLOW! There's no fastforward button, buildings are erected in real time, colonists plod along in a zombie like pace etc. In both cases I've found that starvation is very hard to counteract, mostly because you don't start with any staple crops. The first time I started in the arctics, could grow nothing but cabbages; they sowed, reaped, and ate the produce right away while standing in the fields, didn't have the time to process or stockpile it. Hunting is unreliable, foraging doesn't yield enough, so what to do.The second time I started on a savannah, got chilli, tea and sugar. Does any of those sound like staple crops to you? At first I thought I could get by on hunting, but no. The meat dropped by the giant beetles apparently taste horrid and doesn't satisfy, and in either case isn't plentiful enough. Not even when they go cannibalistic do they manage to fill their bellies. Apparently eating a whole human isn't enough to satisfy their hunger needs once they're starving!Despite my best efforts to get along with the fishpeople, one of my moronic colonists went and raided one of their hatching piles when I wasn't looking and hadn't told him to, and as a result, I now get constant, endless, raiding parties whittling away at my starving colonists. My colonists' staple diet now consists of fishpeople steaks. Which they hate, and are STILL starving.When you need overseers you get workers, when you need workers you get overseers. There's always too much/too little of either or, and they apparently rely on different conditions. For instance, I managed to get a -66 relationship standing with my own empire using a diplomacy office (I kept asking for food, apparently they didn't like that). So now I never get any overseers, which means that if one of my current overseers die, I'm pretty screwed. You can't promote workers into overseers or anything like that, they are special snowflakes and if they die, which usually you have zero control over, it can be really bad. Again with the unstoppable downward spirals. Oh and you can't name the workteams either. So you can end up with The Happy Soldiers tending to a cabbage patch, and until they get skilled enough in farming, there's no quick way to see what they are doing without clicking on them (usually it just says Idle anyways, lazy bums). I get it, you have a high soldiering skill, but you're farmers now so shut up and farm.The game has plenty of those catch 22 moments that prevents you from enjoying it. In the savannah, there's apparently very little stone to be had, but it isn't obvious at first glance and I didn't know just how limited the colonists were in how far away they can move. I figured I needed a trade office to get stone. Guess what the trade office required to be built? Yes, stone. In the end, I solved it, but it's one of those cases where there's no way you could have known that it was going to be an issue and could have prepared for it in advance, since nobody told you. If you see a bunch of stone piles scattered around, you probably figure, hey I got stone, no problem. But you don't realize how little those piles actually yield in the end. And the tutorial only gives a generic runthrough (no mention of how to solve the food problem though), same for every enviroment, when it clearly shouldn't be.And you need to build a kitchen to cook. How bout a camp fire, and some tents for shelter that degrade over time. Who sends out colonists to sleep on the dirt and without proper crops to grow, apparently these people.So TLDR; it isn't balanced properly. And being forced to rely on the slow and moronic AI while nothing really happens that requires your attention, makes it that the game could just as easily be on standby without you. It isn't FUN to play is what I'm getting at. I can see a lot of potential with the idea, but some serious work is required to get it to a functioning level, and since the devs have the audacity to charge this much for a broken alpha version of the game and dare to say it's almost close to being finished; makes it so that I strongly doubt it will ever reach that potential.I would be happy if you prove me wrong though, so by all means, aim to do just that. But for now, for this price and claiming that it's almost finished when it's clearly not, gets a downvote from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is a drag.  It takes ages to get anything done, villagers wander around aimlessly, there is no way to speed up gameplay, the resource production / hauling / consumption balances are completely screwed.  Then after spending two hours slowly building up a tiny population 25% of them are killed because your soldiers run away or completely ignore the threat.  It is boring and frustrating and completely lacks any reward for the boredom and frustration.  There are plenty of other far superior DFLike/DFLite game available online.  This one is to be avoided.			",116,25,23,37,70,1,34

								The idea for this game is incredible, the features are there that should make a great game, and the development team isnt afraid to innovate. The problem though is that the optimization isn't there. I played for less than a half hour and experianced constant frame rate spikes and crashes, and the game completley crashed at both auto-save points. Though this game SHOULD be great when the development team fixes the current bugs and optimizes gameplay, it currently is not and is a long way off.Good luck to the development team, when these issues are fixed I will gladly re-buy the game and change my review, but as for now the game is unplayable.

								In its current state it simply isn't worth buying. The interface is just way to clunky and it's hard to get a good overview of your people; the only way to inspect people are one and one while it should be something more along the lines of Dwarf Therapist for Dwarf Fortress those of you that know about it.The game also lack quite a bit of convince when it comes to doing stuff, removing farm plots, being able to assign a group of people to ANY task, removing floor from a blueprint, disband workgroups, et.c. Simple things that really should have been there when each of these features were introduced. A minor annoyance I also had with the game was when its paused, animations and sounds keep playing.Finally the game lacks content which I won't hold it against since it's early access. Give it another two-three years and it might just turn out to be a good game.			",129,21,4,28,30,0,40

												I love games like this, going through my steam library I have a lot of games that I refer to as ""civ builders"" I really enjoy them. This one was just released and offers a lot that many others do to but at the end of the day I really love the setting and there's so many little things that are unique. This one has quickly skyrocketed to the top of my favorites list.It still has a few issues but the devs are the same guys who developed Dungeons of Dredmore which they updated and kept working on for more then a year afterwards adding little things and making it better. I'm really looking forward to seeing what comes of this game considering how great it already is. Thanks Gaslamp and keep up the great work!			",270,35,2,62,32,5,79

												I was positively surprised when I went to my (regular ~3months) testing session for the newest updates and see that it got a proper release. And I have to say: It is nearly perfectly playable (1.0D experimental). Pros:The tasks get worked, the provision and maintenance got a very good revamp.  Every functionality and feature I read about the years seem to be implemented and I have encountered no bugs in my last session. The music makes a good work in putting one into a creepy mood to encounter great old ones. The feeling that everything just works, even if it takes some time is just great. Also the game mechanics in itself are realy well thought about.Cons:One might think the game feels a bit slow. Everey task has to be considered if it is now a good time to do this or later. The game improved in communicating with the big Overseer (you) but could be improved also a bit. I still do not know where I get sand despite the random(?) lucky appearance of 2 in my stock. In later games one might hope for some graphic options which might improve the feeling of smoothnes in the game.What does it mean?For every lover of settling and passive building strategy games: it is now time to try it out. Me thinks if your PC is not older than 3 years than the smoothnes should be no problem. I do hope though that we get some middle big updates just to improve the general gameplayability in term of performance and feedback to the user.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hi, I tried to like this game very much. The story telling is nice. But over all the game at its current state has too many bugs.The game mechanic is to remove and delete buildings, and it does not even handle this properly.Also there seems to be bugs with certain pawns getting stuck attempting to do an action. Without super micro management the poor AI and the poor UI it is almost next to impossible to set anything up properly.Now I did play and understood the game and its workings, just it is not currently playable without extreme micro management.The UI is very large and blocks a lot of your view of the game. It is single task oriented. You can't check resources while trying to craft something. You can't check the current pawns that are idle to send them to do something. The delete function of tasks does not work all that well since sometimes pawns become stuck if you delete a task while they were trying to do it.If you modify anything while the AI is attempting to do it you almost break the game. Resource labels don't display properly, Pawn labels don't display properly. Dead pawns sometimes stay in the list of pawns that are alive.But, this being said the game is quiet enjoyable feel, I just wish it was not so riddled with bugs.I would play this game again if the bugs were fixed.

								So I know it's an EA game, but it's been out for over a year and it's got some OK reviews so I figured it'd be playable.  It looks like it might be fun, but it's hard to tell because the game always crashes instantly.  It seems like they don't bother with the stable/experimental release distinction that most EA games enforce.The forums are just hundreds of posts about a dizzying array of bugs hitting people everywhere from immediately (like me -- can't get the game to run for more than a few seconds) to days and days into their game.For the price, I'd suggest you stay away until the game stabilizes.

												At its current stage I could not recommend this game, its just so damn boring. It's a shame really because alot of the concepts are cool and the graphics and atmosphere of the game is more appealing then other games of its kind. the issue with this game is that even though its been out in ""early access"" for a while. yet the developer seems to put alot of its effort into certain content when what this game needs is a large amount of bug removal and a few things that would make me play this game rather then assign tasks then play hearthstone on my phone for a half hour. for this game to actually capture my attention for more then that amount of time it would be nice if A. you could speed up time, and B. make it so your weak♥♥♥♥♥workers can pick up more then 1 thing in a stack (like more then 1 log/stone/plank). its sad when i have to assign my military to haul♥♥♥♥♥♥and even then im still having to wait for ever in order to actually play the game.-Edit as of 11/15/2016-so after waiting for a long time for this game to come out and finally playing it after release, its still boring and buggy. two of my main complaints seem to have been answered and the fact that your workers can now carry stacks of items makes this game atleast go some what faster, but unfortunatly your workers can build buildings quickly...but then hit a wall when it comes to resources. This is where i thought the ability to speed time up would come in handy but it seems the developer just wanted to add an eye rolling 2x speed which I had to have on at all times because crafting is so slow with out a large population.Maybe 2x speed wouldnt be so bad but the AI is still as dumb as it was in early access. for instance I watched once worker stack a pile of logs, into a stack and walk off. then a different laborer walked up, split the stack into 18 and walked off. A 3rd laborer walked over, carried that stack to the contruction site, wandered around for about 15 seconds (in 2x speed) and then descided that she could build the building now. Its also strange to see one of your soldiers runs into melee range with a rifle as another example...you know a ranged weapon. I could recommend this maybe if you are bored, have alot of time or are really patient as well as really loving this type of game.			",239,67,0,46,39,2,34

												Don't be put off by all the negative reviews. This is still a solid game worth your time.Yes, it still has its rough edges and bugs, and appears to have been rushed for release, but the setting and ideas of Clockwork Empires are incredibly original, especially for a sim/city-builder. The real shame is that so many of us, espescially Early Access supporters, had such high hopes that the devs weren't fully able to execute on. I would love to see them continue to support and polish this game to truly make it something special.If you love city builders and appreciate taking the time to learn and invest in the systems of the game, including its micromanagement-based economy (admittedly not for everyone), then you'll have lots to love and appreciate about Clockwork Empires.

								Clockwork Empires has a lot of charm, and its development gives great hopes as the team is doing the job seriously. The game is a colony-building, with bandits, fishpeople, foreign powers, and dark cults. Of course it's actually in Alpha stage, and far from completed, but it already offers some good moments, and the updates are regular and going in the right direction. The interface is still uncomfortable, the AI is improving, more events are being added, and the ambient is quite good. So I recommend the game for those who are aware it's an Alpha, and are curious about the direction this is going.			",44,8,0,15,8,0,28

								Didn't played it for long time yet, but as for now I could say that this game future is looking really promising. It reminds me slightly of ""Dwarf Fortress"", only with less features (For now, at least) and graphic interface. Worth every penny and I do not regret purchasing it.Edit (04.05.2016): Some time has passed, couple of patches been released and I've decided to give it another try. Aaand, on the bright side: I loved the individuality in your citizens. Everyone has it's own traits, habits, manias, goals, fears, etc. They could get scared, angry, crazy, depressed, etc. They could have suicidal tendencies, communist thoughts, planning a revolt or a riot against you, join a cult and praise some ancient evil or rob your storages and run into the wilds to form a gang, so you never know what to expect from your citizens and you should keep an eye on troublesome ones... They can make friends and enemies among other settlers and that is a pretty big and not that common feature in games. What I did not like is, there is no subterranian layer and you can only build on the surface and also, there isn't much space for your creativity, as all the buildings are square-shaped and pretty much looks the same. The difference is the utility and decorations, but that's about all... And this is a buzzkill after you got a while playing the game, everything starts to feel the same.Also, the updates are reeeaaally slow. It takes about 2-3 monts for a new update, so maybe I'll check on this game later. But for now, there isn't anything else to report. I loved the personality of your settlement, but the planning/building part is a meh'.			",435,59,4,47,45,4,68

								This game could be really neat. I know this is EA and a lot might still change, who knows. I just don't expect many changes anymore as has been the case with most EA games (and this game has been out for 1.5 years already!). I really like the concept and the graphics though and I usually like these kind of games. But here the gameplay is really, really boring. There are not many different building types that you build (which can take a while and all you do is watch and wait) and besides that there is really nothing to do. 100 colonists max is also not a lot to work with. It's way, way too easy, there are no challenges, no real goals just nothing to do there. Also the game constantly crashes and the UI and menus are horrible in their current state. I will certainly update this review if anything more should be added or improved.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A few hours ago I decided to write a review for this game. I bought Clockwork Empires because it looked like a cool project, a Dwarf Fortress kind of game - a game that could produce the fascinating situations that arise from the complex interaction between your colonists and the enviroment they inhabit.I felt like I wrote a fair and balanced review, based on my experience with this game. I decided to play it a bit more, research its mechanics and the basics of how this game works and its community. This brought me to realize I was wrong, my earlier review was not fair.This game doesn't have any working mechanics, this doesn't have basic functions, this game is not just in the very early stages of development - Clockwork Empires isn't developing at all.Nobody knows how this game works, not even the people developing it. I read the official forums, and I see that the problems people are having, are not because of the bugs or them misunderstanding the various functions of this game. It is because there are no functions, there is no logic or reason to anything going on in the game.It is chaos. No reason, no logic, no basics - nothing to rely on. It is an utterly incomprehensible mess.The developers will at some point have to realize there is no way they can salvage this. Like other early access developers, there will come a point where they will be forced to abandon this project.http://clockworkempires.gamepedia.com/Clockwork_Empires_Wiki That is the link to the Clockwork Empires wiki. A place one goes to when you need a basic explanation of how something works in a game. The wiki contains no answers - no facts - no basics. Just rambling steampunk fantasy texts, but nothing in relation to how the game works, because it doesn't.IN CONCLUSION:Don't buy this. This is just a fantasy project. This will never turn into a game and you will have wasted almost 30 Euro on absolutely nothing. It is steampunk fanfiction visualised into some kind of bizarre abomination of a computer program. First I thought it might end up as a finished product, since the developers are so dedicated and obviously invested time and money into this. I get the feeling they put their heart and soul into this too. Sadly they built the foundation of their dream on top of quicksand, so no matter how much they work on this - it will inevitably sink down into the depths.			",82,8,2,8,37,1,20

								-----------UpdateStill recommending you hold off on buying.I have figured out a big part of the problem.  The dev team needs to fix the pacing and needs management.You need too many facilities on day 1 and your settlers work much too slowly.  Keep in mind that you start with around 9 people and they all work SLOWLY.* You need a lower class house for everyone to sleep in.  Building it will take about 3 days.* You'll need a carpenter, which gets built relatively quickly but still a little too long. - And assign an overseer to it.* The lower class house will also need beds, so you'll need cloth, which means you also have to build a textile workshop (this is where it starts adding up) and assign an overseer to it.* In order to get the flax you need for cloth, you'll have to make a farm for it and assign an overseer wtih a team team to it. * Keep in mind, these buildings take stone and wood so you'll need to have overseers wtih teams gathering those as well. * You need to feed everyone so you have to build a kitchen and assign an overseer to it, preferrably with a team. * The kitchen needs food to cook so you'll need to make another farm and assign an overseer with a team to it. * There are going to be bandits and fish people attacking soon (even if you decide to avoid conflict, your people will seek it out) so you need to build a barracks and assign an overseer with a team to it. * The CONSTANT fighting is going to require the services of a Barber (doctor) so build that and assign an overseer to it. * Within a few days, people will be complaining that they're sleeping below their station and they want a church.  To build either of these, you'll need a ceramics workshop so build it and assign an overseer to it. * You can forgo the church but it just adds more fighting because of cultists. * Settlers DO NOT DEFEND THEMSELVES - EVEN WHEN ARMED.  This is insane.  Once your guards have been whittled away, a single enemy will slowly destroy your entire settlement.  And even if they are eventually stopped, they kill valuable overseers making it impossible to keep up with the overwhelming basic needs of the settlement.End of update-----------------------------------------------------------Have ""played"" for several hours now.  Moves SO SLOWLY and takes forever to get anything done.  Feels more like a screensaver than a game.I was excited about this game because of all of the hype around the intelligence of the people making it and how intricate behavior would be.  It doesn't feel intelligent AT ALL.  There really isn't any good information presented to the player to help them know what's going on or why.  This game needs a TON of work in making it easier to understand what's happening with the people and the settlement.  Help me out a little.Fishpeople bring me gifts, drop them off, then proceed to attack and kill everyone.  Just keep your damn gifts, fishpeople!  I haven't even done anything to provoke an attack, much less the non-stop fish raids.Settlers with rifles just running around and getting killed by fishpeople instead of defending themselves.Again.... takes forever for colonists to get anything done.  They are demanding buildings that can't be provided because they can't even take care of the basics in a reasonable amount of time.  Waiting literal hours for jobs to get done is insane.As I write this, I'm down to 1 Overseer, fishpeople have been in my town, killing people, non-stop for reasons I don't know, and there is now an army preparing to invade me.  Losing like this would be great if I felt like I had anything to do with it.  Instead, I feel like the devs just have some lazy code in here.FINALFar from intelligent.Far fom done (hopefully).Far from fun.			",92,6,0,17,24,2,26

												WARNING: It looks like this game may no longer be supported by the developer. There hasn't been a game or social media update that I've been able to find since around November. I wasn't able to confirm this or rumors that Gaslamp has shut down, but be aware that there MAY be no further updates to the game.Given the above warning, I still enjoyed the game and feel that you could get your money's worth.Disclosure: I was given a free press copy in order to create a video review of the game, available here: 


YouTube™ Video: Let's Try Clockwork Empires - Steampunk City Builder in a Lovecraft Setting 

			Views: 204		

			Clockwork Empires is a city building game set in a steampunk, Lovecraftian world, complete with eldritch horrors! Buy Clockwork Empires on Steam :...		

PRO:+ The steampunk/Lovecraftian setting is quite interesting+ Having to manage ""hard"" needs like food, safety, etc., as well as things like happiness, sanity, etc kept things varied and interesting.+ Good variety of building types+ Random events like airship crashes create some interesting opportunities and reasons to have access to certain buildings/professions+ Random area generation+ In-game help/information is helpful for the most partCON:- The Overseer/Laborer system is a bit cumbersome. - AI can be a bit wonky at times- Micromanaging laborers gets tedious at times- Time controls are limited to Normal speed, 2X speed and pausedOverall:A fun game that had me playing for quite awhile and I still haven't seen a lot of the advanced buildings/mechanics. While there is a very real concern that the game has been abandoned, I feel that you can get your money's worth. If the prospect of the game no longer being supported puts you off, I'd still suggest taking a look again when it goes on sale.			",290,79,1,49,45,3,29

Early Access Review
								Concept is great could be a good game, but right now its not. Purchased this on a whim and at first its fun and exciting but it wears off quickly with constant crashes (about one every half hour or so) there is not autosave so unless you save manually (which could cause a crash thus negate saving the game) you are SOL. There is no way to deconstruct and some structures will bug out and not work (had my storage area just stop working so no one would stock items there as well as my woodshop just stop producing planks). like I said the game is fun and could go places but there is the folly of early access, most people will buy and never play again due to the bad taste it leaves in your mouth. Heed the steam early access warning and wait for this game to work itself out (if it ever does). Or if you're like me and want to waste $30 because you're bored on a sunday afternoon, have at it.

												TL:DR ""Needs work""There is a lot of promise here, but this game is not ready for prime time.  I've been playing since first version was made available on Steam and progress has been made but I would still consider this game in BETA.Some noticeable bugs:* you raise your standing with the Empire (100) so they are sending you Steam Knights to assist... except their weapons are blowing up your enemies AND your colonists to bits * stockpiles keep disappearing (no fun when food stock goes from 600 to 0 in a second)* colonists get stuck in a loop (this happens a lot in a church when 2 citizens are in a confession loop and die of hunger) * with around 75 colonists the AI seems to be wonky at times when all of them pause for few seconds before moving on (not sure if this is due to path-finding issues)Other observations:* Building mechanic needs templates; since i'm going to build a lot of houses with the same layout (6x6 with 2 windows + door + 3 cots) let me save the design into a template and save myself some time on the next build.* there are some cool story elements while you are sand boxing your game but this game needs a single player, story-driven campaign (i.e Settlers 2)* UI is not finished and needs to be more accessible, scrolling through lists is not fun, this isn't excel and i would think most people are playing on 1080p and above by now.
