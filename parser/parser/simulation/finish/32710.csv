												As much of a gem that this was back when it was released, sadly it doesnt play very well on modern systems. Max resolution is extremely low, and controls (joystick and keyboard) are extremely clunky.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A old game that is kind of a challenge right when you start the game. It is hard to kill other tanks if your not used to this game. It's graphics very old and blocky. The gameplay is not really great but can keep you entertained for a little bit. I wouldn't recommend this game to any army buff that wants good tank fighting. Make sure if you do decide to get this game make sure its packed with other games with it.			",3039,1134,139,314,429,33,477
