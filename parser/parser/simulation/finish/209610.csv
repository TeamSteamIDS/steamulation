												What can I say about this game?...  Well, it’s fun.  It’s frustrating.  It’s simple.  It’s small.  Did I mention it’s fun?  That said, it's not worth $10, and I'll tell you why;Roller Coaster Rampage is pretty different from every other roller coaster game I’ve played.  The coasters in this game are virtually “created” as you ride them.  Trust me, it’s a very unique experience, and often that is where a lot of frustration comes from.There are 2 modes you can currently play in Roller Coaster Rampage.  There’s the Campaign mode where you basically try to collect as many gems as you can while linking your on-the-fly track with already pre-constructed pieces of track.  Then there’s the Free Ride mode, in which you just make a coaster any way you like.  You'll find yourself spending most of your time in Free Ride, as the Campaign mode is rather easy and only has about 30-ish challenges to finish.I found quite a few things dissapointing about this game.  One disappointment with this game was the content seemed to be drastically lacking.  It’s virtually impossible to build the same coaster, but you only have one location so the scenery all around you is always the same.  The location is rather small as well, leaving you struggling to build any ride that lasts longer than a minute or two.  The coaster itself was also always the same.  You couldn’t change to a wooden one, or a hanging one, or any other coaster than the standard metal one.  The starting station was always the same, however in Campain Mode it was sometimes rotated a bit to make your launching and landing directions different.Element impacts (crashing into objects) were random as well.  Some things like the coaster track legs would get out of your way as you crossed them and other times you would ram into them and your hard work would come to an immediate and very violent end.  Occasionally when legs did move they would interfere with a part of the track you already built, leaving you to sloppily go right through a track leg when you went back and rode the coaster after it's built.  It was impossible to know if it’s safe to cross under another track or not.  This made most of my coasters climb as they progressed and then dive back into the station at the end, instead of having a large hill at the very beginning.  It also kept me from doing several cool maneuvers, like having a loop run through the center of another loop.  Scenery was also touch-and-go as well.  It was hard to tell what you could safely pass through and what you couldn’t.  On occasion, sometimes an object would be deadly to your coaster one pass and safe the next.  It was a mix that made it hard to do the quick decision making that the game requires you to make.Another thing that brought frustrations was the control layout.  I found the controls really awkward, especially since you have to really think fast while playing.  Your acceleration/breaking and “roll” was controlled by the WASD keys while the arrow keys controlled left/right and up/down movement.  You also had the numbers 1-3 for “stunts” like left/right corkscrews and looping.  It probably would have been a much better setup with Q and E for the corkscrews and maybe R or F for looping.  That would be more common, and easier, for those who are practiced in FPS games.It’s not all bad though.  I really enjoy this game as a simple time waster.  It’s fast to load and you can quickly get yourself into the “Free Mode”.  Even if you’ve only got 10 minutes to waste you can get a few rides in before you have to shut it down.  I often find myself firing up this game in those few minutes before leaving for work, just because I know it’s a game that you can be satisfied with only playing it 5 minutes.The purchase price of $9.99 is very high, and it's the main reason I'm not giving my recommendation for this game.  There's just too much lacking.  A lack of content makes it nothing more than a quick time waster.  The controls are frustrating.  The unchanging scenery is just lazy game designers.  It's not worth $10.I bought the game as part of a 4-game bundle for $5.99 which makes my purchase worth it.  If you can buy it like that, or on sale for no more than $2, then go for it.  Otherwise you're just paying Cadillac prices to own a Ford.			",151,43,3,34,48,2,29

												If you're tired of those Tycoon games with the boring coasters; this game is for you! If you dislike games with very clunky controls that makes it impossible to play; you'll hate this game. The utter freedom in creating any coaster design you want is great; even if you create physically impossible coasters that would rip it's riders apart; and the fast action makes it addictive. But, still, those controls. They make absolutely no sense; they're hard to get to when you need them and you'll find yourself spending more time crashing your coaster becuase you weren't able to get turned quick enough. It's a fun game, it's a *really* fun game; but the controls aren't suited for the kind of fast paced action this game throws at you. They're clunky, they're cumbersome, and they're just in no way suited for this game. If you find it on sale; it's worth about 2 bucks; but I wouldn't give any more for this game. It's a game you'll play; you'll probably never actually advance.			",48,4,10,3,20,0,2

One of the worst rollercoaster simulator games ever.[/b]Now don't hate this review because I played the game for 16 minutes...Please sit back and easily read my comment.Don't get me wrong, I like simulator/tycoon games, especially rollercoaster,waterpark.But this one is just a no. At first I was suprisingly amazed by the screenshots of the game and wanned to buy it, but now I saw it in a bundle, on bundlestars. Got the bundle... And I was suprised...Its actually alot worse than I though.Don't let the screenshots fool you.Its hard to explain this thing by text, and hard for you to understand why you shouldn't get this game.So let me explain this easier - heres cons and pros.Pros:+ Graphics,textures.+ Doesn't take alot of space.+ Good animations.+ Controller support. (I haven't tried it.)+ Workshop??!? (? - I'm not sure about this, they said they have one tho it doesn't show up here. But yeah I guess its coming soon feature.)Cons:- Bad menu.- Only 1 track color.- Only 1 coaster design.- Boring after first half hour - hour.- No new coaster parts.Anyways, its a no from me.

												DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS IT IS ON SALEI know that sounds harsh but it's something that has to be said.A lot of people aren't recommending this game.I see why. Roller Coaster Rampage is simply a game about Roller Coasters. That's it.However, This game delivers everything that it promises. (I haven't seen much destruction in my playtime though.) The graphics for this game look 2007-ish, and not up to modern specs. The Coaster Creation is an innovative idea, although it takes a bit of getting used to. Most players would feel more comfortable playing this with a controller. The campaign (as it's called in game) is merely a set of simple challenges that can be completed quite easily, and they seem very repetitive. There is only 1 park available in Roller Coaster Rampage, and it gets small and boring, fast. If you could walk around the park and visit other attractions, the game could be reasonably fun. However, you cannot.Free-Play mode is where the game shines. The track can be easily created and then you can ride the insane monstrosity you've created (But I couldn't find a save button). It's pretty neat, but construction can get messy with lots of rails and support beams everywhere. When you hit high speeds the track seems to get choppy (even though the game renders at a nice 60 fps), and the railcars seem unable to follow physics.Workshop support is 'Coming Soon!', but I have no idea how long that's been there.But why do I recommend this game? It's simply a fun little time killer. I bought it for $2.50 during the Holiday Sale, and that's as much as this game is worth. If you're thinking about dropping $10 on this, wait for it to go on sale for $2 or less.tl;drGraphics: 7/10 - looks cartoony, but a little on the low-def side.Overall Gameplay: 6/10 Needs fine tuning, and a controller greatly helps.Campaign: 5/10 - Average challenges that add little to mechanics and design.Free-Play: 8/10 - Fun, but you cannot save tracks. Physics and Construction seem a bit wonky.Overall Score - 6/10. Average, but definitely not worth $10. Wait for a sale.			",156,31,5,10,14,1,7

												Wow, that's all I can say to be honest. This is really not the sort of game I would normally play, while it is a pretty terrible game, I strangly found my self laughing and actually having a good time. I will probably never open this game ever again but still. The aim is to build a roller coaster in real time as you are riding it. This can lead to some pretty hilarious sitations. The amount of times my cart went flying across the map using some weird rag doll effect and cracked me up was too many to count. Need cheering up? You'll find a barrel of laughs right here...

												This game has a nice change of pace concept for a coaster sim.  Its not a theme park came, but very much a build as you ride coaster generator. The concept is nice and create an easy pick up and play format. However, I find there is one main flaw in this game and that is the lack of a rewind feature.  It is quite frustrating to build a really long coaster and have it crash right at the end and have to start all over.  Either restarting 10 seconds before the crash or just a simple rewind feature to be able to go back to any point in your build and deviate from your original plan.  I would invest a lot more time in this game if this was the case. Otherwise, I see myself playing it seldomly.			",83,25,0,10,9,1,10

												This plays kind of like a magic carpet ride.  Wasnt sure what I was expecting from a 3d roller coaster, but in this game you just kind of move around and it lays track as you go.  You dont plan it out as in other tycoon type games.  In this game you need to collect gems adn do stunts.  The controller support is ok but the game is very picky if a jump says 50 mph, and your at 51 or 49 you crash.  Crashing would be more fun if people were on the roller coaster screaming, but the game is mostly silent minus a muted background track.  Meh, woulda been more fun to build a wild ride like Mr.Bones but there is no real building in this game just as you go.  Kind of like stearing a plane but it lays roller coaster track.Rating:  2/10  Value:  $1.99			",2655,1122,101,267,367,29,398

												Roller Coaster Rampage is an interesting twist on roller coaster building.  Don't expect to build amazing, realistic coasters because that is hard to do, but collecting gems and smashing through objects is a lot of fun.  It's definitely a lot better using a controller.  I use my xbox one controller and plug it into my PC and it works great.  The graphics and scenery look pretty cool too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The graphics are alright and its nice to build a coaster so high that you can barely see the ground, but just watch out where you place your tracks. This is not a tycoon game, nowhere near it. This is a strategy coaster building game that will push you to your  frustration limits.			",258,66,4,11,40,2,19

												Literally the worst game I have ever played. It's broken, it's buggy, the controls are horrific. It presents itself as a roller coaster ""game""... but it's more of an awkward physics-less flight sim that draws a roller coaster track behind you... poorly... as you go.Every time I think about that I gave this developer money, I cringe and get irrationally angry. It is a complete disgrace of a game, and a shameless money grab. If Steam had their current review policy back when I bought this, rest assured that I would have returned it.Do not, under any circumstances, waste your money on this garbage.			",31,5,6,2,3,0,5

Then yea you can ride the coasters but usually it's such a mess it's nothing like a real coaster.  It's only a few bucks at the moment, and its sort of a fun mini-game, but I can't really recommend this.  Oh yea, there is NO keyboard or mouse support, must have controller.

												Though the story can be vague at times from what I can tell, Roller Coaster Rampage is a funfilled game about a roller coaster that is possed by some sort of demon. Powerd by blood, the rollercoaster builds itself as it rides whilst feeding on its RAMPAGING destruction. Though beware! A lone monk has randomly blessed some nondestinct objects making them indestrucble, but which ones? Thats for you to find out! All in all, one big thrill ride of non consquential faffing about featuring both reflection and refraction.3/10			",150,44,3,23,22,3,36
