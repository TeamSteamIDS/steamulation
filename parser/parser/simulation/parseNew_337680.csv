												This review is a tough one, because I wanted to like this game - a lot.The concept is a really nifty thing: Deliver tactical-pause mechanics to the same genre occupied by, say, ""Homeworld."" In a trailer it looks VERY cool. Guide the trajectories of fighters, use 3D space to your advantage, set up some killer pincer movements, and just generally have some real control.That's the promise. The reality is slow, clunky, and - strategically - just like everything else. Mass your firepower, and just hammer the problem until it goes away.The 3D nature of the game IS important. You should organize your fleet such that your ships are unlikely to bump into each other. Past that, though, maneuvering for the optimal shot is a giant pain, and a waste of time. WIth any decently mobile enemy, chasing them down and specifying them as a designated target is an exercise in near futility. You'll end up just going around in circles or ""S"" curves, all the while being chewed up by whatever is not the designated target. The ""turn-rhythm"" of the game is such that it tends to produce stalemate, with designated enemies in and out of firing arcs long before your ships decide to actually shoot at anything.You're far better off just allowing your fleet to fire at anything they think they can hit, while keeping your ships able to support each other. This means that all the fancy maneuver mechanics can be reduced to a few variations: Everybody turns in a clockwise circle, everybody turns in a counterclockwise circle, or some ships turn one way and the other ships go the opposite way. (The ""movement limits"" represenation was actually done really well, by the way, even if it could be hard to click on the ship you actually wanted if a big crowd had formed.)A major contributor to the ""clunk"" factor is that all non-movement commands go through the HUD interface, with basically zero provision for ""context."" For instance, designating an enemy to chase down and fire upon should be a matter of right-clicking the enemy and selecting something from a short menu. Instead, it's a chore involving finding the enemy you want, finding the designated fire button, clicking on it, and not really getting much helpful feedback as to what's going on. Shortcut keys do help a bit, but the whole thing realy ought to have been more direct. Missile fire is even worse, with a target designation system which zooms into an enemy (completely breaking your contextual sene of the battle). While you can click directly on a foe to designate them, the ""enemy to shoot at picker"" is designed around two buttons: Previous and Next. That's fine when there are a few enemies on the map...and horrific when there are tens of them.And, of course, the auto zoom from the target picker often means that finding the target you want becomes a ponderous, multi-step process instead of a snappy one.Another thing that drove me pretty crazy was that every mission required the manual rebalancing of energy systems for each ship. Since shields don't regenerate by default, avoiding the loss of a fleet member pretty much demands that you rebalance your power use towards shields. Doing that for each ship, over and over again, was a bit of tedium that could have been done without.The metagame also has problems. ""Star Hammer"" doesn't allow saves during a mission, which creates an all-or-nothing type of scenario that punishes mistakes, bad luck, and the sometimes vague win-conditions far too harshly. It also makes glitches very, very frustrating, especially when a long mission has been going on. More than once, I ran into a situation where the game never fully exited the realtime portion of a turn, and my only option was to restart. What finally soured me completely on the experience was almost finishing a long, difficult engagement...only to have my fleet suddenly refuse to fire at anything.""Star Hammer"" actually does a decent job with its setting, with your bridge being inhabited by real, identifiable characters who converse through text boxes. The humanization of the game is good in that sense, but the wider context tends to get lost. The ""world"" is actually a spiderweb of various organizations and people - and that's a cool idea - but the way it all comes across is as a confusing mash of names that don't end up meaning much.I feel like ""Star Hammer"" might contain the seed of something that's really first-rate. It didn't clear the bar of recommendation for me, but doing so doesn't seem like it would be out of reach for the developers. The way the experience works as a whole needs quite a bit of polishing-up, though, before I would want to try it again.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but there's certain things missing from it which I can't forgive in a game like this.All the weapons fire look the same, just with different colours. It can't be difficult to design a different shape salvo for different weapons. As it stands most battles look like a few ships with a rainbow crying in the middle of them.There's a crap load of salvage missions, mostly escorting some frigate to a wreck through a series of waypoints that are entirely irrelevant because everything on the map moves to attack you from the very start, and when they're all dead the mission is complete, making them waypointless. However, you don't actually hear about anything that's been salvaged. You get no equipment or new tech or anything from it.There's a variety of different hardpoints on ships with different weapons on them. Good. However, there's no upgrades or chance of anything new or different. What's on them is what's on them until the end. Providing variety for this is an obvious way to increase the tactical challenge (and fun) of the game.Big capital ships have the same range as a half decent staple gun (basically the same as everything else).The ships are not what I would call well designed. There's nothing distinctive about them. Stick a couple of engines on a rhombus and you'd have a better looking ship than half the fleet.The story is too fragmented for most people to follow. I mean, you have to *really try* to immerse yourself in it; it doesn't entrap you in the world. Homeworld pulled you in within three missions; you watched your home be destroyed, and from that point you were onboard for wherever it'd take you. In this, a guy, who it's been made clear doesn't like you that much, dies, and you get to salvage his ship (well, sort of, see above). Oh and your father is someone high ranking. Not exactly mind blowing.			"

												The good:- Simultaneous turn-based space combat! Was looking for this for a long time.- Decent AI, with some tough scenarios (played on hard).- Shield management is actually fun.The bad:- The ship variety is limited. - Fourteen hours in and I never had the chance to customize my fleet. Every mission I have to use exactly what they give me. I never got any points to buy new ships. - War Scale mechanics is opaque and seems pointless.- Ammunition is unpredictable from mission to mission. Will I have 12 or 2 missiles this mission? Who knows!  - Crew RPG mechanics seems broken. Couldn't remove crew. Was given crew members I couldn't assign because there were no free slots. Because you can ""respec"" crew trees at any time, there is no sense of important decisions being made.- Human ships are interesting, but I found the aliens to be boring (for whatever reason). Just not my thing, and they make up a majority of the battles.- Screen gets really messy when the spitters start covering everything in their trails. - No sense of drama during rescue/escort missions. Outcome is pre-determined, and no penalty for failing (you'll see).- Dialog is boring. No voiceover.Overall:- Not recommended.			"

												It's the Star Wars Armada Miniatures game on the PC and it's great.I've played the first 3 missions and found it really interesting.You can rebalance your shields, use special abilities (missiles so far), aimed fire or auto fire for your normal guns and there's firing arcs that you need to position the enemy in while trying to position yourself outside the enemies firing arcs as much as possible.Turn based combat where the decisions are made and then the results are played out for a set period of real time. accidental collisions must be monitored and avoided and you can use the vertical axis to dodge as well.With so many well implemented components this is a game to take your time learning and then enjoy playing AI skirmish matches afterwards. Only thing it seems to be missing is Multiplayer. If it had that it would be an absolute must buy game. As it is I still recommend it as a great implementation of strategic space ship combat.			"

												A fun mix between Nexus: The Jupiter Incident and Flotilla where you go mission to mission manuveuring battleships and frigates in space while trying to outsmart your enemies. Holds your hand enough for you to learn the basics of the game yet isn't afraid to throw you in the fire after a few missions. Features a skill tree full of passive bonuses which boost your fleet's effectiveness, a decent selection of different ships, different factions with different strategies to fight against and a story that actually becomes more interesting the further you go. I actually love the fact that ships can actually Ram against opposing ships assuming your guns just aren't enough. Definitely a recommendation in my book.

												Read danny_maland's review (most helpful) to contrast with this. Similar points, he barely gave a thumbs down, I barely give a thumbs up.TL;DR: Spacy. Combines elements for a story above its price. Gameplay gets more challenging and more complex as the game progresses. About 20 total ship types in game between two factions. Many bugs. No voiceovers. If they had more time or budget, this could have rivalled Homeworld.Longer version, but I'll try to keep points short.Story guy did his/her job (too lazy to look up credits). People have personalities. The world has politics. Everybody has a motive for their actions. Story in a game is important to me; this one shows a world.Graphics did their job. Limited number of ships, but they look nice. Weapons are visible and are indicated when changing firing behavior. Worked well with story team: one station looks like a giant ship, fleet admiralty intended it that way.Combat designers did their job. We-go/turned based system that plays out in real-time where you can review the previous turn with no loading delays. Movement indicators similar to recent XCOM games, they look nice. Turret firing arc indicators optional. Most turrets have the same range; damage and accuracy determine target priorities. Multi-mission chapters (can repair ships between missions, can only rearm ammo between chapters) is a sweet-sweet idea implemented well. Ships have a limited veterancy system, which benefits keeping ships alive. Requested reinforcements can show up mid-battle if they're small ships, which is nice to see happen. Qualms: can't target sentient mines (bigger than the smallest ship and very slow); no ship has overlapping turret arcs; targeted firing mode causes all turrets to hold fire unless firing on the target (contrast: autofire ships can hit as many targets as the ship has guns); sprayer acid clouds are numerous enough to blanket large amounts of the battlefield in late game missions; some missions give an escort objective, then order you to kill everything anyway (making it easier to ignore escort objectives); war score might be based mostly on ship energy distribution, making defensive scores a chore to obtain; enemies can sit still, while player ships cannot; nautalid(enemy) corpses can be so numerous that maneuver becomes unnecessarily difficult toward the end-game. Small points, but numerous. Would have preferred a few missions fighting alongside allies. That's personal preference though. Interface is a bit clunky/complex for some; I found it okay.QA did not do their job. There are many bugs that are the make-or-break issues for many players. Final mission attempt 2 of 3: enemy monarch corpse drifted out of battlefield, enemies rallied at the corpse and made the fight very long, then 2 enemies left, killed one, the turn never ended, I had to restart. Clicking on crew skills button while a mission briefing is open will cause mission selection icons to disappear (solution: exit to main menu and resume, no loading time so it's superfast). Achievements are bugged; gone through the game twice and haven't gotten basic achievements for getting crew members. Ships will (as best I can tell) spontaneously hold fire, meaning they won't fire on enemies until you notice and change their fire orders. Acid spray area of effect may be much larger than the graphic; noticed ships with substantial space between them and the nearest stream still suffered ill effects.The game's design allows for a lot of meta-game. You can dismiss corvettes with empty missile racks and request another corvette as reinforcement, and the corvette will show up mid-battle with full ammo. Reinforcements can also be used to go over the ship limit; dismiss the reinforcements before the next battle and request new ones to go over the limit in the next fight. Well-timed countermeasure launches can destroy up to 4 missiles, instead of just 1 (though this might be intentional); if well-placed, the countermeasures can also cause missile AOE to damage enemies. While a challenge, sprayer streams (temporarily degrade shields) and missiles can be baited and tricked with good raider maneuvers. Allied missiles can unfortunately hit allies; enemy missiles can be tricked into enemies. There are probably a lot of options I'm missing.Personal idea: would have been nice for some mercenary work. Corporations pay for responding to distress beacons, personal rewards for securing a certain number of transports, recovering a certain amount of information, holding off an enemy for a certain amount of time, or destroying a certain number of enemies. Use that money to purchase a capital ship and pay for upgrades: armor, power core, engine and weapon tuning, more missile space, more powerful missiles, etc. The in-game greed factor would have helped longevity.Unfortunately, the game's kind of dead. Steamspy says there is an average of 1 player at any given time. The last forum post was 6 weeks ago. Doubt there'd be any improvement, since there'd be almost no money to be made. [Edit: two weeks later and 0 ratings on the review. Sad because it's a game that at least deserves the attention.]Despite the issues, the gameplay and story get the game a thumbs up.			"

												Overall I've enjoyed what I've played of the game. The more I've played it the more its grown on me. At this point I'd give it an 8/10. I doesn't come across as anything revolutionary but its a pretty solid game. It mixes neat elements like ships only being able to fire in a limited number of directions with turn based gameplay. So its kind of like naval combat in some of the Total War games (and probably other games) I guess in that sense. Combat also reminds me of the combat in Space Rangers 2 mixed in with the graphics and feel of Star Wolves 3.I've only played the first five missions but so far story wise they seemed alright. Just alright though. I'm hoping at this point it evolves into something a bit more substancial because its coming across as being pretty generic.Ultimately, its a turn based game. So if you aren't into that kind of thing you probably shouldn't buy it.Most of the negatives I have about the game are more nitpicking on my part on ways it could be improved. I'd still overall recommend the game.Positives:- Combat is reasonably smooth and the game is pretty enjoyable as far as I'm concerned. - I experienced no major bugs- The background art between missions looks really nice. Obviously the game graphics themselves are not 2015 level graphics, but they are reasonable I think given the price. - Seems like the game has a lot of potential.Negatives/suggestions- It would be nice if there was a waypoint option. Something like Space Rangers 2 where if you've selected a location on the map to travel to (that is outside of your ability to travel to in one turn) you don't have to manually say to go to the next turn in cases where you aren't being fired at.- The commander/captain of any vessel probably could be shown in a larger text size. - The first mission dumps a lot of info on you before you probably really need it. Info about the UI could probably be spread out more.- Some kind of indicator that projects an enemies movement limitations. Particularly if I'm supposed to be (according to the story) familiar with a ship design.- It would be good if you had an option to turn off automatic dialogue. Sometimes the pacing of the dialogue is a bit off and it takes forever for your wingman to say what they were going to say.- Very limited ship customization options from what I've seen so far.- To me it doesn't make much sense that given the 3D nature of space that a ship would only exclusively be able to fire forward or behind it (or exclusively to the sides). Outside of smaller craft like fighters ships should have some ability to shoot targets on their weaker sides, even if that ability is considerably weaker than their ability to shoot on their stronger sides. The only exception to that might be a ship that is exclusively designed to fire a big gun in one direction (like an Ion Frigate in the Homeworld series).- More significance for the Z axis. If this has some significance then that isn't made clear. It doesn't seem like it has any combat significance.- The movement of ships can be pretty finicky. You'll click on a ship's shadow and it won't register that you clicked on it. This could be improved I think.			"

												Hate the campaign. Fell in love with the skirmish mode. Took a ginormous fleet into battle, limped away an hour later with a single smoking frigate and a huge grin.  Disappointed in the complete lack of customization options. Really Slitherine, I would have loved to tinker with the ship  designs, or at least the weapon loadouts.			"

Posted: June 5, 2015
												This game at first reminded me of chess in space, star wolves and space ranger  with a bit of homeworld, but now after i have played it for a while it's more like X-COM except with star ships. You need to put a lot of thought into your moves or you can screw yourself.  You have to watch your play style and not be too agressive imo or you can screw yourself later on when the reinforcements and reload on ammo aint coming.   Very polished game with excellent sound and music.  Easy Tutorial takes you right into it giving you what you need to know with out over complicating things. Easy Med Hard play settings.    The Story so is pretty good, your play style in combat change the way the story finishes so i believe.  There are muliple story path depending what kind of captain you are. You find crew members that lvl up skill paths you choose. They also  build bonds between each other that gives bonus to your fleet if your crew is getting along.  Another thing that i find interesting is that the story changes depending how you fight your battles! If you are agressive and reckless in battles instead of defensive and tactical, it will change the way you are treated and rewarded. There is a Gauge that keeps track of this stat starts in the middle and slides left and right as you win battles to show how agressive or defensive you have been fighting.This game is not just about the combat it's about managing the fleet, crew relations,X-COM combat feel using naval space fleet system.8/10			"

												I bought this game together with Battlefleet Gothic during the autumn sale last month. I figured it could wet my appetite for Battlefleet gothic since I'm a huge fan of Warhammer 40.000. Boy was I wrong!SH:VP is a magnificent game. Graphics are good with lots of details. Controls are incredibly simple for its genre, yet the tactical, forward-thinking required to win the game (without too many ship-losses) is still very much present. At first this game seemed a bit low budget to me. 2D portraits to advance the story, A simple crew management sheet where you can switch out crewmembers for your flagship, and a point-click map with waypoints to chose a mission to advance to. However what makes this game great is just that everything works. The developers clearly put a lot of effort in both the gameplay as the campaign and the main characters and interactions are very well portrayed and don't seem as cliché as one might expect from a game at this price.In short, This game is great for it's price. With a solid story, interesting characters,  simple controls and gripping gameplay I would recommend this game to anyone who loves sci-fi and strategy games.			"

Posted: June 4, 2015
												I own my fair share of Slitherine games, and I always approach them with a bit of caution - I'm still feeling a bit burned by Sovereignty, for example. Pike & Shot has scratched my historical wargaming itch, but it doesn't feel particularly polished. But like every other Slitherine game I've purchased, Star Hammer drew me in with it's concept. While their games are sometimes a bit rough (Sovereignty, I'm looking at you), Slitherine tackles concepts and mechanics very few other companies will - so I took the plunge. It was worth it.I'm only a few hours into the game so far, but I'm enjoying it. The controls are intuitive, The game is gorgeous, with ships moving in appropriately ship-like ways, shootng beams and railguns and missiles (oh, such satisfying missiles!) and dying in interesting ways - full on explosions, drifting hulks rocked by secondaries, the works. The campaign has been fun too - if you've read any Honor Harrington or Jack Geary you're not going to be _too_ surprised by anything you run into in the plot, but it's presented serviceably and the characters are likeable. There's a neat mechanic where you build bridge crews to give your ships passive buffs and the relationships between officers matter - pair folks up who hate each other and that buff suddenly doesn't look so great. Notably, the game presents pretty much all of the story in text and (wonder of wonders) that text is virtually typo free and decently written - and even a bit clever in places.The missions so far haven't had a ton of variety - mostly they've boiled down to ""kill all the baddies"" sometimes with ""and make sure this one thing doesn't die, either"". Refreshingly, failing the second objective (protecting salvage crews, etc) doesn't always cause mission failures - though I presume there will be reprecussions later in the campaign. Combat feels right for the genre - closing with an enemy fleet is a fencing match of outgoing missiles and countermeasures before broadsides and spinal mounts start blazing. So it's totally worth a buy if you want to reenact some David Weber novels or if you're having a hankering for some turn-based strategy goodness - but what are the downsides?>The music is pretty generic. I turned it off within the first few minutes and put on something else. It's not bad, just bland.>The character portraits are a bit ""old school"" in their design - they remind me of Wing Commander in a good way. However, when they're displayed in-mission they're blurred or low resolution or something, which doesn't look the best.>Mopping up the last elements of an enemy fleet - particularly it's smaller/faster ships - can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It boils down to a lot of circle strafing and predicting where that last enemy corvette is steering.>The game is relatively unforgiving. Crews gain XP from missions, but if they die, they're gone forever. The game rewards patience and planning - be careless in moving your ships and they'll collide, inflicting massive damage to one another and stunning them. While you can save freely between missions, I didn't notice an option to save in-mission, which may lead to frustration.I've noticed no glitches, freezes, or other hiccups. If none of the above turns you off, the game is absolutely worth a shot - you'll probably have a lot of fun.			"

												I don't normally write reviews, but this game is so much fun that I thought I'd do a quick one…I've only played a few missions but I can already see the great game play and fun story… The graphics look nice which isn't the most important thing but it's worth mentioning - the sound works well and the music seems appropriate for the games style etc. What I really like is the combat which is good because the game is a combat simulation -It reminds me of some of star fleet games in that you balance shields and engine power and work out which is more important each round.  I usually play in a defensive style so I keep my shield above 40% to keep up shield regeneration most rounds. But I sometimes throw 80% power into engines to maneuver into the right firing angle (solution?) only to put lots of energy into the shields and little into the engines as I move and fire at my targets… I'm playing on Normal and it’s a fun challenge without being too easy to annoyingly hard..I haven't gotten into the upgrades on the captain and crew very much but it seems like they are interesting special abilities that help define the way you like to play.I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based space combat and science fiction stories…On the whole it's not a AAA game with all the bells and whistles but it is a really solid and enjoyable game at a reasonable price…  "

												Tactics is space, along the lines of Nexus: The Jupiter Incident. Although graphics (especially on higher zoom levels) and story wise it could use some improvement; the tactical part, which is the core of the game, is very well done. I have played about 2.5 hrs so far and there is likely much more to comment upon, but from what I can see so far it is worth a buy, especially for the price. If you are a turn based tactics fan, this is something you will very likely enjoy.			"

												Yep... I really like it:It's turnbased and it's really looking good. Got some kind of real Space Battle Feel. Sure there are some MINOR Issues but not game breakers or something but more in overall game design and looks.This game has such an enourmos, unbelivable, awesome potential in it that the gap what this game actual is and what it could be nearly made me cry. I found myself daydreaming about the best 4x Space Game ever.Take the best Ideas of Master of Orion, GalCiv, Sword of the Stars, StarDrive, etc. and mix it with THIS turnbased Combat Engine:That would be, at least for me, the best 4x Space Game ever created... there could be nothing above.But fair is fair... so let's stick to this game:I'm starting with the Cons:* I find the the Campaign really uninteresting. The StoryTelling is somewhat cofusing. X-Names of X-Events that I can't remember or care about.* No customizing of ships ! * No Voice Actors. (It would be REAL cool to get some Voice Feedback of things that happen on the screen... Panic, Damage Reports, Order Confirmations, etc-etc.)* No real working Tactics. You can try e.g. Pincer Moves but that does not have a real effect, so the enemy ships do have weak points on different locations. It simply comes to: Hitting with everything what's availabe... BIg Stick and brutal Force. No Finesse required.Pros:* Turn based Space Combat !!!* Executing Orders in Real Time. Watch the Action and learn to regret your mistakes from the Order Phase ;)* True 3D. The Heights of the ships do matter. You really trying hard sometimes to avoid collisions* Technically stable (sad that nowadays this is a feature that has to be mentioned)* Some Kind of real basic Roleplaying. e.g. You have a Bridge Crew to care for on your Flagg-Ship and NPC-Captains on the other Ships that level up with combat experience.All in all a good game.I strongly recommend this game for everyone who loves turn based strategy and Micro managing. But be warned: This game is ALL about micromanaging. From adjusting and relocating your shields manually to dividing the Power output in Drives, Shields or Weapons th have the perfect amount of each for the next action Phase. You permantly wondering ans calculating what do you need for each ship... FirePower or Speed or Defense. There is no good Default. Mistakes could be fatal. If you love this, like i do, this game is for you... if not stay away.After all you winnig a space battle not with the best tactic but in managing your ship systems perfectly.Greetings from SwitzerlandRobert "

												4 hours in to the game right now and I have to say I like this game.  Graphics are decent, sounds is good, music is pretty much the same thing over and over.  My favorite part would have to be how you give commands.  You give several seconds or orders to your fleet and then watch it play out.  Tactical, but feels quick.  The only thing I'm finding that I'm not a fan of would be a lack of ship customizing.  Ships do improve with experience, but weapon and equipment loadouts are set and unchangeable.  With everything else this game does right, that seems like an option they would have added.  9 / 10			"

												Great story, depth of mechanics are insanely gratifying and the combination of turn-based strategy with real time is excellent. Visually the game is stunning too and will keep you glued for hours on end!Check out my first impressions for a great in-depth look at the title itself.

												Greetings fellow spaceship warfare enthusiast!Starhammer: TVP as i will shorthand it, is a well designed space naval combat game.I say naval because you do fight on a 2D plane with 3 ""layers"" pretending at ""height"" and ""depth"".Your ships can move up and down but it does matter very little in th end as far as combat tactics go, its more useful to avoid colissions (oh yes, you can ram and be rammed). A clever tactician might abuse this by flying low or high all the time and using the dorsal or ventral shielding arcs as cheap shield batteries,. but you do not have that nugget from me, no sir you do not.Combat itself plays out turn based, insofar you give your ships movement and firing orders and rebaance power levels to match the game situation then hit ""play"" and the ""turn"" will proceed in quite adorably cinematic manner, you can watch the shooting and enjoy, you will not be faced with twitch reaction requirements.The combat does move in rahter similar routes once you have eased into  ""your"" set of combat maneuvers and got comfortable with your tactics, and som consider it stale. I consider it the mark of a good tactician if the fight goes ""uneventful"" XD.The story features likable characters (i will not spoil this for you) and a good, branching campaign that offers replayability.Its got  humor, action, spaceships and a good plot. Graphics:The graphics are good looking and will not crush a low end pc. Effects are well done and the sound design is very good: a big spaceship laser or gun SOUNDS as impressive as you would want to have it.No pling pling here, no sir. The game gets 4 stars out of 5, its a fun romp that does nothing wrong. While one might argue they could have done ""more"", it would be good to remembr that this game is well rounded and ""works"" as opposed to ambitioned projects that just turn into roadkill.			"

												If you don't care about graphical quality and are looking for a small fun space fleet combat game, then you will have a great time with this game.  While feeling graphically incomplete and unpolished there is a solid core game that is fun to play through multiple times. Pros: * This space combat portion of the game is great. * The combat controls give you a sense of the characteristics of each ship, and the ships don't all feel the same.  * The methods used to control your ship are straightforward and easy to use. * There are some solid RPG elements such as building your fleet over time, and mission decision making over the course of the campaign. * The player's playstyle assessment assisting in the mission type availability is something I found rewarding and made me want to play through again but play the missions differently. Cons:* Graphically the game feels very prototype and unpolished even for the price point. * The UI is definitely the most unpolished portion of the game. * UI Layout for the ship is scattered all over the place. * Menus overlap everywhere and the iconography is horrible, all the buttons are hard to read. * The story dialog is very poorly written. Even though the storytelling format is solid. * The campaign menu is poorly implemented graphically.  "

												Great game and most importantly, a lot of fun.  If you like space strategy, you'll most likely like this even if you side more typically towards RTS instead of TBS but it certainly isn't, as obvious from the media posted, a bulletfest action game.  It's still TBS space battles, with a good amount of complexity that you can delve into as deep as you want, that play out in RTS as you finish a turn.  The game has a fun story overriding the campaign as you go from mission to mission which are tactical tbs space battles.  You build and control the resources of your fleet as you progress including assigning crew members and deciding between their special traits which can interract with other crew members based on their relationships.  Another fun element is that you can affect the overall war by cooling off or heating it up by how aggressive you are in the battles which will affect the story.  The graphics are good quality as well and the pew pew spaceship factor is definitely fun.It's a no-brainer at 20 bucks if you have an interest in TBS, tactical or strategic, space genre.			"

												Finally the tactical space fleet game I´ve been looking for. It feels a little like a tabletop game, but with height variation (which, contrary to some reviews I´ve seen, IS important in the battles) and rts graphical execution. Also, I´m a sucker for ""we go"" systems.If you like tactical games and space combat, the game is a must.If the campaign and RPG elements were deeper, I´d give it a 10/10. As is, a 9/10.			"

												Exellent tactical sim, encourages a diverse fleet make up due to the special abilities, and makes you think about when to employ them with limited availability while not feeling stingy about how many missiles and decoys you get.Not much of an RPG as the ships don't actually recieve any real upgrades and the crew development isn't major, but nice added layer on top and doesn't detract from anything else.Campaign is a little short, but replaying it with a different approach and different decisions will give quite a different experience.  The decisions taken in the campaign feel very meaningful.			"

I dont know why it wont work with steam but is doesnt. If your running windows 8 and below then you shouldnt have a promblem.

												It's... okay. The total lack of ship customization is appalling. In a game like this I just can't imagine how any design team could arrive at the decision to not include it yet include a basically meangingless and bugged ""crew"" system that really is pointless. Can't really select your ships before battle either. It's basically an illusion of choice for what little there is. Upgrading is slow, for what little there is. It has some randomness to it, will you have a dozen missiles this mission or just a few? Who knows how that is figured internally. There's little to no strategy to the game.  Yet is heavily tactics based. The basis of the game is maneouvering your ship properly, keeping firing arcs aimed and anticipating the enemy ship's movements. You're not going to out maneouver a small frigate with a destroyer for example. It's at decent enough game on sale. But in my opinion, even for people who enjoy this sort of game it's not worth $20. It just oozes a rushed product pushed out by it's publisher despite not having halff of it's features implemented properly or at all. Slitherine is usually not a dev that does this but I feel like that's probably what happened here. It's just a bare bones game, it can be enjoyable, especially after a hard fought battle but I don't know if that's enough to carry it. I'd sitll recommend it for tactical buffs if it's on sale for 50%			"

												will update(/create) my review as i progress through the game.Initial thoughts, wow. First battle where i had a spaceship equipped with EMP/Stun gun, stunned an enemy, and it careened into the side of my capital ship, blowing itself up and damaging my shields. Then i managed to send an enemy careening into an asteroid :P.As for gameplay, nothing too stunning.Shipwise:shielding on the ships in all 6 major zones (think cube faces).power management systems which visibly change how the ships react (weapons=dmg done per shot, engines=speed, shielding=shield recharge rate) with a variable selection so you may divert all power to a zone, or some to each system.Gameplay wise: only 6 missions into the game so cant comment fully on this aspect			"

Reminds me of Star Trek Starfleet Command, but more refined (gameplay-wise) and a much bigger scale.

												I really like the combat in this game i like it alot the look of the ships the managment of shields weapons engines all that jazz this is done well and im a fan.However the reasons this game is ruined for me are as follows.the story is poor and the lack of voice acting really damages emersion reading and having to wait for the next page is very annoying the devs should have got family and friends in if they were that hard up for cash.Having missles not replenish while the enemy have them every round is also stupid i would prefer fewer missles or reduced damage and have them replenished after each mission or at least some idea of when they would replenish rather than just guessing.No customisation of your ships or ability to upgrade weapons bigger selection of ships would have been nice to.All of the above (tho the lack of voice acting angers me because its feels like such a stupid move not to have it) can be forgiven because the combat is very good. But the thing that really tips this from a recommend to a not is the warscale system it is broken. If you wanted a mass effect style paragon system make it about choices you make in the mission selection screen and or in dialoge options not about the way you fight with absolutly no direction on what determines aggressive or defensive. Did the devs not realise leaving people trying to guess would be frustrating because thats seems obvious.Oh and to top it all off for some reason now after i restarted the game i now cannot gain ship points 8 missions in and im still stuck on 110 the game starts you with meaning i cannot buy new ships. I dont know if this is because i keep getting aggresive warscale (because as i stated 0 direction) or if its a bug that didnt show up on my first play through.Such a shame a few of the mechanics have let this game down.

												Ok, So before I start there is one thing you should know.This game is pretty much everything I've wanted from a space game for ages.Ok, so now that you know that I drool over this game like an idiot just based on its mechanics alone... I do have a few complaints.1. The RPG mechanics should be deeper.The game makes a triffling effort at having RPG esk progression buts its very shallow and doesnt really appeal to me as a long time veteran of RPGs. Perhaps something more like a skilll point system where you can allocate and spec, your captain and crew to your OCD wracked, heart's desire?2. No customization on a ship by ship level.This game has a great system for customizing what ships are in a fleet, what position those ships start in, ect. But they still dont feel like MY ships. They are cardboard cutouts of what they should be. Ever play Nexus: The Jupiter Incident? The customization of that game, while linear and limited, still managed to make me feel like I was resposible for those few ships. They were very much MINE and loosing one was unacceptable.3. The story, is somewhat lackluster.Ive only played the first few missions of the game so far. But the rocky start is really not saying good things about the rest of them. Whats my problem? Well to put it bluntly, the MC is an over agressive idiot, The Military is fine with you not following orders to go do whatever, the antagonists are yawn inducing (not in their battle mechanics but their concept.)This game could really shine if the writing was kicked up a couple of notches. Give us a real space opera, thats what the system feels like it was built for.4.The artOk, the ships are wonderful, (if a bit on the low end for this day and age) but your 2D art? (which I dont have a problem with you using) Is just kind of lazy looking, its muddy and the characters look more like impressionist art than people. This was one issue I really agonised over wheter to put down or not. Im sorry for insulting someone's art like that but, it really should be top notch if your going to use it in a game.So there you gave it all of my compaints.If you think it doesnt paint a very nice picture of this game... well your right. This game feels like it was created by a very small group with highly limited resources. I STILL RECOMEND picking this up however. Lets get these guys some money so they can either patch up this game with the five star content it needs, or deliver to us a great title in the same vein in a few years.			"

												Initially I wanted to recommend this game, but it's just not even remotly worth the asking price and there is no long-term factor that makes the game any fun.The premise is that your federation or whatever is attacked by aliens. So far so standard. You're sent into battle with a few of your starting ships. In the upper left corner someone is talking (writing, since there is no VO in the game. At all. Not even in combat.), but you really couldn't care any less. The characters lack depth, the story is as standard and full of holes as it gets. I rarely even checked which one of my crew mates suddenly had something to say. But let's not focus on the story, since this game is about gameplay.Sadly it's lacking in this department as well. You're playing this game mission by mission, but you can choose several routes at times. I have no idea what these are doing though. Perhaps you get more story exposition and XP to follow ""optional"" routes. In any case, combat, the meat of the game:Before combat starts you can ""arrange"" your ships in a ""tactical position"". Why the quotes? Because it really doesn't matter. You don't even know where on the map you will spawn. After that it's simply giving move commands to your individual ships and letting them fire upon the enemy. You can focus fire on some enemies, but that doesn't always work that well and is clunky (you have to select each ship manually, then change the fire mode to targeted fire and then find the target you want to attack, since the game switches to an exclusive targeting mode in which you have to tab through enemy ships, unless the ship is visible on the screen...then you can even click it). Enemy and friendly ships all have different shield bars, but for some reason a ship taking damage on it's right side somehow lost shields for its left side...yeah). After each turn you can redistribute shield power to certain sides (though I have no idea how top and bottom could even be effectively attacked, since you CAN switch planes). You will also periodically have to redistribute system power between weapons, shields and engines to either regen shields quicker, have a higher movement allowance or do more damage). You can also change engagement ranges for each weapon subsystem, though no idea why you would bother with that.Technically it's not a bad idea, just the execution is mediocre at best. You don't know where enemy ships will go of course and more often then not they're just trying to ram you. Using special abilities apart from rockets is also not very clear. Firing lines are a nice idea but every battle pretty much plays out the same with you trying to keep your fleet together while not crashing. I've lost ships with full health to something I don't even know. That was a destroyer even.After battle you get XP and some sort of ""morale"" stuff that determines if you've been aggressive or defensive. No idea how that works, since I always get aggressive. I mean, we're fighting after all...I guess it's the crew members you can equip that offer various agg and def bonuses that can be toggled. Apparently they also form some sort of relationship with one another. It's even an achievement...hm, speaking of which, many of them just don't seem to trigger. Ive' definitely killed more than 25 ""squids"" and I've also recruited a few people that should have given an achieve...oh well.In any case, levelling them and your ships up doesn't really DO anything. Your crew mates get passive % bonuses. Yay. And your ships get automatically stronger the more enemies they have destroyed, which means your strongest ships will level up quicker since they often get the kill shot due to superior weaponry. And that's the problem: It gets boring after only  a few hours. I'm currently sitting at 1 battle cruiser, 2 destroyers and 1 frigate (there is a ship points limit), but there are no upgrades, no customization, no layout changes, no variants. A destroyer will always just do what a destroyer does, can't change weaponry, focus on shields or engines. There are also no carriers as far as I can tell. And there is apparently only 1 more ship class (your flag ship gets upgraded automatically). Also, if you want to repurpose a ship or replace one you have to do that in an actual mission, which takes quite a long time, so you're starting a mission weaker then necessary.Graphics and sound are not terrible, but also nothing great, especially sounds are boring.Overall it's not a terrible game, mediocre maybe, but definitely overpriced and it lacks longevity. After 16 missions I just can't bring myself to play any more of it, since every mission is essentially the same: kill all enemies. The UI isn't really PC optimized either. Maybe a 6/10 for effort. Might benefit from a MP mode. I think you need to adda) an interesting and well voiced plotb) a clear progression systemc) more user friendly controlsd) more customization optionse) better sound and visual design			"

												This is a lovely game with a remarkably forgettable title. For shame, whomever named it!Star Hammer: WE HAD TO FIT THE WORD PROPHECY IN THERE SOMEWHERE - is all about the story of a promotion seeking navy brat with a famous father and a burning desire to slaughter helpless aliens and people who disagree with her point of view.I guess it could also be about a patriot trying to make the best of a tough situation? I dunno, there's a branching campaign, but I plainly picked the correct branch and I have no regrets.If you like space naval combat, and you like space naval combat narratives, and you also like nuking filthy xenos and traitors, then this is the game for you. I can not over state how neat the options in combat really are. There is not an impressive number of ship types, but every type has a purpose behind its design and they are all dangerous to the enemy and to you. Great stuff.A+ would smoke a cigar and ram my first contact era frigate down the throat of the enemy line of battle while my fast movers roll up their flanks again.			"

												Yes yes and yes. This is how turn based space combat should be done.			"

												Excellent gameplay where fleet formations, maneuvering and tactics are actually important. Story is very badly communicated and forgettable. Half the time I didn't know why / what I was doing a certain mission... But frankly I didn't care, bring on the warships!			"

												Boring... there's nothing to this game. No real substance. You have no real control over anything but turning your ships and setting their fire mode. Where's the strategy, upgrades, storyline, etc... No thanks. Probably won't play this much unless I need a brain drain afternoon where I don't have to think			"

												absoultely gorgious and fun (yet tactical enough) space fleet turn base battle lol my only complaint is that right now it doesnt support user submited content (mod etc) and there is no voice acting (which isnt a big deal lol)			"

												I like the gameplay and looking forward to some updates ... my only issue so far is it keeps stopping during a game (says starhammervp.exe has stopped running and ask you to close the game).  So about 1/2 my games never get finished in the skirmish mode and in campaign mode it locks up at game 4  or so (first real signficant battle).  Gameplay 8  (simple but fun to play - especially skirmish mode)Buggy       2 (but I will give a positive rating since I hope this gets fixed in future)			"

												The story and writing are garbage, but the gameplay itself is quite fun.			"

												Good tactical space combat game - A bit text heavy for me, but I felt this game really started coming together by the fourth mission in, once the Frigate is added to your fleet. The game's mechanics are great and top notch, visuals and audio strong. Worthy title and you'll enjoy it if you've ever played Battlefleet gothic or Star Trek Attack Wing table top games.			"

												This game reminds me of old school 1990s tactical space combat games (Star Fleet Battles, Babylon 5 Wars and the like). It has the production values of an indie game, but since it is in fact an indie game, I have no complaints. Others have commented on the lack of voice acting, but that stuff is expensive (or done poorly, if cheap)...so again, no complaints here.			"

												This game has some signifigant problems and issues.  It's a bit buggy at times, the UI REALLY needs work in a lot of places and the writing for the campaign is... let's be polite and call it unintentionally amusing but servicable.  I'm not sure I should be giving it a thumbs up for its regular and regular price.But... at the end of the day it has some nice ideas and interesting things to do.  I got it at the Christmas sales and I can't really complain about what I'm getting for what I spent.  I would tentatively say I'd be interested in a sequel because this isn't something I see done often and it really should pop up more often.  In it's own twisted, flawed way this might one of the best space fleet combat simulators out there.			"

												Awesome, well rounded and surprisingly in -deapth strategy. This is really how space tactics ought to be done. The ony thing i could ever wish from this game that IMHO could improve on the formula would be a sandbox mode with an open map instead of the mission by mission campaign. Now dont take me the wrong way, i enjoyed the campaign all right, m just saying that sandbox approach could do miracles for the game's replayability.... oh well, maybe in the sequel. <nudge nudge>... come on Devs, <wink, nudge nudge>			"
