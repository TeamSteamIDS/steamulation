												This aint a simulator. No freeplay, you just get thrown into a storyline and have do do as told. Stick with one of the other Airport Firefighter sims out there! Can't reccomend this to anyone....			"

												An authentic duct crawling simulation and non linear narrative about one man's evolution as an airport firefighter. Bombings, trash can fires, meeting your boss for the first time; this game simply has it all.			"

												Missions are boring and shortthere are not even 10 missions and most of the missions only take 2 to 3 minutes to completegame is full of bugsyou can take a firehose out of one of the trucks (no mission needs this its just for show)and attach it to the back of the truck and now the worst part YOU HAVE A NOSLE IN YOUR HANDS WITH AN INVISIBLE HOSE AND UNLIMITED LENGTHor the game says enter fire truck 2 but you should enter truck 3on fire truck 9 when you drive it the iner wheels dont turnthis game feels more like a DEMO "

												First of all as a firefighter I feel this game is very lame! I feel its for kiddy's instead of gamers! This would be a game my 10 year old would play! As for anyone else thinking of buying this I would hold off!!!! It was a big disapointment for me and I will remember that these types of games get what you pay for!			"

												Hi there, usually my Reviews are full of words like Amazing and wonderful and very positive. Because that's what I try to be. I give credit where credit is due and there are parts that i enjoyed very much about the game. Performance wise this is one of the best running title in the Firefighter Simulator Franchise, this is achieved by many loading screens that split the areas into smaller sectors. With that VIS was able to  put more detail into the single sections.The Story line is loosely based on Ladder 49, down to the name of the protagonist, but there are twists and turns that are not in the movie. VIS Wanted to make sure that all players have a similar experience in the game, not like in previous versions where some had all the action and some had only garbage can fires. Unfortunately they overshot their goal by about 2 miles.The game feels like a on-the-rail shooter with little variation. Freedom is no longer a word to be used in the same sentence with this game. In fact i think that the word Simulator in the title is misleading. There is no freeplay mode whatsoever and you can only replay certain missions on different difficulty settings.The Vehicles are much better in handling and appearance, and the addition of American Apparatus feels fresh and is a step in the right direction. However that does to little too late to save the game from a thumbs down verdict, there was lot's of potential but unfortunately nobody capitalized on that. The Main Storyline with side missions is about 2 - 2.5 hrs of gameplay with little more after that and almost no replayabillity value.I hope that VIS patches a freeplaymode in, in a future update.Overall I can not justify the purchase price and if you really want this game i would wait 6 weeks when it probably  will be sold for $5.

												Pleasantly surprised by this game concidering the reviews that I was reading.As far as the actual game was concerned, its not the worst simulator I've played, but definatly not the best.For first, the thing that I didn't like and slightly annoyed me was the fade to black, mission title, fade to game whenever I reached an area where it had to load something, once or twice sure, but it was getting really repetative.Besides that I can't really fault this game7/10			"

												As a professional fireman in one of the USA's largest east coast cities, as well as being a big gamer, I can say with authority that this game is terrible.  The word ""simulation"" us used incredibly loosely here.  Would it be fun for a little kid? Sure.  But as an actual fireman looking for some fire gameplay that was decent, this game fell far short. Very disappointed.			"

												The game simulates you as a firefighter, it could have done a lot more better with the animation, especially the subs (subsitute characters).The game engine needs abit more work and the UI needs more work.It is a good game in all-round concept, but it has a few several game-flaws that sould really be attended to, especially in how the game is. the matter of driving to a fire doesn't bother me, but there are times when I've failed when I'm practically doing an act that a real-firefighter woukd perform.

												It's a good game don't get me wrong......but for $19.99 it's lacking.  I wish it had a mode that you could just be at the station and it would just generate missions.  You just play through the story line and that is it.  Maybe I'm being too picky but def. try to get this game when it goes on sale, don't feel like I quite got $20 worth.  It's fun to play games like this when you do it in real life!!			"

												Was cool they added North American vehicles, was not cool they took out the freeplay mode. As a side note i finished the game with enough time to refund it, shows how short it was. If you want a firefighting game i would suggest firefighters 2014 for a game like this, the other airport firefighters game (not on steam), or 911 first responders as it has lots and lots of mods to play with.

												It seems a real shame with this game I thought it was impossible to get worse at making games but you have quite obviously proved me very wrong. I admit I am a Emergency services phanatic and this was painful to play through, I think you need to really take this back to the drawing board and actually ask your target audience what they would like to play and what makes a game great for them. What is even worse is the fact that this game is £13.49 On Offer how is that any discount at all? People work for there money and they should be treated with the love and the care they deserve not some half finished I can't be bothered game. Come on people use some common sense.As you are unable to ask your audience any thing they dislike/like I have compiled a list for youWhat I Dislike-Vehicle Handling-Dispatcher-No Freeplay-Laggy water animations-Walking for NPC's-Lighting on one spot-Controlls-No English Fire optionWhat I like-Missions-Chance to work as a group-Range of Vehicles-Detail-Choose What you want to play as German/American "

												Awsome made and a good idea behind it. but sadly not worth the money, way to short and missing the free play that you have in the first Airport Firefighter Simulator, and sorry too say it not worth the name simulator. the idea with all the loading screen is waste of time and you miss the fun driving part. would love to se a more work you up in rank that you have in the first simulator. the first game they made was more worth the name simulator. the good ideas in this game is the air thank, axe and hose you bring out of the truck. love that part and i love the graphics . but this game still is missing so much to actually will be worth to be recomended.

I was expecting a lot more i like these type of games from Flight simulator to train simulator to Fire fighting simulators and i was hoping for a more difficult challenge. But no i was ripped off by steam and the creator of this game. I been with the fire department family for a long time my mom brother fire fighter was a fire fighter, My dad was a fire fighter and a Lt for the department. I have tried number of times to contact steam about games like this but nothing is done.			"

												It is a shame that there aren't more Firefighting games.As a big fan of Firefighter F.D. 18, Fire Heroes (Hard Luck), and SEGA's Firefighter arcade, I couldn't pass this game up!Why aren't bigger companies like Capcom, or Namco, or even someone like From Software developing a game like this?I've never heard of a Fire Department that is stationed on an airport. Must be a European concept...I have played this game start to finish, and I'm satisfied overall.When the game works, it is fun- Even exciting.The main mission is broken up by a series of other missions- They often involve manning the Fire Engines.If you've played Firefighter 2014, this will help immensely.The soundtrack is also fairly good on some stages, such as 'Onset of Winter'.The english voiceovers were cheesy, but clean. They're a good laugh at the very least.Unfortunately, there are a few issues with the game.As stated, the Fire Engine control scheme is much more complex. I wished they had used the same exact control scheme as your firefighter.The game suffers enormous lag whenever more than one character is on the screen.This can be infuriating at times, because you fail your mission if you don't reach a checkpoint within the time-limit.These contributed to a majority of my losses. The only other being some of the jumping sections in the game.Not to mention when you leave the Firestation, every engine in the Dept. acts like a starving wolf chasing a steak.Nevertheless, definitely glad that Steam gives you access to obscure games like this. If you've got a little cash, and there's a sale- Go for it!			"

It dont even look real. At mission ""The Debris"" I kinda find it annoying. The plane was unmanned crash on the runway. But It moving fowarding while it come down. Once it crash. It crash and stopped at very spotted. Plane was not straight down. It moving forward. So when it crash. It should still moving forward and spreading more debris all over runway. *face palm*Also other annoying... All firefighter already in bunker. Even during off duty >.< Real firefighter keep their bunker at truck. Other annoying. Limit time?! Please! Game is rushing us into finish mission. Most mission limit 2 to 3 minutes. Reason I give it thumb up. I like firefighter game and airplane game. It's combo. But they still need serious rework on mission ""The Debris"" .... Second though. I'll give it thumb down			"

												i think this game has great potential and i think if they add freeplay it would greatly improve the game. right now i would not buy it as after story wich lasts 2-3 hrs depending on your play style there is not much to do but replay old missions from story. This game would be worth 10/10 if it had freeplay  i feel as of now it is 5/10 it feels incomplete since the story is so short and there is no freeplay.currently 5/10   if they add freeplay 10/10    worth a buy ?  depends if freeplay is added if not i recomend you watch it on you tube since you will have just as fun an experience and you save $20.I recomend TheNorthernAlex for a great play through of the game and other firefighting playthroughs.

I finished the game in 3 hours.  A game priced at $15 should provide more play time, missions, freeplay for this, at least a little bit better graphics, better game overall, and longer to beat.  With 3 hours of game time, and it being $15 without discount or bundle, it would have been $5 an hour, that is horrible.  I do not recommend getting this game, unless it is at an extreme discount or in a bundle.			"
