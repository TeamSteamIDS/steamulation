												Now that I have reached 1,000 hours (or 42 Solid DAYS of time) played in Arma 2...I think I can honestly say that some of the best and funniest times of my life have been spent on this game since when my group and I all bought it in 2012. We were all brought to it by the stunning mod called ""DayZ"", but we found that Arma 2 was so much more then just DayZ. It turned out to be the most awesome and funnest military simulator ever. The thing that makes Arma what it is, is the endless creative freedom and community that bring us memories we will have forever. And I intend to make many more in the next thousand hours I spend on Arma.			"

												This game will always be embedded in my memory as one of my favorite games. Part of it is the game itself, but the majority of it is the community around it. The community I am specifically referring to is DayZAnarchy. The founder of DayZAnarchy, known as skunk, spent countless hours slaving away at his keyboard, scripting his server to be the best it could be. The work paid off, and I considered DayZAnarchy to be the best DayZ server there was. However, skunk passed away recently. No longer will DayZ be the same for me, or my friends. It makes me realize how much of his work I took for granted. I only knew him for a year, but I considered him a friend. If not for skunk, I would not love DayZ. Therefore, this is not only a review for DayZ, but a memorial for skunk.69/10 would f*** a pumpkin again. Rest in peace man.			"

ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead is best known for the popular zombie mod DayZ, which is a unique apocalyptic open-world experience.But what many of the players who bought the game only to try DayZ miss out on, is the vanilla game itself and the original experience when you join an organized clan or server to teamwork with other players during tactical missions. All servers use unique player-created missions.The missions are normally PvE, but PvP also exist to a lesser extent. Missions can range from being in an escort of military vehicles, rescue hostages, or attack/defend outposts. The game has a built-in mission editor that is easy to manage. ARMA II have plenty of realistic weapons, vehicles and characters. There are also hundreds of mods that increase the amount of everything.The game suits people who like sandbox, simulations and action games. However, it's not a very fast-paced game like the CoD or BF-series. In the ARMA-series, you might die unless the wound is treated. You have no visible healthbar and you require a map and GPS to know where you are.Useful links:Clans & Communities - Find a clan that fit you.Armaholic[www.armaholic.com] - One of many sites with plenty of usermade content.

												After playing this for a few years now and obtaining over 1000 hours on this game, I think it is time I reach my verdict on it. I believe that, though this game has its challenges, it is one of THE greatest games ever devised for the Personal Computer. I feel like simply doing a Pro/Con review because it's the easiest to format.ProsDEDICATED playing and modding community - even after being out for several years, many people, myself included still play this game religiously.Incredible mod support - There are literally thousands of mods for this game. Hundreds of new, GIANT maps. Thousands of guns. Thousands of new unit types. Even entire overhall mods to change it into the Vietnam war or World War 2. Mods exist to change every sound in the game and graphical mods exist to ease the strain on lower end PC's or make the game more beautiful than it already was.Already expansive game - The game, minus mod support, already contains hundreds of units, vehicles and guns in the case of Combined opsMaps - 15km by 15km maps, enough said. Maps contain multiple towns and villages, and often 1-3 large cities and/or settlements. There are also large area with beautiful landscapes such as rocky cliffs and washing oceans.  Some custom maps can be even bigger. But to put it into perspective, Skyrim's map is about 37 square kilometers, where as the default OA Takistan map is 164 square kilometers (About 12km by 12km corner to corner). Think about that one.Replayability - I do not mean the story when I talk about this, I talk about the virtually INFINITE ability to create scenarios in the editor. Want a tank battle 20v20? You got yourself a tank battle complete with terrain big enough to house it and FOBs for both sides. Want a small special ops team to assassinate a middle eastern dictator from 1.2 km away with a 50 cal? You got it. Want to fly an attack helicopter or CAS jet into the heat of battle? You get the idea. Infinite.Graphics - Though this is something that many people would argue with me about, Arma 2 came out in 2009. Even though it was released later, OA's graphics are no better because the game is still from 2009. It's the same engine and the same game, with a different setting. Given the circumstances, I do have a very nice rig, so the graphics look pretty to me. I constantly find myself looking off a cliff while preforming recon on an enemy position and thinking ""Wow, look at that view.""Realism - This may be a turn off point for many. I, for one, live for realistic games. I often b!tch to myself about other games not being realistic enough. This game, with the addition of a few mods, can be as close to real life as you want it to be. Mods to check out for added realism are ACE 2, Retexture mods for units to make them up to date and state of the art (Changing the US Army units to Multicam from that dreaded UCP camo comes to mind), and the Zeus AI mod.Multiplayer - 100 + player games. Nothing else to say.Now for the cons, these are all the problems that I've found with the game that personally annoy me.Lag/Desync - This is only an issue with larger servers, usually. It can be annoying but rarely 100% game breakingPoor Performance - This game is not very well optimized, and if you have a weak computer, you will struggle to run it with more than 10-15 FPS. Even if you have a good rig, it will usually only max out at about 35-50 FPS. Don't let this turn you off though, you really just get used to it.Ocasional hackers - This happens very infrequently, and it only happens on big servers.Expensive - For a game as old as it is, it is a bit pricy, I reccomend waiting until a Steam sale comes around to make a purchase in the Armaverse.Lack of Realism in Some Places - This is more of a pet peeve of mine rather than an actual flaw. It annoys me that all the US Army units use the SCAR L, considering it was rejected by the Army. The light version of the SCAR is just ugly to me, and when I can, I always mod it out of the Army. This will probably not bother 90% of people considering this game, but for those that enjoy absolute realism, check out the RH M4/M16 pack on Armaholic and it's respective replacement packs. STEEP Learning Curve - Patience is a virtue. You need patience for this game. A lot of it. You will die. A lot. And you'll die some more. Guess what still happens to me regularily. You guessed it. This game is a tactical simulator, if you try to play Call of Duty, you will be swiss cheese every time. The controls can be hard to learn, and I changed them right away so I was more comfortable. Modding the game is not reccomended unless you have experinece modding similar games. Though modding is very simple, things can be screwed up if you delete or put a file in the wrong place.Time Consuming - Processes in the game take a very long time. Firefights can be anywhere from a few seconds to 30+ minutes. The time it takes moving from place to place ranges widely. If you are on foot, expect about a 35-40 minute walk from one corner of a map to another. By plane or helicopter, you can travel long distances in minutes and seconds.Frusturating - It feels really bad when you're almost done with a mission or objective, and get killed.Overall this game is by far my most played and one of my most treasured games of all time. Very few games have the scope of Arma 2 and its many addons. PS: Arma 3 is much less realistic in terms of units and gameplay, but still has the giant maps and mod support. It does have better graphics, as well. I reccomend getting both if you can afford them.EDIT: MAKE SURE YOU BUY COMBINED OPERATIONS OR THE GAME WILL SUCK.			"

This review is for both Arma 2 & Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead combined. It is recommended to buy both games so you get all of the content and can join all the servers.Arma 2 is a realistic Military Simulator. Below I will review each aspect of the game.  Aspect Review   Gameplay The game has very enjoyable gameplay, with many different weapons and vehicles. You can do missions, play with the editor or play on multiplayer servers with many different game modes. Even if you aren't a fan of realism, this game can still be played casually.   Graphics and Optimisation The game is horribly optimised. Even people with top of the line PCs get around 20-40FPS at times. I personally have old hardware so cannot test the graphics properly, but at low they are still decent, but don't expect Arma 3 like graphics. The game gets extremely frustrating after a while due to the poor framerate. It should also be noted that the controls for this game are extremely uncomfortable to use, by that I mean it is unsatisfying and is the main problem I have with this game.   Additional Content The game features some additional DLC, however not owning the DLC is no problem at all, since the light versions allow players to gain all of the content from the DLC. However, the DLC content will be low resoloution, unless you buy the DLC. The game has no microtransactions. The game can be somewhat pay to win depending on the server, as some servers offer better weapons for premium players, but this isn't every server.   Value The game is worth the full price, as it is very enjoyable and you can get a large amount of hours out of it (for me it doesn't even get boring!). However, some people do not like the game. I recommend trying out the demo before buting the game. The game also goes on sale frequently, so it is worth waiting for that.   Aspect Score (/10)   Gameplay 9   Graphics & Optimisation 3   Additional Content 10   Value 7   Pay to win? No   OVERALL 8 Notes: This game is enjoyable both offline and online. It is one of the best military games I have played, but It is not to be confused with fast-paced action FPS games such as CoD. The 2 games are very different.			"

You can play civ, cop, terrorist, you can follow the law and mine for a living or do DRUGS :3 its up to you!I also played alot of wasteland, which is like a giant deathmatch on a massive map with vehicles and all, oh how many hours I have spent on independent camping the gun store xDMUCH RECCOMEND HIGHLY REPLAY VALUE 10 CAN OF BEANS / 10			"

												1000+ hours but didn't purchase this on Steam till after I was pretty much done with this game.This is probably my favorite game of all time. I never played a game more than this one and I will say why in this review.Back in 2011 or 2012 I remember being bored and looking for new games to play since I was new to PC gaming and always played on Consoles before this. I remember coming across a YouTube video about Arma 2 realism shooting. I thought it was interesting since I grew up playing Halo and COD when I was a kid. I seen this was something new so I thought to give it a go. I came for the realism but stayed when I noticed a server called ""Cherno life"". I had no idea what it was but it sounded interesting. --- My RP Experience ---I load into the server and I see there are Cops and Civilians. I learned that day what a online RP game was like back then. It was the funniest thing I have ever seen. People playing as Cops and chasing people who would rob a bank or gas station or commit murder. Even things like speeding got you pulled over. I never seen anything like it and I just loved it. I remember one day I got tired of some people playing as Cops just doing stupid things like killing civs for no reason and it annoyed me but I was in luck. I came across a video that had ""City Life RPG"" as the title. It was a mod and the very first I went and downloaded. It had things like sports cars and even ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1979 Honda Civics in the game and if you couldn't afford that than I guess you could test your luck on stealing a car but the cops could find out and you could be put in jail and that isn't fun.There was just so much to do in that mod, you could grow drugs and run a business doing it. You could do the boring legal route to and sell olives which hardly made money but it wasn't illegal. Fishing and illegal fishing (shark hunting) was a thing and if you wanted to just be clean you could even become a cop which was hard as hell to do in this server. Robbing banks was even a choice but usually a stupid one unless you had snipers or were good at tricking the cops otherwise it wasn't worth it. It was pretty much GTA but with real people instead of A.II put at least 1000+ hours into that mod because it was so different and niche that it just appealed to me. I even met people on there who I still talk to today 5 years later. The mod just had one of the best communites ever and nothing comes close to it for me. Like I said in the beginning, I came for the realism side of the game but the RP side I accidently came across kept me playing it for a very long time.--- DayZ Mod ---When I started playing Arma 2, I remember there being 4 DayZ servers. They weren't that popular either but I tried it one day and I loved the idea and the game itself. It was something that has never been done back then. I remember this mod just blowing up and 4 servers became a 1000 in 2 months. Arma 2 went from a niche game with 4,000 people playing at most to one of the top PC games out there all thanks to this mod. Survival games have been changed forever because of the success of this mod that was made into a full standalone years later and is still one of the biggest Early Access titles in history. DayZ was fun with friends but after a few months of playing it and things like Overpoch, EPoch started coming out and all the hackers started joining it kind of going annoying. Combat logging was huge back then to which ruined the mod for me but in the beginning I think it was one of the best mods ever to release.--- Realism Mods ---Played some realism mods for a bit because that is what I was looking for in Arma 2 in the first place. Mods made it so fun to play and for awhile I enjoyed it. I did this for around 3 months and just got tired of the ego some people had. The community kind of ruined it for me but overall I still enjoyed it. Some of the best mods I have ever seen in a game like DayZ so this was nothing short of incredible.I said this before and I will say it again. My favorite game of all time. One of the best communites (in some mods, DayZ was pretty bad after awhile.) and the best mods I have ever seen created in any game. I would recommend this game in 2012 but not 2016. Its kind of dead these days because its such an old game. It might still be worth playing for DayZ mod though since this game goes on sell for as cheap as $2 sometimes. Otherwise just wait for a sell.Best game ever thanks to the modding community.			"

												It's okay for singleplayer, but a great game for multiplayer. I enjoyed playing 200+ hours into this game. Mainly the domination and wasteland missions. Graphics are good and very compatible with mods.""But you have 22 hours...""You could say I have 222. My CD key was actually stolen, but thanks to the amazing customer support at Bohemia Studios I was given a spare CD key for free as they were able to identify it was a CD key theft. This encouraged me to play the game even more and enjoy it. Thanks a bunch, Bohemia.			"

												Sincerely, one of the best games I've ever played.The base game and it's DLC are of sufficient depth as to keep you busy for quite a while.  The learning curve to master controls is a bit steep, but once you're proficient, you're set.If you want true milsim, there are plenty of mods and communities to support that.If you're into the whole post-apocalyptic undead-walking scenario, there's a little mod for that as well.In playing this game, I have had some of the most boring times and some of the most exciting times I've ever experienced, and I've had it go from boring to HOLYFXKK in mere seconds.I've fought for my life against great odds and come out on top, I've been shrekt by cheap AI, I've outsmarted entire groups of players (and had them compliment me by accusing me of scripting), and I've walked away from my keyboard while my character crawled a few km to a town so I could fix my broken leg.This game won't always reward you for playing it, but when it does, it's a true reward.

												In 1947 the legendary general Forman swore to combat all who would dare create new fun games with the theme ""simulation"". While his efforts were largely conceived as honorable and patriotic, there were those who would create their games regardless of Forman's rule. Even though the ban on simulation games would be lifted in 2003 they were still regarded as low-class toys and shameless attempts at controlling the masses. People know to the public as simulation developers were shunned from society and declined their right to vote.This all changed in 2007 when Bohemia Interactive released a game so superb, so innovative that it's release is commonly seen as the greatest moment in gaming history, in all of history. ARMA 2 captured the imagination of audiences the world over. Its riveting story and enthralling graphics made the game an instant hit, and at the same time threw the simulation games into the mainstream, no longer would simulation developers be banned from voting and eating using cutlery, instead they would now be encouraged to vote, as their opinion meant more than that of the common man.Many have tried and many have failed at reproducing the feel and social and political impact of ARMA 2, Microsoft Train Simulator and Farming Simulator have nearly single-handedly cast the simulation industry back into the shadows from whence it came. Was it not for ARMA 2’s focus on replay value the world would not have survived the onslaught of terrible simulation games. Every attempt at recreating a game as tremendous as ARMA 2 has been futile… until now.20th of May 2013 will go down in history as the day when Bohemia Interactive released their greatest creation yet: ARMA 3. Its gameplay is like nothing no-one has ever seen and will revolutionize the gaming-industry, if not the modern world. Bohemia has managed to create a game that will suck players into its massive world that encompasses a single island, and on top of that tells the most spellbinding and creative story ever told. One may laugh at the idea of creating a game where the player is expected to sympathize with an ENEMY MAN, 200 METERS and care for its actions, and struggles in the world, but Bohemia's extravagant game put’s those claims to the test and proves once and for all that Bohemia is the greatest gaming-company the world has ever seen. 11/10			"

												Not just a combat simulation.... A fun simulation.....Seriously this game gives so much bang for your buck. The amount of hours you can sink into Arma2/OA are insane as there somethng for just about anyone here from the vehicles and weapons to the walking and the missions/operations. There are communities within the game that put on 40+ men operations that take hours and have an insane amount of detail and coordination. Just watch any of the shaktac community's videos and all the different perspectives you can see of a single operation. It's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome and however I myself have never gotten this close to what seems to be the true arma experience I have gotten a more toned down taste of it with several friends doing small missions that just give you this sense of scale and enjoyment you wont find in other games. Outside of its military simulation and the mods that further improve on that aspect you've got mods that have become something like garrys mod in there selection. To name a few; Takistan life, Wasteland, DayZ, Escape Chernarus, a hunger games type and many many more. Your options of play are endless and the mods are just as well done and provide just as much if not more than the base game. Hell Im sure a majority of people that have bought the game did so just to play DayZ. That itself spawned a stand alone game (That is and probably never will be on par with the mod). This game is the represent what it means to be a PC gamer. The experience and freedom you simply cannot get on console. But seriously there are so many key bindings and actions some arent even binded by default and you have to manually go in and find what else you need or want to bind. I've tried rebinding keys to make it more functional for me but I always end up missing a key or running out of keys in a comfortable area. The worst part is I cant tell if this is black mark on the game for being complicated or praise for its complexity and amount of input.... its just brilliant.			"

DayZ, Wasteland, deathmatches, there's no end to this game. I have some of the most memorable moments of gaming in this game.  I have recommended to my friends, bought it 3 times over, even had a friend build a PC just to be able to play this game. If open world survival games are your thing, I would get this 100%. Thanks Bohemia, for creating friendships, stories, YouTube videos, moments I'll never forget, and thanks Rocket for the DayZ Mod although you did a pretty awful job with Standalone.			"

												60km long neck due to online glitches.3km snipers shot after 30 minutes of tracking and 5 minutes going through range cards, windage, ballistic.Require a bazillion set of mods to work properly. A mind boggling vast amount of weaponry and kit to have too.Might not gleam and shine like Battlefield or Call of Duty but will put all other to shame in terms of having a truly satisfying military simulator experience.You will learn to VOIP or TeamSpeak. You will learn that Tourette's disease are for the weak. You will be patience. You will laugh at the ragers. You will spend an hour to kit your team and 10 minutes to complete the objectives.111/10 would buy again if I go back in time.			"

												Definitely one of the best simulator games this platform has to offer. Besides DayZ mod you can do so much more like Wasteland (base building and pvp gamemode), make custom missions, player made maps and playing around in the armory with your friends in an online server. Pretty good singleplayer, although I think the multiplayer with all it's gamemodes is where this game truly stands out. If you missed out on the hype and still want to play DayZ mod, I would highly recommend Overpoch by CCG. Either Taviana or Chernarus are both great maps for this mod. Taviana being the best in my opinion. + Gameplay and general feel+ More content than Arma 3 at the moment (e.g. weapons, vehicles, items)+ Operation Arrowhead DLC was free+ Custom maps made by modders (Taviana, Lingor, Namalsk, Sahrani, Panthera)+ DayZ Mod+ Comes with alot of default maps (like Takistan, Chernarus, Utes, Bystrica)+ Alot of different gamemodes+ Great fanbase and community- Graphics (depending on what settings you play on, but on overall high settings it becomes laggy in multiplayer)- Uses more CPU power rather than GPU- Clunky inventory system compared to ARMA 3- Vehicles drive like a cereal box- No weapon customizationThis game is in my opinion better than ARMA 3. Mainly being because of the timeset. I like the weapons better (M4's, AK's, DMR's) and there's alot more vehicles to choose from. ARMA 3 is a bit too futuristic for my taste, and the weapons in that game do not make any sense. Overall 10/10 and highly recommendable.			"

												Arma II: Operation Arrowhead is an excellent expansion. It provides an abundance of new content and a beautiful new Central Asian setting, and a respectable number of new factions and armaments.  Arma II's single-player campaign achieves almost everything that an expansion should be.The thing to remember with the ARMA series is that it is more of a combat simulator rather than a simple shooter. To survive and proceed, the player has to learn tactics. Run and gun tactics of many games out there just will not work here. Tactics are the key to success in the mission objectives.This series still holds the crown as the best military simulators around.			"

												I ran up some stairs once and broke my legs and bled to death. My friend got his neck snapped by a tree because he went prone the wrong way near it. I drove a bike over a small bridge and it flipped over and crushed my spine. I drove a missle truck over a slightly larger bridge and it bounced up and down until it landed nose-first into a ditch and exploded the second I exit out of the rear left tire. I vaulted over some barbed wire and it teleported me under the map and I fell to my death. I combat carried my friend out of fire and he disappeared into the a black void where no light or cry for help escapes. I vaulted over a dam and got stuck under water. I rode a bicycle slowly over a bridge and made it safely to the other side where the rear wheel got stuck in the bridge and I got launched into the stratosphere when I got off. My friend landed a chinook on top of me and I survived until I climbed a ladder that teleported me to the ground instantly. I ejected out of a helicopter and survived the 230 meter drop because I landed on a 80° angle. I shot a bicycle with a tank and it didn't get damaged. I rode said tank over the bike and it flipped over while the bicycle remained standing. I unpacked a machine gun into the side of a building and could shoot out of it while no one could directly shoot at me. I got called an autist for not saying ""Copy"" and ""Over"" when talking in Independent faction chat. A hacker teleported everyone in vehicles into a hangar and they all exploded and the server crashed. I rode my UAZ off a ramp and the back wheels got stuck on it until they slipped off and the car exploded. I ran my armored car through a tree and took 0 damage to any parts and didn't get slowed at all, I then drove through a bush and took massive hull damage and the front tires were destroyed and was stopped instantly. I landed a helicopter near a bush once and it destroyed my rear rotor. I drove a tank at full speed over a small rock formation and it worked like a normal ramp, while an actual ramp damaged my turret and hull and brought me to a full stop. I planted a mine near a bridge and it didn't detonate when a tank drove over it, but when a civilian on a bicylce rode past it, it triggered. I wanted to be a cop in a roleplay server to abuse my power and they demanded I get on their teamspeak and do a job interview. I shot down an admin's jet on a wasteland server because he was carpet bombing every event area, he called me a hacker and banned me.			"

												Introduction:ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead is the standalone DLC (Downloadable Content) Pack for ArmA 2, A Military Simulator by Czech developer Bohemia Interactive. ArmA 2: OA is the only standalone DLC pack for ArmA 2. Multiple other DLC packs play part in Takistan, Including the BAF (British Armed Forces) DLC and PMC (Private Military Contractors) DLC.The Map(s):ArmA 2: OA is set in the fictional Middle-Eastern country of Takistan. Takistan has many towns, villages and cities to explore, with two airfields on either end of the map. The map of Zargabad, A Small desert city in the middle of nowhere, quite small compared to Chernarus or Takistan, but the city is hugh compared to Takistan's largest, Rasman. Zargabad also comes with an airfield and a few buildings here and there. the PMC and BAF DLCs use this map as well.The Gameplay:ArmA 2, as a military simulator has many aspects involved in succeeding. To me, and many others, the most important is Teamwork. You have to work as a team to get things done in this game, and I love that consept. It is very slow paced, very tactical, and aimed at people that don't like to get things done rambo-style. Movement is extremely fiddly with the inability to walk through clearly enterable spaces and breaking your legs on the oddest of places. The game is fairly old, however, coming in at a 2010 release, a year after the original ArmA 2.Graphics/Voice Acting:Graphics and Voice Acting are quite shameful, but the game is old and developed by a Czech developer making an english game, and the quality is tolerable.The Multiplayer:The ArmA Multiplayer is quite easily where the most fun is to be had. With excessive mods and gamemodes developed plus the original gamemodes implemented to play with your friends, i've spent 99% of my OA Experience on the Multiplayer. My most enjoyable moments on the multiplayer moments were on Takistan Life: Revolution servers. TLR, as it is abbreviated to, is a Roleplay Mission File for OA.My Issue(s):My only Issue with OA is the fact that when update 1.63 was released, it wiped out an extremely large fraction of all multiplayer servers. I took this as a sign of BI telling us to go to ArmA 3, which is quite rude. Luckily, servers are popping back up here and there, which is a very good sign.Summary:Overall, All ArmA games are amazing in my opinion, but ArmA 2: OA gets the cake. Congratulations to Bohemia Interactive for making such an enjoyable, but serious game and I hope this review was found helpful.Overall rating: 9.5 out of 10 / 4.5 out of 5.  "

												I´ve spend 1.5k hours of my life on this game. Thats one of the best ways i can explain this game. ArmA 2 in only one word: Fun! Every time i think about ArmA 2, i remember the old DayZ days with my friends, and oh boy, i can tell you guys, DayZ Mod was the best time ive spend on steam. But i dont wanna talk about my memories, i wanna give you guys a serious review, so lets get started:Weapons: There is a big variety of weapons, and a lot of different options for every weapon, for example theres your ""vanilla"" m4, and then theres options with holo sights, grenade launchers, silencers and so on. Its not like in ArmA 3 where you can put the attachments on by yourself, but its still well made. Also, every weapon feels, sounds and looks different. The Weapons dont feel as realistic as ArmA 3 weapons do, but you still have to compensate for bullet drop, and the velocity of the bullet. Maps: There are many maps in ArmA 2, and they are all unique and well made. Theres definetly a lot to explore, and have fun on playing!Gamemodes: Well, this is kind of sad, but theres not really any other servers than DayZ nowadays. But lets be honest, i think the main reason people buy ArmA 2 is DayZ, just because its unbeatable by the SA.Movement: Well, the movement in ArmA 2 is not as complex as it is in ArmA 3. Of course you can lean, crounch, prone, walk and run. The movement system feels smooth, and is reliable.Overall: This game guys, let me tell ya, its one masterpiece of a game! Buy it, seriously, buy it! Its worth every penny, and for 15 euros its in my opinion the best game you can buy at this price point. And if you just want to test it out, and you dont think its worth 15 euros, then buy it on sale, you can get this game for 2 euros. Once you get into the game, you cannot stop playing it, trust me guys!			"

												We're driving along this road out of Rasman, Takistan, when this mission comes in.  Wants us to check this nearby hill, so we hit the road and floor it for some action.  400 meters out, we park the jeep behind a village hut, hearing .50 rounds and grenades being fired into the targeted hill.  We check the map.  A box with an oval in it -- armor of some sort, low numbers.  Luckily, we're suited as tank hunters.We ditch the jeep -- too loud, too big, and load AT.  Our three man team stealths up the side of the hill, hearts pounding, eyes darting left to right.  Once at the top, we find some sort of ruins, and take cover.  There's light brush around it, providing additional concealment.  The perfect position.  200 meters away and slightly elevated, past the folds of the hill top, light flashes.  We watch as an enemy transport, small, boxy -- retreats as small explosions pepper along its path.I raise my weapon, a tiny fraction of myself exposed, and take am.  I take time to line the shot, but know the vehicle's frantic retreat and distance away do not favor a successful hit.  We let it vanish in the folds of the hill.  The explosions follow, and suddenly, we can't hear the engine.""Ugh.""  I say.My companions respond.  ""It happens.""""No, I left the jeep running.""  We laugh.Suddenly, rounds impact our position -- big ones.  We hold steady and follow the tracers into the desert, but find nothing.  The AT's still hot -- no infantry had been marked on this hill yet.  We wait for something, before I finally decide to return to my rifle.Scrolling down I find the correct item, and click to select it.  Instead of switching to my rifle, the AT fires into the ground at my feet.Just another day with arma. "

												One of the best military simulators out there! if you are interested in realism to a degree, then this is the game for you! The game has good dlc but there are some bugs you will encounter, they arent to annoying but sometimes can give you a good laugh. Check it out if yo uwant to fly some jets , helis or just dfrive some cars and tanks. Really fun game and it also has a lot of mods that makes a lot more of gameplay to the game so you can keep enjoying the game in new ways.

												It was a drizzly day in the Chenarus. As usual, I was sitting in the woods, listening to the majestic sounds of nature, the birds chirping, the wind murmuring through the trees, as I waited to see other people. All of a sudden, ""POWPOWPOWPOW"". Instinctively I dropped down, and heard the sounds of bullets rushing past me, which sounded completely different than how Hollywood makes it sound. I judged the direction of where I was taking fire from. 40 ... 43 ... 45 ... 3 o clock! I saw a dark clad man jogging forwards holding a Russian PKM, which he probably found in a helicopter wreck. As I raised my gun, my M16A2 ACOG, I adjusted the scope to compensate for the bullet drop, and leaded my target.""POP! POP!"" I heard the scream of the man, and decided to slowly inch forwards. He wasn't done yet. 20 meters away, he suddenly opened fire. ""RATATATATA!"" He was injured. Instead of his shots hitting me, they went right into the ground, because he was forced to prone after his legs were broken. With one shot, I silenced him. Then, I took some food and ammo from his body, and went out to seek more targets.10/10			"

												If you like sandbox military simualtors you should def buy this game!1. You can setup and edit your own missions or whole campaigns with as much or as little detail as you want. It can be a lot of fun to make missions for friends and swap missions. I really enjoy building in depth detailed missions.2. I would not buy this game for the campain. This is not like a modern day skyrim. The AI can be very stupid. I call them situationally dumb troopers. The villagers do not do anything but stand there and die. There is no situational awareness for any NPCS. The villagers do not have a dialy/nighty life cycle. They stand 24.7 and do nothing interesting.It takes a long time to communicate critical details to your squad: such as GET DOWN your under fire. They often just stand there while you wail at your squads reaction to enemy fire.3. The mission editior is what makes this game worth it.YOU CAN build an awsome campaign/map/maps. 6.5/10			"

												Listen to me now. This game is unbelievably awesome. Most of these reviews - if you take care to read them, are from when the game first came out. It has come a long way - and so has the hardware to support it. Buy the game - even better if you buy combined ops - or buy ArmA II and Operation Arrowhead and combine them. It's not that expensive. Join a clan - a good one - one without ridiculous requirements to maintain membership. Play with the crew. Get to know them. And run some of the most immersive, realistic, expansive, open-ended, tactical, fun, glorious missions you have ever seen. ArmA vets laugh about CoD. We mock CoD. Because CoD doesn't have anything on ArmA. Seriously. Buy it and play it. Learn it. It's tough - we know. But good things come to those who wait - and put in the effort - to learn a real game. And if you can't figure it out - after just a few hours of applied effort - a look or two through the controls menu - and maybe even asking a question or two on multiplayer - then go away - we don't want you here anyway. Go back to your CoD where enemies throw themselves into your bullets and you are virtually invincible. We will be busy fighting serious **** enemies - human or AI - and trying not to get shot even once - because this game does not f*ck around.			"

												it ruined my life10/10More than 1k hours on this accoun, and at least 500 more combined on the beta version, off-steam and on my other account, it's one of the best games ever made.The core game is great, still competing with big titles after all these years of its release, but the mods made it even better. Be it ACE and realistic mods, be it DayZ and its variants, or basic Life/RPG mods, this game offers everything you'd want.Arma3/DayZSA Comparison:--------------------------------------------When compared to Arma3, it's barely worse. Both games are great, and got their own special feel. Arma3 is newest. so it'll keep having fresh content and an active community, and that's its main advantage over Arma2.-Buy this instead of DayZ Standalone, it is, and will forever be, better than that piece of crap. Other than SA being horrible, overpriced, and a complete lie, Arma2 has more to offer. It actually is playable, it actually has content and you can do endless things, not just glitch around and starve to death while eating.Plus, Arma 2 is almost always really cheap on steam, like $5 for the core game, the expansion and all DLCs			"

												I Dont know whats so addicting to this game but i found a gamemode on this called wasteland and i have not left the house since. I cant stop playing as bad at the game as i am, i find it so fun, i could play this game for hours and i plan on it. The gunplay is the most realistic ive ever seen the graphics are great, driving is mostly solid, and the map is huge and ive only been to a section of it. The wasteland mode is the best part of the game, where you scavenge for food, water, weapons. and you can build your base pretty much anywhere and its a great game to play with friends. there is a huge lineup of modes of transport. But now the main game, its a great realistic military shooter with accurate combat and many maps, modes and players.			"

												Despite not playing very often anymore, this game still has a thriving community (mostly in DayZ Mod servers) and is still very fun all around. It was the sole reason behind me making a Steam account, back when the original version of DayZ was gaining popularity. To this day, I still go back on to play with friends that I've met on DayZ or through Arma, or at the very least play recklessly on a Wasteland server, which requires no mods. Yes, the game can be very buggy, the community toxic more often than not, and ping issues may plague you, but this game has been the source for untold hours of fun, frustration, rewards, tense situations, and insane gameplay for so many people. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to access and explore a game with so many dynamic features and meet some awesome people; there is a well-grounded reason why this game has 14x more positive reviews than it does negative reviews.

												I LOVE this game. It's a tactical shooter/military simulator that has singleplayer, coop, and PvP. There are hundreds of vehicles, weapons, and player models for you to use, so each time you play, you try something new. However the game also has some parts that bring it down. I will list all the good/bad points.The good:Emphasis on realismEmphasis on multiplayerWide array of equipment, all usable in-gameSmall but active, mature and helpful communityGood graphicsGood atmosphereEasy to learn, difficult to masterLarge map, open world. Able to travel over entire countryGood inventory systemFun custom missionsReplayabilityThe bad:Bad voice acting. Every time you order people around, it feels like all the words are spliced. For example: ""team RED. go to that TANK""Clumsy infantry movement. While sprinting around for kilometers in open areas feels fine, moving around in buildings is slow, clumsy, and innefecient. You will notice that you either move too fast or slow for CQB, and that your gun won't fit through doors unless you're holding it down.Large amount of HDD space taken up. This game can take up around 15 gigs on your hard drive.No low-spec computer support. While you can turn graphics options down, you will find it hard to target enemies over 1 kilomenter away when everyone's texture is just a blur and there's a great big wall of fog right where they are.The engine. There are no ragdoll physics at all, object collision doesn't always work, shadows take up much processing powerAll in all, if you can get past the poor engine, you will find this game extremely addictive and fun. 8/10			"

												The Arma series has always held interest for me. It is one of the few shooters that has a learning curve. Playing smart, knowing your limits, and understanding tactics will give you the edge every time. I enjoy the large maps and the ability to play terrain. Its not a bunch of hallways and passages covered by an army of snipers. Vehicles and emplacements are powerful modifications and enhance the style of play. Everyone has a job to do and the team suffers if someone comes short. The DayZ mod is also enjoyable and employs some of the same tactics and skill with the ""zombie"" aspect. This is a great game and offers varied forms of play and there are a TON of mods available. It is worth getting Operation Arrowhead even if it is outdated. All of the Arma Games are a great option.

												'Do you recommend this game,' Steam asks me. I do, emphatically. I hope this anecdote from an in-game multiplayer experience I had will explain why. Prepare yourself for ARMA2: The Review: The Movie.Spring, 2011; early in my ARMA career, first tour of duty after a Steam Sale. I'm a fairly fresh recruit, seasoned with a couple dozen game-hours spent trudging through an expansive and swampy learning curve. Spent today at work, drove home, made dinner, cleaned up; it's Game-O'clock. Steam. ARMA2. Launch. Menu surfing, looking for multiplayer. Server browser hits my face with lists of information. -AWP-Warfare Capture the Island mode looks appealing tonight. Played it a couple times before, and I feel comfortable with the basics by now. Server connection established.Click! I'm in, filling the boots of a digital NATO badass. Apparently, international treaty organisations occasionally require the service of men with guns. Disturbing thought, but I'm no politician. I'm just a nobody with a rifle, taking orders that filter down the food chain. Those orders fill my mind now. Objective: town. Location: nearby...as the crow flies. Heh, the team's commander does have airborne technology unlocked, I just don't have the cash to buy a lift yet. Looks like I'm taking the scenic route. A quick check of my map tells me I'm at one of our hidden frontier bases and that there's two whole mountains between me and the nearby town. Great... I'll be taking the scenic route to the scenic route. The map tells me more: several of my team members and their A.I. controlled task forces are currently approaching the town. I'm already late for the party :(Might as well bring the fireworks.The base I'm at has only an armour factory and infantry barracks, but both will well suit my rapidly forming battle plan. I'm thinking heavy calibre fire support from high ground, overlooking the town. The topographic information in the map shows that the road I'll be taking is nestled around a minor hill as it approaches the town. Perfect. I'll park two BMPs there and they'll provide overwatch of the whole area while my comrades finish their capture of the town. An LAV will ferry me and one squad of A.I. infantry to the combat zone. I spend the required funds and set the plan in action.Wait a tick, BeatYourHeadIn, are you telling me you actually have to plan how you’re going to get your troops and equipment from point A to point B in ARMA2? Logistics in a game!? Yes, actual logistics...in a game with a map so FRIGGIN’ big you need to employ logistical planning skills to see any sort of success. And it's not boring!Back to the story. Formation of a military convoy. A few orders issued to my A.I. controlled task force later and the BMPs are on point while I lounge in the command chair of the LAV at the rear of the column. I man the turret-mounted automatic grenade launcher, a devastating weapon. Its barrel is ominously pointed at and tracking a lollygagging friendly player as my convoy departs base. Yeah, that's right chump, make one wrong move and I'll end you! Though itching to test the power of my new toy, I decide it's not worth getting banned over.  I let my teammate live, for now.The A.I. drivers of my convoy are as dim as a new moon, but I can fine tune my plans and keep up with current events while they drive. It's an 10 to 15 minute (realtime) drive that negotiates a winding mountain pass through an elegant evergreen forest. These are backroads, unpaved; enemy forces unlikely to be using this route. I feel secure enough that I spend most of the trip looking at the map, reading topography, lanes of fire, positions of friendlies. I smile when I realize I could probably minimize ARMA2 and play a few rounds of Counterstrike while my convoy travels.Dying immediately is certainly the last thing I'm worried about as I crest the peak of the second mountain.Suddenly: EXPLOSION..DEAFENING SOUND..FROM BEHIND..MASSIVE DETONATION..JESUS H. CHRIST WHERE IS THAT VOLUME KNOB! What is going on here!?My turret pans to the rear of the LAV. The sight, what a sight...I'll never forget. Fire. Wall. 60? 70 feet tall? A wall. Of fire. Taller than the trees in the forest, literally FILLS my view from left to right. There is nothing in view except the fire. I'm in awe. Confused. Shaken. I've seen 'splosions in this game before, BUT NEVER LIKE THAT! Did somebody tried to nuke me FFS!? I know there's no nukes in this game mode, so...Over the cacophany of destruction: the scream of jet engines. Very close. As the flames die down, a large shape traverses the air over the crest of the crag. Airframe, Sukhoi configuration. Enemy. Wing tilted down slightly; canopy visible. I know he's surveying the carnage below him. Hunting me. Cursing his aim when he sees the LAV still intact. I feel small, molecule small; what I just witnessed was caused by his war machine. Napalm bombs. Heavy ordinance. Whatever it was, it dealt complete destruction to that forest.Understand this, readers: in this game, air superiority is a literal phrase. Air is SUPERIOR in this game. This isn't your Battlefield ""oh look I can shoot a few rockets from my jet fighter and maybe kill one or two goofs on the ground and then reload (because reloading rockets on a flying jet makes a lot of sense) and kill a couple more goofs"" experience. No! In ARMA your aircraft can have a payload of more than a hundred devastating rockets and you can fire 'em full auto like a machine gun and destroy an entire town worth of goofs on the ground if you wanted to. Ha! Forget about balance! This is the real life Shiznit. Modern air forces don't invest heavily in war planes because they're ""balanced"". They invest in them because they can kill a hell of a lot of people quickly! ARMA2 knows this. Simply put, the developers have a big Bohemian boner for air power.But BeatYourHeadIn, what happened next? Tell us! Okay, I'll tell you. A miracle happened. My convoy survives the 'splosion to end all 'splosions. My battle plans go up in smoke like the forest around me. My current objective is to live through the next 30 seconds. The LAV is the only reason I'm still alive. It is damaged, but drivable. I order my drivers to haul ♥♥♥ in a forwardly direction. I track the Sukhoi as the convoy labours onward. The receding bogey performs a wide highspeed U-turn. He's heading straight for me again. Relentless much? He's the UPS guy we all wished was real: the one who comes back after he missed you the first time, instead of leaving a note telling you to pick up your package at the office near the airport!Then, from beyond the first mountain I had passed: a smoke trail racing skywards. Anti-aircraft missile! Ha! RETURN TO SENDER, A-HOLE! Two vectors intersect in a puff of smoke and light. Direct hit! Booyah! Wait, uh... he's still flying at me. HEY! HE'S STILL FLYING AT ME!With black smoke billowing out of his engines, this topgun is still determined to deliver my severance package. Frantically, I order the BMPs to target the limping jet. Cannon rounds arc through the sky in attempt to smite the airborne menace. Sukhoi Dude is getting closer, but he's losing altitude. Fast. He's now descending below my level on the mountain, looking up at me through the trees as he approaches. None of the BMP fire connects, but it doesn't matter. THIS GOOSE IS COOKED BOYS! Relief. Now, his desperation salvo of rocket fire is way off-target; falls harmlessly some distance away. I watch him frantically yaw right and nose up as his fighter loses the last of its life-sustaining lift and plummets in a sideways cartwheel into the trees. The inferno he leaves behind is a feast for the eyes. There was nothing left but a dark crater.Now, I can start thinking about that town again...What, are you apes gonna dig him a grave!? We got our own mission to die for! Forward march!All that's left to say is: play this game!			"

												Bought the Game for DayZ back in the DayS, still do not regret it. Early DayZ DayS where the best. Updates and new features made the game worse over time, so i quit at some point. PleaSe note that my gametime here is not even close to my actual spent time. Arma II itself - one hell of a good game, but sadly outdated. It's a very good military Sim and very fun to play with people you know. Other than that - not really worth buying anymore at this point. Thumbs up for the game, thumbs down if you want to buy it without being in a community which is actively playing it.			"

												What can I say? It's the one and the only ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead, probably one of the most well known games amongst the PC gaming community. This game has everything for everyone. You want to stroll around in a zombie infested wasteland full of players trying to kill you instead of zombies? It's got that! You want to fly in a special ops raid on an insurgent filled town at night with the glow of green illuminating your room while tracers fly on the screen? It's got that! You want to play as an abusive cop and beat down the local civilian population for driving in the middle of the road? It has that too. Yes ArmA II:Operation Arrowhead has just about everything you could ask for, but it does have stuff you didn't ask for. Like AI's that are either blind of Vasili Zaitsev, Zombies that come through walls to get you, and other weird glitches that although are not game breaking, are annoying at the best of times. Whatever your fortay me be in video games, I am sure that Operation Arrowhead can fullfil many of your hopes and expectations from a now old, military simulator that is at the top of its respected genre of games. Whether you want to be a pilot, infantry soldier, tank operator, marksmen, civilian, rebel, or police officer this game can give you what you want. It is for these reasons and more that you will discover, that I recommend this game even so long after its initial release.			"

												Getting older day by day, you may think Arma 2 is a game of the past. That is not the case, as it is still massively popular mainly thanks to the gargantuan number of mods that have benn made for it. If you purchase Arma 2, you are buying over 25 games in one. It's really hard to become bored, as there is always something new to play! However, due to it's age, the physics and graphics may be a tad annoying at times, but i seriously recommend it to anyone who loves a good simulator, and who also loves shooters!			"

Vanila Gameplay is Really good single and multiplayer both, (multiplayer is significantly more fun) but once you install mods like ACE, TFAR (or ACRE) Blastcore, and JSRS you enter an completely new and mindblowingly awesome dimension of realistic gameplay. Yes the game is also buggy like hell, but the bugs are not gamebreaking and sometimes they are hilarious. And once you get familiar with the most common bugs they will stop bothering you, and you will be actually able to avoid them most of the time. "

Graphics are still good, performance with current gen hardware is good.This game for me has zero cons, not even the bugs. For if you play this game for a long time, you'll get used to the bugs and you'll know how to play around them.Do you think this game isn't worth it anymore because of Arma 3? Well, I like Arma 2 more than 3. It feels way more natural, performance is better and weapons feel more realistic.If you are looking for realistic tactical shooter, no reason not to buy.If you are looking for fast paced fps, don't buy, for it's not fast paced and way more unforgiving than other shooters.

 Arma 2: Combined Operations REVIEW  Just so people don't get confused Combined Operations is Arma 2 + Arma 2 OA. Arma 2: CO is a fun military shooter while being realistic but not too realistic if you get what I mean.I can't say much about the campaigns as I have only gotten past the first mission on both Arma 2 and OA so I'll skip that section.The multiplayer is massive and can go upto nearly 100 players! (I've actually seen a server with a 200 player cap!) there is also a wide range of missions both default and user-made. However not all user-made missions are perfect and can have weird framerate drops, missing scripts and glitches. These missions range from generic deathmatches to total domination of the entire map with up to three factions brawling it out which is very fun if people ya know... Work TOGETHER. Which leads me to the community side of things.The community is rich with mods that add stuff like: armies from around the globe, weapons ranging from sci-fi sniper rifles to classic bolt-action rifles, maps of real world locations or comepletely made-up islands! There is so much modifications yyou just have to see it for yourself! The community is  most of the time  friendly and have loads of groups that play together with teamwork. Now here come the more dissapointing parts of the community. See you won't get much teamwork or friendlyness outside of these groups or clans. You WILL come across people who love to ruin the experience with people ranging from lowlife teamkillers (Sometimes its on accident) to hackers. You also get racists, random banners (Doesn't mean Battleye ban) etc. There is just a bad chunk of rot in the game so beware.You may also find it hard to actually PLAY ARMA 2! My goodness what ever you do if you want to PLAY ARMA 2 please for everything that is Arma USE THE FILTERS. The serverlist by default is spammed to absolute hell with DayZ. Which I consider a TOTALLY different community (They don't ""play"" Arma 2 they play DayZ).Now you may be thinking by most of the screenshots in the Community Hub  ""These graphics are terrible""  Well...1. The graphics most people set its LOW, LOW, LOW, OFF, OFF, OFF and LOW with a hint of 800x600. These people are A. People who struggle with the game's unoptimized performance or B. Have ♥♥♥♥ PCs that cost $400.2. The graphics are quite nice maxed out (Not that I can max them out ;_;) and if these are below your standards may I suggest you give it a shot.Now the fun part! Gameplay is... Fun? Is that the right word? I don't care I think it is fun to play, bit clunky at some parts but it is generally all good. The main focus is infantry combat which is nicely in-depth with range finding, sneaking about, misc buttons, etc. The game has A.I. companions that tell you to do ♥♥♥♥ but where it's really at is commanding them... Which is a interesting experience. The A.I. ISN'T the best I will tell you that right now! They can go through walls (Only really happens with LOTS of A.I.) They can't drive properly even if their life depended on it but there are mods that make the A.I. better. You also have the ability to use heaps of cars, trucks, bikes, planes, jets, APCs, jeeps, tanks and helicopters all with a little difference or a massive difference in speed, mobility and armour.Now before I wrap this up this game is VERY far from flawless and you will experience bugs and glitches that will only ever happen in Arma 2 depending on what is happening these can be downright annoying or pure hilariousness! These are the following examples of what we call being ""Arma'd""1. Death By PhysicsYou may be wondering  Wait other games can kill you by phsyics!  While you may be right but Arma 2's ""physics"" engine provides the most hilarious and interesting experience I've ever had in gaming.I've been killed by running into a non moving vehicle 3 times, I've had my legs broken or have been killed by rocks or similar objects more times then I can remember, I've been flung by vehicles further then the longest sniper shot and I've had my own vehicle flung into the air so high that it puts NASA to shame.

												A marvellous, diverse, realistic and truly amazing game. So, why not recommend? One word: Battleye. Quite possibly the worst anti-cheat system I've ever seen in all my years of gaming and now that Steam has integrated with the servers, you may not even purchase new CD-keys for the same account. Thats right. Legally and legitimately bought CD-keys for this game have no use if you've already bought the game on Steam. Battleye has proven to be a stable as a house of cards, kicking people and denying them online play for nonsense such as ' Battleye failed to intialize ' and other such technical problems that plague the system which unfortunately was never perfected. It's a shame, because the game has a LOT to offer in terms of online and i'd personally jump to ARMA III if my computer could handle it but alas, I'm stuck in the single-player limbo of this game and confined the hacker friendly online servers. In short: Good game, ♥♥♥♥ devs ruining it with an unstable ' Anti-cheat ' nightmare system.			"

Bandage him up and rush to a hospital where he gets shot and killed through a window anyways. Yep i knew what kinda game i was getting into. I think i prefer to play on private servers. I've tried a bit of different survival horror games and i think i like this one overall. But its buggy, And the combat feels a little loose. I wish it was more tight and the zombies didn't glitch out when you're aiming at them...but the best out of them all.			"

												*Funny review*Tried a bit.''Serious''So,If you looking my review you obviusly know about ArmA serie or you are quite bit know about it.Lets begin with the gameplay.Gameplay isn't simple as you thinking every atmosphere will effect you''being shooted in leg,lung,near explosion etc etc''and these effect isnt effective out of battle.But when you in a firefight it will effect a lot.Like sprinting n running not works. Cus when you run your character tires and your aim is goes right left like real life.When you get suppressed your characters seeing is blurs.Etc.Lets talk about GEARS-WEPS-VEHICLESA bunch of weapon and A ♥♥♥♥ING BUNCH OF vehicle and gear in this game.Like real life you cant actually see at night without nv or flashlight.Silencer is more than minimap spotting especially at nights.Vehicles is an dimension.Like t34/t72/m1a1/m1a2 is only a little part about of it.Planes is specialized at helis.But not at jets(happens in all arma games nvm)Lets talk about modes.DM-TDM is normal modes.BUT there is 2 modes i really love and special for only arma.Cti a.k.a warfare.Whole real warfare.You can be commndr or soldier its fun and realistic af.Commander can build base,move hq,set waypoints,set missions etc.General approval/:Gameplay 8,7/10Graphics   7,9/10 Good for its time grapsAudio        6/10 Some weps got same soundsOverral     7,2/10Would die while doing HALO jumps in warfare.AND A NOTENever play alone or you will be bored.If you wanna play just add me.

												Bought this for the DayZ mod, and I wasn't disappointed...Very glitchy, poorly optimised, low frame rates in towns, random deaths, can sometimes glitch jump through walls, players using hacks, getting killed when you're a fresh spawn and have nothing, server donators/mods spawning with helis and AS50's, random leg breaks, random bugs which kick you out of flying helicopters, weapons disappearing when you switch them out from your backpack, zombies glitch hitting you through walls, getting stuck in vehicles, not being able to get in vehicles.All in all it's a fantastic game.But seriously, team-work based gameplay can be a-lot of fun, and the huge open world with no loading screens is great.Also don't listen to the minimum required specs, you could play this game on a machine built by Lord GabeN himself and it would still run like it's being played on a toaster.

												This is a good tactical military shooter not your standard run & gun fps. It requires a bit more patience than most shooter games and more time to master some of the weapon ballistics and vehicle handling like flying choppers and planes. The campaign is not to bad, it's more fun playing either multiplayer or coop missions, two of the more popular online types Dayz & Wasteland are what are generally played online, I personally prefer wasteland which is more combat orientated than Dayz. The game has been out for a good while now but with mod support and a powerful in game editor this game has been quite fun, if you haven't picked it up yet it's worth a try on the steam sales! 8/10			"

 Get ready for a badass shooter! This will be semi quick, I've only been able to play about 30 - 45 minutes at a time before my latptop overheats (Will write an entirely new review later on, this is just to give a honest heads up on what to expect) so I don't know much about the scenarios quite yet or if they're worth playing but I can tell you that the bootcamp alone has me interested in playing as much as I can, I also learned this is NOT a fast paced shooter for the most part and is infact very strategic, I wouldn't know too much on how to handle the more commender-esque moments as I often played the ""freeplay mode"" and made a base asap for that UAV drone just to see what it's like up in the sky raining hellfire and let me tell you, the graphics for an older and non-AAA game shouldn't even compare to this game's as the locations are very well detailed and worth taking note of at times, I can't say I'm a fan of the land vehicle gameplay (HMV's and Tanks) but that's never been my cup of tea but I do like sitting back at 1000M and picking off pesky threats with a M24 while they spray violently and missing every shot along the way or taking out a small convoy with a unmanned drone, anyhow besides that not much is notable about the game as far as I can tell, the variety's fair regarding weapons/vehicles/etc (However without the original ArmA II you wont be able to use most of the normal gear or so on without paying a few extra bucks) and a fair amount of mods are out for this game that extends the realsm of this game by a ton.Imo this game is worthy of a Good rating on it's own, but as I mentioned earlier some of the variety of this game comes from the original ArmA II so if you plan to get this game then try to buy Combined operations.Combined operations (Original and Op:AH) 9.3/10Operation Arrowhead 8.5/10			"

												I have been playing the Arma Series for around two years; I can honestly say that it is my favourite series despite all the bugs and glitches. Arma has without a doubt one of the most active gaming communities that create endless amounts of content. Without these moders and script writers the franchise would have ended a long time ago. In steam alone I have 62 hrs played but out of steam using play with Six launcher and other launchers I probably have close to 1000 hrs played. Arma will disapoint at times when you get killed because you rolled into a tree but its worth it!. It can be slow but you can grow to love that, it's not for everyone but i highly recommend it even with the Release of Arma 3. It simply does not have the same feel or enough content to surpass the classic Arma 2.			"

												ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead has got to be one of the most amazing first person shooters I have ever been able to get my hands on. It is an amazing expansion to the already amazing AMRA II. It has an amazing blend of story and action with different yet very well thought out controls. For left and right handed people. The wide variety of vehicles and weapons works so well with the settings in which the game is based in. I absolutly love the multiplayer! The high number of servers with hundreds of thousands of people playing on them even to this day! This is also backed up by the ground breaking DayZ mod which has an amazing blend of the classic multiplayer's firefight action and a high number of zombies out to get your brains!Pros:- High number of players still active- High number of servers- Amazing graphics- Wide variety of things to do and weapons/vehicles to use- Great storyline- Amazing equipmentCons:- Complicated controls for helicopters and planes- A few glitches in the multiplayerOverall, ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead has gained itself a well earned 10/10!

												Every second I've spent playing this game was worth it. Domination mode and DayZ mod will burn hundreds of hours of your time and you won't regret it. The engine takes quite a long time to get used to, and there are plenty of bugs, but the Arma 2 engine is unlike any other. There's something about the gameplay that is really fun and interesting once you're used to it. The DayZ mod is no doubt the best game you can play with your friends. The funniest moments I have ever had playing a video game took place in the DayZ mod. There's is so much freedom and endless possibilities for hilarious moments. There is nothing quite like how the anarchy works in DayZ mod.			"

												Probably the best realistic shooter I have ever seen. Although the campaigns are not as good as in the original Operation Flashpoint, the gameplay was vastly improved, and the missions are quite good too, unlike like in any other ArmA (save for OFP). If you have never played this series, then you ought to download a demo and give it a try! Although the game is very unoptimized and controls are clunky, it is the best as war simulation ever went in video games. Good singleplayer (and mission editor), and great co-op multiplayer, which should give you at least dozens of hours of entertainment. PvP multiplayer isn't as good in my opinion, although it has its followers. "

												What do I have to say about Arma 2? Its great game and has so many things you can do, from fighting in the battlefield with your comrades to living a peaceful life as a civilian in the beautiful maps of Takistan, or Chernarus. But, don't mistake this for a simple sandbox FPS, It is far from it, I don't recommend this for people who are used to simple controls, unless you are willing to spend some time in the tutorial for a couple of hours. The campaigns with the DLCs and without them are amazing to play, except the one in the Army of the Czech Republic DLC. I personally give this game an 8/10 for great storyline in the campaign, the amazing modding capabilities in the game. The only faults I find are some bugs, the Army of the Czech republic dlc was disappointing since I couldn't really see the story behind it.			"

												Probably one of my favorite games, Arma 2 OA isn't nearly as good as Arma 3 but it's very fun. IF you get regular Arma you can also play DayZ Mod, the original!Pros: Tons of things to do in the editorLarge mapsYou can play as a cowYou can make firing ranges (well more like many things you can imagine)DayZ ModQuite a large amount of mapsMaps are usually hugeCons: Graphics aren't good (compared to Arma 3 or something like that)If you play as a goat you go super slow :(Editor can be pretty hard to mess around withSometimes it's hard on my FPSNot fast-paced like COD (this can go either way, if you like to chill in a heli headed to the AO, strategizing with your squad etc or if you like to go balls deep, M4 firing..) A great game, buy it. PS if you read this far you probably read about the fast paced ♥♥♥♥, on some multiplayer servers you can simply parachute into the AO with your M249 at the ready			"

Playing alone is kinda annoying and not that fun, but if you've a whole squad then it's awesome.

												It's been about 2 months since my original review,  and in that time I've watched many servers die. I'm almost at 600 hours in Arma 2, and have been through a couple Milsim groups and several servers.To those wondering if you should buy this, and you stumble upon my review by chance, take a moment and read.Pros:-A great milsim game. A pistol can kill you just as effectively as any other gun in this game, just like you'd expect in real life. The fancy guns dont make the good players. If you take the time to practice, you can use a CZ-550 and take out a guy with a M107.-Good community. In the many servers I'm come across, I've been greeted by nothing but a great community. I've met some of my now great friends in DayZ, the murder simulator, and some great friends in Arma 2 Takistan Life.-Lots of vehicles. If you're used to Battlefield and how you get tanks jeeps and helicopters there, get ready for an ♥♥♥♥♥♥. There's several different tanks, multiple different cars, several helicopters and jets, all with different weapons on them. It takes a while to learn them, which is a sad downside.Cons:-Lag. Unless you have Google Fibre and a beast of a PC, this game will lag on highly populated servers and will be practically unplayable in the large cities of Takistan and Chernarus. I run this on a $300 laptop, with really bad internet, but I'm able to get about 20 fps. Just make sure to mess with your graphic settings so that way you can get optimal performance.			"

												This is a review for the series in its totality. ARMA II and its expansions were a welcomed breath of fresh air to mainstream FPS/TPS games. Everything about this game is military ops to the letter. Real Time, Open world combat where one wrong step over a ridge can end you up flatlined. Tactical thinking is requierd in most situations on the campaigns, and sometimes even micro/macro management of your forces. Be aware that even though this game is kind of getting long in the whiskers, setting your visual settings to all high and max draw distance is not advised. The max draw distance of 10,000 (meters) will crunch even the best of Graphics card, and you will notice and performance drop. Every building in the game is descrutible (from what I have experienced). Also there are some bugs with ARMA II base game. They include, but are not limited to weapons/gear disappearing when exiting water, vehicles not spawning in when you buy them, AI getting vehicles stuck for no good reason or not properly moving to a waypoint, and in certain situtaions, losing command of certain purchased units, notably in your squad. Despite these flaws, ARMA II is still and fun and challenging series. And the multiplayer has loads of fun as well. Everything from testing weapons, to dropping a bomb on a group of civillians and watching them go sky high while your frames drop to the teens.			"

												ARMA 2 OA is the definitive military simulator, it combines both FPS and third person player perspectives in the most realistic combat ever seen in a computer game. Made in 2010 ARMA 2 Operation Arrowhead takes place in Takistan a mock-up country loosely based on Afghanistan. You engage in combat against Takistans guerilla army and also engage the Takistan army. You can contol tanks, aircraft such as helicopters and a number of jets. Infantry combat has it's own combat system, hide, peek, strike. The infantry combat or any other combat in ARMA is realistic and tense, make a wrong move and the mission is over unless you have a 'REAALLY' good medic like my friend Jackson Lonsdale he'll have you patched up in matter of seconds. Overall ARMA 2 OA is an utterly brilliant game that I can thoroughly reccomend to anyone who has $25.00 to spend, it's worth it!			"

												ARMA II Operation Arrowhead is the very first expansion, and biggest for ARMA II, this can be played as a standalone game, and has a little more content than the original game. When DayZ first was released everyone was eye-ing this expansion as a way to install DayZ, since this was required. But people overlooked the quality of this standalone expansion. Taking place in a desert-like middle-eastern country, named Takistan, this is just a playground of destruction. With various gamemodes you can find yourself doing Co-op missions with friends, like flying helicopters, freeing hostages, clearing camps etc. Or you could do some full-scale massive gamemodes (Domination, Warfare, Deathmatch and Capture the island)This game is most definently must have, if you dig military sims, and are an owner of any of the other ARMA games.

Especially if you are playing the Wasteland mod, the graphics and engine are outdated, game is full of bugs, yet, it is one of the best games I've ever played, because of the gameplay. If you like being a rifleman, a heavy machinegunner, a tank gunner, a heli pilot (or gunner), a jet pilot/gunner, it doesn't matters, because it's war and you can be whatever you want. 10/10			"

												Turned out to be one of my all-time favorites. Operation Arrowhead patches so many bugs of the basic Arma II and essentially makes it a new game.While the game is still riddled with flaws, it is just awesome. A fantastic tool for tactical war-sim gameplay if you're so inclined and you bring a bit of brain matter into the equation.Grab your friends and roll in a tank, build up an outpost, dominate a crowd of kids in a plane or ditch the whole public domain, install ACE and ACRE, find a platoon and immerse in tactical infantry gameplay the way you did when you were still in boot camp many moons ago.Be a leet sniper and parachute into the action in hopes of quickscope headshots just to get mauled by enemy fire every two minutes or learn about the range of firearms and proper range estimation and use camouflage to your advantage as you work your way from one objective to the next under the cover of friendly surveillance.Shout into Voice-Over-Net because mommy doesn't understand you or join an ACRE server, learn about the use of radios and broadcast your grid reference to your platoon commander on VHF, over.The choices are yours to make once you realize that no two servers are the same and you don't actually have to play with toddlers.I will love this game forever and for always.

												I've owned this game for some years now and I tend to go back to it now and then. For me I really only bought this game for the Dayz Mod and kind of theft this game to rot in my library. I had never played the vanilla game and only used it to get to Dayz. However, when I did play it I couldn't get away from it. My 130 hours or so should explain that. Yes, most of that time I spent playing Takistan life with friends granted but other game modes were very interesting to say the least.  I never played the main campaign and don't tend to either, I believe this game is best when playing multiplayer; but only when you are with friends. Playing this game without a friend or two gets boring after a while, you can try and make new friends but if you're like me that isn't going to happen. Does anyone else love the glitches on this game ? I do, especially the ones on the Dayz mod where planes would bounce on the ground and you would die because of it, or when you try to vault into a blown up building only to break your leg. Loved it. The Dysnc! Oh god, if you want to be in the passenger seat and watch as the driver crashes into every tree in the game then this is the game for you to realise that it didn't actually happen? I like this game and always will do, but due to the lack of friends to play with and the fact I can't get the Dayz mod to work this game is some what dead to me now and will forever be a memory of the good times I had, an their were some good ones. 6.5/10. Why ? Because like I said before, its only fun when you're playing with friends and it gets quite repetitive after a while and very boring and stale fast,  and to many it is only a way to get to the Dayz mod which now for me is dead. Maybe if you were buying this is 2011-2013 then it would be great fun.   "

												Military simulator, meaning it's much harder and more unforgiving than other first person shooters on the market. Nonetheless fun, with an extremely varied selection of weapons and vehicles, whether civilian or military. It however requires a pretty beefy processor and graphics card. There are many fun gamemodes other than DayZ, like Takistan Life, Warfare, Domination and Wasteland (personal favorite). If your computer is powerful enough, I recommend checking out Arma 3. Better graphics, and a lot more content.			"

												ARMA 2 OA is the definitive military simulator, it combines both FPS and third person player perspectives in the most realistic combat ever seen in a computer game. Made in 2010 ARMA 2 Operation Arrowhead takes place in Takistan a mock-up country loosely based on Afghanistan. You engage in combat against Takistans guerilla army and also engage the Takistan army. You can contol tanks, aircraft such as helicopters and a number of jets. Infantry combat has it's own combat system, hide, peek, strike. The infantry combat or any other combat in ARMA is realistic and tense, make a wrong move and the mission is over unless you have a 'REAALLY' good medic like my friend Jackson Lonsdale he'll have you patched up in matter of seconds. Overall ARMA 2 OA is an utterly brilliant game that I can thoroughly reccomend to anyone who has $25.00 to spend, it's worth it!			"

												A Video game for anyone who ever relishes the triumphal note of western war films, who gets carried away by the moral high of being on the winning side. For those who saw the good in the Gulf War, saw how many people America helped and was proud to live in the Western world.ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead is an anti-war game. Its opening scenes are not the declaration of war, but soldiers celebrating its end. Then coming to grips with its consequences.It's hard to really adequately describe this game. Let me try. ""Operation Arrowhead"" does an excellent job of showing just how gonzo modern warfare has become. You've got unemployed reservists going to the Middle East for kicks. A takastani army who uses gas attacks, electric shock torture and other atrocities to fight the rebels. Thrown in the mix is a U.S.-educated taki whose businesses were destroyed by the Americans.Not the best role playing game in the world. Funny, shocking, thought provoking and honest, 8.5/10.			"

												Its a game that can give you both realistic feeling, and an unserious explosion of fun with friends. Not only do you have the armory to test out most of the stuff in the game, but you can also mod the ♥♥♥♥ outta it. also, if youre bored and feel like youre all alone when playing, why not join a unit/clan. My friends and i have a small thing we call 532nd, you can see more if you go to my groups (secret self advertising). As you can have desert warfare in good ol' Takistan, you can do missions in the forest of Chernarus. Theres different camos, weapons and vehicles for your entertainment purpose. Ive had tons and tons and tons and tons of fun with especially the 144 mod, and the ACE mod, and i hope a lot comes in the future too. If you dont feel like trying any mods ""yet"", heres what youll get for whatever price you bought it at:(in me and my friends' opinion)+realistic bullet penetration+semi realistic helicopter flying+AI actually knows where to go and can take commands-grenades are annoying (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGt8QbK61aE)-GameSpy shut down so theres not much of a multiplayer (unless you and your friends use hamachi to connect to eachother)This was not all the +s and -s that i have for this game, this is just what i feel like i should tell people when they ask me about the game.

												I got ArmA 2 outside of steam back in 2012 before the gamespy shut down and since I bought it back then I have thoroughly enjoyed it. In total I have amassed at least 5,000 hours of actual gameplay.I bought the game because I was at a friends house who had the original ArmA 2 from 2009 and when I seen the game I thought there was a lot of potential because of how it is open world.Almost everyday since I have had the game I've played around an hour a day but recently it has started to decline due to the game dying due to old age and useless updates for the DayZ mod.I think it is safe to say that this game is a fantastic game although it may have a bunch of bugs still in it, but the time has come for Operation Arrowhead. It is a 7 year old game in June and there hasn't been any real significant updates since the last corepatch in winter 2 years ago (or so I think). There has been no new dlc, only BattlEye Anti-Cheat updates to keep the hackers out.People need to understand that it might seem like a good game to buy now, but I encourage you to save your money for ArmA 3 if you don't have it, or, Playerunknown's Battlegrounds.I have been watching the population of this game recently and there has been a steady decrease of players. Just 2 months ago there was an average of 5,000 people concurrently playing, this number has now halved and I don't see it increasing again.It has been a good journey, but the road must come to an end.

												***********************************************************************************************************Arma II: Operation ArrowheadArma II: Operation Arrowhead is one of the best expension I've ever played. It corrected what Arma II lacked i.e. the HUD in Arma II was a bit clumsy and could often get in the way when you played. all this was fixed in Arma II: Operation Arrowhead. HUD was not the only thing that is new in the expension, new armd cars, helicopters and guns are new.DayzThe main reason whay people bay Arma ll and Arma ll:Operation Arrowhead is to play Dayz. Dayz is a mod to Arma ll. To play the mod you nead Arma ll and Arma:Operation Arrowhead. Most of may time in Arma ll:Operation Arrowhead is in the Dayz. You can play alone and whit your frends. the mod have some problems. The hit box can be wherd som tims and the cars often have problems driving over bridges.

												Definately one of my favourite games of all time, there is a broad spectrum of things you can do with the right mods equiped, be it the infamous ""DayZ"" Mod, or just a standard Co-op Mission. I definately recommend this to anyone with even a small interest in a tactically focused Shooter-Game.Additional players/friends improve the experience drastically.TL;DR Buy it, be it just for ""DayZ"" but try the other possibilites too if you find the time.10/10			"

												This game is wonderful, the infantry and vehicle combat is spectacular although the vehicles have some wonky physics but overall the game does what it does best, simulate combat in a realistic environment. The campaign was overall good and the online play is exceptionally good if you play with friends or even by yourself. Although if you are going to purchase this game I'd recommend buying all the DLC at once since the PMC DLC also has a very good story to it and adds cool vehicles and weapons.			"

												Definately one of my favourite games of all time, there is a broad spectrum of things you can do with the right mods equiped, be it the infamous ""DayZ"" Mod, or just a standard Co-op Mission. I definately recommend this to anyone with even a small interest in a tactically focused Shooter-Game.Additional players/friends improve the experience drastically.TL;DR Buy it, be it just for ""DayZ"" but try the other possibilites too if you find the time.10/10			"

												Arma 2 OA is one of if not the most relictice games of all time. it is hard to lern and fun to play.Gameplay:Gameplay is not esay and is not to be overlocked so if you like the army and are not afrad of dieding over and over and over then pick it up and it is a good game. and it is best in good detail everything feeles alive and is good when you kill someone so in that aspect it is rely good. Animations:Not good animations but far from the wost i'v seen so not much to talk abote here. Story:The story of Arma 2 OA is that the tacastan (do not know how to spell it) army has seized control of the contery. the US laed coaltion is to bring down the tacs and liberaty the contery. And the story is reliy well pulled out for a game like this.Verdict:Arma 2 OA Is a good game with good gameplay for the type of game it is and my finel verdict for Arma 2 OA is a 8.5			"

												Great game to chew up hours of free time. Play almost 100 hours and I will never regret those hours spent playing the  DayZ mod optional with the game, which I encourage you to try. Look up popularly known Youtube content creators like JackFrags, FRANKIEonPCin1080p (I know he had a couple of scandals regarding the hacking incidents, such a shame) and PsiSyndicate.Fantastic game DayZ is.Although a bit more expense required to play this game compared to other survival games (Rust, Romero's Aftermath and Minecraft etc.) it is still worth a buy. I bought the package with most of the DLC (ArmA 2: Complete Collection, costing $39.99 USD without any sale) making the game look fantastic. Runs extremely well on Windows 7 - 10.There is a deep aspect of survival in this game, making it one of the most realistic zombie post-apocalyptic games on Steam. Heavily refined over the years, Arma 2: DayZ Mod is a fantastic game to play. Great fun with friends and can get lonely playing solo in the in the zombie apocalypse.Does require deep concetration and skill to maximize enjoyment.			"

We turned aroundcame in for a landingwhen a missile came out of nowhere from the base and hit my freinds aircraft making it careen into the desert sands below leaving him screaming for help, alone.I landed, got out, got shot in the legsand then attempted to crawl to my freind and revive him, in which resulted in me getting run over by a old takistani shopkeeper in a Lada.I don't think i have ever seen such an accurate representation of the military then what i had just went through.

It's a little glicthy and laggy from time to time but is still the best zombie survival game to date.
Graphis are a bit old but the gameplay is solid and fun for a ton of hours, just make sure you have friends to play with and back you up when you're in need. "

We turned aroundcame in for a landingwhen a missile came out of nowhere from the base and hit my freinds aircraft making it careen into the desert sands below leaving him screaming for help, alone.I landed, got out, got shot in the legsand then attempted to crawl to my freind and revive him, in which resulted in me getting run over by a old takistani shopkeeper in a Lada.I don't think i have ever seen such an accurate representation of the military then what i had just went through.

												Arma II: Operation Arrowhead is an expansion pack of Arma II and was released in 2010. I didn't discover this game until 2014 when I started playing the DayZ Mod ""Overpoch"" (Arma II:Operation Arrowhead is the base game for all DayZ mods).This review is for the Overpoch mod more than Operation Arrowhead (which I actually have not played the single player campaign).Like all Arma games, you can sink hours and hours into these games because of the huge mulitude of possibilities.  Overpoch is an excellent mod (it is actually a combination of two separate DayZ mods, Epoch and Overwatch).  It involves crafting, building, PvP, AI missions, and much much more. I highly recommend this game but be prepared to lose many hours of time to it!			"

На самом деле DayZ не стоит и грамма самой Arma II. Сейчас эта игра ушла в прошлое, уступив третьей части, но для фанатов, она останется незаменима.			"

												By far one of the best games I've ever played.With Arma 3 out, I can say that this game is still better than Arma 3 at the moment.I mean, the DayZ mod(s) are amazing, Arma 2 Wasteland is fantastic.Highly recommend for those who love some good shooters (and realistic ones, too)The graphics are NOT the best, but gameplay > graphics any day for this game.One of the only games that doesn't take 1000 shots at someone to kill them ;P+1 for me!9/10			"

												This is a really good Military Simulator. there are tons of guns, armaments, objects, etc. you can use to create whatever kind of situation you see fit. like rebels stealing NATO supplies, or US marines taking over Russian FOBs. plus this game has tons of mods, including the infamous ACE/ACRE mod and the ever popular DayZ mod. gamespy might be shutting down next month, but this game will be ever so strong in the Multiplayer department. besides the mods, there are tons of realism units out there, like th 15th MEU and the JTF207, there's a clan out there for everyone. and if you arent into clan based dealings, maybe you could try your hand at an Role Playing server? there are different kinds of RP Life servers on ArmA 2 OA, such as the common Chernarus and Takistan life servers, to ones such as City Life RP and TCG RP servers. like the realism units, there's a community for everyone. the greatness of this game is that you have the freedom to do what ever you want, how you want it, and when you want it.

It's a little glicthy and laggy from time to time but is still the best zombie survival game to date.

												After being a fan favorite, from my early childhood, this game has truly tested time.With amazing sounds, graphics, and combat, it felt too real for 2010. From the aminious forests and valleys in the northern sectors, to the barren fields where you expect an entire army to start firing at you, this game immerses and involves you.As well, as being home to coop domination, team deathmatch, and more, Arma 2/Arma 2 OA brought and sustained one of its best, FREE, modded expansionsDrumroll please.........DAYZ!Featuring a new way to play, with scavenging, surviving and adapting, Dayz brought a whole new aspect to the Arma environment. Whereas before, you would ignore enemy weapons, explosives and clothing, you now needed to loot and make sure you had enough bullets, food and supplies for any situation...Whereas before, you'd be dissapointed you'd died, and have to respawn at base or restart the mission, Dayz stressed, and panicked you. If you died, you would probably lose your gear forever, lost in the Coyote Backpack of that ghilie bandit at Sniper Hill. Additionally, the game branched out and expanded tremendously out of Vanilla Dayz.Modders added bases (my favorite), new guns/sounds, new maps, new vehicles, a new economy system, and SO MUCH MORE!If a game truly has the best modding community, it's Arma.I hope, that Bohemia continues to create and enhance the Arma experience, in future installments and updates, fixing glitches and annoyances, like physics, destruction, medical treatments, and more.But if you can get a group of 2-3 friends, get in a group chat, and load up this game, it will amaze you with a brilliantly crafted, Tactial masterpiece.Arma 2/ Arma 2 OA: 9.5/10			"

												Already have 232 hours on this game, mainly because of wasteland and takistan life revolution. Been a huge fan of this game because of those two ""mods"". Speaking of mods, I bought this game because I wanted to try out DayZ. The DayZ mod, not standalone... I fell in love with it. Played for hours and hours per day. And then, school started again... I was heart broken, I had to wait for several hours to get to play again, and im not talking about sleeping. Well I did sleep during the classes sooo... But long story short: Love this game, many mods and gamemodes, great community(most of the time).			"

												This game has given me many hours of pleasure and to this day is still on of my favourite games. this game has things that no other game has and this game does what it does perfectly, yes it might be a bit glitchy and buggy (especially the physic's) but thats one of the reasons it fun, like what better than seeing an APC or tank hit a tiny wire fence and explode. another thing you have to keep in mind if you buy this game is get the wasteland mod it will make your life wonderful. build ing bases on this game with the wasteland mod with a super toxic community on a full 50 player server is just great. so next time you have spare money or this is on sale buy it.P.s i hope my review helped you make up your mind on Buying this game it would be great if you could thumbs up my reviw so many other people can learn from what i've written.

												This arguably one of the most in depth military games out there, the modding community has also really made some stellar missions, and other content. There is an entire website dedicated to new vehicles, weapons, camo, game over hauls, and maps. It really has something for everyone, and can also be modded to play the famous DayZ mod which has countless hours on its on. Arma II: OA really shouldn't be called a game, its more like a sampler. You can literally play exactly what you want, if its an idea there is a mod it really is a shining example of what cooperation between a developer and their fanbase should look like in the whole industry.The game can be demanding on your setup so make sure you have a good CPU, lots of ram, and decent graphics card. The settings cranked in this game make it pretty damn gorgeous so you will not be dissapointed. The game is often on sale as are all of the initial dlcs, which add various new things, and also unlock the full potential of high res texturing.			"

A few friends of mine love playing this game for the tactical feel, DayZ is fun but there are WAY too many servers for it...Pros:+Large amount of vehicles, with even bigger maps, even flights from one side to another can take several minutes or more+Kicka** weapons+Kicka** vehicles+Looks great, and runs better+Controls aren't all that bad+Have to aim above target at long range, authentic bullet physics (minus wind)+Artillery requires communication between the units+Decent customization+Moddability, mods like Invasion 1944 (personal favorite) and DayZ (ugh) have been a huge part of this game's community.+Extensive level editor where people make levels so detailed, you'd think the devs made it (Quoting my friend Jack.)+So, so much moreCons:-Laughable voices-The guns sound like someone hitting a garbage can with a stick-Even though the controls aren't that bad, they could use some work, especially Aircraft controls-Aiming is pretty wonky-Clunky as ♥♥♥♥.-No FOV adjustment from what I see, can cause motion sickness to some people-Pretty wierd HUD-Community for the base game is...well...

												I am literally in LOVE with this game.Arma is one of the very few games that has managed to suck out 200+ hours out of me, without me getting bored of the content within game. It is an amazing game that you should have at least tried if you are a gamer, I mean c'mon the Multiplayer of Arma II is free, and the best parts of the game are in the multiplayer!Arma 2 OA is a standalone expansion from Arma 2 and it offers a completely new experience to the other game with a whole new upgrade to the look and feel of the game which is worth the full title cost. It is set in the fictional country of Takistan which is torn apart by the OpFor forces stationed there and is trying to be recovered by the BluFor forces stationed three. The game also allows the player to play in the old map Chernarus, but only if you own a copy of Arma II or have the Arma II Free game installed. The single player gives you the experience of being there and commanding a unit. The single player also features parts where you are in control of your superiors and takes a different direction of how a mission is played. What it does is it gives you and objective, guidelines, but you don’t necessarily have to follow them, but for the sake of story and depth its best to play within reason. The game allows you to learn from your mistakes, adapt or play in way that nobody else has, For example I was in a mission where all my men died, and I had one injured man left, and I had to get to a rendezvous but we had to face about a chalk of men. From constantly dying in the mission, I learnt that I could not protect my teammate as he would die instantly from any damage, so instead of facing the enemy I ran off and took a stealth route, which I could complete but because of AI Intelligence, he couldn't. And it’s because of moments like that, that make the single player something really special.The multiplayer gives you an experience of user created gameplay that very few games allow you to do, and this is one of the trademarks of the series. With some game modes and missions that you can play together with others, most people prefer to play user generated missions or game modes. The mission side of things is very simple. You get given tools that with a basic knowledge of google search or scripting allow you to create a mission that could be put in the single player of the game itself. I myself have made a few of these types of missions, ranging from border patrols, races to a vehicle and weapon showcase created to test out all the vehicles and weapons in the game and enable anyone to learn how to fly a plane or helicopter in game, without getting yelled at for wasting a valuable asset in certain multiplayer game modes. Game modes made by independent developers or groups of people is where the main fan base of the game stands at. Some of these 'gems' include:-Domination, a team based game where you are part of an army working together fighting and liberating towns from the OpFor stationed in them. -DayZ which now has evolved into a standalone game, is a whole new game mode in which you are one of the many survivors of a zombie infestation and you try to live within that scenario getting over the many obstacles that would exist including in depth problems like health and blood loss and social problems like gangs bandits and trust.-I44 is a whole re-branding of the game. It’s called Invasion 1944 and is set during the invasion of American Troops into Europe. The whole game is remade with a WW2 feel, with iconic weapons, gear clothing and vehicles. You have at your disposal, the German, British and American army to play with playing historical battles or some of the user-Generated games modes within Arma II such as DayZ and Domination.-ACE Is an upgrade to the already semi realistic game that Arma is. It offers more depth, challenge and realism and is seen as a mod for the more hard core fans, or people that like a more difficult game or a more enhancing experience in comparison to the vanilla version. It achieves this by adding little details everywhere such as fainting and ear protection from explosions. Also it adds more difficulty with things like shooting and stamina making the game that one step more realistic.-WasteLand is a scavenge and co-operate game mode in which players must earn money to make and but defences for their team, with a goal of domination and annihilation of the other team and the land around. The last game mode I want to talk about RP civilian life or as it’s now known as 'RPG Life'. This game mode adds a Sims like aspect to the game, as you play a civilian who can live his life normally or he can become a criminal or rebel and fight the police force who are in charge of keeping peace in the country. With trading, working and doing normal things like eating and drinking this game mode is one that will never be the same twice. Now this isn’t a full review of the game so I'll stop at the game modes and not expand any further as I could go on forever, talking about this game. So in short I give this game a 85/100, the reasons?Some Positives:-Has a decent campaign with a whole new approach to how a mission can be done-The multiplayer is and unlimited canvas with almost unlimited potential.-The community is a wide and strong one adding a lot to the game itself.-The Semi-Realism is an enhancing experience that adds on a lot to the game.Some Negatives:-There are a lot of fundamental ideas that are expected to be seen in sandboxes that are missing.-There could have been a lot more things done by the developers than just leaving the community to handle it and where there was support it was usually not in the places needed-There are some really bad flaws in AI and horrible animations that really take away from the game			"

												What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No. I go for the chandelier; it's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I love the cold. Thirty years later I get a postcard. I have a son. And he's the Chief of Police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.			"

												If your buying this for DayZ heres a warning. DayZ is extremely fun for a while, but its riddled with hackers. You have to join servers with active moderators or you will be playing with them. Also once you get setup with a vehicle, a stock of food and water, and weapons it gets a little boring. All you can do after that is pvp and if you die you pretty much have to start over, unless you manage to get your body back. Overall its a fun game for a while, try trading for it or getting it on sale.			"

												Arma 2 Review:The short; A great game, with great physics, perhaps the best for its time. Great graphics has well, night and day cycles well. Controls are a slightly confusing for some people, but can be modified and adjusted to the users liking. However for  fast for people who are willing to learn the controls are positioned quite well (Except the in-game VOIP). Game play itself is great has well. Single player has one of the best storys, with multiple endings and quite long in length (You can even finish the game early and get a ""secret ending""). However the multiplayer is perhaps the best place to enjoy the game to its full. Not met a game like it ever (Except Arma 3... but thats next in the series anyway). Cant list any real flaws, at least none that i noticed, except for the steep learning curve. Arma 2 OA adds some greater graphics, new story and new area to play around in; this is a great expansion and exactly what we needed. Furthurmore this is a great modding platform. Some of the best role play experiences i have had come from this game. The Life mode, and the DayZ mod(s) are great community produced items that have shown that giving the community the right tools, a great concept can be made. I highly recommend this game based on the price, the mods, and the game play of the ""vanilla"" game. Great experience, and i hope to see you on some DayZ mods. *Hint* I am not friendly. "

												If you're looking for a war game to have fun, DO NOT buy any Arma game. Arma is a simulator. It's supposed to be realistic as possible, and we all know that real wartime situations aren't too fun. I do love this game though, because the missions are very well made and it's pretty realistic. There's a lot of tactics involved, meaning you have to use strategy at all times; you can't just run into battle and expect to get a good killstreak going. So if you're looking for realism, give Operation Arrowhead a try. I rate this game 9.5/10.			"

												This is actually my favorite game of all time. The countless ammount of hours I spent playing island life (800 or so) with my friends was an experiance that I will never recreate. The game itself is not good unless you are a military enthusiast however the modding community for this game is increadible. Dont forget DayZ, DayZ was the most fun and unique experiance about this game. Its the sole reason of Arma 2's exhistance. It revolutionized how gaming is today by inspiring many developers to touch on the same unique gameplay experiance that is zombie survival. To give this a rating on a scale of 10 I give it a 10,000,000,000/10. <3			"

												Arma 2...Is it worth buying? Lets see lets see lets see...Arma 2: Operation is a shooter Military simulation game. Were you can take your own squad into battle. Ok. First of all. If your just looking for another story mode game. Were you can just run and shoot. Then this game is not for you.  And stuff like that. Because if you gets shot 3 times your dead. Now. This game. Got me playing for a few hours now. And it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off a little bit. When it comes to Lag. But Arma 2 Has more lag Then Arma 2: Operation. But your computer has like runs like 1000 frames a ####ING secound. Then you don't have to worry about  the ####ing Lag. If you cant buy Arma 3. Then i would buy this with Operation. I got the Dlcs. And i like the Dlcs. Ok So forgot about that. So the gameplay. It's really looks real. When it comes to Military. You shoot Al's from far away. You can control your own squad. And one of the missons on Arma 2. You can even buy units. And If you Think. That this is another one of those games. Were you just level up. No This game is not all about that. It's about Military. And that buy units Part. You could just buy cheap units. [Ingame money] And they would still be useful. Don't think this is Army of Two. [Well you could just do Army of two on a misson.] But you would have to be very skilled. 3 Shots your dead. If your looking for a game. That looks real. And just like real life Military. This game is for you. If your looking for a game were you can just, Run and Gun.[Which means like Call of duty Story. Were you just shoot then. And Run.] Then this game is not for you. So this game is ? Worth a buy👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 YES			"

												This game definetely is not for everyone. It takes time and effort to be as good as you dream to be, but oh man once you get good it's awesome. I've never had a more realistic expierince in any game. Though graphics and FPS may not be the best, it is what you expect from this type of game. This game is one of the reasons I saved up for a Gaming pc, and it does not disapoint. There are 2 things that are super annoying about this game. Team killers ( You will come by them at one point or another) and flares not working. It is so annoying to mash the R key and have the missle still smack your choppers ♥♥♥ right out of the sky. Not to mention the super annoying squad auto-command/responces. All you will hear is ""under fire"", ""Reloading"", ""need help!"", ""Connot fire!"" over and over and over. Thereis a setting in the options menu that I highly insist you turn off to keep you from hearing this. Other than those minor issues this game was the peas to my carrots!			"

												ARMA II is a spectacular mil-sim that's all about tactics and strategy, running and gunning won't get you far here. This game features a wide variety of firearms, big and small, as well as vehicles and aircaft that can really change the tide of battle. ARMA focuses on representing it's wide assortment of toys accurately, you will find a level of detail here that is uncommon in most other shooters. That being said, it does not achieve full simulation of most things. You could probably find more accurate car characteristics in a racing game, and better aircraft simulation in a dedicated flight-sim game. It doesn't matter though, the combines arms feeling this game creates will make you feel like you're in a real battlefield.If there was one thing I had to complain about, it would have to be the 'feel' of moving and aiming. To me, everything feels very clunky and tougher than it should be. If you like a tactical experience of a battlefield, get this game. It really shines, in a small squad with your friends breaching a house, or in a huge battle in a city, this game is great for all aspects of war. My recommendation: Join/host a game of domination or insurgency with a group of friends, both are very fun experiences that my buddies and I couldn't stop playing for hours.            "
