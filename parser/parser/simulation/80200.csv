												Fate of the World is a really deep (and dark) Simulation of our upcoming years. Especially with all the available DLC it has lots and lots of content to keep you busy for a long while and make sure you'll get money's worth. Like all simulations and simulation games it is obviously not a complete and perfect replica of the real world. Of all the Simulation-games I've played throughout my life it is one of the deppest and most realistic simulations though.You should definitely not play this game if you're afraid to start over again many times until you reach one of the desired endings. There is a reason that the 7th word in the description is ""dramatic"". You'll often run into bad ends or simply won't reach the neccessary mission goals in time. A great idea can backfire and make you think twice about adopting it the next time around.The game presents choices for every region in ""cards"". This makes it look like a card-game to some people but it really isn't. I think the game desingers just tried to find a name to summarize ""Policies"", ""Research Programs"", ""Military Actions"", etc. and then they though ""Hey, those things are presented on stuff that looks like cards."" So they went with cards. Don't be turned away becaues you don't like card-games. FotW is not a card game and it might just aswell be called ""decisions""; There's no deck, no drawing of cards, etc, etc.Play this game if:-You like mental challenges-You're not afraid to see our Earth go to hell (because of your decisions)-You think Trial-and-Error can be funDon't play this game if:-You hate starting over-You hate going through menus and just want to ""play play play""			"

												Fate of the World tells a story of what will probably happen if or when the global warming gets out of hand and they let you to be in charge.The challenge is not a simple one. In charge of GEO, you are faced with all the global problems at the same time from floods and changing weather patterns caused by the global warming, economic crisis caused by the decreasing oil production rate and the social crisis caused by overpopulation. You tackle the problems by instituting 5-year plans. They are represented by issuing policies, i.e. ""playing cards"", each of which costs money and man power. And if you screw up, you will be lynched or disintegrated by a global nuclear war.There are six card types, ranging from projects to several kinds of policies. Projects are special long-term actions that let you e.g. start space program or force people to go vegetarian. The policies allow you to do anything from e.g. constructing defenses against warming effects to using extreme measures of population control. These are used to affect the problems represented by charts and statistics available to those of you who want to see the concrete effects.At first it feels easy to handle the problems. Then the economic crisis because of the lack of oil kicks in and you no longer have enough money to handle everything. Then you have to learn to prioritize or get lynched trying.There are several scenarios to try out. The basic one, with several variations, is to try to survive until year 2200 battling the global warming and trying to save the humanity, but there's also a scenario where you're actually trying to destroy the world, if you're in a mood for some evil masterminding.Mood and suspense are big things here, maintained by some awestrucking music and local news from around the world, listed by region. Interface needs a while to get used but most of the action happens anyway in choosing policies and judging, what you can afford and where to concentrate your efforts. One full game takes about two hours of intense thinking to play through, so by the time you're through with your first game you'll already know enough to try that much better again. It's exciting to try different approaches and once you finally manage to survive through the term (even barely), it's a total triumph.			"

												It is exactly what it seems to be. You guide humanity to it's brighter future through the global warming, fossil fuel depletion and population rise. With all of what makes a good global strategy/simulation: underlying mathematical models, realistic region balance, tons of available data (hidden by a click-fest UI, but at least data is meaningful and easy to comprehend). Technologies, nukes and space missions supplied.IMPORTANT: get the Unofficial Patch, only then the game becomes what it was supposed to be. From other reviews you can get the impression that the game is abandoned, biased and half-broken. Yes, it is. Unofficial patch really patches the game for better.			"

												This game is FAR from perfect -- even with the ""unofficial patch"" there are are loads of bugs.  But it definitely presents a perspective on an extremely important issue that video gamers are not likely to stumble across on their own.  It certainly got me thinking on a couple of subjects.  If you're so entrenched in your own beliefs that nothing can ever change your mind, then don't bother with this title.  But if your mind is open even a teensy crack, it wouldn't hurt to try it out.  You might even have fun -- it is, after all, a game!  And maybe -- like me -- it might inspire you to do your own research on the subject and learn a thing or two.			"

												So in this game you try to save the world from Climate Change via a variety of methods with questionable effectiveness. To be honest, this game is rather difficult and not easy to pick up because alot of the terminology and proposed schemes for fixing Climate Change will likely be unknown to alot of people. There is some in-game information, but that still won't prevent this game from often being frustrating. Also it has bugs, with some of the achievements simply being broken with almost no chance of them ever being fixed since the devs for this game are long gone.It's an informative little game that is often frustrating due to its difficulty and lack of adequate information. Another case where a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" just is not enough to describe my overall views on this game. Ultimately... I'm going to have to say no. It's interesting and a rare game dealing with real-world issues, but it's problems are just too annoying for me to recommend. :(			"

												Fate of the World is an interesting simulation of how to deal with global warming, to say the least. You are given the role as an underfunded leader of a global organisation set up to handle climate change and global warming. To do so, you are given a whole lot of options and a large chain of potential tasks you can tell your lackeys to do.The first problem then is obvious, you have no idea what these tasks(Displayed as cards) do until you try them, and often only a vague idea of how they'll effect the various things they're supposed to effect. This will be frustrating, and may lead to you just restarting several times just to see what your policies are actually doing, and what they're effecting. Trial and error gameplay will be the first thing you notice, but that is only after you have spend a turn building offices all over, which you need before you can even see what policies and programs you can enact.There is no real tech tree equivalent you can find that shows you what exactly you can do after building one of such offices, or what leads to what other things.A real shame is that the game is excellent at hiding your options from you, and that it also hides the data behind a small tab in the top right. You can see practically everything you need to know about an area, but how your politices will effect it, or how these things interact with eachother is left completely behind the scenes. Only a few things you can do actually tell you the full extend of what they're going to be doing with the limited money you're spending on them.In short, frustration. However, once you get over that and learn roughly what policies go where, you will find the game opens up to you, and lets you actually play it. And it is a much bigger game than it seems to be at first. Sure, it deals with global warming, and your goal is technically to stop it, but to focus purely on that is not going to help you. It's your end goal, while your organisation does not only have the authority, but also the responsibility to prevent wars, establish healthcare and education systems, manage economic growth, and fund technology. And all of these things are not told to you, and neither is it explained to you how to do them, you have essentially become the New World Order and everyone more experienced than you has died or quit. Indeed, one can ask what actual governments do in this game, and I so far haven't seen them bother with anything yet.When they said it was all up to you to stop climate change, they meant EVERYTHING. Make the middle east a stable place, prevent the global economy from crashing, fund space missions, create anti-flooding and drought systems, establish healthcare all over the globe, stop deforestation, ease the use of fossile fuel, and many, many more things.And to do this, you get barely a cent.And even if you do know what you're doing, even a little, you will have trouble. There is very little margin for error, as a few mistakes will send Africa into a continent-wide civil war(As opposed to how it is right now with only parts of it being at war all the time), and you might start nuclear conflicts in Latin America if you don't personally check up on them every turn to make sure they aren't getting ready to use your nuclear power plants for weaponry. Fate of the World is difficult in part because there are a lot of factors involved, and you are told about none of them until ♥♥♥♥ has already hit the fan.Make no mistake, it is a difficult game, but it is a great simulator. It simulates production of fossil fuels, transport, energy generation, industry, agriculture, economy, disasters and so much more. But it just doesn't tell you about any of this.Aside from that, the moral lessons it tries to teach are questionable at best. As the only way so far that I have found to get close to succeeding every time I try is to start a genocide program targetting China, India, the Middle East, and if they keep complaining South Asia too.Fate of the World teaches you(Or at least, me) that the only way foreward is to kill the asians(Except Japan), and to wipe the Middle East from the map. Africa is to be policed at all times and forcibly kept poor(but educating them) until technology exists to create emissions free power and industry for them.The Americas and Europe are to be converted to renewable power, with media campaigns focussing on distracting them from the rest of the world. Japan and Oceania are pretty much empty as far as global population is concerned, so just give them a few defences against floods and occasionally some other protection if they need it.(To switch over ALL of Oceania's transports to electric instead of oil based costs the same as all of Europe or North America's for some reason)Fate of the World is an interesting game that I would recommend for people who enjoy detailed simulators, and don't mind having to figure out everything themselves. But I would certainly not give it to kids.Worth 10 bucks? I'd say so, if you are one of those people into simulators, or if you've seen someone play it and think you can do better			"

Look up Fate of the World Unofficial Patch v0.50 by Delnar_Ersike in particular, I find it does the best job of creating interesting economic trade offs and providing a more objective, less statist interpretation of economics and markets.

												An interesting game that addresses complex geopolitical topics and one of the most pressing issues of our time. Unfortunately, it does this by pushing a very specific narrative in which only cap-and-trade works to halt the eventual end of the world. What about switching power generation to solely nuclear and renewables? Well, uranium runs out pretty fast, even with breeder reactors (what?) and apparently the game thinks that it'd take about 1500 years to switch over to renewables, judging by the 0.018% change in energy mix every five years, assuming you've made renewables a priority.It's still a fun game to play around with, and I don't consider my money wasted, but I really wish I'd known that some options were ridiculously non-realistic. Pass, unless you really like playing Cap-And-Trade simulator.			"

												If you draw a line between Democracy and Civilization, Fate of the World stand inbetween, in the fringe of serious gaming.The game has been funded by humanitarian organisations and created with the help of universities. The result is a robust and deep political / social / economic / scientific / environmental underlying engine. And here is the true quality of this game : the engine is accessible, but most of the time hidden.As a player, you receive updates of the actual situation in multiple regions of the world in shape of news or governemental reports. From that point you can hire agents and select several missions displayed as cards (nice design idea) for a time set between 5 years and permanent.The game is not easy, the task at hand is hard. Improving the life and well-being of populations won't prevent insurrections or shield you from climate change - at least in the early years.The interesting benefit of Fate of the World is to give you perspective on critical issues, and experience the tough job of trying to be a fireman in several places at the same time.

												It's a pretty complex card game where you get to play global policy maker. There are actually a lot of different things you need to keep track of including region stability, employment, population growth, energy demands, technology research, medical care, education, and many others. There is an immense amount of data available to aid you in your cause, but you can choose to ignore it altogether and just ""roll the dice"" and see what happens.The game is not very intuitive. It isn't obvious what each card does until you've played them a couple of times, and it took me several campaigns before I got a better understanding of how they were used to actually accomplish goals. You'll definitely need a little patience to struggle through it. It's a different strategy game than the norm, but nothing I would recommend. It's one of those games that you either love or hate--not much room for being on the fence.			"

												This game is hard. Very hard.That is good.The problems posed in this game are (mostly) real, and the solutions it offers seem plausible.As some sort of leader of the world, you are tasked with saving it. Saving humanity from itself as it were. You will have to fight global warming, poverty and recession as you struggle to minimize climate change and human suffering (except in that one mission where you have to kill them all).You play the game in a very board-game like fashion, you hire agents to carry out your decisions. These decisions are represented by cards, allowing each agent to play one card each turn. Individual agents are locked to world regions and can, if the situation gets bad, be lost.  Agents cost money to hire and cards cost money to play, and you have a very tight budget, therefore you must prioritise. Will you fight poverty and disease in Africa? Will you fight to reduce emissions in North America? Will you try to cool the political situation in the middle-east? All these things have to be done, but you cannot afford to do them all at once.This game is a challenge. This game is political. This game is good.			"

Whether you deal with it through socially acceptable means, or more evil strategies, is up to you. You even get to decide what socially acceptable is, as long as you have the money. Fate of the World is a beautiful game, with crisp clean art that helps you instantly identify what is happenning and when.

												More of a Puzzle Than A GameGame-wise, the premise is very simple: 1) invest actions into nations with money,  2) invest actions and money to affect change in nations. 3) Try to reach your goals by wise investment and look out for random events.   The first mission shows how easy this is to do with 2 nations. but the second takes out the stops and gives you the world.   You'll be trying to develop and put out fires on a limited budget.   Your only resources are time and actions and already I see how there isn't going to be much replay value once you figure out the missions. So go slow: there aren't many.  Also, even though the game likes to throw precise graphs and numbers at you to show you change, your own actions are clumsy by comparism.  You have no way to apply a finely-tuned strategy or invent something new.  Its always invest money and wait 5 years.Do not get this game if you have no patience for strategy or hate board games.  Do get this game if you're looking for a unique challenge or want to get perspective on how tough it might be to save the world and keep people happy at the same time.			"

												Fate of the world is a unique card game. There aren’t many games where you can pacify the masses with vapid pop princesses while you prepare a plague to kill them off (for the environment, of course).  At first glance you could dismiss Fate of the World as tree hugger propaganda, but this game is probably too cynical for people who think they can make the world a better place. For example, species go extinct all the time, Africa needs to be pacified by armed might before you can think about saving Rhinos, and nations will expel your global environmentalist super organization if your goals don’t mesh with their national interests.Personally, I like it. If you are a budding Machiavellian looking for a challenge then consider picking it whenever it’s on sale for $5.  "

												I never thought I would enjoy this.It's a world management simulator basically, though don't let that put you off.What's great about playing it is that it uses a card based system which makes it have a fun gameplay element.It is also brutally hard and has a learning curve like a cliff. I recommend watching a walkthrough of the game before you attempt anything beyond the first mission (tutorial).But the main takeaway from the game is that it teaches you about the world, about the dangers of trying to deal with global warming, without actually trying to teach you anything.  It's amazing how that works out.I first played it early 2011 and as time moves on, I continue to see things happening in the world that I already knew about due to this game.  It blows my mind.

												Fate of the World is an educational strategy game that places you in charge of many global policies to try to save the world from ecologocial disaster. It's pretty fun to play, and certainly far better than you'd expect from edu-tainment. You basically have to balance the political, economical, and social problems of individual nations with the fight against long-term solutions to global climate change.This game is hard. Very hard. The first mission's no problem, but I'm still trying to figure out the second one after three failures. The main problem is that you aren't given enough information to tell what affects what, or how you're supposed to react to certain problems. One false move in 2030 will leave India devastated in 2070, and you don't know what it was most of the time.It's worth giving this game a try if you can pick it up cheap. It's fun to play around with and see what you can do, but don't expect to finish this one without a lot of out-of-game research.			"

It is hard, and a lot of times humanity seems to be utterly f****d by the end of your scenario (if you even manage to make it that far). However, it is a lot of fun for people who enjoy ""what if"" scenarios, and it also teaches you a bit about the environment.

												A great game in which you must guide humanity through a shortage of resources and climate change. The game is very difficult as a few mistakes and the Earth becomes an inhospitable place. There are a few beginner missions which serve as a tutorial, but after that you're on your own. That being said, there's no greater feeling than beating the Three Degrees mission. Fate Of The World is worth the price. As for the DLCs they are a bit short on content so I recommend getting them when they go on sale.			"

												While the game does contain some green propaganda and isn't really too realistic, but unofficial patch can easily help with that, and there are some nice scenarios like Dr. Apocalypse or the whole so-called Denial DLC offers a much more realistic pack of scenarios. But even in the ""normal"" ones you can just enjoy rulling over the whole world, like all totallitarian regimes scaring the populace into submission by some scapegoat and external enemy, even if it has to be ""climate change"". I add the tag villain protagonist to the whole thing and recommend it. Even when you can be not a villain in many scenarios, some actually require you to be either a villain or well-intentioned extremist. You can be Ras al Ghul or typical Illuminati world governement if you want, as long as you just enforce your rule and force them not to emit too much - killing, forced sterilization, regime change if necessary, one-child policy - all this and more is possible.

												So, you think you fix the world? In this game, Planet Earth is a puzzle (that you're probably not going to be able to solve first time!)Different regions of the world have varying virtues and vices. Stable regions won’t mind having their long-term energy consumption tampered with, but you will need to balance this out with short-term environmental solutions to keep the sceptics happy. Or perhaps you would rather make the Earth uninhabitable? Well there is an unlockable scenario where you can do just that!What keeps bringing me back to this game is the tiny margin for error. Perhaps you’ll lose control over a region a few turns before your time is up, causing it to fart out just enough toxic gas to lose the game. So you go back to your last save and make a special effort to keep that region happy.You'll either love or hate this game.

												I learned a lot playing this hugely educational game.Fate of the World is a game where you have to save the world from disaster. It offers the player an onslaught of statistics for each major region of the world, and an interesting ""card"" mechanic for adminstering policies necessary to achieve mission objectives. This game was developed with input from Oxford University and Oxfam, so there is a strong factual basis to the whole affair. The missions are very tough, but each playthrough rewards the would-be GEO President with masses of insight on the challenges real world leaders might have in managing world affairs with limited resources in an unpredictible world.My main gripe is the presentation of the statistics: it's not very thoughtfully laid out meaning lots of clicking between screens; better design would have solved this problem and made gameplay more enjoyable. The sheer volume of stats is a bit overwhelming to begin with, but after a few likely unsuccessful games, you get the hang of it. In my judgement, this is an excellent game. I'm not really into strategy games so don't know if it would appeal to the hardcore of that crowd, but for a generic gamer like me it's satisfyingly fun and also very informative. If you want to learn about world affairs or fancy a career in the UN or something this is a great educational tool.			"

												A complex simulation where you are tasked with the responsibility of saving humankind from itself, balancing short and long term goals, targeting research and development, managing political instability, consumer attitudes, militancy, perspectives on the green agenda to pilot the world through to a sustainable lifestyle. It is very difficult, but ulimately reewarding, forcing you into difficult ethical dilemmas. Will you take time to save the whale and the black rhino while you save makind? Or not.To play the game effectively, the unofficial patch is a must since it explains what impact your choices will have in affected sectors. WIth care, the game is eminently beatable but to succeed here are a few suggestions.# Beat up on coal early and also business and household regulations in the developed world. targetting high emissions / coal areas to give you a running start. Also, funding law enforcement in unstable areas, whilst being dead money, is necessary until you can take such measures that will stabilise conditions. (Thanks Quill).# Whenever the first world is happy, judiciously plunder tobin tax, but for one cycle only. I rotated Europe/US with Oceania/Japan and whilst annoying them with one hand, throwing them a happiness fish to open a card slot, keep them compliant and release some spending at the same time. RInse and repeat. A happy world will open its pockets.An nagfy world jus gets angrier# Don't neglect R&D. Japan is a good area to focus on since emissions are low and literacy high, so it can become the world's school.# Go green. The investment pays back in willingness to invest, and a happy population that ultimately enables you to turn the corner on emissions .# High priority early investments are infotech for smartgrids, energy for CCS, robotics for aerosols that then open latrr in the tech tree to powerful technolgies to be shared witht he world as soon  as possible.#Use the news tab and telemetry tabs extensively since they will lead you to the high priority problem areas. The tech tree is also intermittently, useful since it will let you know how soona region will acquire technology showing if funding is worthwhile. You can be more judicious with the deeper drill tabs, but they are useful to indicate where the rescources and potenital for renewables will give most bang for your buck.Solving the world's problems should not be easy so don't give up if you find the game a struggle.  If you are a FPS adrenaline junky, avoid since  the chances are you will endure briefly, then blow up the world. Which is not ideal. At least not in this game. If like me, you are a paradox gamer, the chances are you will enjoy, and learn something about rhe dilemmas world leaders face as they inexorably steer us to extinction...			"

												Fate of the World is a difficulte game and does not give the player a lot of direct feed back. The 'black box' mechanic combined with the lack of a tutorial can be frustaiting.  However this fits the theme of the game perfectly as the player take on the role of world leaders and try to solve theats to humanity with little infomration. This game is a great educational tool and for those looking for a challenging puzzle.			"

												Right let's make this actually useful. Fate of the World is a game with a rather unique concept: you've effectively become Grand Eco-Dictator of Earth, and are charged with guiding humanity through ecological armageddon. And believe me, it's apocalyptic. You interact and set policies with a series of cards. Play a political office, your hand will expand next turn with political actions, which in turn can have a cascade of actions. Behind this simple veneer is a staggeringly complex pile of statistics that attempts to simulate the world and what you do in it. At least for me, they are very opaque. Which makes it difficult. And leads to India, despite me pouring my every last nickel and dime into them, melting down into an unrecognizable storm of overpopulation, famine, misery, and disease. But the game is very unique. And despite feeling like I was blundering blind from time to time, very rewarding when the hard choices are made and the majority of humanity survives. If you are looking for something different, this is it.			"

												Very hard to get in to, this game does NOT hold your hand at any point. You have to learn for yourself what all the figures mean, how they affect the game, and how what you do affects them behind the scenes. When it all clicks though, this is, for a while, an immensely satisfying game, as you haul Earth and humankind back from the brink of total disaster.This satisfaction is only tempered in the end by a few irritating bugs that can sometimes prevent everything going as it should, even when you have played a brilliant game up until that point.I've never had any interest in environmentalism, but this game really struck a cord with me, and effectively illustrates the future we may be heading for, and will all be responsible for.Challenging and thought provoking, occassionaly frustrating, I would say this is worth a shot if you aren't afraid of numbers, graphs, and thinking.

												- Spoiler Alert -In 2020, twenty years after a global cataclysm known as the US Presidential Election, teenager Shinji Ikari is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father Gendo Ikari, the director of the special paramilitary force GEO. Shinji witnesses the United Nations forces battling a Tempurature Rise: one of a number of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the Dead Sea Scrolls. Because of the Temperature Rise's near-impenetrable force-fields, GEO's giant bio-machines, synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Temperature Rises from annihilating humanity. GEO officer Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the GEO complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Unit-01 against the Temperature Rise. Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the unit to go berserk and savagely kill the Temperature Rise on its own.Following hospitalization, Shinji moves in with Misato and begins settling in to life in Tokyo-3. In his second battle, Shinji destroys an Angel but runs away after the battle, distraught. Misato confronts Shinji and he decides to remain a pilot. Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired and Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, a mysterious, and socially isolated teenage girl named Rei Ayanami. With Rei's help, Shinji defeats another Angel.Ritsuko Akagi, GEO's chief scientist, reveals that the US Presidential Election was not caused by a meteor strike as officially reported, but instead resulted when the first Tempurature Rise arrived on Earth, codenamed Adam, exploded in the Antarctic. The pilot of Unit-02, teenage girl Asuka Langley Soryu, moves in with Misato and Shinji and joins her fellow pilots in defeating the next Tempurature Rises. Shinji's schoolfriend Toji Suzuhara is selected for Unit-03, but during his first test synchronization with the bio-machine, Unit-03 is hijacked by an Tempurature Risel. When Shinji refuses to destroy the rogue unit, his control over Unit-01 is cut off and supplanted by a prototype autopilot system known as the ""Dummy Plug"" system, and his bio-machine rips apart Unit-03 crushing Toji's cockpit. Shinji is devastated and quits piloting the bio-machine, but is forced to return to destroy a Tempurature Rise that has defeated both Asuka and Rei. Asuka loses her self-confidence following her defeat, and spirals into a deep depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against an Tempurature Rise which attacks her mind. In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji later visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is ""the third Rei"". Misato forces Ritsuko to reveal the dark secrets of GEO, the bio-machine graveyard and the Dummy Plug system which operates using clones of Rei.Asuka is reduced to a catatonic state by her depression, and Kaworu Nagisa replaces her as pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji, is revealed to be the final Tempurature Rise. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to thrive and asks Shinji to kill him. Despite his initial hesitation, Shinji kills Kaworu. Soon after this act, GEO and the US trigger the forced evolution of humanity, termed the ""Human Instrumentality Project"", in which the souls of all mankind are merged into one through Rei. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him. This allows him to be reunited with all of the main characters, who congratulate him.			"

												1:Genre (2/5)I don't really know what Genre to put it into, probably some sort of strategy / cardgame, eventhough I find it to be more luck  and experience, than strategy, because it takes a very long time until you find out if an action has a positive or a negative effect, and there are so many actions that its extremely complicated to figure out everything - which you need to do to win.So just by guessing, your chance of winning is probably higher (but still very low.)2:Gameplay (2/5)As many other reviews have already said: WAY TO HARD. If you like a challenge and never get frustrated , then feel free to try. Respect to everyone who has mastered this game. However, I dont like the cardgame-style of this game. With such a complex topic, it is very sad to let go of the potential the game has by turning it into just a complicated card game.A tutorial would have been good for the playing-experience, but it wouldnt fit to the message of the game (at least the message I have gotten out of playing it).The in-game menu is slightly illogical and complicated.3:Story (4/5)The best thing about this game is the story. Its really great that someone tried making a game just for fighting climate change, while maintaining high standards of living. And it fits very good to the human nature that the people start hating you, just for helping them, or rather not helping them enough. Which then leads to the player being kicked out of a country. Everything is pretty detailed, eventhough events repeat themselves often.Negative about it is, what some people might understand as the message of the game :""It is nearly impossible to fight climate change, so you might as well give up trying."" Im sure this wasnt their intention, but due to the frustration you get from playing this, some might see it as such.4:Playtime (3/5)Of course you CAN spend many hours playing this, but at least for me it is not worth it.5:Graphics & Sound (1/5)Concerning sound: Nothing specialConcerning graphics: Some things too small and often you dont know where to klick, since its unclear which is a button and which just decoration.Overall: (2.4/5)A very... unique game... I gave it a bad rating since I never wanted to continue playing.			"

But this game is about solutions to problems and different ways to solve things, honestly or through more subverted means, while managing instability in regions and exploiting natural resources for energy. Will you build wind mills? Will you drill for oil? Or will you say screw it and burn that coal? There are different scenarios to keep things interesting and fresh.

												This game is fantastic for fans of political sims, world/government sims, social studies/history buffs and environmentalists or those interested in the environment. If you think global warming is some stupid, made up liberal thing, this game isn't for you...and most of my friends think of me as a conservative. Just a fair warning. But this game is about solutions to problems and different ways to solve things, honestly or through more subverted means, while managing instability in regions and exploiting natural resources for energy. Will you build wind mills? Will you drill for oil? Or will you say screw it and burn that coal? There are different scenarios to keep things interesting and fresh. And as you can see, I've gotten over 100 hours out of it. How can I not recommend it? It's fun.			"

												Fate of the World is a pretty interesting simultator, pitting the player as dictator of the world, with a clear agenda to save it. It has a lot of interesting strategic choices and trade offs. Pretty cool. It must be noted though that its pretty much an environmentalists wet dream. Which sadly explains why its has completely skipped implementing the nuclear options which are means through which we can power humanitys future. Thorium, a technology from the 1970's which lost out to uranium based nuclear designs, since it cannot produce weapons, is amazing beyond belief, which is why many countries, most notably China and India, are putting a lot of effort into it. Clean, cheap, no noticable waste and infinite amounts of fuel... Why oh why was that no included in the game? Well... It would make it  trivially easy, and it doesnt fit the hippie agenda.			"

												Seemingly simple, yet amazingly deep, extremely hard, and most of all totally depressing.Will you let those 40 million people die of famine just so you can buid those ecological solar power plants?Will you convert the world to sustainable lifestyle, losing all your money, support, and chances to win in the process?Make the good, intelligent, fair choice, and get assassinated as a reward.This game is all about these choices, a lose-lose situation where you try and save the earth by choosing which part of it to forsake.If you don't care about action, this slow, methodical, stat-based strategy game is guaranteed to give you a challenge, some headaches, and most of all some realistic and chilling political thoughts.

												-Learned a lot about climate change.-The turn-based card-playing mechanic works well.-Well-built underlying model shows how HDI, GDP, energy-mix, rate-of-deforestation etc impact on other areas.Do you replace the dwindling oil supply by sacrificing agricultural land to grow bio-fuel crops, or research shale oil instead at the risk of more emissions?  These are the choices you make on each turn and in each unique region of the globe.Took me 4 playthroughs of the second scenario to realise that environmental toxicity was the reason for India's low Human Development Index.10/10 would poison the soils again.

												Not that good, and not really that fun.  Unless you like a challenge.  In which case you'll love Fate of the World, because there are lots of tough challenges.  Your first challenge: learn to play the game.  20 hours in and you're still probably going to feel like you're just blindly choosing options that are too limited and too expensive, and that usually don't really explain how they work either.  This game, and the gameplay, were not well thought out, the learning curve is too steep, and the interface is pretty poor.But there are a few neat rewards, if you can progress far enough in the game.  Interesting nanotechnology available at high levels to help clean up environmental problems, or quantum computers that you let you suddenly bring in a whole lot more money.Overall, I recommend the game--IF you enjoy strategy games that have a lot of options that you need to do a lot thinking to sort out.  And if you can stomach all the things I already mentioned.6.5/10			"

												First of all: the game is addictive. That's the good side. The game idea is great. You are responsible for a new organization that has to take care of mainly the earth itself. Your moves are measured against the global temperature rise. You can reach your goal through different ways. Quite interesting is the idea of drawing cards. But...once you're diving deep into the game you will miss a sandbox mode. However, you might think that this is only a minor point. The major missing point is that you rarely know what impact your moves got onto the engine. This makes the game quite hard to play at some points. For me was the ""but"" a big issue, thus I can't recommend the game.			"

I power my home with a generator that runs on human fecal matter. My partner and I convinced countless friends, family and neighbors to get abortions so that we don't overpopulate the earth. I also drive a car that runs on my sweet sweet anal juices. Last month I had my entire family euthanized so that I could use their rotting corpses to feed newly planted trees in Africa. I am always looking for ways to help Mother Earth and this game understands the sacrifice necessary to keep her alive.			"

												This is a difficult, highly complex game, which is good for when you want to torture yourself.While I appreciate the basic premise of this game, I dislike the amount of pressure it puts on the ""GEO"" to hire mercenaries to enforce civil order, provide health care and education, and micromanage the world's economy.  (all of this on a very limited budget)I know that I wouldn't feel PO'd at the GEO if my country was erupting into civil war around me.  I'd feel PO'd at the government.  So, having the media and populace specifically targeting your staff and regional centers for something that your organization really Should Not have anything to do with, really raises my hackles.On the same line of thought... Healthcare, education, and housing?  Why would people get PO'd at an environmental organization about these things when you can be PO'd at the government who's actually supposed to take care of it instead?  I just don't get it.And maybe that's the problem.  I just don't get why people get PO'd at the innocent for being innocent.			"

												The game's heavy basis on its real-world statistical model is both its greatest feature and its most serious flaw.  It makes things very fun (if often hectic and complicated), in that you have a huge amount of complicated interactions to explore, and the actions available feel like they're genuinely interesting as a result.  It also makes the game educational -- while not everyone is going to agree with the precise model they used (or the research they based it on), it gives a good overview of the various environmental and resource-related issues facing the world today, and the general pros and cons of each of the numerous ways we have to address them.  Most of all, it captures how complicated these problems are; even with almost complete control over the world's policies, you're probably not going to be able to solve them without a lot of attention to detail and careful balancing.The drawback to all this is that its heavy focus on the real world means that the game eventually gets fairly repetitive.  It comes with a number of scenarios, and there's a lot of room to try different options, but ultimately you're going to be facing the same general problem with the same general tools, and once you've figured out a working solution the game is pretty much ""solved"" -- some scenarios may be harder or easier, or might tweak your goals a bit, but since the overarching situation of the planet doesn't change much, it's more or less the same game each time -- it lacks the replay value of Civilization or similar games that let you explore alternate worlds.With that said, it's definitely worth playing for anyone who is interested in any of the issues it touches on, or for anyone interested in real-world management games in general.

												Card games (Non Traditional) are about deck building. A selection of strategic choices that you can mix and match.Fate of the world gives you narrow choices and tells you to put cards into them. The cards may as well be selections from a text box. Keep the worlds countries happy with limited resources. It's a plate spinning game where you might have a bit of trial and error as you learn how spinning each plate will destroy humanity. I just stopped playing. A heavy handed environmental message, delivered in a dull, in your face way. If you didn't know already, we are destroying the planet. Playing this video game is a step in the wrong direction. All the electricity used has probably killed a small family of voles.			"

You can go into every detail from controlling the human population, to saving wildlife, to preventing natural disasters, and creating new technologies to reverse global warming.  The first mission was good, but after that, it became very difficult to play..... most of the time impossible.  It came down to not enough money, and not enough agents in different countries.  It does not matter what you do in this game, it is impossible to win.  The only way to achieve your missions, is to enter cheat codes and give yourself unlimited money.  If you really want people to play a game, don't make it so impossible that it puts people off playing.  Good game in theory, awful in practice.			"

												I honestly love these kind of games but, this game was beyond terrible. No action, no nothing! I expected more from this game... If you want a boring game it is all yours otherwise don't waste your money. I couldn't even get through a full hour of it without being confused by the TUTORIAL. I mean this game is a solid 3 out of 10. Disgusted, could've bought much better than this.			"

												This game has an incredible strategical depth compared to the conceptually simple card-based gameplay. The topic is interesting (although you have to accept that it can't always be 100% realistic) and the game is very challenging (although the expansion adds an easy mode that I've not tried, despite having failed the second mission three times and the third mission many many times). On the downside, the user interface is not optimal and some of the difficulty comes from the fact that all the information is not clearly available to you. You'll have to spend a long time learning, and a long time on the wiki and forums to understand how some hidden variables work. Eventually, I'ld say it's still a very nice game. And it's cheap.			"

												ever want to experice the joy of trying to bail water out of a sinnking ship with a series of dixie cups that you have to buy one at a time?  then this is the game for you.  serious challenge, pretty good music, and a grim reminder of the inevitible collapse of civilization no matter how desprate mankind's attempts to salvage this doomed world.7/10: would fail the people of india again.

												This is a simple to play take on solving the world's problems - you have certain cards you can play, all within a timeline and specific scenarios. Each card offers something that a particular nation needs. I think the greatest value of this game is just how easily it makes clear the complexities inherent in overcoming issues - after all, if feeding the hungry and ending war was easy, we'd have all done it by now right? I really like this game, and hope you all do to.			"

												Fate Of The World is an interesting beast that punishes failure and sometimes success. You have the job of global leader/scapegoat/fuhrer/tobin taxer pretending to be a climate scientist. It is a game you have to get used to losing; of my 15 playthroughs I have won as many times as I have lost due to my policies causing Australia to start a global nuclear war, one time each. If this is your first spreadsheet simulator, and even if it isn't, expect to be confused; The varied and numerous graphs and statistics can overwhem very easily, and just speaks to how complex the problems facing the world are. Ultimately, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who doesn't mind failure and ten digit death tolls.			"

												Edited 28/9/16: Original review (below) no longer applies as the lack of transparency has been addressed by the unoffical pacth by Delnar_Ersike. I can now enjoy the game to its full potential, and I'm happy to recommend it.Original review:Short summary:This game is very interesting and induces the one more turn feeling. However, after many hours spent on this game, I've come to realise why I don't like it:The lack of transparency around my actions.More detailed explanation:In other games, you're competing against other players (people or AI). Who wins is down to skill and chance.However, in this game, you need to try various strategies to see what works best. If you play enough, you will be able to make good decisions and win the game. The only challenge is having to play the game a lot, to understand what works.It'd have been better if the game told you what the consequences of your actions will be at the time that you're deciding what to do. It doesn't, and I'm now tired of looking at forums and wiki's to learn how much something will be affected by a choice I make.			"
