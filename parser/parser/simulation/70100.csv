												You won't be hacking the mainframes when you finish this game, but overall it is a decent puzzle game involving the concepts of network intrusions and data gathering.  The whole game is presented in an Amiga amber color with a mostly command line interface and some point and clicking.  You are presented with missions by invading companies, extracting data, and breaking computer securities by use of proxies and other tools you.  With a pretty chill electronic music sound track to go with it, I had an overall good time with this game pretending to be a hacker.  I hope you like typing.  For a couple of bucks, it's not bad.

												Hacker Evolution is more of a typing game, then a hacking simulator. I like the concept of hacker games. The sense of online omnipotence has a huge appeal. HOWEVER, this game actively punishes exploration. A lot of the game is trial and error. If you do not do things in order, you will have to restart. Restart the level? No, the entire game. Your penalties from previous levels carry over to the next. If you ever feel the need to check out things off the developers predetermined path, they slap you with in game monetary penalties. ex: You see that a website called dot-hackers.net. Seems cool, right, so you go to check it out. You are penalized for looking up the website. Yes, they penalize you for LOOKING UP WEBSITES! Then they penalize you for logging on, and then they penalize you for downloading files. The only way to take away your penalties is too pay in game money. They penalize you when you make money. Every. Single. Time. So if you get the game, go ahead and save yourself some headaches and use the money cheat (xmoney) to give yourself all the money you will ever need. The good thing about the game is that it had somewhat of a vision, but if you want a hacking game that makes you feel powerful, go with UPLINK.			"

												Hacker evolution is NOT a hacking game, but more something like: You must dig into the servers to find new servers, clues and other things that will help you. Something between exploration and detective.  This game is more about thinking ahead. Stats like trace will be carried with you to the next level, so if you finish a level with 99% trace, it will be the same in next level. For people who like to play easy games this game is really frustrating, but for those which like challenges this is a perfect game.Pros:+ Great Soundtrack+ Good Concept+ Great UI (BUT it will not fit everyone)+ Lots of fun if you like challenges+ Great StoryCons:- Hardcore for some players (you have to restart whole game if you screw something up)			"

												Hacker Evolution is a fun game. I't shows somewhat believable ""movie"" style hacking in a nice game package. Awesome idea, and clever execution. Much better than the game ""Uplink"" as in the typing aspect really gives you a sense of ""I'm a hacker"". Just don't play this on a laptop in D.C. on a tour of the White House.  "

												I've bought the bundle despite the mixed and negative reviews because I love the idea and the style of hacking games.Played the main game for about 1-2 days, and completed the story.This game isn't supposed to be compared to Uplink because there is a huge difference.Uplink is a ""free-roaming freelance hacker"" with minimum story. Uplink is the GTA of hacking.Hacker Evolution is a level-based story game. Hacker Evolution is like an NES Super Mario game.At first, I was upset by the lack of being able to ""hack the world"". But as the story progressed, I realised that this game is suppose to be a puzzle hacking game. Not to mention an interesting story and interesting ending.Here's the run down of what to expect if you are thinking of getting this game:1. You are a expert hacker which was tasked by someone to find out what caused the blackout of major business (Example: The Stock Market)2. This game has a money system which is used to upgrade and reduce trace level.3. You have a passive trace percentage, which if you reach 100%, you get caught and you'd need to restart the level.4. When you successfully hack a server, decrpt, crack, or even login, a fixed amount of passive trace is added. (Except connect)5. When you start a hack, an active trace will start. If you fail to abort the hack or hack in time, you get a huge passive trace.6. You can upgrade your 1GB memory, 1GHz ram, 1mbps modem, and no firewall, into a decent computer.7. Firewall and Ram are usually the top priority.8. You become a Money Savant. You know when to upgrade and when to keep your money to reduce trace.9. Your money, trace, and score gets moved to the next level. What ever code/exploits you store in your computer mysteriously disappears, presumably deleted for no reason.10. You have to learn the basic commands. Because most of the game is mainly typing.11. The puzzles gets harder. Sometimes your next clue is cleverly hidden. In a wall of text.12. Like the previous point, sometimes you might find a server which has and .exploit which can be used to bypass the cracking and save you tons of trace and money. Oh, and sometimes a $10,000 lying around in there.13. ""Scan atm-ba"" + (TAB) = ""Scan atm-bankof1234567890youaregoingtoberich.bank.com""14. Apparently our technology broke the equation of the universe. Internet speed is faster than light. Now we got a Time Traveling internet.If you can look at this game as a story based, puzzle level game, instead of a free-roaming rogue hacker, I can recommand Hacker Evolution. If you are looking for a rogue hacking game, try Uplink. Or if you want a story-only hacking game, which has a blood-pumping action music, you can try Hacknet.I rate this game a solid 8/10 for it's curious story, good puzzles, and long term financial planning.The music is okay.

												For me, Hacker Evolution turned out to be a rather frustrating experience. There is a trace meter that tracks your trace level and when it gets to 100, you lose. The biggest problem is that you get penalized for successful cracks and decryptions which means the trace level increases even when you are doing things the right way. And the only way to decrease your trace level is through money, but they are pretty stingy on making that readily available. Not to mention they dangle a bunch of system upgrades that aren't cheap which gives a false impression that there is a lot of cash to be obtained in the game. So if you spend money on these upgrades, you end up with no money left to decrease your trace level and ultimately get stuck because you can't reduce your trace level. The manual even states, ""Important: Don't rush to upgrade your hardware as soon as you have money. Having the best hardware is not the main objective of the game. Carefully make your decision, and only upgrade your hardware when necessary. Money is not abundant in the game, and its main purpose is to reduce your trace time."" That key piece of information is not found anywhere in the game; you have to read it from the manual. Now why they decided to design a game that revolves around money, yet not make it abundant is not clear to me.They don't even grant you rewards for completing missions (a little money would be nice). Instead they give you a score (why?). But the real kicker is your trace level carries over from the previous mission, so if it was high and you don't have any money, you're ♥♥♥♥ed on the next mission. What this ultimately means is you must follow a very specific path on the early missions to be able to survive the later missions. So after I figured this out, the game quickly lost any open world feel of being able to solve missions in different ways. Plus you never really know if you didn't do something right until you are stuck on a later mission with no money.I did like the graphical interface, although the actual command execution was a bit oversimplified. It was fun for a few hours, but ultimately it was the lack of a proper reward system that really turned me away from progressing further with this game. If the simulated world of Hacker Evolution sounds interesting to you, go buy Uplink. It offers a much better gaming experience.			"

  You'll Enjoy This Game If You Like:   Movie Style Hacking   The colour yellow   Text based games   High difficulty First off, this is not a game for the faint hearted - it has a very steep difficulty curve and you will need to put in some time to understand things. Put it this way I actually managed to fail the tutorial twice. This can avoided by really reading everything properly! It will also probably make sense to have a notepad alongside you so you can remember the difference between commands especially decrytpt and crack.The game is also not very forgiving as one mistake further on into a level can mean you need to start over. But once you accept this and you get over the difficulty hurdles, the game is great and strangely gives you sense of the whole thing being real which does make it exciting.Enjoy hacking and don't give up too easily.

												I'm glad Steam has great sales, otherwise I might have never seen this game or played it. This is only $2 right now and I think it's  worth every penny and more! Hacker Evolution let's you be that hacker you always see in the movies trying to hack into something. ""I only need one more minute. Just give me a minute."" I played about 30 minutes so far and just think it's really cool. The whole game as far as I can tell is just typing commands into a console and it is very satisfying. Their are mods and different skins for your console too. The music is pretty decent and feels like good music to hack to. Anyone who ever thought of being a spy or just a hacker, should play this.

												Overall, this is a fascinating experience! The Hacker Evolution series is a serious treat for the geekiest gamers. What makes it unique and positively special is that it's essentially played by in-game console commands! There are no other games I can name that utilize this as a core game mechanic. In fact, I wish Watch_Dogs played less like Grand Theft Auto and more like this. My only complaint is that there are a number of points within levels that feel like ""Guide Dang It!"" Either my brain is not up to snuff, or the levels barely give a clue (if at all) on how to complete the objectives (such as figuring out the names of all the servers for each level). Fortunately, it is ridiculously easy to add content and your own levels with provided mod tools. This gets even better, because the main game levels are treated the same way, meaning they can be opened up and used as an answer key or even changed to the players' liking. The overall scope of the game is small and simple, but it definitely uses that scale to the best measures possible. A 10-dollar price tag may be a bit iffy for some, but if it were for 5 dollars, it's a must-buy!			"

												There are a lot of negative reviews about this game which I think is unfair. It's a misunderstood game, I wouldn't call it puzzle because that's misleading, but it is supposed to be a hacker simulator and nothing more than that. My idea of a hacker simulator (before I decided to play any, that is) is something which can be periodically frustrating as you figure out (for yourself!) what to do next. It should require thinking skills, not just point and click with a hand-holding guide. A clear set of objectives and a list of commands so you know what to type and when, and when you finally do input the right code after trying time and time again, there should be a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.Hacker Evolution does not let me down on my expectations of a hacker simulator, it is exactly what ti should be. It is unforgiving if you don't do things perfectly, but because the levels themselves would actually be quite SMALL if it weren't for all the try/fail/try/fail/try/succeed that goes into it, it is supposed to be difficult! So that you're not just breezing through it, because that would be completely unrealistic. I'm not saying that it is so amazing that it is like a hacker's version of say... Microsoft Flight Simulator where all the controls that would be in an actual aircraft are available to you. Because that would mean you would have to actually learn a programming language in order to play the game. It can't be 100% realistic because no one would play it, because the only people who could actually play it would be out hacking/ cracking real computers. In saying that, it is an exciting game with a very simple, user friendly interface. The tutorial gives you enough information to learn the mere basics, it's not there to hold your hand and coddle you when you get frustrated and tell you that it loves you like in a lot of games. As far as I can see so far there's no ability to save your progress, you just have to start the level over from scratch, which isn't that big of a deal because you can generally remember what you need to do, and when you do things right in this game, it doesn't take very long to complete the levels. Overall I'm very glad I didn't listen to a lot of these reviews which almost made me not buy the game (which is currently $2.99 on bundlestars for the ENTIRE Hackers Evolution games!). My actual point is, if you can't be bothered thinking for yourself, or feel you will have to resort to walkthroughs, then avoid this game like the plague because you won't find it very fun, because the AIM and the FUN of the game is to actually think for yourself!8.5/10 - Gameplay; fun, simple to use once you get the jist of it. Helpful tutorial, but not too helpful so that it makes the game too easy. 7/10 - Music; the techno music is a bit of a stereotype, but it works well in the game and intensifies at just the right points which adds some nice suspense.7/10 - Graphics; this game isn't about graphics, but they look fancier than what I imagine real hackers/ crackers work with.Kind of like a CTU interface from 24.7.5/10 - Overall rating.

												This review covers Hacker Evolution and its expansion, Hacker Evolution: Reinsertion, which is included with the base game. From the very beginning, as you start the tutorial, you realize that Hacker Evolution is all about the command-line interface. This has its pros and cons, but fortunately, it all comes together quite well. Scrolling up and down in order to read through information that has since gone off the small window can be a little problematic and sometimes confusing, as you will be fishing for short lines of detailed text in order to perform various text commands. The music is constantly of the techno genre, but it is overall enjoyable after you get used to it. Being that this is the developer's first (as far as I know) effort in the hacking simulation genre, it is much more polished, much more user friendly, less cumbersome, and with far less flaws than Uplink in every way. This still means that the game play will be slow at times, and you will need to appreciate this type of game in order to enjoy it. The missions are interesting, challenging, and with personality. You actually believe that you are part of the short story in meaningful ways, and after completing each goal, there is a feeling of accomplishment and significance. The story progression makes sense and manages to remain interesting, as each level provides new challenges. Also, if you do not have enough funds at the end of each level, in conjunction with a high trace count, you will need to start the game over from the beginning, which is a very serious problem, in my opinion. If you are not careful from the very beginning, the game simply tells you ""your fault, start over"". Which I suppose means that it is an attempt to go along with the simulation aspect of the experience. It is trying to be as realistic as possible. All missions are exceptionally designed, and it is clear that the developer took great care and attention to detail to prepare all of them, in conjunction with the storyline. It is also valuable to point out that even though the amount of commands is limited, all missions have a different feel to them, and must be approached from different angles in order to succeed. It is amazing how much excitement is offered in this game as everything on screen is mostly text based, with the exception of the background graphic and mission briefings. It is the most engrossing and captivating hacking simulation game I have ever played, despite the fact that it does not have many competitors. The overall experience is fresh, fun, and with an absorbingly interesting atmosphere. It is a game that should be used as the prime example and inspiration for what all future hacking simulation games should be and must be.Hacker Evolution is good.			"

												Hacker Evolution is a hacking sim, too few of these in the world, with puzzle solving mechanics. It does what it does very well. Unlike uplink, with its infernal clicking, you actually feel in the role of a hacker. Typing Linux commands into a terminal to look for clues and hack bank accounts. Its only like nine levels, but a good nine levels. Also it is replayable as there are several solutions/ tactics, and hidden parts of the plot you might have missed because you didn't hack or find a particular server etc. If this sounds interesting and you can type commands and like puzzles then I hope you enjoy this gem as I have.      A recommendation, try not to look up solutions. If you need it there is a good guide on game faqs that doesn't give everything away. Also does a good job explaining the leveling mechanic ie. buying parts.The game tries to show you a bit about this, but I feel it should have explained what the different upgrades do.			"

												I do like the game, and enjoy the mechanics. But the problem I have is with the difficulty. Let me be clear, it's not that the game is hard, it's that it's punishing. One mistake at the very beginning of the game can force you to have to restart everything 5 levels down the line. And yes, that's ONE mistake. You basically need to figure out the absolute optimal series of actions to manage to progress. There's no room for guessing, there's no room for exploring the setting, there's no room for error. It'd be much better if you could explore the levels a bit, find out about the world, and really feel like a hacker.As far as the rest of it goes, it's really well done. Realism while still being an engaging game, and I'd definitely recommend it based on everything else. But it's too punishing to recommend to any but the most masochistic gamers.			"

												So I decided to write this because they're are plenty of misguided reviews regarding this game and I think it's unfair to not try and counter some.One review particularly, which was the first review on this page at the time of writing, got my attention by completely misunderstanding what this game was and what it was about. On actually correcting the wrong things in the review (ironically, everything) they removed my comment. Anyway I won't name the person here out of respect but there name rhymes with PrudlerTheHorse...I will also use their review as a template.The first complaint they/many people have is how it looks. You will not find next gen graphics here, there are no 4k textures. It's a hacking ""simulator"" therefore it doesn't need fancy graphics, hackers use command consoles and code to initiate commands not fancy buttons and iPhone apps. This is a bare bones approach. It still has added UI for the people who don't just want a console, with helpful information and visuals, so for a hacking simulator, it's actually very visual.If you get this game and complain about it just being a console and a few graphical information modules, then you are stupid. You get exactly what you see. You wouldn't complain on a game like papers please, that it didn't have the best graphics in the world.Another complaint that people have is the difficulty.This game is hard, it's supposed to be. The learning curve is not steep in terms of mechanics but the puzzle lies within analyzing data on servers to find the next step in the path. It's about being intuitive, it's about being savvy with resources (bounced servers/proxies, money, trace percentage), it's about actually reading stuff and not getting spoon fed.The tutorial gives you everything you need, it gives you a few hotkeys to bring up help/goals etc. and then guides you through a basic scenario. If you constantly fail at the tutorial then blame yourself not the game. I have had no problems with the tutorial so it's a user problem, not a game problem. Again, it's like complaining dark souls is too hard because they don't force feed you instructions on the tutorial.Typing is too long windedIn terms of a hacking simulator, the mechanics are there. Actual console commands are used as well as the functionality of a console (pressing arrow keys to recall previous commands). You can also use tab to autocomplete commands. The typing is not long winded and anyone who has used a computer for more than a few days should have no trouble typing.Secondly, it's a hacking game. Hacking = typing, expect to do a lot of it. Game analogy number 3: go complain stardew valley has too much farming.Justified complaintsThere are a few good non-recommended reviews however and a lot of good points against this game. The gameplay is very punishing, I don't believe it's that punishing (at least as far as I've got) though. However, the point that the game is far too linear, in terms of only having one or two ways of actually getting the information and the endgame from each scenario. If the game was a bit more lenient in terms of the amount of trace you get each time and therefore allocation of exploration, it would lead to a much better open experience.As I hear the newest game is exactly that, open world hacking. Not too sure on the games that proceed this, as I want to play through this first but I just wanted to point out some issues people have with the game as it's been bringing down the rating unjustifiably.

												I received a copy of Hacker evolution as a gift from a friend and the game seemed like fun to me so i decided to give it a shot. First off I'd like to start on the negative points of the game. What really annoyed me is that you take your progress along every level, the amount of money you have and your 'global trace%'. So basically because I did something stupid in the second level of the game i had to completely restart the game in the late stage because I simply lacked the recources needed because of an earlier failure. Also I have an IT (wireless) networking background and you can tell the makers of the game did some homework, but not all of it if you have an IT background like me some little strange things can annoy you. I also understand people lacking an IT background may find this game very difficult.In the end I did enjoy the game though there are definitely more than enough positive points to cover up the negative ones. The interface itself is really simple you may say it makes the game lack a nice graphical view, but that's not what it's made for. The interface is really overviewable and helps you especially in the early stages to pick up the game as soon as possible. I like the idea of the game, it's not really a hacking simulator offcourse it reminded me more of (very) basic scripting, but as a puzzle game it's well thought out and designed. The game offers for me a right amount of content. This isn't a game that should be 200 hours long as it would only be frustrating if you don't do any screwups like me expect somewhere between 8 - 12 hours of gameplay, depending on how quickly you pick the game up. The (included) expansion pack offers another hour of gameplay. I also like the puzzles themselves, the solution isn't often easily given, but unlike some other puzzle games I didn't run into random puzzle where you're more based on guesswork than logical thinking. Sometimes it can be a bit rough to find the answer to your question, but all puzzles have a logical and explainable solution.So the game definitely has it flaws, but for me the positive points outweigh the negative points. It's not the best game ever made, but I enjoyed the experience of it in the end. If you enjoy this kind of genre and don't give up easily this would definitely nice for you to pick up. I'd rate it 7/10 in the end.			"

												Of course anyone, who knows Uplink (a great game from Introversion) will compare this game to it, but they are different games by playstyle. Whereas Uplink requires speed and good mouse skills, this game wants you to think ahead and search around for clues at your own pace.You mostly use your keyboard to control your computer (mouse only required to work on the map). By issuing commands you can bypass security layers and access data that you require.It may not be as impressive as Uplink, but it is still an enjoyable game.			"

My playtime: 18.6h (based on steam, main story + all extra levels are completed).Developer Response: ~1 month.IntroHacker Evolution is a hacking simulation game which is played in terminal. You'll use several commands to do the ""hacking"" and some of them are real terminal commands.This game might look similar to Uplink in the shell, although the execution is quite different.MusicThere are some soothing musics played in the background. You can also change the music selection by pressing F4.GraphicsThe game has a dominant dark yellow/brown color in it. There are 3 separate themes in the options which will change the UI design and color. Two of them are still using dark yellow/brown dominant color while the other is dark blue colored. The UI is okay for an old game.StoryThe game shows an intro when you start the game and give you a background story before you start a level. You don't really have to understand the story in order to finish the game although you need to read the background story to find some clue in the level. If you don't really bothered to read the story at all, you can always brute forcing (trying all combinations) your way to find what you want.Although the story looks promising at the start, the ending is quite dissapointing. The ending suddenly adds the ""Time Dimensions"" concept without even any hints beforehand.The gameThe main story has 9 levels and 1 tutorial level in total. Although there is a tutorial, the tutorial will guide you in a wrong way. Every malicious thing you do (cracking, decrypting, even fail login attempt) will give you a penalty called trace % which will be raised by 50% if you fail to do it and that's what the tutorial will ask you to do. I understand that the game wants to teach you to be careful before doing anything, but this trace %, along with other things such as money and PC upgrades (will be explained later), will be carried over the levels and this will cause trouble later on.If you let your trace % to reach 100%, you'll have a game over. You can reduce it by paying $500. This will make money to be a very important to save yourself. However, the money in this game is limited and you are basicallay screwed up if you don't use it properly. This limitation will be an obstacle for you to explore all servers and ports because one mistake can cause a game over and makes you to restart the level. If you messed up in the previous level, you have to restart the whole game since the game autosaves after you complete a level (there is no manual save). However, there is a cheat command and money glitch to get around it. You can also backup the save manually and replace the save whenever you screwed up.Aside from the trace %, you can also spend your money for PC upgrades. You'll need to have a proper equipment in order to avoid being traced. If you have a low PC spec and you can't hack without being traced, you can also make a bounce to other server which will give you more time before being traced. However, you can only bounce to one server three times.Having a low PC spec also means a long waiting time. Even if you somehow manage to bounce to a lot of servers to hack a server with a very strong defense, you have to wait for a very long time for it to finish, especially if you haven't upgrade your CPU. There is a time where i have to wait for around 1 minute without doing anything since there is no fast forward option.There are a lot of commands that you can use in the terminal. If you are not familiar with the commands, you can type ""help"" to list all available commands. The list might be a bit overwhelming for people who are not used with this though. Most of the commands are self explanatory like ""delete"" which will delete a file, and ""connect"" which will connect you to a server. However, there are also some commands which might confuse people who never use a terminal before such as ls (list directory) or dir (directory) and cat (concatenate). Note that these commands are real terminal command. Although there are some duplicate commands which has the same function such as ls and dir, the game fails to add ""rm"" command which is supposed to delete file in linux although there is a ""del"" command (delete file in windows) in the game.There is also an autocomplete which is triggered with tab button. However, the autocomplete doesn't behave exactly as how a terminal is supposed to be. If there are ""xenti-design.com"" and ""xenti.com"", the text will autocomplete to ""xenti-design.com"" when you type x and then tab just because you register ""xenti-design.com"" first. Luckily, you can change the autocomplete suggestion by pressing tab although sometimes the autocomplete will fail to give what you want. In addition, there is also no copy paste option in the game.The game may seem to be redundant since you just have to find a hidden clue to go to other server to advance. In later level (well, one level to be exact), this clue will turn into a puzzle where you have to solve a hint to find the next server. However, the puzzle might be too much (although solvable) to non programmers especially since the puzzle introduces an assembly language and configuration file (and there is also an equation that can only be recognized by programmers in it , ne(not equal). Luckily, there is an instruction to read the assembly and the hint in the configuration file is pretty obvious if you look it properly.The game starts in full screen by default. You can change it to windowed although you can't change its resolution. The windowed game is too tall in my screen (1366 x 768) and i can't see what i type in the terminal if i don't clear the screen since i can't see the very bottom of the screen.In addition to the main story, there are 2 Mod/DLCs (+1 ""example mod"") which has around the same length. The mods requires a different strategy from the main story although unlike the main story, the mod is only difficult in the first few levels. You can also make your own mod although you can't publish the mod since there is no steam workshop.Pros:- 9+1 levels- 2 bonus mod/dlc- Mods- PC upgrade- AutocompleteCons:- Unforgiving penalties- No copy paste- Unable to adjust windowed screen- No fast forward option- No manual save (but you can save your backup manually)Should you buy this game?No.Actually, i am having a hard time to choose whether to recommend it or not. As i said before, the game penalties you a lot and punishes you harshly. You even have to restart the level (or the game) if you screwed up. However, there is a glitch that you can exploit to get around it. If you like a game with lots of penalites and waiting time, you might want to buy this game when it's on sale. You also might want to buy this if you like to play hacking game. But if you can't stand waiting and don't like to use either glitch or cheat, you better skip this game. Try the demo first before you buy it though. "

												I received a copy of Hacker evolution as a gift from a friend and the game seemed like fun to me so i decided to give it a shot. First off I'd like to start on the negative points of the game. What really annoyed me is that you take your progress along every level, the amount of money you have and your 'global trace%'. So basically because I did something stupid in the second level of the game i had to completely restart the game in the late stage because I simply lacked the recources needed because of an earlier failure. Also I have an IT (wireless) networking background and you can tell the makers of the game did some homework, but not all of it if you have an IT background like me some little strange things can annoy you. I also understand people lacking an IT background may find this game very difficult.In the end I did enjoy the game though there are definitely more than enough positive points to cover up the negative ones. The interface itself is really simple you may say it makes the game lack a nice graphical view, but that's not what it's made for. The interface is really overviewable and helps you especially in the early stages to pick up the game as soon as possible. I like the idea of the game, it's not really a hacking simulator offcourse it reminded me more of (very) basic scripting, but as a puzzle game it's well thought out and designed. The game offers for me a right amount of content. This isn't a game that should be 200 hours long as it would only be frustrating if you don't do any screwups like me expect somewhere between 8 - 12 hours of gameplay, depending on how quickly you pick the game up. The (included) expansion pack offers another hour of gameplay. I also like the puzzles themselves, the solution isn't often easily given, but unlike some other puzzle games I didn't run into random puzzle where you're more based on guesswork than logical thinking. Sometimes it can be a bit rough to find the answer to your question, but all puzzles have a logical and explainable solution.So the game definitely has it flaws, but for me the positive points outweigh the negative points. It's not the best game ever made, but I enjoyed the experience of it in the end. If you enjoy this kind of genre and don't give up easily this would definitely nice for you to pick up.

												First off, this is not like real hacking. You can learn some of the concepts of hacking from this game, but don't come out feeling like you can take down any website you want just because you played this game (seriously, at one point you scan a local ip address and you get a location in NY and you are in Alaska. WTF).That said, Hacker Evolution is a fun game if you like typing and resolving horrible domains names about a billion times (and it's extremely picky about spelling, despite spelling special wrong). Do not play this on a laptop you are unfamiliar with (for you will cry).In the end, Hacker Evolution is a brutially hard game just for the fun of it (try keeping your trace down, such a pain in the ♥♥♥), the command console will be filled with the same helper text you've seen before (causing lots of scrolling) and it's one of those games where there is one right way and that's pretty much the only way.Verdict: It really depends on how much you like text based adventure games.

												Simply surprising, great music... I may not become an hacker but I can play as one without special stuff.You're a renowned IT specialist that retired as an ermit on an isolated island following your family's death. However, you're asked to investigate on 4 different problems, that seemed tied. What will you discover?Hacker Evolution is perhaps a writing simulator, as you need to type the command but you need your brains to avoid to be traced and to have a game over. Sometimes, you'll need to begin a new campaign because you can't do anything but try a different manner to avoid spending too much money you've ""stolen"" or to add to your trace level. That's perhaps the most frustrating thing in HE.You're going to read files, find passwords, find exploit files that will make your life easier, crack, decrypt, use your brains to know how many hosts you need, upgrade your hardware (should I add a faster modem or a better firewall or more CPU Ram?).Now, the product is stable, there was a time where exosyphen messed up with keyboards (mainly AZERTY) but they're really listening to their customers.For the graphics, they're simple: a map, a console, your config and messages. The original one is all orange but there is a second skin, much darker, that I largerly prefer and that I used.The best point for this game is the soundtrack, very electro/dance but very fitting. I loved it. I really loved it.Hacker Evolution came with Reinsertion Pack, since then replaced by a nice mod called Operation Electrosphere.While many will whine about how it's not realistic as hacking game, I'll say: I don't care about realism. I just want to enjoy myself. And Hacker Evolution had perfectly succeeded to do that. So, yeah, go for it.			"

												The way the 'hacking' progresses, it's mostly linear. Get hint, hack that and so on. It takes out the satifying aspects behind exploring. Also the information you need to complete challenges can be very cryptic. Not noticing the tinyest name or address at the bottom of a bland paragraph of text, can literally result in an hour backtracking.Other than that, it's kinda buggy. I had to do the tutorial 4 times because I did the objectives out of order. If your going to play any HE game, play Untold.			"

												Got this game on sale because it seemed interesting.At the core of it, it's a typing game where you use simple commands to hack sites. Every site you hack adds to a 'trace' counter. When that counter fills up, you've been traced and you need to restart the level. Therefore, you need to balance out which sites you hack, in which order, and then manage the money you're accruing to lower your trace counter.Fun stuff for what it is. Quick game that kept my interest long enough.I don't know if I'll play the subsequent releases but I enjoyed this release.			"

												This game would be fun... if it wasn't so difficult so soon. Even the tutorial is difficult. It kicks you out of the level as soon as you're done, so if you want money, too bad. You aren't getting it back. I've restarted the game 12 times today... It would be great if they re-examined what they made in the game. The tutorial tells you nothing. It gives you no useful tips, no hints, it basically tells you how to do something and then when you're done, it shoots you into a difficult puzzle. It's ridiculous. I do NOT recommend this game at all. I hope they update it soon, and then, perhaps, I will read the specifications of the update and decide to play it again. But this is utterly ridiculous. If you want to play a game like this, go get Uplink. Or Hack Run. Two great games, both similar to this, and both much better. Good luck to the people who want to finish this game; I've been playing hacking games like this for years, finishing them in one day, but never have I encountered this. It's unrealistic, starts out WAY too difficult, and doesn't tell you how to do anything.			"

												I was pretty excited, heard from this game long ago. Turns out it was a disappointment. I've encountered a series of small annoying bugs.Also, most mistakes are irreversible since you can't go back levels. If you pass a level but your trace level is too high and you have little or no money, you're doomed to fail in the game eventually. This turns it into a memory game, not a strategy one. You'd have to pass every level almost optimally and choose upgrades knowing the nature of the next level of the game to survive properly, and this process is not pleasureable in this kind of game. Maybe in a platformer, but not in case of a game that is supposed to be linear.			"

												Hacker Evolution is one of the few games where blatant cheating actuals resuces the game rather than ruining it.The standard gameplay cat be quite punishing due to the resource management mechanics - especially since they persist between levels.  However, the built-in cheat codes allow you to grant yourself enough money to completely ignore such things and enjoy the game as a puzzle game instead.  Doing this, Hacker Evolution has a decent story to make up for the somewhat limited gameplay and at times difficult to read font.  Removing the need to perfect your approach through multiple retries does cut down on the play time though, an I cleared the main story as well as the two DLC missions I have in under 9 hours, so you might want to wait for a sale.

												If you liked Uplink you'll probably like Hacker Evolution. It's definitely a bit more realistic though the hacker tools are, as usual, not accurate.I don't like the fact you can only use a system a certain number of times (it appears to always be three) for bounces, however once you have the first firewall upgrade, a decent CPU, and a decent modem you never have to bounce again anyway. Trace levels seem to always go up no matter how close they get to actually catching you, and the game is a bit short.On the other hand, the music is excellent, the story is mildly interesting, and it's more command prompt based, which means less trying to click on tiny icons and more typing commands.I enjoyed it, your milage may vary.

You can ugrade your computer to make it faster and pay (ingame money) to change your IP so it's harder for people to trace you. There are moments when my heart is actually racing as I try to steal money, or crack a encypted code before being traced. I have the ""abort"" command typed out waiting to press is at any second to avoid being caught. Sometimes it's a fraction of a second I make it by.

Highly stylized but unconnected to reality, but I can't really say I expected much from a game that equates ""hacker"" with ""script kiddie."" :Le sigh:As someone who uses a terminal on a daily basis, I can tell you this isn't even remotely what real digital B&E is. This game had me pulling my hair out over how terribly it portrays a CLI. Maybe the game has a decent storyline, I wouldn't know -- I was too busy head-desking over this game. Give me an open bash terminal and I'll show you some REAL hacking, and it WON'T involve using a single command to break into a box.tl;dr If you use Linux or are anything above a luser, don't get this game.

												A very interesting, and challenging game. It teaches you the differnet ways to hack around the world, from hacking into a bank account from Alaska, to finding a password on a hidden network somewhere in Greenland. None of it is real though, but, overall it is NOT easy, very challenging.			"

												Hacker Evolution is a hacking simulation game that tries very hard to simulate the success of uplink but fails at every turn due to extreme game difficulty. At its very core Hacker Evolution is a text based puzzle game. The level of comprehension required to understand what the hell to do in this game is insane, some of the clues needed to solve certain puzzles required digging in to some txt files hidden off in some server that is also hidden from view. Forget about pacing, even the tutorial requires thinking. World trace level is badly designed, if you don’t collect enough money per map, you will end up getting screwed in the long run. If you end up with a bad world trace level and no money you have to start over FROM THE BEGINNING. Luckily the storyline in this game is amazing, I was thoroughly mind ♥♥♥♥ed at the end. Hacker Evolution has a satisfying storyline with frustrating gameplay, wait for a sale.			"

												Hacker evolution is a puzzle/command prompt game, but not a true simulation of hacking as you type crack or decrypt you're in. Puzzles are great with a intersting story line driving you for the one more hack to see what files and exploits you can uncover. Truly a puzzle/mystery game to figure out who took down the stock markets, but this game can be very unforgiving. Cons:If you make a mistake by not buying a firewall for the first upgrade, or ran out of money to keep your trace below 85, game is done. Most puzzles are very intuitive, but a warning about that maze puzzle level; TAKE YOUR TIME! I spent nearly 3 hours in that one part because i spead read a clue that spun me off 4 different directions in 5 playthroughs. Pros:Great Console GameClever puzzles looking for the next server within the textSoundtrackFinishing a level after the introduction gives you that feel of accomplishment.At $5 or below on a steam sale, this game is worth the cash.

Take advantage of Brian Spencer's programming codes, intervene into systems, crack passwords and much more in the multi game mode Hacker Evolution. Spy out all important servers available on the world, stalk out profiles of some other hackers and help the FSA to defeat the evil A.I. which was supposed to control the Xenti Corporation's software (evolved into a trojan breaking and making the space and time unstable), allowing to arrive data packages to their destination before they even were sent.

												First of all, the reason I said I don't recomend this would be the story. The story is quite idiotic, and does have bad elements to it. I know you guys are looking at how I played this for only 7 minutes, but the game was ruined within 3. I'm not going to create any spoilers, but let's just say that if you like a story which is believable, don't buy this game. The game does play with some intersting ideas. For example; typing, the firtst game which relies heavily on it.Buy Uplink, doesn't focus on the story as much, but that means that it's not ruined by an idiotic idea.			"

												If you're looking for a review you've come to the wrong place, if you're here to cook a pie then read on !Napoleon from the final puff pastry You will need: Ready flaky pastry - 1.5 kg five eggs Flour - 150 g> Sugar - 400 grams Milk - 1200 ml Vanilla sugar - 1 n. Cognac - 1 tbsp. l. Shelled walnuts - glass sequence of preparation: dough defrost naturally at room temperature (defrost time indicated on the package). Cook the custard: grind the egg yolks with a mixer or a whisk to a conventional incandescent and vanilla sugar, flour and brandy to enter the mix. The mixture pour a trickle of milk, stir and cook, stirring constantly. Divide the dough into the desired number of pieces that will later Korzh. Roll out each piece on a board sprinkled with flour.

												This game. I LOVE IT!!! As someone who has experience in coding and hacking I can say this reminds of a custom built hacking program/OS that has commands that are easy to use. The layout kinda reminds me of Linux ubuntu Or the similar but the look is changeable in the options. Now if your wanting to learn how to do REAL hacking THIS. IS. NOT. THE. PROGRAM. FOR. YOU!!! you WILL get in trouble if you try this stuff if you get your hands on software like this. But if your wanting to just have some fun playing a hacking game that has a more realistic sense (I said more, not real) then Watch_Dogs then go ahead. It will take a while for you to get used to the game and how it works but that's enough out of me. Go enjoy the game since it's on sale. Oh and if your asking if it's worth 10 bucks normally, yes. Yes it is. Overall I give it a 10/10. Enjoy!!!			"

												Maybe it appeals to some audience.Maybe.The gameplay can be fun for an hour and you would repeat doing the same thing. As you progress further, the unstable difficulty curve might put you off from it as well.As the game becomes more difficult you aren't really being challenged with your skills or critical thinking. It's more or less  just doing more tedious things (such as bouncing more network) to delay being traced. That's about it.The game isn't very difficult, but I played this game way before it was released on Steam so I can't speak for others.Level design is basically awful, but due to how limited the gameplay is there isn't much you can do to make this game interesting after the first few levels.

												Hacker Evolution is a beautiful game of the series. But there is a lot of difficulty stage. Game do not recommend it because it is not HD and supports video modes. Mr. difficult from level occurs. Playing serious challenge stages available. They describe it very well in the game for the hacker to be a tough job. I congratulate those who play.

												This game sucks.The story is crap > data arriving before uploaded (Come on, really?).The gameplay is horribly dull, with no real explanation or justification for its mechanics.  The interface is probably the worst part.  Player interaction is done soley through command line-esque gui where many, if not most, of the commands are never taught to the player.  And, the GUI hurts my eyes.The controls are an awkward mixture of keyboard & mouse.			"

There is so much wrong its hard to know where to startIf you follow the tutorial instructions you will fail the tutorial, I repeat: FAIL THE TUTORIAL. Let that sink in.To play you basically type on your keyboard into a virtual command prompt.

Nothing else is happening - you're just sitting there.  I wish I was exaggerating.The game communicates no goals or objectives to the player, nor does it explain any game mechanics.  The only thing you'll be instructed is to type into the hacker console some long string of text, then when you do it you'll be told you failed.  Nothing will explain why you failed or what you could do to prevent it in the future.Run, don't walk away from this game.			"

												This has got to be the WORST hacking game I have ever played!Anybody who has ever played Uplink will agree with me.  The game mechanics are too simple, designed for absent-minded people, sometimes even totally incorrect compared with what one would do IRL.I regret for paying any penny for this POS. Get this TURD off of Steam.			"

												This isn't a game. This isn't sparta either. THIS IS ♥♥♥♥.The game basically a typing simulator with  some really boring ♥♥♥ minigames. The actual game looks amazing to have on but honestly, they should have just created an interactive screen saver. It would have been better. This game? No. If you want a hacking game, try Uplink, its old, not perfect but blows this out of the water. "

I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People.

												I have played many hacking sim games in my life and this game is near the top of the list in terms of enjoyment. While the game does not use the extensive commands that you would have at your disposal if you were doing this in the real world they have still managed to give you enough to keep you working for that win at the end of the level. The game is more of a puzzle game with a hacker theme in my opinion, but is very good and will eat hours upon hours of your day. This game also gets positive marks for two main things that i do enjoy, one is that the game is all based around the command line interface which gives it that good old fashion feel, and the other is the ability to create your own story line and your own world in a sense. By that i mean that they have a proper mod editor that a lot of the other hacking sims i have played seem to lack (most of those just being hand typing into a notepad while this one is a full separate application).For more, msg me.

												Hacker Evolution is one of a slowly growing genre of Hollywood hacking games. Like Uplink, you hack computers across the globe, bouncing your connection across them to help stave off the ever-looming trace. Unlike Uplink, you're not just lazily clicking everything together. You control almost everything you do via a command prompt, which I feel makes all the difference. This does mean having to learn the commands, and the tutorial teaches you next to nothing compared to what you'll need to know. Don't fret, though - it's not all that tough to pick up. Gameplay is quite interesting, involving some puzzle-solving. Oftentimes important information such as server addresses and passwords are hidden on servers, in messages, in files... and aren't always obvious. Luckily, and also unlike Uplink, the game only acts when you enter a command. You're free to take your time between actions to figure things out and plan your next move, which makes this feel more like a tactical puzzle game than a simulation. And it works. The one complaint I have is that your money and trace level carry over between levels, meaning that an error early on may not become obvious until several levels down the line when you suddenly discover you don't have the money to keep your trace from boiling over. Of course, as long as you're checking every server for loose cash and not over-upgrading, you should be fine. If you want the command line Hollywood hacker experience, I can easily suggest Hacker Evolution.			"

												Contrary to this game's description, it is not a hacking sim.  Rather, it is essentially a text adventure/puzzle game wrapped in a hacker facade.  The game is divided in to 10 chapters where you will scan websites, decrypt keys, and crack passwords in order to complete level objectives.  Puzzling out how to complete your objectives without getting traced can be quite fulfilling.  However, you will find yourself frustrated by a number of things.  Firstly, the game's tutorial and help menus are mostly useless.  They don't enumerate all of the syntax at your command, and the descriptions that do exist are unhelpful.  Once you do figure out how to actually play the game, you may find that you have played yourself in to a corner and have to restart the whole game from scratch.  This is essentially just a couple of poor design choices and overall shouldn't impede your enjoyment of the game.  If you were fascinated by mid 90s cyberpunk hacker culture, then you'll dig this game. 7/10			"

												Hacker Evolution is a brilliant game. A 'Hacker Detective Mystery', which blends both puzzle and sim genres into the gameplay. The gameplay is objective based, and involves hacking other systems looking through files, finding clues, downloading/uploading/deleting important files, and locating new IPs to hack to complete your objectives. Meanwhile managing the balance in your bank account, which is used not only to upgrade your computers specs, but to reduce your current trace level. If your trace level reaches 100% or you are caught decrypting or cracking a server, you lose. You can find money by locating IPs for ATM Machines, also some servers occasionally have money in them to transfer. While hacking in the game is simplified, it still does take time to learn the commands. There is a tutorial, also typing HELP will bring up a list of commands when needed. Hacker Evolution provides a great experience for those who invest the time and patience to learn the ropes.			"

												Despite the tedious style of gameplay, the game isn’t actually tedious. The levels are reasonably shorts and because it’s more puzzle than action, you spend more time thinking strategies than actually typing. By typing every word yourself, it’s even more fulfilling when something goes right and you beat a level. And victory is certainly satisfying as the game isn’t exactly easy. There’s some kind of background story (just to establish you’re one of the good hackers) though all I really gathered was that you’re Brian Spencer.Want to feel like a slick hacker and you use your superior networking knowledge to benefit corporations? Then this is the game for you. Don’t like typing long, complicated strings of computer-related nonsense? Then this probably isn’t the game for you.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/08/13/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-hacker-evolution/ "

												An interesting take on video games, combining Hollywood style ""hacking"" with a unique story allows this game to be a pretty good run. Now, with all of the fun interesting concepts in the game, be aware of two very large issues with the game. First, it is targeted to a specific audience. This may not be the game for you if you want to perform real life training on security penetration, or analytics. It is also not for you if you don't like a whole lot of text. But if you can get past the Hollywood make over, it is a game that will make you think outside of the box, and pay attention to every action. 7.5/10			"

												So I bought this game. I really like hacking simulation games you know :).But not this one. I hate it's level based approach (I hate that in every game) and absolutelly annoying controls via console where you have to type in server's name thousand times. There are some shorcuts (on your mouse - clicking on servers) but guess what? Games doesn't learn you.Whole interface is rubish as well and if you do something sooner then it tells you to do, quests completely glitches out.Don't buy this game. Buy Uplink instead			"

												So I bought this game. I really like hacking simulation games you know :).But not this one. I hate it's level based approach (I hate that in every game) and absolutelly annoying controls via console where you have to type in server's name thousand times. There are some shorcuts (on your mouse - clicking on servers) but guess what? Games doesn't learn you.Whole interface is rubish as well and if you do something sooner then it tells you to do, quests completely glitches out.Don't buy this game. Buy Uplink instead			"

												I did absolutely NOT like this game. In my case, me and my friend tried this game out, we had already completed another Hacking-simulator-game and we have both experienced this before.So in the first mission, the tutorial level, we broke the game by completing a step before it ""was meant to be done"". We had to restart.In the second mission, after we've learned that the messege-screen that pops up with objectives, we did exactyl what we were told to do. And after a few minutes the new objectives stopped popping up. Very confusing game and I do not recommend it. Maybe, only MAYBE, to a younger generation.			"

												Suggesting this for people that know abit about computer techs from before, not for newbies to be honest. Its a fun game, but also a game you easily getting angry on, hard to understand for times, also the tutorial isnt well explaining for you. I still will say this is a fun game, but i dont really know if its thumb up or down, it stuck between them, so i giving it thumb up.			"

The aim is to hack various servers to find files, information, money and to complete objectives by typing various lines of code.

												Date: 2/1/16Review Number: 7Game: Hacker EvolutionFrom (Creator Publisher): exosyphen studiosPlayed On: LaptopSteam Price as of Review: $9.99Total Time played: 40 minutesReview:Yes, technically this is being released on the second, however I have yet to go to bed, so I’m still calling this as day 7.  Though really, the biggest reason why this was delayed was because I actually took some extra time to play the game that came up on the I’m-a-die-die today, Hacker Evolution by exosyphen studios, a mostly console oriented hacking game.  Now, at first glance you would think a game like this would be a somewhat boring little text based adventure game, and really that is what this, a simple concept that at its core is no different than trying to fix a busted DOS prompt before your mother finds out you’ve been messing with the autoexec files again so you can play your games with the proper soundblaster IRQ settings and accidentally the whole drive system.  However to some of us, that throwback is half the fun.  Being able to sit down with nothing but text descriptions and a little blinking cursor you find you have to use your imagination to tell half the story, while the game does a very thorough job of guiding your imagination through a rather ingeneous story, and makes the CSI-level ‘hacking’ both enjoyable and engaging, if not addicting.  This is one of those games I would like the play the whole way through, I honestly think.Game’s Fate: Kept, surprisingly.  This game is deceptively addictive.Buy/No Buy:  Honestly a good buy, even with as little as I’ve seen, it’s a unique concept I can sink my teeth into. "

												""Hacker Evolution"" is one of those games that just tickles your fantasies of being a Programmer/Hacker..It uses its own simple command lines to hack into servers for cash, information, virus, and etc.This game is very challenging, even at the start of level 1! You have to watch your trace level and make smart decision on what to hack into.It may not be hardcore programming, but it is still entertaining!This game is extremely addicting and I warn you...you will put in a lot of hours into this game...sometime your partner will wonder why you haven't respond to her calls...and at times you will have dillusion that you're a incredible hacker...and then the FBI will start investigating you because you tried this in real life...then your partner left you because you were busy playing this game...You'll start seeing patterns and start bouncing on people...thinking it will lower your trace level....O god...this game HELP!

												More of a hacker-themed puzzler than an actual hacker simulator. For example: whether you crack a server and get trace down to 2 seconds remaining or bounce the single through 4 servers with trace as high as 120 seconds remaining, your trace percentage will still rise by the same amount. Pretty interesting story and I did like the puzzle aspect of the game. Though, I did find myself restarting levels knowing all the servers and answers in advance allowing me to save thousands of dollars. Note if you want to survive: don't worry much about upgrading your computer (except for FWL2 and 2GHz CPU) because you're gonna burn all your cash on killtrace XD.			"

												I bought this in a steam sale for like $2. I was on a hacking simulator fix after playing Hacknet. I didn't really enjoy this game to be honest. I turned the music down and put my own stuff on. The story was bland and it was very repetitive. Still for a few bucks i guess it wasn't too bad. I saw a bunch of expasion packs but the first one didn't float my boat enough for me to plurge on additional content.I also found the puzzels to be a bit much, you really have to dig around and read into things. you will enter 15 ips at one point until you get it right, but by 5/6 you are questioning if you are even doing it right. Then at completion you are awarded a very flat plot twist.			"

												I believe at this point this an older style of hacking simulation game. Actually, I think there's been a genre shift to coding simulations. However, this style, in which your interface is a map and a command line, is still fun and challenging.The storyline has mystery enough, though there are some distracting spelling errors.With trial and error I think I've got an understanding of the factors that determine whether I will complete levels or not.

												Hacker Evolution is one of a slowly growing genre of Hollywood hacking games. Like Uplink, you hack computers across the globe, bouncing your connection across them to help stave off the ever-looming trace. Unlike Uplink, you're not just lazily clicking everything together. You control almost everything you do via a command prompt, which I feel makes all the difference. This does mean having to learn the commands, and the tutorial teaches you next to nothing compared to what you'll need to know. Don't fret, though - it's not all that tough to pick up. Gameplay is quite interesting, involving some puzzle-solving. Oftentimes important information such as server addresses and passwords are hidden on servers, in messages, in files... and aren't always obvious. Luckily, and also unlike Uplink, the game only acts when you enter a command. You're free to take your time between actions to figure things out and plan your next move, which makes this feel more like a tactical puzzle game than a simulation. And it works. The one complaint I have is that your money and trace level carry over between levels, meaning that an error early on may not become obvious until several levels down the line when you suddenly discover you don't have the money to keep your trace from boiling over. Of course, as long as you're checking every server for loose cash and not over-upgrading, you should be fine. If you want the command line Hollywood hacker experience, I can easily suggest Hacker Evolution.			"

												I have played many hacking sim games in my life and this game is near the top of the list in terms of enjoyment. While the game does not use the extensive commands that you would have at your disposal if you were doing this in the real world they have still managed to give you enough to keep you working for that win at the end of the level. The game is more of a puzzle game with a hacker theme in my opinion, but is very good and will eat hours upon hours of your day. This game also gets positive marks for two main things that i do enjoy, one is that the game is all based around the command line interface which gives it that good old fashion feel, and the other is the ability to create your own story line and your own world in a sense. By that i mean that they have a proper mod editor that a lot of the other hacking sims i have played seem to lack (most of those just being hand typing into a notepad while this one is a full separate application).For more, msg me.

												I cannot recommend this game enough.  It is one of my long time favorites.   This game does an excellent job emulating a hacking experience with it's operating system, and is possibly of the best puzzle games I have ever played.  For those who are confused about gameplay, then I can describe it this way: You use actual commands to discover information hidden on servers in order to reveal information on other servers.  You will type commands into the console like CRACK, SCAN, BOUNCE, DECRYPT, TRANSFER, UPLOAD, DOWNLOAD, and KILLTRACE in an attempt to not only steal information from companies about recent cyber attacks, but also steal exploits and viruses from hackers themselves in order to TRANSFER funds to your account from other companies or orginizations that you can use to upgrade various components of your computer such as your GPU and memory, which allow for faster decryption and cracking speed and more files to be stored on your computer.  [h1I give this game a 9.3/10,[/h1] as some of the directions are a little rough at times.			"

												Despite the tedious style of gameplay, the game isn’t actually tedious. The levels are reasonably shorts and because it’s more puzzle than action, you spend more time thinking strategies than actually typing. By typing every word yourself, it’s even more fulfilling when something goes right and you beat a level. And victory is certainly satisfying as the game isn’t exactly easy. There’s some kind of background story (just to establish you’re one of the good hackers) though all I really gathered was that you’re Brian Spencer.Want to feel like a slick hacker and you use your superior networking knowledge to benefit corporations? Then this is the game for you. Don’t like typing long, complicated strings of computer-related nonsense? Then this probably isn’t the game for you.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/08/13/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-hacker-evolution/ "

												An interesting take on video games, combining Hollywood style ""hacking"" with a unique story allows this game to be a pretty good run. Now, with all of the fun interesting concepts in the game, be aware of two very large issues with the game. First, it is targeted to a specific audience. This may not be the game for you if you want to perform real life training on security penetration, or analytics. It is also not for you if you don't like a whole lot of text. But if you can get past the Hollywood make over, it is a game that will make you think outside of the box, and pay attention to every action. 7.5/10			"

												I honestly don't know how it happened, but I got hooked onto this game.  At first, learning the commands and how to use the interface is very confusing.  The game does not have a very comprehensive tutorial and the beginning can be muddling.  DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU'RE RE-DOING LEVELS OVER AND OVER.  In fact, this seems like the only way to get the hang of the game.  Once you understand it, though, it's wonderful.There's a lot of strategy involved with completing the levels; who to hack first, how to hack, how to gain funds to upgrade your computer, whether you should trade information with other groups, etc.  It's like a game of chess.  There's also some replayability value if you challenge yourself to finish the levels quicker and with more funds.  Although it's not an action game, it's definitely engrossing if you enjoy something that can make you work your brain.			"

												Hacker Evolution is a brilliant game. A 'Hacker Detective Mystery', which blends both puzzle and sim genres into the gameplay. The gameplay is objective based, and involves hacking other systems looking through files, finding clues, downloading/uploading/deleting important files, and locating new IPs to hack to complete your objectives. Meanwhile managing the balance in your bank account, which is used not only to upgrade your computers specs, but to reduce your current trace level. If your trace level reaches 100% or you are caught decrypting or cracking a server, you lose. You can find money by locating IPs for ATM Machines, also some servers occasionally have money in them to transfer. While hacking in the game is simplified, it still does take time to learn the commands. There is a tutorial, also typing HELP will bring up a list of commands when needed. Hacker Evolution provides a great experience for those who invest the time and patience to learn the ropes.			"

												Hacker Evolution markets itself as a ""Hacking Simulator"" and boy is that spot on.This game not only makes you think and feel like a hacker, it really challenges your mind to solve the problems that you have to solve.You MUST think like a hacker in order to beat this game, and it really challenges your mind as I said before because it can be pretty hard to solve the game's puzzles.The game gives you a few commands and resources and the rest is up to you. You'll probably fail multiple times trying to solve a puzzle, but every time you retry you'll get just a bit further than you did before, and that to me is the most rewarding form of gameplay, slowly figuring the game out and finally beating it.If you ever wanted to feel like a movie-style hacker or just enjoy a good mind challege, Hacker Evolution is perfect for you!

												Man oh man, I wish Steam reviews had an option to put an 'it's okay' rating.Hacker Evolution is one of those games that I bought as a bundle because it was on sale (Hacker Evolution bundle for around £2.20 haha). But is the first instalment one I can recommend? Before we go into that, let's cover all the points.The story seems a little bit convoluted but in simple terms, a lot of crazy stuff happened in the world and it's up to Brian Spencer to find out who did it by taking the back door in, hacking computers and following leads.The graphics are decent and also rather fitting for a hacking type game. The controls are entered into the console and you type them out, just like a real hacker. You can even upgrade your hardware and the like, which becomes very important later on in the game. The music is catchy the first time you hear it but I'm not sure if it fits in with the aesthetic. It does sound cool though.However, the objectives are very vague and there is very little direction on what to do next (except in the tutorial level but that doesn't really count). It's erring very dangerously on that line of frustration. Some brief guidance would help a little but just like a real hacker, that guidance isn't given. Is this a good or a bad thing? That's a bit difficult to say.What about the difficulty curve? More like difficulty leap. After you finish the tutorial the difficulty skyrockets. You'll definitely need a pen and paper to take notes of all the commands as well as any other important details. Plus, any 'trace' you've acquired will be carried over to the next level so one has to watch that.Does it feel like hacking? Yes, in quite a few aspects.Does it give you that slightly badass feel while playing? In a sense.Should you definitely buy the game? Not at full price. £6.99 is a VERY steep asking price for a game like this. On sale, buy it if you want. But full price? No.All in all, I can just about recommend this game. But it is a very fine line. If you like a big challenge and feeling like a hacker, then go for it. If you don't have the patience or can't handle frustration, steer well clear.			"

I can see the fun in it but I'd like to see better control and maybe less typing. Maybe a copy/paste type feature. Still... it can be a good time waster if you're up for a challenge.			"

												I honestly expected this to be some clicking-based nonsense, however it turned out to be quite well done thing.Of course it has nothing to do with hacking and stuff that you're supposed to do barely makes any sense, but in the end it's quite funny game if you're not afraid of hours and hours of typing down commands!It would be amazing if this game got Multi Player so you could compare your ""hacking"" skills with others.Pros:+ Not as bad ""hacking simulator"" as I expected+ Dynamic difficulty levels+ Thankfully it's not based on player clicking on buttons so it doesn't make people think that hacking is just clicking at various buttons in hope something will eventually happen+ Trading Cards! yay! (profile backgrounds and emoticons as well, of course)Cons:- Not really realistic way which the game works, however you can't expect anything super accurate, at least not for this price- Static and quite boring graphics (I'm sure it's intended but still...)TL;DR: 8/10 - Quite good simulation for fair price. If you see this on 90% sale, just go for it, it's totally worth! :-)			"

												I like playing this game, it gives a nice Immersion with the player’s textual interactions just like a real hacker behind a terminal console.The core “admin” spirit approach of the game can appear a bit complex and repetitive compared to graphic gaming. Difficult also due to limited actions (trace level penalty/money), IMHO too much present and harming the fun during the progression. Definitely, this should have been lowered for rookies, and increased dynamically for aces.But the overall gameplay stays appealing, it reminds me of the police enquiry board game “Clue”. Here, rooms are replaced by servers, and clues can be everywhere in what you will hack.Very happy to have purchased the game during a 90% sale on Steam :) Really worth it!			"

												Date: 2/1/16Review Number: 7Game: Hacker EvolutionFrom (Creator Publisher): exosyphen studiosPlayed On: LaptopSteam Price as of Review: $9.99Total Time played: 40 minutesReview:Yes, technically this is being released on the second, however I have yet to go to bed, so I’m still calling this as day 7.  Though really, the biggest reason why this was delayed was because I actually took some extra time to play the game that came up on the I’m-a-die-die today, Hacker Evolution by exosyphen studios, a mostly console oriented hacking game.  Now, at first glance you would think a game like this would be a somewhat boring little text based adventure game, and really that is what this, a simple concept that at its core is no different than trying to fix a busted DOS prompt before your mother finds out you’ve been messing with the autoexec files again so you can play your games with the proper soundblaster IRQ settings and accidentally the whole drive system.  However to some of us, that throwback is half the fun.  Being able to sit down with nothing but text descriptions and a little blinking cursor you find you have to use your imagination to tell half the story, while the game does a very thorough job of guiding your imagination through a rather ingeneous story, and makes the CSI-level ‘hacking’ both enjoyable and engaging, if not addicting.  This is one of those games I would like the play the whole way through, I honestly think.Game’s Fate: Kept, surprisingly.  This game is deceptively addictive.Buy/No Buy:  Honestly a good buy, even with as little as I’ve seen, it’s a unique concept I can sink my teeth into. "

												I did absolutely NOT like this game. In my case, me and my friend tried this game out, we had already completed another Hacking-simulator-game and we have both experienced this before.So in the first mission, the tutorial level, we broke the game by completing a step before it ""was meant to be done"". We had to restart.In the second mission, after we've learned that the messege-screen that pops up with objectives, we did exactyl what we were told to do. And after a few minutes the new objectives stopped popping up. Very confusing game and I do not recommend it. Maybe, only MAYBE, to a younger generation.			"

												A fun puzzle game that uses a command prompt as its primary game mechanic. I don't recommend this is if you have no desire to type commands. Prior knowledge of command-line driven systems administration (aka ""hacking"") isn't something that I see a prerequisite. I've done a great deal of this in real life, and I think it serves only to create preconceived notions that are not necessarily helpful.

Although the game doesn't do that, it gives you a good idea as to how hackers do. I have played a lot of hacking simulators, but Hacker Evolution really does take the trophy as it provides a simple yet complicated and neat way of hacking. It is also a great way of excersizing your fingers and making typing a lot quicker. Hacker Evolution may be tossed away as just another game but it will stay as the best Hacking Sim in my books.

												I can't really bring more to the table than what has already been brought up in most of the reviews. It is true, Uplink is a better game on all accounts. The whole experience was rather mundane. The objectives of this game are rather repetitive, and can become quite bland as the game progresses. The ending in this game is rather uneventful, leaving me with a feeling of 'Is that it?'.  The 'puzzles' only get somewhat interesting in the remaining two levels, which was a further let down.The mechanics of the game are certainly over simplified, giving you the ability to past through the majority of the game with just tree commands: hack; crack; killtrace. So if you were looking for a more realistic, more dynamic game, you're best off not wasting your money on this game, and just sticking with Uplink.Despite getting the Exosyphen bundle for a mere $5, I felt as if it wasn't really worth it. Overall I would not recommend this game.			"

												It was ok but game is poorly designed. I love the thinking part but hate the do-one-thing-wrong-and-you'll-do-everything-again part. Yeah, it's 'realistic' but it's a poor game mechanics and get old really quick. if you wanna play a game, try Watch Dogs. If you wanna hack, do offensive security. ;) 4/10 "

												Feels like it's trying to be a spiritual successor to Uplink, but the interface is too restrictive, what's happening is too opaque, and the difficulty curve more of a brick wall.			"

												I like playing this game, it gives a nice Immersion with the player’s textual interactions just like a real hacker behind a terminal console.The core “admin” spirit approach of the game can appear a bit complex and repetitive compared to graphic gaming. Difficult also due to limited actions (trace level penalty/money), IMHO too much present and harming the fun during the progression. Definitely, this should have been lowered for rookies, and increased dynamically for aces.But the overall gameplay stays appealing, it reminds me of the police enquiry board game “Clue”. Here, rooms are replaced by servers, and clues can be everywhere in what you will hack.Very happy to have purchased the game during a 90% sale on Steam :) Really worth it!			"
