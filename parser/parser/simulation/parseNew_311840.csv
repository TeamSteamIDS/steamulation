												Well, where do I start. If you like wildlife park as I did when I was young along with zoo tycoon and many other games of its kind you know what your getting into. It runs well on modern OS. I have had little to no frame loss or crashing. I am enjoying it but I played it when I was young. If you buy it please note that it has oldschool UI jank.It does hold up and run well however. heres a screen shot of the options menu http://imgur.com/iNUBw4II recomend it if you played it back in the day. Its still way better then Wildlife park 2. "

												I own the game on CD since it has been released in 2003, and even in the next years I couldn't wait to run home after school to play it in my free time. I was happy to see that it came out to Steam as my laptop has no CD driver I couldn't play the game anymore, and even better, it has achievements. The only problem is that the Steam version has graphical glitches (the cursor keeps vibrating for me, and the resolution settings is also weird), I hope that this will be fixed. I recommend the game for anyone who enjoys zoo simulators and is not being afraid to try something ""retro"", I still think that Wildlife Park (and NOT Wildlife Park 2 or 3 or any of the Zoo Tycoon games) is the best in its genre.

												I brought this game as I'm a fan of similar titles like Zoo Tycoon and heard good reviews about this. However I didn't see the negative reviews which highlight the major flaw with this game, that you can only play in a window and cannot change the resolution. There is no full screen mode. If you try and make it full screen using the options menu the game still runs in a window, cutting off the text and tool bars making it impossible to progress especially if you are playing the tutorial. I managed to progress a little using the defult small window display though it was increadible hard to read the text and make out what was happening on the scree due to the small size. Hopefully this issue will be fixed but intill then I would not recommend purchasing this game.  "

												The game itself is ok, obviously a bit dated, but still fun. The problem is there are serious graphical glitches that render the game unplayable in any mode other than windowed at the lowest resolution. It's difficult to see things and read the text at that size, and it's annoying that I can't play fullscreen.			"

												Decent enough game, would recommend purchasing it while it is on sale. Old-school type gameplay and old-school graphics but it works really well. When you start out you might want to pay attention to the tutorial because it is difficult to understand some of the animal♥♥♥♥♥♥without it			"

												I love the game. Even though the graphics could have been better, but hey.. it's an old game now.There's a few things I'm missing, like the ability to move a building if you screwed up, but it's minor issues like that. I have wildlife park and wildlife park two. I bought them at the same time. The reason is, that WLP2 doesn't have trading cards or steam achievements.			"

												Im stuck on the seaworld and panda breeding program. I can't advance in the campaign unless I beat them and there are no walkthroughs online. I would be more then happy to change my review if someone can answer some questions for me.  1. How would you suggest I play the panda breeding program?I have tried focusing on just the pandas so they will breed and made them a cool home. But then the customers don't like my park and I go bankrupt. If I focus a little on each the panda home isn't suitable enough to breed, but the people are happy, and I'm still not making money. If I try just other animals to make the zoo popular. I just can't make enough money to adopt two panda's so I'm just stuck.2. How do you make a killer whale home stay? I can do the shark and the bottle nose dolphin. If I can figure out the Whale then I can pass the board.Anyway yeah. Thumbs down.			"

												Aside from some of the graphical errors of playing a dated game on a more recent computer, it's still really fun. Sure, there are some annoyin things I had to do to get it to stop doing stupid stuff like a flashing cursor, however this is a gem of a game even to this day. The simplicity and even challenges at time are what make it a really good game I think. The addition of achievments is a nice touch I think too.			"

												This game, to me holds a lot of great memories. I had this game years ago on a disk, and the hours I put into it...Well worth it in my opinion. The details in this little game are really nice and the game play and views of all things in it, hard to meet sometimes but who doesn't like a little challenge every now and again huh? :)			"

												I'm so happy to be able to play this game after many, many years! My 8 year old self is practically screaming with joy! Although  some of the controlls are a bit different from the original CD-ROM game it is exactly how I used to picture it playing and looking when I was a kid! :D			"
