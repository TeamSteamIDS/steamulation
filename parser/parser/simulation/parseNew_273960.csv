												This is the kind of game that takes ""every concept from every game"" and throws them all together. But, there is no concern for things like ""balance"" or ""gameplay"".The game has an XP system. Except you'll max our the trees-that-matter on your units in a few short missions, after which you just spend your XP on generic +1 hp upgrades. Of course, the first mission has infinitely respawning enemies and no time limit, and yes enemies give you XP per kill. So it's trivially easy to just sit on a mostly-won mission and farm up XP if you really care to.The game has unit types. Except scouts are worthless since heavy armor shines so much in comparison to light armor. For 200-points-per-unit, you can have a heavy armor soldier who can stand in an open field and kill any enemy troop that is not also heavy armor. For 100-points-per-unit, you can hire a scout, that can die horribly when confronted by any enemy whatsoever. Oh, and if your whole squad is wiped out, all of their XP is lost and they're dead forever. Also, light troops can die to a single attack from many enemies in the game. What are the benefits to light troops you ask? None, they have no benefit other than being cheaper to resupply the squad in the field.Those are just a few examples, I could keep going, but I don't think I need to.This game is a gigantic pile of steaming... wasted potential. It could have been a good game, if they had anyone on their team that understands ""why"" these other games have the mechanics they do, instead of just including them willy-nilly with no understanding of why they're adding them.

												This had the potential to be a great game, the rough mechanics for some great ideas are there. However, the basic fundamental parts of the games control scheme and balance were rushed and are very poorly done. A lot of it is just little stuff that every other major RTS gets right, such as being able to select units and click the mini-map to get them to walk to that location, etc.The biggest issue I ran into though was balance, on just about every mission the enemy has infinite spawns of squads that will come after you, and they just about always know where your guys are, so flanking isn't much of an option. Since you are perpetually outnumbered, your squads lose grunts, and then you have to march them back to the landing zone to replenish them. This pretty much means you have to conserve your guys and thrust from landing zone to landing zone, there's no real way to take it slow, because attrition will just wear you down too much.They hyped up the mechs and really seemed to want them to be a great mechanic for a very powerful ally, but those are broken too. Engineers can't repair them in the field, so they also have to tromp back to the landing zone for repairs which are prohibitively expensive, all in exchange for pretty lackluster supporting fire and very little tanking ability at best.Finally, the infantry(which is your main core of units in this game) are horribly balanced. Essentially, light squads are useless, medium squads pretty much go 1 for 1 against the enemy(which are horrible ratios when you are always outnumbered by an enemy with unlimited supplies) and heavy troops are the only troops that are worth having. Your heavy troops will mow through a squad or 3, and by then they have lost enough people to be rendered combat ineffective, and have to tromp back to the landing zone themselves, which takes forever because of their heavy armor.This just killed the flow of the game for me. There's a lot of great ideas here from other RTS's that I love, such as Dawn of War 1 and Starcraft 2, but the execution is absolutely clunky and horrible. This game hasn't been out long, maybe the developers will add some actual balance so this game isn't so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nintendo hard. The simplistic AI and poor balancing pretty much just makes this game a meatgrinder.			"

												After playing for a few hours i can say that i do not recommend this game (for now).-Side missions are almost tower defense style, enemy dropships take reinforcements every minute, forcing you to turtle chockepoints and deal with constant suicide rushes.-There is no lifebar on bunkers or turrets, neither vivible external damage, so you never know when they are going to blow up and kill you squad inside.-Squads only become usefull after they level up and anything below armor 350 is just useless, dying to easy.-The game gets boring fast, has no autosave, it feels like incomplete.Me recomendation is to wait at least a month, so they can update and more reviews show up.so far the game is a no go and since i already bought it i am going to play something else for now.

												This thumbs down makes me very sad.  The game SHOULD be cool.  It has all of the pieces there.  A compelling setting, decent artwork, cool cutscenes.  Mechs.  I mean, what could go wrong?Well, simply, a total lack of fun.  The game is only about the heavy units, all the others are a waste of time.  Part of this is terrible game balance, part of it stems from the mechanic of permanent loss of a unit and all the experience it earns when the last squad member is killed.  This is made worse by the fact that the enemy has infinite units, and if the ai doesn't register a response (like while crossing a bridge) you will also lose those units.What does this mean?  It means that rather than an interesting tactical game, you are in for a long slog with slow moving heavy units.  Push a position, clear it out, head back and heal.  Repeat.  Repeat A LOT.  Relatively simple missions take 3 to 4 times longer than you would expect.And you barely get mechs, this is a game about rocket infantry.At some point you have to stop and ask.... is this even fun?  For me, the answer was no.			"

												This can be a great game with some tweaking.    Mechs are very limited with weapon/equipement slots. No in mission save, light infantry are worthless and a few other minor issues.  The basic RTS move and fight commands are intuitive but upgrade, purchase, save etc... commands take a little trail and error to figure out.  The one thing that I do hate is having to run back to the landing pads to replace men or repair the mechs. It would seem that you should be able to call for the replacements and let them make their way from the landing site to their squad. Same with the mech, engineers should be able to at least do small amounts of repair to the mech and or be able to call in a repair vehicle that will travel to the mech to repair it in the field.   Basically it is a descent game with the potential to be a great game that is fun to play not frustrating as it can be now. If the game gets tweaked it is well worth the price.			"

												While I'm a fan of both RTS and Mech centric games this title flat out fails to deliver on either front.1) The primary complaint you will see anywhere, and that I will confirm myself, is that this game is painfully slow. Even the most mundane of missions will take you much longer than it needs to as your units move at a snails pace through the board. Firefights between anything but the lightest of units are boring to watch as they just sit in one space and chip at each other's health until one drops.2) The game is a straight tactics game. While not inherently bad, the execution is poor enough that most tactics get thrown out the window in favor of brute force. On top of that unit management is clunky and awkward with only half of your commands really going through and a cover system that pathfinding will never allow you to use 100% correctly.3) My final and probably biggest but also most personal complaint in regards to this game: ""Mechs & Mercs"" is more 10% Mechs, 90% Mercs. You'll find that most missions refuse you access to mechs in this mech centric title, leaving you to resort to the aformentioned clunky infantry in cover to cover combat. Not only that but once you actually do get a chance to field the mechs, they control just as awkwardly sans the cover system, and when you get back to the dropship you will consistently need to replace the pilot in an individual mech because the game has this odd habit of removing them post interaction.It's honestly very disappointing that a great concept like this went down the tube due to poor execution. The graphics, while lackluster, aren't bad for a standard rts. The unit designs are pretty basic but get the job done well, and the mechs look decent. There was a lot of potential here but the game is effectively not fun to play.			"

												This is a harsh and unforgiving game.  Period.  It does not hold your hand or give you any inherent advantages.  You have to fight and plan like you know what you're doing because if your idea of tactics is a mob rush it's going to get VERY expensive for you very quickly.That being said it offers a rather impressive tactical combat system involving short/long ranges for weapons, requiring the intelligent use of cover and troop designs where you can be strong or fast but rarely both.  The upgrade system has more depth than most realize at first glance as the 'generic +1 upgrades' are actually a surprisingly powerful way to make your troops more durable or specialize them to a combat role, i.e. static defenders focus on cover and long range damage, assault types utilize armor/health and close range, etc.)The inclusion of different armor tiers is a very nice touch given the size of most of the maps, but the rocket problems (see below) force the lighter and faster troops to the wayside in favor of simple survivability.  The faction troops are another very interesting idea, but one I simply haven't had time to fully explore.The early mechs are light weight, fast, and heavily armed... but also rather fragile so protect your pilots if you want to use those bigger more devastating machines later.The game only actually has a couple glaring problems that unfortunately overshadow some excellent system designs.   Rockets are fired at a particular point, never miss and fire through cover, which combined with the AOE and extreme damage make them arguably the perfect weapon.  This is beyond a doubt the most broken part of the game.  Rockets should have a (high) chance of being blocked by cover as they're direct fire weapons as opposed to grenade launchers that would arc over said cover.  Also consider that an RPG and AT rocket are two VERY different weapon systems.  The current design of the rocket systems literally make every other weapon inferior in almost every situation.  The lack of any medical support for troops means wounded men are a liability until they die.  There are multiple ways to fix this, either through medics that heal over time out of combat (maintaining the sense of pressure intrinsic in the game) or via insta-heal when reinforcing from a Landing Pad.  The latter is easier to do as it applies the current system for mech repair to infantry.Overall it's an impressively designed game with some rather dated graphics and a couple glaring issues, though for my money it's a great purchase.  If the problems it has were fixed I think it'd be better than CoH, but that's just my opinion.			"

Posted: January 11, 2015
												This game is just bad.Why is it so bad? Where to begin? Lets start... at the beginning.1. Tutorial: Game says easy mode is for ""people who've never played RTS before"". Well I'm quite a strategy buff, but nothing I've played is much like this game, so that is an inaccurate description on their part. Most likely if you've never played THIS GAME before, you should probably start on Easy.2. There's very little strategy. Unless you consider ""walking up to enemies and shooting them while trying not to stand on a bridge"" a strategy. The game touts things like crossfire and cover, and ... not standing on bridges because there are armor penalties (or bonuses). But there's no real strategy. Its mostly just blasting enemies with as many guys as you can while damaged sections run away (tediously) to healing pads. If you're looking for anything resembling real tactics... you might want to look elsewhere. Before I explain what I mean, let me define a few things... DEFINITION: StrategyStrategy usually means managing at a macro level (research, gathering resources to build a larger army, capturing choke points etc) for advantage. There are resource locations in this game, but they're not terribly useful excpet that they generate the money needed to heal units. Once your best units are in the field: there is nothing more to buy. More units just get in the way and distract from you trying not to get your best people killed (squad death is permanent).DEFINITION: TacticsTactics is about singular engagements (hitting the enemy in ways that they can't hit back, flanking, or rock-paper-scissors). What do I mean by ""rock-paper-scissors""? In a hypothetical modern warfare game, it would be something like.... attacking the enemy helicopters with AA, while your helicopters attack their tanks, while your tanks attck their AA. When you maximize the number of your units specialized at killing a particular unit type, with engagements against that unit type: that is a good tactic and makes for a good game. In this game, everything early-on defers to the all powerful heavy rocket infantry, and later on to mechs. All weapons have about the same range, so there's no sense of pinning an enemy down while snipers pick them off (etc). Its just NOT THERE in this game. Everything is about having the most guns to bear at a particular time and making sure that the ""last guy"" in any unit isn't killed because then the unit dies.3. The unit AI is abysmal. Its really annoying and frustrating, especially in a game where you constantly have to scroll around to do things like checking that enemies haven't spawned behind you, or sending units back to healing pads. You will frequently find that you will send an order, go do something else, and then come back to find out that the order was ignored. Units get stuck on the map, ignore orders to shoot stuff (or don't return fire when they are under attack). Attacked units will not complete their order. Units tasked with entering a bunker, may or may not just stand there and jitter spasmotically, while others allow themselves to get shot up by enemies standing directly next to them, or just wanders off to die in the enemy camp. The only thing that saves you from defeat at the incompetence of your idiot soldiers is that the enemy AI is even dumber. The whole enemy strategy seems to consist of ""reinforce as often as possible and send them at the player"". While this seems simple, its often made tediously impossible by giving the player 1 spawn pad and the enemy AI 6 or 7 per level, then forcing the player to also manage some other tedius task like ""evacuate the civilians"" or ""don't lose your engineers"" at the same time. And speaking of that...4. Mission parameters don't make sense. Mission 1 the goal requires engineers. You can get new engineers at the drop ship pad. Despite the fact that you can get more, you ""lose"" the game if you lose all your engineers in the level, despite the fact that you might have more in reserve... ready to be called down at a moment's notice.5. The sound is REALLY messed up. Music is WAY too loud. I turned it off, only to find that the video cutscene sound (including voice and sound effects) are on the same audio track!6. What's with the unskippable cut scenes?7. What's with the non-standard RTS game controls?8. The story is non-existent. I wanted to know more about the game universe, but clicking around on the strategic map only tells you planet name and whether there's a mission. Ingame fiction seems to have been overlooked.9. WHAT DO UNITS DO? There is no encyclopedia that I can see. No hover hints. You pretty-much have to guess if a unit is what you want. But I suppose that makes sense, since all the units seem identical anyway. The game says units have special abilities, but I haven't seen it (other than for engineers). They appear to unlock later. So until then: enjoy your all-the-same units.So is there anything good? Artwork seems pretty good. It has a compelling look, albiet overly-busy and maybe slightly lower quality than the game dictates. I like the abundance of fully-rendered cutscenes. This is one thing that has disappeared from games recently that I would wish to come back. And RTS for that matter: its not a dead genre. But big publishers won't make it because it doesn't port nicely to console. Its nice to see that a game company is at least TRYING to make an interesting RTS.That's all I have for now. Thanks for reading! "

												Loving this game so far. I don't understand what's with all the negative reviews.I guess many players are not into tactical gaming or buying this expecting a different game.Mechs and mercs is unlike anything I've played before. it handles very well the mix of xcom-like management and let's say Company of heeroes tactical movement/fighting.The first mission is tough. But once you get how the troops work and start using the strengths of each, you'll love the challenge.			"

												Mechs and Mercs is a delicious tactical game that combines several different components in a dark futuristic setting.Graphics and designs are lovely. I see there was a lot of love creating the soldiers, mechs, ships, weapons, etc. The Unit upgrading works really well. Novice units are relatively weak, but after powering up a few levels they get dozens of buffs that boost specific things.Mechs are the ultimate units, able to fight against several squads at once. But the lighter mechs aren't that powerful. You'll want to keep your credits to buy the powerful ones.The campaign keeps jumping from planet to planet, which is nice. There's that feeling of action everywhere at once.Hint: use and abuse of catching units on crossfire.+1			"

												In short, Mechs & Mercs delivers what it promises to.The combat missions play well, with the enemy keeping constante pressure. First mission is fairly simple with the tutorials explaining what to do, but it's not a walk in the park as the enemy is constantly getting new reinforcements.Cover system is an important part of the game. Units taking cover behind specific objects get a huge bonus. On the other hand, crossing some areas like bridges makes the units more vulnerable.Units have specialized roles that access special abilities and general upgrades (armor, speed, strength).The management part is very well done, adding an upper strategic layer to the game. New squads and mechs can be bought, as some upgrades to the mothership (these are very expensive, I have yet to see them).There's also more stuff to do in all the rooms. New messages arrive after each mission explaining what's goin on.Then there are the other factions that offer side missions. I don't have any of these special units yet, but they offer some interesting abilities from what I saw in the featurettes.I hope this game gets continuously updated, as I see great potential here.

												Let me get this straight: this is a great game as it is. But with some improvements, it can become legendary.It has a tactical depth much deeper than it seems. Units can't be used to grind the enemy like a typical RTS. They must be preserved and used wisely. The combat itself must be well planned or everyone will end up dead very quickly. This isn't a no-brainer strategy game. And that's why it's so satisfying.			"

												First of all, i'm a big mech genre fan. I literally grown up with Wargame & Mech Commander series finished them maybe dozen of times. So i was a bit more positive when i buy this game (i even buy on sale!) Lets see...+First of all mech-rts games are really few, i'm not talking about spam this mech or this mech-ish games, i'm talking about games with lots of customization & upgrade options. Mechs&Mercs has it and thats a big plus. (how i miss mechcommander...)+Also you can customize every single unit via skills and weapon selection tab. So your units shows difference with each other and you can get some sweet combos. (probably that's only good things this game had for now)Let's review negative sides,-I'm going to give graphics a mediocre, it's not bad but not good either. Animations however are terrible. Mech's walks animations are still haunting me in my dreams. -Game is kinda slow paced, especially if you got heavy squads and a big map just ready your supplies in real life, cause that mission gonna take looooong time in your life. -Unit's are somewhat unbalanced. I'm not expecting a recon will beat a heavy squad but they're melting way too fast. Also Mech's shield recharge rate is kinda useless. -There's no quick tab options in group selection, you need to manually click a squad then give your order which bored me a bit (for example retreat or reinforce)-Pathfinding is terrible! You may find some dumb'ss spread your inf. group and stay in few meters ahead of them or few people teabaging your mechs instead of firing in combat. -Fonts are terrible, if you want nostalgia's around 1990's then it's a good thing, otherwise it's really bad. For final words. It has potential but not there yet.			"

												The basis of the game is what prompted me to purchase it, as it looked like a good straight up Supply-style RTS. While it does have interesting components, there really is little that is innovative to the game and its held back by a great deal of grind and worse yet a sloppy response to the controls, where my soldiers often did not do as I told them, namely having an insistance on fighting on the bridge where they are most vunderable rather than cross that bridge. The AI was little to write home about as well, being very generic and predictable. The visuals and audio is decent but only for an indie type game. Ultimatly, it feels like an alpha of what the game could have been rather than being a complete game. Dissipointed and moving on.			"

												Engineers frequently just dont build what you told them to and just stand looking at the ghost of what they should be building.Troops wander aimlessly despite having being given orders to move into cover. Uses frustrating combat mechanics that dont seem to make any sense: apparently identical encounters can be won easily or be a total bloodbath, seemingly at random.Who's genius idea was it to make the second mission a desparate defence type? They need a slap.Mission variety is good. AFTER you are used to a staus quo. Complicating things whilst I'm still learning wtf all the buttons do is completely unnessisary.I'd give this game: EIrritated me very early on.Thrown in too deep too soon.No apparent logic to combat, possibly a symptom of not knowing wth is going on as being forced to react rather than respond.

												Decent squad based RTS mostly focused on infantry. There are mechs like the name says, but its mostly about the soldiers. Has a campaign and optional missions that can be done to earn more money and experience for the troops.It's not DOW but it's good enough for some hours of fun.			"

												Good squad based RTS game where a regiment of mercenaries battles against an invading army.Units have different professions, side factions can be turned into allies and there are mechs, which are pretty awesome. Could have been more though, mechs only show up in the 3rd or 4th mission.			"

												This is one of those games that looks really good, only when you play do you realize how much potential was wasted. I adore the warhammer 40k series and XCOM which are two of my favorite series. When I saw this game I though I might enjoy it for the strategy and persistent squad aspect. However, this game from what Ive found is a zergfest. If your infantry arent moving together its easy to lose squads. The enemies you face always seem to know where you are and have unlimited resources. With this taken into consideration if you try to move tactically and flank opponents you'll find that your units become over extended and are taken out which causes frustration.This game could have really been something with a couple tweaks, but it falls short. With all that taken into account, I find that this game isnt completely horrible. The cutscenes are great and the setting is awesome. Running a stranded merc company and fighting your way out inadvertantly winning back a sector for its people is a great plot. I cant really say anything about the characters, because from my experience they arent really fleshed out. This game is a fun zerg, but with the way the AI attacks it kills any strategy you could think of.I will say this, if you enjoy strategy games and this is on sale, get it, if not forget it.-Reghs			"

												Not the Best.Plays a bit like the old Mech Commander, and the UI & Gameplay belong in the same decade.I like the concept with units and understand the comparrison with XCOM, but they can die instantly and no chance to revive so if your not watching that part of the map you can loose your best squad without even knowing why. Light/Medium Infantry are nothing but cannon fodder. Heavy & Mech's make it a long slow game. Also no auto-save meant I lost 50% of my progress, and the game just isnt engaging enougth for me to want to re-invest that time.,			"

												I love mechs and I wanted to love this game, but it just seems to lack the ""it"" factor.I've played a ton of RTS games and this one feels the slowest of the lot. Part of that is the simple movement speed of the units, but part of it is that enemies are almost always waiting for you and entrenched in cover.The mechs are the most disappointing for me, they seemed to lack flair and they weren't cool enough. The one I had in the second mission moved as fast as a normal man and the firepower was quite limited. It took a fair bit of time just to kill one enemy soldier, let alone a unit.Overall I can't say I'm terribly impressed with the game. It's not terrible and I may pick it up again, but in my opinion it's not wonderful.			"

												I have NOT played this game very much, but here is a quick review of my first session.First impression is it's just so so so clunky and slow.So far it reminds me of playing through those first few missions of any RTS like starcraft or red alert stuff.  You're trying to grab helipad dropship checkpoint things to heal/resupply and little oil pumper things to earn command points to call down more of your stuff. You get your little group of infantry and go blow up things, have some floating female coordinator telling you random updates. But with only two unit types, infantry squads of 4-6 people and individual mechs. Each can have different loadouts or types.But much crappier.The squads are awkward to control. There is a decent cover system, stand near barrels or trees or whatever to get upgrade, stand on bridges or open areas to get defense nerfs. The units rarely work they way you want them to. Click to secure an area, they may go stand in the general area. If there are enemies involved good luck. They basically just do whatever they are going to do. Had to turn on a 'ignore enemy fire' and move option just to keep my guys from standing on bridges getting killed or engaging an enemy while they were 2 pixels away from cover. Clicking on the cover again often makes them move away from it or in other directions, not sure how the movement AI works.The minimap is horrendous. A small red trapezoid that is roughly related to the direction you are looking. (That is, click to position the trapezoid an entire step away from what you want to view). Minimap icons are not easy to follow. You can't zoom out nearly far enough to make sense of much of the battle. Everything is just SO SLOW. It feels like lag, but it's not, it's just the awkward movement of everything.Randomly throughout any mission 'enemy airstrikes' show up. So you have to quickly click around the crappy minimap and find each of your sqauds and move them a few feet each so they are not standing in the giant target. Easier said then done. Often in a group when I would try to move them, they would all wander weird directions because I clicked them into cover or whatever. I was playing a mission to secure three checkpoints, one checkpoint my dudes were just sitting around drinking iced tea in case anyone showed up, the airstrike was coming I asked them to move north. They moved a weird way instead because of some cover and were not just moving north so I clicked for them to move north again. Half of them walked right back the other directions in the middle of the target and were killed. Red Alert in the 90s or whatever had a 'scramble' hotkey. If this game does too it hasn't bothered to mention it during the tutorial/walkthrough. Units in modern and even older RTS games were super responsive and people talk about micro and CPM and stuff. Controlling units in this game is 90% of the difficulty so far. This is terribly implemented movement.The mechs are nice. Slow and clunky, but IN A PROPER WAY. Because they are giant multi-ton machines and they act like it. They pivot fast, shoot and kill what you want them to shoot and kill, and act very nice. That being said, they have shields/armor and just take linear damage through them until they catch on fire or whatever and eventually I assume blow up. Haven't lost one yet. Why is that? Because you can just sit them on a 'drop point' or helipad thing you get reinforcements on and spam 'heal' on them and they are magically healed. Same goes for infantry squads. Lose 5/6 of your guys in the squad? Go stand on the helipad and spam the heal button. They are resurrected instantly.Also, countdowns and numbers are meaningless. ""Dropship will be available in 100...99...98...""  98 somethings. 5-10 seconds later it has gone down a few numbers. Very slow. Then you have on the same exact screen a timer counting down for when the next civilian evacuation will take place. And it is clicking away a few times per second, until it hits 8 and all the sudden the announcement is made they are coming. The dropship countdown is super slow. I mentioned spamming repairs and resurrecting squad members on helipads, it takes so long to get a dropship in the early part of the game you have nothing better to spend your money on. Another good way to spend the cash is spam turrets or bunkers that your engineers can build. Not necessarily because you need them, but because they earn XP for building them and you have plenty of spare command points anyway.The infantry squads have a number above them, which is how many guys in the squad are still alive (then if you click each individual dude has his own health meter, for whatever that is worth. Civ and others reconciled this just by having a 'health bar' for the whole squad and as it dropped guys died from the group. I suppose this system is technically better, because having 6 wounded dudes firing is still providing higher firepower than having 2 dead guys and 4 perfect guys like the Civ system might fail to model. But one of the big UI problems with this is each time one of your guys dies he may go violently flying off in an explosion or whatever, or multiples of your guys die, etc. But the little number disappears for a bit and then reappears with the new number. So if you have two or three squads fighting, the health indicators are constantly flickering on and off as you see guys flying away in explosions and stuff. So its hard to really tell at any given point how quickly you are loosing men or where you are at with each squad in the middle of a fight.Upgrading squads and the tree paths are nice, a feature that improves ANY game. Love that kind of stuff, but it's fairly basic in this. It is hard at this point, so early in the game for me, to decide any noticeable difference in the paths of the trees. Units 'upgrade' between battles with the trees and you keep the squads together and choose their loadouts almost like a crappier XCOM hanger system but each guy represents six little dudes on the ground.Anyway I don't know. Buy it on a Steam sale someday or try it out for yourself. It's not a great game by any means, but it's not terrible. Clicking around with a souped up mech mowing down enemy infantry squads is very enjoyable. I'm not disappointed I bought it, even at that price because I want to support the genre and it makes a very solid attempt at bringing a good RTS with mechs style game to the table. The graphics are excellent for what it is, menus and between mission planning and upgrading and stuff is very well implemented. But it has a LOT of cons that make it tough to recommend. I am giving it a thumbs up because I would hate to downvote a game in the genre before giving it a fair shot. I've yet to work with multi-mech squads or later missions or upgrade things enough to say it is definitively bad. But so far it is not looking good.tl;drCrappy XCOM-meets-first-few-tutorial-levels-of-RTS-games"" with frustratingly awful to control units. But mechs are not bad and always a pro in any game.			"

			Views: 255		

			First try on Mechs and Mercs Black Talons. Disclaimer: I was provided with a review copy of the game. Get it on Steam : http://store.steampowered.com/app/273960/		

Mechs and Mercs is a RTS of the slower sort. It is not important to have impeccable micro management, but you need to do positioning of units really well. In other words: Heavy armored units counter everything. In terms of balancing this game is not that great, as many other reviewers have said already. And you get to feel that first hand in the fist mission when an enemy squad of heavy units plows through your medium armored units that are standing in heavy cover while the enemy is exposed out in the open.After beating your way through the first level you come back to your mothership and inevitably one or more squads have leveled up.The idea of having tech trees for your units is not that bad, but apart from being mostly boring ""+x% on y"" upgrades there is not that much to it. One thing that is really annoying is as well is that single points in upgrades can not be reverted, so you either put it in the right spot or do it all over again. The first time you get to customize your mech is not that bad. You have a good variety in terms of weapons and upgrades, but again the upgrades are just numbers with no visible impact. As you can see in the video, the combat is also quite interesting to say the least: The interaction radius on enemy units sometimes doesn't let you cross bridges, which leads to them getting slaughtered. By the way: All losses are permanent, but don't worry, you will get enough money to buy more squads in the black market. Another thing is that sometimes effects like ""suppression"" and ""crossfire"", which are crucial to win battles, don't trigger even though the enemy runs towards a turret or is surrounded by 3 squads.In terms of controls there is not that much to say apart from it working pretty well. One thing I'd like to add though is that on a multimonitor setup you are better off using W,A,S&D to scroll the screen since when you go too far to the left or wherever your next monitor is, the mouse goes out of the window. Luckily the game holds on that point and remembers it's state so that when you get back into it no time has passed.Speaking of time, the timers in this game are... aribtrary. I think that describes it pretty well. 90 time-units of wating for a dropship to be ready are not the same as 1.60 time-units of waiting for a contract to be ready. The thing with the contracts also boggles my mind... you have to stay on the missions screen in order for that timer to tick down... While you are at your mothership there are some things to do, so it would be good if that timer ticked down while I am doing other stuff.From a performance standpoint the game most of the time is done pretty well. In terms of optimisation there seem to be some problems, because my rig, being far superior than the recommended requirements, struggles to reach 60 fps. I'd love to hear other peoples' reports on that, but from my standpoint it is not really well optimised. The graphics are fairly okay though, there is not that much to complain about. The soundtrack is also relatively good, but in terms of sound design I have to say that putting voiceacting and sound effects in the same category is generally not a very good idea.This is especially true, when on the one hand there are sound effects that are so loud, even on the lowest settings, that they almost blew me off my chair the first time I've heard them. And on the other hand you hear things like objective updates and your units engaging in combat via voiceacting. That needs to be seperated or at least adjust the sound level of the sound effects to a level that no longer endagers my ability of hearing.At the end there is not really that much left to say for me... I could only recommend this game to the hardcore audience of the genre. For everyone else I cannot give a recommendation to this game.Edit 1: Fixed wording, spelling and linebreaks.			"

YouTube™ Video: Mechs & Mercs: Black Talons Review 

			Views: 2,698		

			Cosmic Reviews Mechs & Mercs: Black Talons, a Indie RTS sci fi game developed by Camel 101 studios. This game was provided free of charge for the purpose of critique.		

nstead of base building the game has landing pads throughout the maps on most missions. Once you have captured one you can use to it summon a new squad by spending power which is the only resource in the game. You can only summon a squad once every five or so minutes and you have a limited number of times you can summon, unlike the enemy AI which has an infinite number. Which begs the question, why even bother having a power resource when you can only summon a limited number of squads anyway. It also seems like having the enemy spawning unlimited squads is a very cheap and artificial way to create difficulty.The controls of the game aren't designed well and can be unresponsive. Sometimes commands are even ignored by troops. Both the controls and the UI are poorly designed and have some real issues both mechanically and aesthetically. The UI offers barely any feedback and icons on the screen are so small you can barely make out what they are. In fact the UI throughtout the game is dated and poorly designed, it feels like your looking at an 80's arcade screen on occasion.My core issue with the game is that it seems like the developers set out to make an RTS but forgot to put in the core fundamentals of the genre. One of the biggest issues of the game is balance. Take your light armor troops, they are utterly worthless in every respect. They cant do enough damage to take out a unit on their own and don't have enough defence to stand up for long in any fire fight. They die so quickly that even using them as cannon fodder is pointless. In fact the game is so unbalanced that the only units worth a damn are heavies and mechs. Heavies are the only units that can hit and get hit without dying in a few seconds flat. What it seems they tried to do is have a few classes to allow you to employ different tactics in battle but due to the balance it's done the opposite and thrown tactics out of the game.Again another major issue with the game is the fact that there's not much meat on the actual bones of combat. There's only really three main mechanics in battle, one being cover so get being cover to gain defence bonus. Two is that when crossing bridges you have a defence penalty and finally is crossfire that is simply two units attacking the same unit so the defending unit will be suppressed and receive a defence penalty. That's not exactly much to work with when your trying to create a tactics based game. Due to its slow paced nature it becomes even more of a problem because you don't have the complexity of games like company of heroes whose units for example could do a variety of things like go prone.The enemy AI is also non existent and is frequently stupid. All the enemy seems programmed to do is either sit in wait or actively go towards you on the battlefield no matter where you are. There is no patrolling or acting like real soldiers, just defend or follow. There was one instance that if you get your distance just right you can attack an enemy and they just stand there like nothing is happening. They don't fire back as your not in range and the fact they are taking damage completely eludes them so they don't bother to attack or move. There's even several experience exploits in the game due to both the problems with the AI and the mission design itself. On many of the side missions you can just place your troops near a enemy landing pad a keep picking them off until all your units are at max level. Map design is very important in RTS games and sadly once again mechs and mercs falls short in this department. Maps are not thought out they seem to be just thrown together. I was very surprised by this as level design can create difficulty and fun experiences when done correctly especially in a RTS focusing on squads. Its like trying to combine the gameplay of dawn of war 2 with the maps on command and conquer, it doesn't work. Level design needs to reflect and complement the game mechanics not just be a poorly textured canvass for your units to step on.I could go on and on about the games flaws and problems. Needless to say is a very sub par RTS, I can imagine the developers overreached, did not understand the complexities of the genre or wrote something that sounded good on paper but in practice failed. There really isn't any kind of redeeming feature for this game, it does nothing well, it has badly designed gameplay, a bad story and its just not worth your time in my opinion. Even big fans of RTS's should steer clear as I cannot see how you would find an enjoyable experience from this. I was really hoping for a decently solid RTS, I can forgive the poor textures, UI design and lackluster story but the mechanical failings and the poor game design overall, I cannot.			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Mechs & Mercs: Black Talons 

			Views: 226		

			Mechs & Mercs: Black Talons Proclaims to be an RTS but we shall see how much of that is true. The Game can be found on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/273960/ Join us at Twitter or...		

	Mechs & Mercs: Black Talons is a tactical strategy RTS.  The storyis simplistic, with most of it centering around going to different planetsto accomplish missions.  There isn't really anything leading you through thegame to make you feel connected, more like separate skirmish missions	You can buy different types of units through the mech dealer and mercenary dealer on your ship.  The design is focused more on the mercenaryfeel, but they sacrificed RTS elements by basing the squads on destructionrather than building bases and summoning troops element.  	You spend anywhere from 30-60 minutes per mission.  Overall I foundthis game to lack in balance.  It doesn't respect your time;  as a group ofmercenaries, you are fighting against an army.  There is no save during battle,and after putting all this time into the battle, the continuous flood of enemies can turn the tide so quickly that you can go from almost winning tocomplete loss in seconds.  The turrets that you have to use can be destroyed easily, and there is no option for repairing them.  	There is no advantage to playing as a mercenary;  the enemy hassuperior, neverending numbers, and you are given no tactical, tecnological,or weapons advantage.  There is no gaining or holding ground, as you are constantly having to retreat to heal up your troops.  	The maps all feel the same.  The interface is sloppy, not providingany information to the health status of the enemy troops.  Where you have four of one particular unit, the enemy will have 20, with more waiting in thewings.  I did not enjoy my time playing this.  I found it to be a giant waste of time.

												No checkpoints. Hidden objective about the engineers. Limited squads. Cover is so badly placed you fight in the open more often than not.Tutorial level was so frustrating I stopped playing. Maybe once they patch the game and tone down the unfair difficulty I might play it again. I was hoping for a mix of Dawn of War and Mech Commander. Instead I found out it's just a very unbalanced and unfair game.  Games should be fun, this one is not fun at all.			"

												This game is by far the worst recent game that I have played. I tried to get into it but their is nothing to like about it. The Strategy is basic with no flavor.I wouldn't even get this game if it was even free. Save your money and buy a different game.			"

												This game is awful.  I apparently bought it previously and only played 9 minutes of it.  I'm sure my brain simply burned those memories out because of how awful the game is.  Did I mention it was awful?  Just awful.			"

												Another RTS... another half-backed product...this seems to be the way to go for this specific genre lately...Let's get into it...The graphics are decent considering the price and i would like to highlight the good physics the game has.The sound does the job and i would even consider it above average considering it always sets the correct mood without ever annoying me or being in your face.When it comes to controls... there is nothing special here... if you are familiar with RTS controls. They could have done some improvements in this area considering you can not send units out via the mini-map. Unfortunately the units are not always responsive when trying to issue a get to cover command for multiple squads.The range indicator is off... it either shows the range incorrectly or the AI is not working properly.Speaking of the AI... there is some work here to be done, you can see what i mean in my first impressions video, basically the units don't always want to do what you want to do.. for no good reason.I can not speak of the AI as i didn't get deep into this tittle. Apparently there are some issues when it comes to unit balance according to comments/reviews on steam. Always do your research before making your mind-up about purchasing a product.Now.. i will recommend because i don't think it's as bad as people say...but with two IF's : 1) Wait for the dev to fix the issues the game has so far.2) Wait for a decent steam discount... maybe at least a 30% off.Other then that you can check out my first impressions video for a clearer view on the game

												This game is meh, so bland, its dull, its just another mundane cookie cutter rts game.  Take your standard small army or company sized force and move them across the map capturing resource points and drop zones.  The missions are so incredibly boring I didn't even know what they were, instead I was just trying to capture and kill everything on the map just to stay engaged long enough to see if things got better; spoiler they don't and its just a long ride on a rollercoaster that stays completely level.  The game includes a cover mechanic for your units, they recieve a bonus to damage resistance if they're in cover, they suffer if they aren't in cover/in the open.  Sounds cool, but cover never ♥♥♥♥ing works, except for the enemy, who gain super damage resistance, while my units seem to be hiding behind cardboard.  I always felt outclassed, that two of my heavy units going against one medium unit would lose, and that my now veteran squads are dead forever and all the progress I made with them is gone.  Now the latter is cool, squad progression, it makes each unit important, and you just don't want to throw them away.  However the enemy is stupid, but is apparently far better than any of my units, veteran statuses be damned.  I often would have to forgoe clever unit placement, and just send waves of soldiers at my opponent because that was the only way to kill an entrenched enemy squad.  Then there were the dropships, the way you gain reinforcements, the life line to your ship, and so ♥♥♥♥ing slow to have their timer reset its ridiculous. I may of called for reinforcements three times my playthrough, and often it was too little too late or the fighting was already over.  Now there are upgrades to reduce the cooldown for the dropship, if you want to spend your credits on that.  However if I capture four drop zones I should at least get more then one ♥♥♥♥ing dropship, I mean seriously I own this giant ship and all I get is one measely dropship?Basically the gameplay is boring, a little unbalanced, and kind of broken with some of the unit weapons/cover mechanics.   Story wise this game seemed to be rather interesting, playing as a mercenary, you're here to help and get paid, working alongside other factions to gain approval.  But the best part was having your own warship, it was very Starcraft II like in my opinion, which I loved.  You had your barracks, the cantina, the hangar, the engineering room, command center; all were places you could go and visit.  It was a nice little touch that I liked, made me feel like I was actually the leader of a mercenary unit that was super badass and not just in charge of some rag tag force made up of the bottom of the barrel.  There could be more added, I'd like to see some character interaction to be honest with you, but that might just be me trying to relieve my glory days playing Starcraft II.  I'd give this game a 4/10, the mechanics are broken, and the gameplay is just so dull and boring, not to mention the enviroments are as bland as the gameplay.  Just stay away, you can find plenty of better RTS' out there for less than this game.			"

												Cannon Fodder rebranded as a ""Mechwarrior"" game and sadly not one of the great games of that style of gameplay. They tried to implement a number of combat mechanics such as cover, crossfire and suppression but it just seems like they've not really thought it through fully.I'd recommend Dawn of War 2 or Tiny Soldiers (as a budget option) instead if you want a game like this.

												this game needs an update patch, AI to hard to many enemy units constant swawning uneven game play.  i like the concept, the in game graphics and units but when units take a beating and they do a lot in this game you need to get them all the way back to a dropship platform to get reinforcements fo the units. why not give your units a medic or if you capture an objective you can call in reinforecemnts from there. the basic infantry units are worthless they die to easy and all the gun enplacements i place just get destroyed so easily. it has the makings of a really good game but needs a better balance of play AI needs to be tuned down. then it will really be enjoyable to play. i stopped playing this game after scenario 3 where you have to capture 3 landing platforms and then hold them for 5 minutes. after i had captured all three i had 5 gun turrets at all 3 places plus at least 8 units at all 3 locations, thought i had killed all the enemy only to see 15 or 20 enemy units spawn out of nowhere to over run my main middle dropship pad. every unit was destroyed how fustrating after 3 tries i gave up game over. this is only one example of uneven game play.  i hope the company who makes this game reads these reviews and comes up with updates and patches and not let this game fall into the abyss.

												I do not recommend even trying this game.This may be an RTS but there's nothing fun, exciting or engaging with this game. There are strategic mechanics in the game that could have been better fleshed out. Gamplay is extremely slow paced and boring as units move at a snails pace. Combat is essentially a ""rock-paper-scissor"" where each unit is better at dealing with other units and you can put units in cover and get all sorts of other environmental buffs, but aside from that there's nothing engaging about the game. there's almost no strategy other than pick the right unit for the right job.Worse yet the game only has a single-player campaign and a ""survival"" mode which is basicly a hord mode, no skirmish modes that allow you to fight against ai or anything. The game is so slow and boring and i went in with an open mind, going through the tutorial level and leanring how the game worked. Sadly it's not that great. If anything, is a functional game, just not a very fun one.Command & Conquer 3: Kanes Wrath might be a better game for you if you're looking for a good futuristic RTS			"

												I can't find a save feature in this game. I played for a while and wanted to save and come back, didn't see that option. A little more balancing would help as well. Not a bad game but could have been better. I will come back and play some more.			"

												its bad i need to say.the fight are .. okay but the units only get XP by killing enemys and the techs by building. Mechs only seem to get xp by killing other mechs. so if you have one unit in the hot zone and all the other are just staying elsewhere chewing gum and plain Poker, they don't get anything from the missions, wich in find pretty bad. In X-Xom and some other games units who take part in a mission get some basic XP, so they don't stay behind later in the game.Bugs are existing and long after relese still not fixed (got no hope though):If you select a pilot for a mech you need to select him after a mission again, the pilot slots set tjemself to default every time, which is anoying.It doesn't mater which side you units are while in cover (in the side to the enemy so technicly without cover, or on the opposite so technicly in cover) they alway are seen to be in cover, even when tey are one mile away from it (okay more one meter to be precise)there are no snipers with would help giving support or clearing a path.There are no meds, so a unit dies it dies, there semm to be no healing beside getting new soldiers near the landingpadWhen the enemy i calling a bombarding via dropship, i get a voicemessage, and need to search where the attack comes down, when you need to secure a big location it happens more that 4-5 times that you lose squad stengh because the minimap doesn't ping the attacked location. in the normal map it is shown but not on the minimap so ... *sigh*at something that worms me in the first mission:You need to teka out the AA-Guns so the evac can commence. When the AAs are active, how are you supoosed to bring down men (with dropship[from orbit and within range of the guns]) to get the job done? well ... I don't care anymore.The game looked promising since i like Strategic games (with RPG elements) like X-Com, Xenonauts, Alien-Aftershock but lost hope quick in the first mission and in the second and the third. I can not reccomend this game, i hope you can see why.			"

												This was one of the most difficult experiences I have ever had in a game. Do you have any idea how infuriating it is to finally beat a mission, then to realize you can't open it again, starting the whole thing over, just because you had to look away from it  for a few seconds. And even if this had a little polish, it would still be mediocre. All because the developers forgot the ""strategy"" to real time strategy. I do admit, I am not a big fan of strategy games, but I am sure anyone who are fans will have a better time ripping this apart then me. If you're looking for a challenge then this is probably the game for you. I'm willing to bet you won't last one hour of this game.Full Review: https://ltwesth.squarespace.com/reviews/2015/1/25/mechs-mercs-black-talons "

												After playing this for a very short time I have a severe case of buyers remorse.  Combat is very poorly balanced and the first mission was so bland I doubt I will ever play this game again.  Heavy units trump everything, no need for any other unit except engineers to do quest items like unlocking bridges.  I am now making a firm commitment to never buy another release day game because of the trash that studios are pumping out nowadays.  I can't even say for sure what genre this game fits into.  Its seems like a mix of quite a few of which none are done well.  Graphics are weird, gameplay is weird, and the game just isn't any fun to play.			"

												Unresponsive controls, mini-map sometimes isn't oriented to the direction that the camera is facing. I often find myself ordering units to do the same thing a bunch of times and it ends up getting them killed when they don't respond. It seems fun, but really the difficulty comes from the interface and not necessarily the gameplay.			"

												The AI is badly broken, the sound system too, the graphics looks impressive, but that doesn't help the gameplay at all. The logic behind the unit movement - or even the unit FUNCTION - is at best abstract. A real ""tutorial"" could help with the basics if all the other aspect of the game were fixed. I'll wait for the next patch before try it again.			"

												As a person who doesn't know that much about the RTS genre (red alerts being the only ones I've played) this was on the quite okay level in terms of gameplay but it doesn't have the lasting impact that starcraft and red alerts give when you think about the world.


YouTube™ Video: Mechs & Mercs: Black Talons - A Quicky Look - First mission gameplay 

			Views: 2,601		

			Today in the Quicky Look we have an RTS from the dev Camel 101 Take a look at the first full mission of the game and see what you think about it. And do leave your thoughts in the comments as well.		

Although an other element of the game gives atleast some lasting effect on to the world and that is the persistant units that the game offers.Like in example xcom you grow attached to these soldiers and you want to keep them alive so that they could get promotions and just stay alive because they are you'r little babies who you want to nurse and shcool them through the horrors of the world.It is a little limited as  I dont think you can rename them and  only the squads leaders are of any importance to the game.They're underlings can die as many times as they damn well please for the glory of they're officer in charge.Gameplay consist of tacticaly moving through maps with a finite number of squads in you'r disposal.If they'r numbers dwindel you can refit them with fresh blood at certain points of the map and summon more squads if you need to, but they are also limited.Cover is also very important but getting specific units to cover can be a bit of an hassle unfortunately.If you are a beginner when it comes to RTS's the game is quite chllenging to say the least. Keep that in mind.Music is quite standard game music, butI'm alright with that and the graphics arent that bad,but I usualy dot care about that.All and all if you like RTS's but aren't scared of some rough edges, I'd say you would enjoy this.

												I honestly want to like this game...  a humble RTS, but there are so many frustrating items surrounding it; that playing it is a real grind. It is dissapointing the amount of Bugs that this title has. The two which pretty much break the game are: 1. At times your units will stand there and get slaughtered without returning fire and 2. The UI in the lower right hand of the screen will disappear -- meaning you can't interact with mission objectives, reinforce, order new troops etc. I honestly wanted to like this game... but there are so many frustrating items surrounding it that playing it is a real grind. Balance and difficulty are also factors which haven't been well considered in this title. Futhermore, in light of all these problems, that fact that you can't save mid-mission is a real kick in the teeth, esp. when a bug is encountered which makes completing a mission impossible.			"
