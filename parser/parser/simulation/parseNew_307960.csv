												If you're coming from War Thunder and think that this game is just like it, guess again. IL 2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad is a true flight simulator with realistic aerodynamics, wind, bullet trajectories, bullet velocities, engine management, etc. You don't necessarily need to be a pilot to be able to do things in this game, but it'll take you some time to understand some of the basic flight physics that are modeled into the game. However, that first lift off that you accomplish will feel like a real accomplishment, and that's what this game is about.Before I get into my review session, let me clarify why there are a lot of negative reviews for this game. I'm a founder, and bought the game while it was in early access. I then had the key transferred over to steam so that I could have all of my games in one place. When the game first came out, there was a lot of things lacking. The flight models still needed some work, and the grind to get camos and modifications was pretty hard. However, the studio has fixed the problems with the flight models for the most part, and they're very active within the community on their own forums.There are two versions of this game: the standard and the deluxe version. The only difference is that the deluxe version comes with two more planes: the Focke-Wulf 190 A3 and the La 5 series 8, and it also gives you all of the unlocks for the planes right off of the bat. Neither of these planes are the best of the best. I find that the skill level of the pilot is what decides who wins what engagement. I've had countless of battles with the FW 190 and the La 5 and still came out on top. The campaign in this game is pretty lackluster, but this is more of a multiplayer game, anyways. There are two parts: the initial part of the Battle of Stalingrad where the Germans are forcing their way in, and the second part where the Russians use a pincer maneuver to encircle the German forces. Within each part, there are three sections that chop the part up into smaller pieces to give a sense of advancement. You select a section which then brings you to a map. You select an airport where you want to start from. You have the option to choose either normal or expert mode and also whether you want the mission to be short or long. Normal mode is basically arcade mode. You don't have to worry about your engine management; the game will throttle itself for you and manage the radiators so you don't kill your engine in mid flight. You also have a HUD on your screen that shows you a map, gives you your indicated air speed and alitude, and marks everything friendly with a blue dot above it and anything enemy with a red dot. It also shows you how far out you are as well. In expert mode, everything is gone. You have to look at your gauges to see how high you are and how fast you're going. You have to look at your coolant temperature and oil temperature to keep from overheating your engine. If either ones gets too high or too low, you have to open or close your water and oil radiators. There are no markers that show where your enemy is, so you have to scan the sky for black dots or scan the ground for smoke trails that come from trains or tracers that come from artillery positions. The main difference between a short and long mission is that you have to take off and land on a long mission, while a short mission will start you up in the air pretty close to your target. You don't have to land on a short mission, but you have to fly through an ""exit point"" to clear the mission.Each plane has its own flight model that is very accurate. Each plane has different stall characteristics, engine management characteristics, etc. A good example is the Stuka. Its engine can't take sudden throttle changes, so if you cut the throttle really fast for a dive bombing run and then shove it back up when you go to climb, your engine will sputter and die. In the BF 109, if you run the throttle at 2600 RPM at 1.4 engine manifold pressure for over a minute, the engine will start to choke causing the plane to shake, sputter, and die.Damage models are pretty realistic as well. You can't shoot down a bomber from its six o' clock (why would you?) because the gunners will shoot you straight in the engine with their machinegun. Depending upon where it hits, you'll either have a critical oil system failure which will cause your windshield to get coated in oil and the engine to eventually die, you'll fly off safe and sound, and anything in between. When it comes to this game, one bullet in the right place is all it takes to take down a plane.The multiplayer is really what this game is about. Unfortunately, in America, I don't seem to be able to find many players playing on our servers. Instead, I have to go to European servers to play with people. However, I don't experience any lag or rubber banding.There is another game that is coming out soon in March called IL 2 Sturmovik: Battle of Moscow. Like this game, it's centered around one specific battle. The Battle of Moscow occurred earlier than the Battle of Stalingrad, so you'll be flying earlier versions of the aircraft such as the BF 109F2, I-16, BF 110, MiG 3, etc.			"

												Even though 1C GS claims BoS to be ""The next generation of the legendary IL-2 Sturmovik series"", the game has very little to offer for its hefty 50€ price tag.In every aspect that the game seems to have something good going for it, the flaws set it back atleast two steps and severely hamper an enjoyable experience.The focus on a single, major event of the war had promise for an immersive, story-driven campaign, but instead, the game is broken into five chapters of the same copy-pasted, ""random"" generated quick missions, of which there are five to choose from (Intercept, Escort, Ground Attack, Ground Support and Bombing).These chapters all include a short intro cinematic, giving you a brief history lesson by recapping the most crucial moments of any operation or such at the time, but these are rather easily forgotten because everything is thrown at you in the 30 or so seconds these clips last.But in the end, you'll just be flying the same missions, over and over again, while the tactical map looks a bit different each chapter.Even worse is that since the campaign has nothing to offer on top of what the other gamemodes already don't (Quick mission builder and pre-made missions, no difference to the campaign), in a desperate attempt to draw you in or give you some sense of accomplishment, they opted for unlocks.Yes, you actually have to grind the same scenarios over and over again in order to use some of the available weapons or mods, some of which were even the standard factory setup for the planes. Not very... simulationy.. is it?This is excellent way of 1C telling you that they did not have anything to offer for a proper campaign, and instead force you to take the free-to-play design of slow grind for small progress.With that said, the campaign atleast works in its own way and AI behavior is not outright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, although your flight will often take the route of attacking a bomber directly from behind, and you'll most likely be dive-racing PE-2's at +600km/h in order to even have a chance to shoot them down.Other gamemodes are similar to the campaign, though quick mission builder allows for more customization. Do note that you cannot ""grind your unlocks"" in any mode except campaign.Plane selection is pretty much what you'd expect from such a title, Luftwaffe sports the ever-iconic Bf 109's, models F-4 and G-2, the Ju-87 ""Stuka"" divebomber, He-111 medium bomber. Soviet airforce has the less enticing selection consisting of the LaGG-3 and Yak-1 fighters, iconic IL-2 Sturmovik ground attacker and Pe-2 light bomber.Both sides also have a special DLC fighter plane available, Fw 190 A-3 for the Luftwaffe and La-5 series 8 for the Soviets. And no, the premium DLC planes do not come fully unlocked, you still have to ""grind the unlocks"".Each plane has it's unique characteristics; the 109's are fast and easy to handle, with cockpit layouts simple enough to learn fast, while the LaGG-3 is a tumbling mess, most dedicated into driving you to the ground while you try to make sense of the gauges, with the Yak staying far more competetive with the superior German fighters.The Stuka and Sturmovik attack planes are both slow and steady, with very different methods of attack. The Stuka will mostly dive from above with its nose pointed almost directly down to bomb accurately, only airbrakes to slow the descent, while the IL-2 will attack almost level with rockets, bombs and big cannons for widespread destruction.The bombers fly level, and bomb, when they're not just for target practice. Really, what else is there to say?Commenting on flight or damage models is the hardest thing, but while the planes fly and get shot down like planes do (I guess), one can definitely say a lot of the arcade-like simplicity the mechanics and maintaining have.All of the planes do their start-up routine with a push of a single button, with crucial actions remaining automated, or optionally, under manual control in a very simple way. This takes away a lot from the potential immersion, with ""detailed aircraft systems modeling"" being mostly text on the screen and few animations.Multiplayer works well, with no larger bugs around, although the lack of servers and even the amount of max players per server is disappointing.While the gameplay is definitely lacking, is there anything the AV department can salvage?BoS does have decent lighting to complement the snow-covered potato fields and the clouds aren't low-resolution mush, gun and engine sounds are enjoyably powerful with models representing accurately their real-life counterparts.But besides that, what can a game of such limited sensual experience give?Sadly, this is again where the game falls short. Planes otherwise being well-detailed, their textures are low resolution, with blurry and blocky normal maps reflecting the sun off your wing in a gringeworthy glare, and jagged, low resolution shadow maps looking like they're about to cut your cockpit into half as they pass.Sounds are incredibly bugged as well, with sound latency up to the level of you hearing your gunfire hits on the enemy plane, and it being impossible to hear your plane being hit.Despite the seemingly low amount of graphical detail at any given time, the game has issues with low framerates, suttering and overall poor performance even on a modern, mid-end PC (i5-4690k, R9 270).This is most likely due to the ancient DirectX 9 renderer the game uses, and very limited graphical customization, being limited to resolution, four presets of Low, Balanced, High and Ultra, with an added MSAA option.Not even the v-sync is properly implemented with triple-buffering, so you'll most likely have to choose between massive tearing, or being locked to 30FPS on the slightest framedrop.After all this, who is this game really for?With its simplified systems and gameplay, I wouldn't recommend it for people looking for the most authentic simulation experience, it offers too little for the price.But the same thing is true for the more casual player or enthusiast, it offers too little for the price and there are games out there that do most of what BoS offers, better and for less.I can't help but feel this game was released crippled and is simply trying to ride the IL-2 name to simply break even. There's potential to this, but as it is currently, I can't recommend it to anyone.Rating: 5/10 at the time this is written. Mostly for the working multiplayer, although many of the issues creep into there as well.			"

												Written in December 2014, the game is in contant development and I expect it to be geting only better. *Year after this was written, I'm adding some comments to keep it up to date*I wanted to start by saying it's unpolished gem, but it's not. It's a highly polished gem, fitted into cheap mass produced jevelry and wrapped in gift bag bough on discount last January. If you want realistic flying experience, don't miss it. If you want to treat yourself seriously as a simmer, you may find out-of-cockpit parts of game not dignified enough *Still mostly true, although quality of jewelry is much better*.The good: The sim part (simulating planes and their enviroment) is very good - the game is great stick and rudder experience, the planes have mass and inertia, when flying them on the edge of flight envelope you feel them sliding from course, rather than being pushed to the side along set vector with randomized shaking added. The AI planes use the same physics as player, so they don't take breaks from reality and pretend they are jets when pressed to hard. Par the course, some people find flight models unrealistic or simply not what they expected. There are no clickable cockpits like in CloD or DCS, but after automated engine start you get to control most of plane systems (IMHO the biggest missing part is no manual fuel tank selection). To me it has the best feeling of ""being there"" of all WW2 planes, but I'm stick and rudder fetishist, not clickable cockpit fetishist. There are no stability problems, unfinished plane systems of weird flight behaviour.The bad: There are ten flyable plane types in the game (*Battle of Moscow will bring ten more, five already done, that BoS owners can meet in air even without owning BoM*). More are in the works, but because of sim part being detailed like I said above, making new planes is slow process. Do not expect to see tens of flyables soon, or variants of the same model (like all Bf-109F variants) made by small modifications of existing plane. There are *no* AI-only planes (one *has been made since review was written*) because, as they use realistic flight physics, they are not easy to make, either. You won't see tens upon tens of computer-controled planes in misisons, either, they are to CPU-hungry for that. The number of players in MP missions is limited (*much less now than year ago*) , devs still work on optimising support of more players in mission as I write. The single player part, or campaign, is something in between proper career from IL-2:1946 and mission generator - you pick stage of the battle, airfield you take off from, plane, mission type (intercept, escort, ground attack, bombing, close air support) and off you go. Missions are generated randomly with variety of weathers and targets, but they aren't as immersive as real career missions - maybe because you get no background on what your target is and why it's important beyond ""go and bomb that bridge"". There are difficulty settings in game, but in campaign you can use only two presets, normal (icons and automated engine management) and expert (realistic). Instead of adjusting realism settings before mission, you disable unrealistic aids in flight by key command (say, I bound a key that turns all engine helpers off and hit it at start of each mission, to fly with manual engine management but icons on). *The third party PWCG, a full blown career generator, is coming and already playable*.The mission editor is quite complicated so there isn't flood of user-made content and multiplayer servers - but what community made so far was of very good quality. The ugly: The most hated part, which caused many people to give up the game as arcade: the plane modifications (bombs for fighters, bigger cannons, armoured windscreens etc) are unlockable - you get them by flying the plane in question in single player campaign. Most of these mods are non-standard, experimantal, or one-off modifications, but few are standard-issue systems that you can't accss from the start. *Owners of Premium edition - all 10 planes - can now disable the dreaded unlocks with one mouse click*. Also, the campaign includes game elements like experience and player ""level"" (the higher it is, the more dangerous becomes opposition and flak fire in campaign. I suppose it is meant to make game easy for new sim players and progress as they succeed and learn). Then, you can start the mission in the air, half way towards the target, and abort it on reaxching ""exit"" waypoint - takeoff and landing are optional - and on lower player levels thare is little action outside target area. So the first impression is that missions consist of going to action point, doing your job, going back. It's not the case, but you have to bother playing through simpler missions to make things more interesting. These are pointless additions to otherwise purebreed sim, and many people can't get past it - some play multiplayer only and don't want to play campaign at all, some call it pointless grinding, some are so experienced they want difficult missions from the start and give campign up as to easy before they rise their pilot level and get to difficult stuff. Make no mistake, once you sit in the cockpit you get a proper sim experience, and once you get your unlocks and rise level to get interesting missions you just have a good mission generator to play with forever, no limits - but the awards that are supposed to motivate players to play are something out of console game.There are smaller bad decisions, like locking most of graphics options to four preset settings - you don't get to set manually drawing distance for objects or super sampling, you choose high, low, medium, ultra setting and that's it. You have manual control of resolution and antialiasing, though. It made some sense in development, but is pointless now * and has been made more workable with more options to customise your settings some time after review was written*.All these are *were* pointless design decisions that nobody i know likes, but the developers stay by them *until they fixed them*. This stubborness earned them lot of enemity and made many people abandon the game *still true*, but I have to say dev team is very cooperative with community in most other respects, adding elements requested by players and listening to suggestions of flight model changes. There was some rush to release the game on deadline, so maybe they will replace it with something better once team catches they breath *they did*. Or not. *Or they add option to drive tanks*.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been playing this sim since about five months ago via early access so what I will say here is really only based on that experience and not with the final product, if it is possible to edit/update my review once the final release occurs in September, I will be sure to do so.  1.) first impressions.   The menu/UI is slick and easy to work with, not a lot of fussing about is required to do anything at all and it is quick to get from your desktop to the cockpit. The overall menu presentation is pretty nice as well with the hanger containing your aircraft (the last one you flew with), this is not unlike 777's previous sim Rise of flight with it's museum backdrop with your aircraft in it.   Setting up controls was pretty straightforward and will be easy for anyone with any exprience in simulations previously or even War thunder, in fact, it shares some interesting ideas in terms of control binding with War thunder (in a good way).  Setting up the visual options is pretty basic with presets, I am not sure if this is going to be a permanent thing and sadly I suspect this will be something that really gets hit hard from those that are arbitrarily judging games based on the video options (due to some influence from certain youtube personalities).   2.) The visuals.   Visually this sim is stunning, the snowy backdrop may not be the most colorful or feature rich but it looks very impressive, easily giving you a sense of immersion, you will almost feel like you need a hot cup of coffee after flying your first sortie, it really does give the impression of winter very well.  The terrain itself is very highly detailed despite it's rather sparse nature, the snow is not just a flat texture but instead gives the impression of varying depths and snowbacks.  The Sky is very nice, the lighting helps sell the winter setting with a bright, cool sunlight that you would expect from that season, the cloud effects are probably the best I have ever seen in a sim with amazing effects as you fly through them, it really gives the whole thing a dramatic feeling when you set the flight time to early dawn or dusk as the colors get very beautiful.  The aircraft models are fantastic, they are detailed and well animated with rather impressive texture work, including a really nice reflection effect off the metal (this highlights very well that some aircraft were not entirely metal but instead had some fabric or wood parts). Additionally, the damage effects are great, the billowing smoke when you cause a fire is the most convincing I have seen in a sim and the fire effects are second to none at this point.  3.) Gameplay.  Like Rise of flight before it, IL-2: Battle of Stalingrad is a survey sim first and foremost, it is not trying to be DCS WWII or anything like that, nor is it trying to be very arcade like War thunder or Birds of prey, it's realism is found in it's flight models, weapon strength and damage models but like Rise of flight, you don't have a clickable cockpit or anything like that.  One thing to note very clearly however, you still need to manage your engine and it's cooling systems, these controls are not handled with your mouse in the cockpit but instead you bind these controls to your flight stick/throttle so you can easily access and manage them in combat. Additionally, the methods you use to manage your engine/cooling are realistic, you need to understand your aircraft's limits before you hop in the cockpit or else you will be blowing engines all over the place due to neglect.  The combat is the real star of the show (as it should be in a WWII air combat sim), the action feels fast, brutal and visceral, this is punctuated by the brutally effective weapons at your disposal, you will be knocking down aircraft pretty quickly due to the way these planes were armed (usually with a cannon through the nose cone and two machine guns on top of the nose), it will only take a few bursts to utterly trash a opponents aircraft.  One final note on gameplay, the feeling of flight (as I mentioned before) is something really special here, the sound, the control responses and the visuals all combine to really sell you the idea that you are flying in a aircraft, it just feels right in a way that is difficult to describe.   4.) The game modes.  This is a spot that will expand greatly as the game reaches completion, as it stands, you only have quick battle mode and some pretty limited online modes to choose from, this is understandable since these servers really only exist for testing and not for varied gameplay.  Once the mission editor is made available publicly (something that will happen despite what some have said on the forums), there will be a great deal more available for both single and multiplayer gamers.  The campaign mode is not yet implemented but it is probably coming soon to early access in some form or another, if it is like they describe, it will offer a good, historical experience that will span specific phases of the Battle of Stalingrad in a realistic way.  5.) Final thoughts.  I can understand the feelings that some may have when they visit the store-page and see the price and the ""DLC"" but it is important to note that in the flight simulation market, this price is indeed not only fair but very much business as usual, the seemingly high price comes from the fact that flight simulations are a extremely niche genre with a relatively small built in user-base, this is why IL-2: Battle of Stalingrad is not price the same as you might find from a more mainstream genre game, it is the only way that they can make enough money to justify the continued work on it.  As far as the ""DLC"" goes, it was made clear on the forums by the dev's some time ago that the extra planes were added as a fun extra for those willing to get the premium edition, they were not ""removed"" from the main game at all since they did not even serve in the Battle of Stalingrad anyway. More to the point, they are not ""Pay to win"" since they are not really the best aircraft anyway.  Those that are complaining about the extra planes should keep in mind that they were never really part of the main game anyway, they were simply a extra for the premium buyers, they are not objectively better, they are not ""pay to win"" they are just like any other premium edition of a game with extra content.   As a flight sim enthusiast first and foremost, I can happily say that this sim brings back a lot of the fun that one could find in IL-2 1946 while still offering a experience deep enough to keep DCS players intrigued.  If you like flight sims, if you like interesting multiplayer opportunities or even just the Eastern front air war in general, this is a great sim that will give you hours of fun.			"

												IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad is a World War Two era flight simulator. In IL-2 Sturmovik: BoS you take control of WWII planes from both the Russian side and the German side of the fighting that took place during the Battle of Stalingrad. You pilot these aircraft on missions ranging from intercepting enemy bombers to taking out artillery or even war trains.IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad excels at being a great simulation, sadly it fails at being an enjoyable game for the most part so I would suggest only getting this if you're serious about flight sims. Before I get started I'd just like to point out I played this entirely with a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro flightstick, the controls are pretty complex and planes are difficult to handle even with a flightstick so if you're a KB&M only player you might want to think about getting a flightstick to play this.IL-2 Sturmovik: BoS is certainly a game which has mixed reviews on the store page but, despite it's issues, I enjoyed playing it and at the end of the day that's what matters. +Gorgeous graphics, even on medium settings everything looks great+Excellent aircraft models+Fantastic, realistic physics and fully customisable realism settings though even on relatively low realism settings the physics still feel real+Great and importantly accurate plane damage models+Has a campaign mode, pre-made missions, quick missions/free flight and multiplayer+All of the aircraft feel very responsive+A good mix of fighter aircraft and heavy bombers, not that that's difficult with so few aircraft but more on that later+Simple UI +Very large maps+Great sound effects+The devs are currently working on Summer and Autumn maps which is exciting as the game currently only has Winter maps-Only eight aircraft (excluding the two DLC planes) which really isn't good enough for a flight sim-Unlocking anything requires grinding in the campaign mode. Having to grind to unlock skins and weapons in a simulation game is bad enough but the fact that you can only unlock things through the campaign is rather disappointing for those who have no interest in playing the campaign, let alone grind the campaign missions, such as myself-They've already released DLC which I think is unacceptable for an Early Access game and such an expensive one at that (just for the record I own the Deluxe edition which comes with the DLC)-I experienced quite a few issues with freezing and crashing during loading screens-Not many graphics options Verdict:7A solid WWII flight simulator with gorgeous graphics and great realism that is let down by its lack of planes and all of the grinding to unlock things. If you can look past the lack of aircraft and all of the grinding or you're simply looking for a WWII flight sim then I recommend picking this up.***This review was written using a Deluxe Edition key provided by the Publisher for review purposes***El K.

Early Access Review
								Excellent.Even at this stage of early access the sim is highly polished and very impressive. The planes themselves feel very faithfully modelled, both visually (particularly the damage modelling) and in terms of flight characteristics. The narrower selection of planes means that each has been finished to a very high standard, although the developers have already made some suggestions about planes being added following release.At the moment there are 10 planes scheduled for release, with only one (the HE-111 medium bomber) not yet added. The Soviets get the much-loved but definitely disadvantaged Lagg, the Yak-1, the Pe-2 and the IL-2. The Luftwaffe have the 109 F4, 109 ♥♥♥♥s well as the Stuka and the Heinkel. In addition to the 8 basic aircraft there are two additional ""premium"" aircraft (the FW 190 and the LA 5). These extra two aircraft can be purchased either in the premium version, or by waiting until launch and buying them individually. The visual effects are obviously excellent and the sound is generally very good, although a few effects appear to be missing (eg some hit sounds on your own airraft), but that can probably be put down to the game still being in early access.The AI is also very impressive and provides a very challenging opponent without resorting to any cheating: the AI follows the same rules as the player, has his vision constrained by the cockpit and controls his plane via control inputs as well. I've occasionally forgotten that I was fighting the computer rather than players online. AI gunners also man the gunnery positions in the Heinkel, Pe-2, the Ju-87 and IL-2, however they can also be manned by other human players. Gunnery stations in each of the planes that have them are fully modelled from a first-person pov.The multiplayer is also very fun, even at this early stage where it appears to be a basic team deathmatch placeholder. Servers offer two difficulty settings; Normal (icons, automatic engine management, navigation assists) and Expert (no icons, manual engine management and navigation).EDIT: From reading the community page, a lot of people seem concerned that the La-5 and FW-190 premium aircraft are some sort of pay-to-win issue. They're intended for enthusiasts as neither played a significant part in the Battle of Stalingrad itself, and neither are the highest performing aircraft on either side: multiplayer is still largely a contest between the Yak-1 and the 109s.

												I don't write reviews, I don't like to waste the time, unles... it's deserved.People who have complained about this game are generally the type to complain about everything. Sure, the AI is off but can you make a human AI moving in all 4 dimensions while also paying attention to relative physics and analyzing and thinking ahead to their next move? Yes, but not at this level. To make an AI like that is hard; expectations are too high if you think otherwise. Also, this game is mostly about playing online, just like every other game. There are dynamic servers that create fronts that change based on team progress, etc.The game, a true sim. Damage model is exceptional, HE rounds explode, AP rounds pierce, fragments fly off the plane and can hit yours if you're too close. Good bullet drop rates, considers grain and powder, doesn't disappear after x distance. Planes handle well, you can feel their weight; you need to consider the weight of ordinance and fuel vs power/lift. True considerations. Engine management is critical; you must be considerate of RPM, manifold pressure, oil/water temp, drag from cowls (+/-30kmph can make a huge difference), prop pitch, supercharger gearing, mixture ratio, fuel amount... If you like games where you just feel neurotic running around shooting people, this isn't for you. If you are more an engineer type, where you like to adjust settings, dial in values, problem solve, and then profit, then there is no turning back. There is a huge element of excitement though, and it requires cunning and planning, like chess. Long fights where it  takes 3 minutes of flying while holding onto your kinetic energy to set up a shot, so rewarding. To pepper the wing, and see it destablize and vibrate then rip off is so rewarding. On the recieving end, to have your rudder or elevator peppered, with minimal stick you can make it home; sometimes that alone is the victory.This is easily the best game I have ever played. To enjoy it you need to have patience,, foresight, and a maturity that understands that you are not the God of war. You are not the God of flight. If you're lucky, you will live. I rate this game: existential paralysis/10			"

												My background/qualification for writing a review: I grew up playing flight sims in their early days, with Jane's Simulations such as US Navy Fighters 1997, the Jane's WWII sim, Microsoft Combat Flight Sims 1-3, 2 being my favorite, and the IL-2 series in the very beginning, up through Forgotten Battles. After that my PC got too outdated to handle anything, I moved on, years later became a man, and now I have an income so I return to the world of PC gaming and flight sims. Now I am a huge fan of Rise of Flight, DCS, and others.If you're in to the flight sim genre, then you probably already own this title, so I will cater the following to those who might have an itch to get in to games like this or who maybe have been pondering getting this for a while.First things first, this game was created to be used with TrackIR. I am not saying you can't get by with a button assigned looking aprroach, but this game was intended to be used with a head tracking system, plain and simple. It is also intended to be used with a joystick, if you aren't sure about that, go out and buy a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, it's not expensive, it works fine, and it will allow you to enjoy this and other titles the way they should be enjoyed.Okay so the game. To be frank, it's fantastic. The sense of immersion is unparalled, I've never felt more like I was really there than in this game. That being said it allows you to tailor the experience to you pretty well, you can play with plane icons, navigation icons, fully automated engine management, or you can go full real and have to hunt down your targets with your eyes and some cunning and instinct.The visuals, should you have the PC to run Ultra settings, are great. The clouds and weather are convincing and effect combat, the textures, especially on the planes, are superb. The attention to detail in visualising the damage on your plane is amazing. One particular thing I enjoy is the effect of the sun glare. You really get a sense of how the sun effects your awareness in combat, and you can use it effectively to make attacks on enemies who can't see you coming, and it can be a pain in your side trying to spot an incoming target. I am a real life pilot of varying aircraft, and this sun glare really captures what it feels like. (and you wonder why aviator sunglasses are a thing...)The sound design is once again superb, the wind sounds under high G, or hanging your head out of the open canopy, the sound of your bullets hitting the plane you are shooting at, and the speed of sound delay in ground explosions, is a level of detail that is often overlooked, but one that is really appreciated by me. Overall the thing IL-2 has going for it the most is a clinical attention to detail. The developers of this have spared no aspect of these aircraft in modeling and programming. The flight model of each aircraft is from my experience, spot on, and the damage model is matched with Rise of Flight in being the best I've seen.The multiplayer experience is, well let's say it has a steep learning curve at times. There are a lot of experienced sim pilots with really nice hardware flying out there, but once you find yourself having a victory, it is unbelievably satisfying, not to mention your heart is jumpinig out of your chest. I recently chased a flight of three Bf-109s in a Lagg-3, stalking them from their blind spot (behind and slightly below) for something like 15 minutes until I had just the right moment to strike, taking out two of them and high-tailing it back to base before the third could find me.As with all sims, yes, there are improvements to be made. I wasn't a fan of the unlock system through campaign mode at first, but I've grown to appreciate it. It has made me spend serious time learning and understanding each aircraft. Sometimes the game crashes with no warning, but this is rare. But the good news is the community support and the developer support is really one of the best out there. This review was somewhat long winded, but I hope anyone who reads who is on the fence will give it a shot. But please if you do, be patient, there is a lot of learning and skill involved in a flight sim game like this, it takes serious thought and a sliver of dedication to fully appreciate, but once you get there it can be some of the most fun you've had as a PC pilot.~Aeronaut "

												NOTE: MOST NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE DUE TO THE UNLOCKS , WHICH DOES NOT APPLY ANYMORE ALSO SOME PEOPLE DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THIS THIS A SIMULATOR, NOT AN ARCADE GAMEWe are living in the GOLDEN AGE of simulation , again with this simulation. Do not be fooled by the negative reviews. This sim is CONSTANTLY evolving in the BEST way.The true successor of Oleg Maddox IL2 1946What I love the most is the immersion, It is really like we are in a real plane (I am a real life pilot)The impression of speed is much better than the old IL2And above all , The dev team is really willing to make this sim a very good one, in the old IL2 spirit and even better.Their passion about warbids, their dedication .Recently some good changes in the direction have been made and they are listening the community a lot!Proof:, among many thing, the community wanted a flyable Junkers 52...The dev team has listen it and it will be available now! (in the official website). Also there are no more unlock.Patch after patch, they are improving this sim. They Implemented DX11 which  makes a HUGE performance boost!I really love this simulator, many pilots in servers!			"

												Is it worth it ?Yes, certainlyWhy is it getting such bad reviews ?Well, to be frank, the devs didn't really listen to the community back in the Early Access state, and introduced a ''UNLOCK'' system, wich is very very VERY bad for a SIMULATION game...It's a great game otherwise, nice graphics, the plane models are great, nice details...MP is nice as well, and it's gonna be even better with the release of the SKIN VIEWER and the ADVANCED MISSION BUILDER.

												I didn't like the sounds of what many sim enthusiasts were saying about the game but I bought it anyway. Soooo glad I did. The XP system is a non-issue for me, just playing it unlocks add-ons quick enough and they are not necessary to play well or enjoy the game, the graphics are amazing and run like a dream on my 4k monitor (running at 2560x1440) and I feel like the sensation of flying way better than most aircraft in FSX ever felt and remind me of some of the excitement of real flying (I've not flown for a couple of years).The hint iconography that some consider arcadey is even less of an issue. Don't like it, turn it off. It is a boon for newcomers though and we do need newcomers to the genre.The game may seem expensive for those that compare it to older games but his isn't just an update to an old superseded engine. This is a modern game with a definite focus on quality over quantity. I think most simmers will appreciate that, Whats the point of having 30 planes if they are almost the same except for the skin? How many can you really fly well (unless they fly the same and therefore pointless)?There isn't a lot for people that just want to play single player with little in the way of variety (at least for experienced players) but to me that's true of almost any single player game. Online with a group of like minded people is where it is at.I am impressed with BoS. The core components as a flight simulator are just fantastic even if there aren't tons of frills. In the end if we want a good WW2 sim there only a couple of options. One won't be ready for some time and the others didn't impress me. Especially ""free"" games that get very expensive if you want to be competitive. BoS is definitely not pay-to-win.			"

												With nearly 5000 hrs on Cliff of Dover and 1500hrs with Il2 BOS/BOM, I believe that I can say that BOS/BOM is a fantastic flight sim and is as good as CLOD if not better overall. The sense of immersion in the game is such that you actually feel that you are in the middle of the Russian winter fighting for your life.  The sim allows you to fly either Luftwaffe or Russian aircraft of that period, however, there are those out there who give negative reviews having only played on one or two aircraft types.  Recently the devs have unlocked all of the weapons and skins so you can do what you want from the beginning and feel like you are getting your bang for buck right away, so that is certainly money worth spent.  This flight sim is like having a kid, in that in the beginning  you are unsure what to do, but with little time and effort everything falls into place and you have a beautiful relationship.  I was going to compare it to my marriage, but I see less of my Wife now playing this than I did before I got into Il2 sims.  Therefore,  if you have a partner or a Wife and you need a distraction, get this sim.  They will love you for it!!However, joking aside, don't expect to jump into this sim and become an ace in a day.  Get online, join on the Teamspeak and join a flight sim community that is willing to help and assist as you will have true friends online that you don't have to send birthdays cards to, but will always be covering your 6.  RegardsHaza			"

												Take it from a retired real-life combat pilot and flight sim fan of 20 years, this is hands down the most authentic flight sim I have ever had the privilage of playing. Well done, devs well done!!!Graphics- Top notch, I can't overemphasise the accurate sense of speed this sim portrays. My jaw hit the floor when I would use the camera fly bys. They nailed it!Sound- really really good emulation.gamplay- just started playing and was too focused and immersed on just flying around but from what I have seen the potential for a great game is there. The little touches like realistic ground terrains that are fully physically modeled. I mean if you go off the taxiway into the dirt you are screwed. Very impressed by this detail.I really hope thy add on VR support.			"

												A truly excellent flight sim that I have just upgraded to premium as new user content has now become available. I am seriously loving this game and with Ciffs of dover, DCS, and rise of flight all on my computer can just not tear myself away from how much I enjoy the feeling of flying and fighting with these planes.Game's future is dependent upon the support of the community, so please think twice before shooting us all in the foot by slamming this game, as what the game lacks now it will very possibly have in the future, as long as the devs are not in the meantime driven out of business by all the negative reviews. Flight sims are not built in a day!			"

								I highly recommend this Flight Sim, it is however not for the faint of heart, and you defiantly need a joystick. Advanced flight models, each plane has its quirks. The graphics for a DX9 games is basically the best and if not better than DX11.If the price scares you just get the lower end and when they come out with a sale in about 3 to 4 weeks you can pick up the other planes.

												Most of the reviews are of people who aren't willing to learn. I started out on the game with an Xbox controller, and it was impossible. I decided to invest 30$ into a Logitech 3D joystick, and ever since then I have never looked back. The game is great! Just make sure you have a joystick of some sorts and are willing to take 2-3 days to learn the game.			"

								If you search for a WW2 Flighsimulation which focuses on the combat and flying aspect with reasonable plane systems depth then this is the one to go with.The flightmodel is great and each plane behaves completely different and believable.The damagemodel includes all different kinds of parts flying off your plane while beeing shot at - even by wind resistance when a  part of your plane is already weakend.Its still in development but supersedes most flightsims which were released years ago already.Highly recommended! - imho.

												-Join multiplayer server, spot German bombers firing their turrets at friendlies in an aerobatic zone.-Commence attack with two wingmen joining in.-One wingman shot down, after damaging one of the bombers-I take fire during the intercept, but manage to take out the bombers left engine, he begins a spiral toward the earth-Heading to engage the other bomber, I notice my aircraft is rolling to the left. Crosswind, I think...-Looking out the window, I notice my left aileron is gone, and the wing is full of holes-I continue to intercept the last bomber, hoping I have enough ammo left. 1km and closing...-At 500 meters, I pull the trigger, and.... nothing. Guns were damaged during the last run.-The bombers turrets put holes in my fuselage, oil explodes from the engine and covers the windscreen-I descend with full flaps, hoping for a soft landing in the crop fields below...What a great game, if you love flight sims this is a no brainer. I have hours upon hours in FSX over the last 8 years and a little time in Xplane 10, but this is the sim that I have been longing for.I played birds of prey on the 360 years ago, and I loved the combat aspect, but the sim side was really lacking. This version of IL2 is dead on when it comes to flight dynamics. Plus and minus as follows;+Extremely realistic flight simulation; wing attack angle is crucial, and the plane shakes and bucks when you push into the critcal zone, leading to a stall if you dont respond quickly.+Realistic ammo loadout; you can and will run out of rounds for all munitions, although I am told you can land and reload. Sometmes, one or two of the cockpit gauges will fail, and the altitude gauge is almost never correct without adjustment+The SOUND - my first mission I had the volume cranked up, listening to the Russian radio chatter and beautiful engine song. The first time I pulled the trigger in combat I litterally jumped. The sound of 20mm guns firing is jarring and pulls you into the world of war. I suggest playing with the volume high, its almost frightening.+Near perfect implementation of TrackIR; I strongly suggest this with any flight sim, its just so good. User Reqium has a great profile that adds alot to the peripheral.+Outstanding visuals and effects; the sun, clouds and ground look great, although I have seen a few bugs in the clouds.+Price; I payed 60 bucks to get in on Prepar3d, which has less aircraft than this game. People ♥♥♥♥♥ about the price of the limited edition aircraft, but go have a look at the price of an addon Leerjet for Xplane or Prepar3d. 7$ an aircraft is a great deal considering what they put into the flight models and cockpits of these craft.-Loading time; on my top end AMD rig, the missions take about thirty seconds to load. Half of that is before the briefing, half is after I hit start. Also, every mission starts paused, as if they expected a high load time that might make you want to take a pee break. I run the game off an SSD, but my main drive is disc, so maybe that is some of it.-Visuals; I know I said it was a plus earlier, and they are great, but from time to time, some shaders seem to misload, especially clouds, but occasionally in the cockpit. This distracts from an otherwise outstanding simulation.-Control options: The controls lack the option to set an axis to trim any of the three rotational axis, only buttons. I know I can make my X52 output a repeat button press with an axis, but it would be nice to be able to set those in game.-Ground variety; Every strip I have landed at so far looks exactly the same. Sometimes there are two strips, but always dirt and grass. Maybe I am wrong, but there must have been some paved airports with towers and lights somewhere in russia!-Learning curve; This is a difficult game if you want to play air combat. There is no training to speak of, gauges are all foreign unless you know German or Russian, and landing is more difficult than any other sim I have flown. However, this is all very realistic, and that is exactly why I bought the game. It is an unforgiving WW2 combat sim, and I have no doubt that lots of rookies lost their lives trying to land with a missing aileron.All said and done, its a fantastic flight sim that pulls you in with lush visuals and bone shaking sound effects. I cant imagine playing without a flight stick atleast, but the option is there to fly with a mouse if you so choose. Any fellow simmers out there who are debating this puchase, just do it and get drawn in, and you will forget the price real quick.			"

												I can see the point of all the negative reviews out there. There have been some fairly dodgy descisions made (unlocks being probably the main one). But this game is, in my opinion, the best combat flight sim out there at the moment by quite some stretch. The flight models are awesome - more so than even the modded Cliffs of Dover, the graphics are supurb, damage modelling is up there with the best of them and the map, although mostly white, is really quite beautiful. At sunrise and sunset I find it easy just to look out of the cockpit in astonishment at the scenery. It really is a winter wonderland. I've been pounced on by quite a few Germans from doing just this. Speaking of which, the AI is pretty good and follows the same physics as the player, which makes it far better than anything else out there at present. As far as pay to win goes, it's really not. I have both of the addon aircraft and although I like them, I'd never use them online as they simply aren't as good as the Yak or the 109. All the aircraft take skill, but these two probably take more than most. With this game you may not get a persistent campaign (although I expect a few modders will change that with the new editors) but you do get a very atmospheric, immersive playground with some fairly historically accurate missions. Though they seem cut and paste, they are actually quite variable. You can tell a lot of work has gone into the game and is still going into the game. I expect it to continue to improve but I already play this over DCS and CloD. In all, get this game, enjoy the flying and the dogfighting, don't get sucked into the points thing too much, and try not to look at the scenery too much either or you will be leaving smoking holes in the ground like I do.

												Certainly among the best WW2 Flight Simulators available right now. The flight models, visuals and game-play is all very good – certainly enough to immerse yourself and enjoy flying these aircraft.Performance and PlayabilityWhen the game first released there was a questionable amount of content and typical optimization issues, but since the first expansion started development (Battle of Moscow) there is certainly more planes, missions and scenery to expand your game with (purchase separate), and the game has become a bit more refined. Even if you don’t own the expansion, the Battle of Stalingrad campaign has been updated with the additional aircraft (as AI controlled planes), and you can even pick these new planes as AI opponents in quick missions which is a really good way of developing the game. The game has also started moving to 64-bit.NOTE: You are required to create a straight forward in-game account to play this.

By: Vetron




AircraftThe game comes with 8 flyable aircraft (excluding addons / deluxe edition) but it appears to of been a definitive quality over quantity approach. Included are a mixture of fighters and two engine bombers. Each ones comes with detailed cockpits, various modifications and a selection of paint schemes.The flight models are realistic and makes the aircraft enjoyable and challenging to fly under realistic settings. The learning curve is moderate, with the hardest parts likely to be taxing and then getting these early aircraft into the air.NOTE: I purchased the Deluxe version of the game. While it does add additional aircraft (La-5 Series 8 and FW 190 A-3) which are fun to fly, I wouldn't deem it essential to those on a budget, plus you can buy both these aircraft separately anyway.MultiplayerMultiplayer is non-steam, but I found this really accessible to play. Hosting is only done via dedicated server, and it takes a little setting up, but compared to other games this isn’t as difficult. Free Flight (Quick Mission)In quick missions this is where you can setup quick engagements of a few types and specify a number of parameters easily for quick instant action gameplay for up to 16 aircraft. You are able to define the aircraft of 2 friendly and 2 enemy flights, including their paint scheme, weapons and skill level. In some locations you can also choose to start on the ground and scramble start as enemy approach.This mode is a good way to test the ability of your chosen aircraft, as you can choose to go against any aircraft you wish.Missions & CampaignThe campaign combines a mixture of a handful of scripted missions and mostly dynamic missions. The dynamic campaign missions work by picking the starting airfield and the type of mission you want to complete, it then creates this for you to play. Playing missions gives XP, and once you accumulate you progress to the next campaign chapter (each chapter focusing on a different stage of the battle). There are no specific squadrons, you would appear to just be playing the random pilot that plays wherever the battle is. Quite a contrast from the Career found in Rise of Flight for example. However I’ve found progressing through the campaign fun in its own way, and certainly enough to keep you interested for many hours.There are also a selection (about a dozen or so) solo missions separate to the campaign that you can complete. There is a mission editor so you can create your own and play other users missions.

								Being a fan from the first IL2 , and badly disapointed by the following Cliff of dover, i went through all the video and preview I could find about this new tittle. And i'm really glad of having bouth it ! It's a gorgeous game (i owned Rise Of Fligh, so i knew the guy could do wonderd). It's fun to fly and weapons have a good punch (i'm not a great pilot, but it took me ALOT of bullet to take down something in CLODO).Sure there isn't as close as the plane choice there was at the end of IL2-1946.  but here you have very well modelised aircraft, with believable Flight model.The online already works well ( i tested with 30+ players).And concerning the price, i don't understand all the hatred i've read ?! every single AAA game coming out on pc is at 50€ ! and it's not offering a longuer play time !! So yes it's worth every penny, and unlike Free 2 play game, you don't have to buy the 17€ DLC to win.  (by the way, any DCS addon is twice this price ... )So in conclusion, GO FOR IT, it's the real sequel to IL2			"

												Fantastic game. one of the best WWII flight simulators hands down. That being said, the game is very hard and takes a good amount of time and effort to get even the basics down. another thing that takes a while to get used to is the fact that the planes are only german and russian meaning there is no english spoken or written within the gameplay itself. This makes it very hard to remember which gage is which and that sort of thing. If you're looking for an action arcade type of game, then this is NOT for you, but if you want one of the most realistic simulators out there, then I highly reccomend picking up this title. Amazing graphics, great gameplay, and very realistic flight controlls. 4.5/5			"

												This is a game for people who love to fly. It has everything you need for that and if you like WW2 props it's a must have title. BoS is probably best WW2 avia sim available on the market.To everyone ♥♥♥♥♥ing about CloD, I want to remind that game was barely playable at the time of release. It is still questionable experience if we do not take Team Fusion mod and custom built campaigns into account.The price is understandable as well, Making a sim is a pricey project and the possible audience is not even a million players. And the devs focused on the most important part of a sim game - the simulation of aircrafts. I like it that way better than rpg without role play (Dragon Age: Inquisition), or shooter without everything but graphics (Evolve). Last one is a total and widely recognized disaster but hey, it's a shooter with graphics, which is equivalent of 800k sold copies.Most of the negativity comes from the price of this game and actually most of ranting people are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of because their whining is cut down from forums. Actually devs are really nice and honest guys to whom you can speak freely on forums.Cons:- Price. Still nothing horrible in my opinion. It's on par with many top level games with DLC.Mixed:- Campaign is based on dynamic missions. Okayish, but could be better. Since story is not a vital part of the simulator I can forgive devs for that,- Unlocks. If you have a premium version you could do an instant unlock, but I have decided to unlock everything myself so that I have a sense of progression. Questionable but understandable decision and it is not a simulation braking feature at any level and I will laugh at anyone saying that the abscence of 37mm on Lagg-3 forces him to ""grind"".- Limited amount of planes but it's quality over quantity. You will spend a lot of time mastering each of them.Pros:- Planes, physics, damage model... the level simulation is one of the top in the genre.- Really fast and stable game engine.- The feel of flight is just right.

												Casual simmer’s view: Pros:- Decent graphics – cockpits lack perfect resolution, aircraft graphics are nice, and during daylight flying there always seems to be a bit of haze in the air. Stalingrad air pollution, perhaps. Very nice environment in lower light levels. Pyrotechnics look good. Can be tough to discern ground elements…am I dropping bombs on artillery or deer hunters out there in the snow? I guess buildings look ok but generic.- I’m not a rivet counter, but fighters feel like fighters and bombers feel like bombers. I’ll leave aircraft performance reviews to the pros. - Easy to jump in and get started, so it’s pretty accessible for folks new to the flight sim genre. Forget about tutorials or any game documentation. Youtube does have some good videos. Cons:- According to the developers, the team is concentrating on single player first. Wow…The XP grind fiasco is a complete buzzkill. I flew about 15 missions in the IL-2 waiting for the laser death ray, hyperboost and adamantium skeleton for my crews but never got them. Instead I got a tailgunner and turret for my IL-2. I shouldn’t have to grind through missions for that. I don’t play Ratchet and Clank for a reason.- The inspired-by-genius XP system suffers from a glitch. During heavy playing times (like the weekend) the XP system stops working. Want to grind out a few missions before the Seahawks game? Think again...grind all you want, but none of it will count till admin fixes the system on Monday morning.- Insipid single player mission design. Take off, fly to “action point,” bomb the train/line of 4 artillery batteries (yep 4 every time…aligned string straight)/two tanks and AA unit/transportation convoy, or shootdown enemy aircraft, return to base. Over. And over. And over. No one should call this a “campaign” by any definition. If the Russian winter and Red Army didn’t kill the German 6th Army, playing this game would have ended them as well…there lies Field Marshall Paulus…bored to death with a joystick nearby.- Except for the chapter introductions, the missions lack any sense of continuity. Then again, with the mind numbing sameness for each mission, who really cares? At first I was disappointed that we didn’t see the Ju-52 in the game. And I was hoping to see a lot more action on the ground…huge artillery barrages, fierce armor battles, building-to-building fighting in the streets. Nope, none of that.  A smattering of the aforementioned ground targets, and that's about it. Then again, after the grind for 3+ chapters, I stopped caring about the war. - Goofy AI. Sometimes your wingmen listen to you, sometimes they don’t. Enemy AI is equally weird. Very accurate tailgunners, but brain dead fighter interceptors. During my last Il-2 mission, I had six Bf-109Gs on my tail with zero escort. Didn’t suffer a scratch. - Not as stable as I hoped. Minimum of one mission freeze or crash-to-desktop each time I played.- A final minor “feature:” if you do purchase the game, do not use your real name or email address as your game name. Some folks have done that and are now stuck with it, which means you’re broadcasting your name onto every multiplayer server you log into. Developers’ response? “We have other priorities right now.” Yes you do boys, yes you do…			"

												Been playing this game now with many hours and I have been having a blast . If you are into combat flight Sims this game is a must have . The attention to detail and the sounds make this game top the previous il2 games which I have been a fan of . I am looking forward to the next dlc's and hoping for a pacific theatre. Cheers to the devs			"

												I'm a bit of a veteran as far as flight sims go and let me tell you, I wish I had found this gemn a lot sooner.  I have Rise of Flight as well and 777 Studios has yet to disappont.  Great realism, great graphics, phenominal multiplayer connectivity, smoooooooooth as butter gameplay. It's truly everything a flight sim should be.  I highly recommend a HOTAS and possibly an extra control quadrant for engine controls and such.  TrackIR or a similar program for head tracking would also greatly help but I don't really use them anymore.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a legit WW2 flight sim.			"

												I have been a fan of IL-2 Sturmovik for a really long time. I started with pacific fighters, and then bought 1946, and I loved it.  In 2013 I bought cliffs of dover, even after seeing all it's problems. I actually enjoyed it, and it ran fine for me. Now I bought battle of stalingrad, and I have to say I am really impressed. It looks absolutely gorgeous, and it is very realistic too. I love the damage models and the physics too, it is amazing. The way the wings and tail bend and break looks fantastic, and the cross winds when landing the plane is also great. I love the fire effects and the smoke trails it leaves behind, it looks great. The planes handle very realistic too, and the bail-outs looks and feels very great and smooth. There are 2 difficulty levels to choose from. Normal and Expert. Normal is for the more casual players, while expert is for hard core simulator fans. You can set a custom difficulty for quick missions, but not for the campaign. The campaign is great too, but it is actually made of randomly generated missions. You can choose what kind of mission you want to do, and what airfield you want to start from, and then pick a plane and weapons and then you choose a difficulty, and click on start, then the game will generate a mission for you. Each mission is unique, because each mission is randomly generated. The enemies spawn at different places every time, and the battlefields feel alive, because there's battles all around the place. When flying to your destination, you may notice ground battles happening below you, or other planes fighting each other in the distance, and all sorts of stuff like that. All those battles happening around you are also randomly generated, and you can even join in and help the friendlies out if you want to. You can play as either the Germans or the Russians, and they each have 4 planes to choose from, making it a total of 8 flyable planes. If you get the more expensive version of the game, you get 2 extra dlc planes. I bought the regular $60 version though, so I can't review those 2 dlc planes at the moment. The game has a decent amount of content. There is a quick mission option where you can quickly make a small mission for you to play if you want some instant action, there is a campaign mode if you want to play through 5 chapters of the battle of stalingrad, there is a mission mode where there is a list of missions to choose from if you just want to play a mission without picking options and stuff, and then there's the multiplayer mode where you can battle other players online, which is also fun. The cockpit is not clickable like cliffs of dover, but instead you need to map keys in the controls menu to use the switches and buttons and stuff. Also, I recommend you play this game with either a controller or a flight stick, because it is way too hard to fly with the keyboard. I use an xbox controller, and I am having a great time. If you enjoy flight simulators, or if you like war thunder, you should play this. It is much more realistic than war thunder though, but it is very accessible, and it has a tutorial, so most people should be fine. If you are new to flight sims, play in Normal mode, but if you are a hard core flight sim fan, play in expert mode. I totally recommend this game, even at full price it is worth it. 10/10			"

												So let me begin by saying, since the game first came out as a beta, it's come a long way performance wise, and with the recent addition of summer maps you aren't constricted to just snowy seasons, and the summer seasons look bloody amazing!I'll just go by pro's and cons now:Pros: With a bit of configuration the game works rather well with a 360 controller~The graphics are outstanding, the sky looks incredibly real at sunset especially, and the clouds are actually fluffy.The aircraft all have great physics to themA great damage engine for just screwing around, or if you feel like taking out other planes by smacking into themGreat texture detail on the aircraft, and awesome ground detail if you fly low enough in the summer/autumn seasonsChoice for simplified physics and many assists which do come in handy if you feel you need themRealistic sounds, from wind, to damaged windshields, engines, over stressed airframe, and weaponsCons:♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, example, if you're taking off and you've got those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s near you, they'll try to shoot you and most of the time smash into the ground and probably take out one of your wingmen while they're at it.No good chase camera for external views (that iv'e found at least) you always have to set it in the direction you fly in.Not even half the planes as there was in IL2 1946DLC planes are bloody expensiveDon't even try using a keyboard to fly, it's not as easy as IL2 1946, its more of an FSX kind of control nowThose are the key points iv'e got, all in all, it does deserve a bit of a better rating in my opinion, it's merely a bit of a downgrade in the number of aircraft in the game, but in return the sounds and physics are well polished.

												9.5/10.  I could go on about the game in a paragraph but that's boring.  So here are some pros and cons:Pros:+Exceptional Graphics+Incredible sound effects+VERY realistic flight model+Lots of replayability+Fast and simple process for setting up quick missions.+Crazy detailed aircraft.  The lengths at which this team goes to realistically emulate airplanes is unmatched by anything I've seen.+Includes mouse and joystick control modes.+Allows you to speed up or slow down time(SP only)+A lot of other things that I'm spacing out on at the momentCons:+Very steep price for the game and its DLC(Honestly though, with the level of detail put into the aircraft added I think it's reasonable to excuse them for this)+Steep learning curve.  This game goes no holds barred in terms of realism.+No tutorial.  CFS3 had prebuilt missions that were designed for learning how to fly, none here.+Not sure how common it is, but in my case the game crashes to desktop unless run in admin mode, and even then it takes two tries to launch.  So it has its bugs.+Less aircraft than 1946 had, but again, that's pretty acceptable if you consider the effort the devs go to when implimenting planes.  That line in the steam description about using original drawings for the planes?  That's an understatement.  Just read the ""About"" section on the game's website.+I probably am forgetting a few things.Conclusion and words of advice:If you buy this thinking you'll just apply what you learned in CFS3, War Thunder, or Wings of Prey, you're in for a rough start.  Give it some time and learn the controls(I'd suggest starting with the mouse control) and you'll be fine.			"

												Really recommend this game to people who use to play War thunder Full simulation battles. I was a regular full simulation battle player for war thunder. As we all know, War Thunder screwed up that aspect in many ways. However, this game is the alternative. The graphics are awesome and the realism is authentic. You can also scale the difficulty which is really easy to do. Its alot of fun learning each airfcraft takes time, but really worth it. The detail in this game is amazing and love the minor details that the developers implemented in the game from trails from your tires going through the snow, the long smoke trails from getting hit in the radiator and the detailed ground units. Very impressed with the games graphics and running stable! The game plays really smooth and finaly, Multiplayer is enjoyable needs some fine tuning but still fun to play. This game is getting better and better as the Devs are slowly improving the game. The only CON to this game is the price!!!  Expensive for the content and i mean expensive. Otherwise, this game is War Thunder on steroids in all aspects.			"

												I have waited to write a review so the devs could have time to add the promised features in a finished product. It seems though the game is pretty much in the same state as in early access and it's not worth the cost.It's still only have one highly oversaturated winter map, no FMB etc.Also the dreaded unlocks in the single player campaign is only skippable if you buy both the DLC planes or if you buy the deluxe version. Talk about a cash grab scheme, they give you a crappy single player experience but if you pay you can skip it, this has to be the wierdest design ever for a game.			"

												Can I just congratulate the team on a simply superb simulator. Battle of Stalingrad embodies the beauty of it's predecessor, Cliffs of Dover, but with a  makeover of it's UI and campaign modelling. With massively enhanced camera views and motion blurring, the feeling both in and out of cockpit is incredibly immersive and very convincing to a real pilot. Well done and I look forward to any future iterations of this series!			"

												Bounce your adversary diving down on him, your speed quickly catches up to him (don't crash into his tail), but if you fly past him, he could get on your tail.... should you slow your plane and match his speed?  This might allow his wingman to get on your tail as you fly a vulnerable slower speed.  The FW 190 A5 was the finest, fastest, piston engine plane of WW2.  It could turn on a dime, but turn too tight, too long and you'll slow down and stall... without at least 700 meters of altitude under you won't  be able to dive, pick up speed and pull-out in time.  How much should you lead your aim using your machine guns and 20mm cannons.  Your eyes and brain have to predict speed, maneuvers and flight skills to get your adversary in your sights taking into consideration the fact that you could crash into his tail, or forget to check your six as his wingman swings in behind you.  Yes, it takes quite a number of hours to master the skills necessary to survive a Campaign.  Fly a variety of planes against other planes and ground targets.  The fun is endless.			"

												After reading through many of the older negative reviews, I realized most of their issues are completely fixed by the dev team, or are in the process of being fixed, or were not really problems with the game at all.For example, the campaign isn't limited to only randomly generated missions, the devs are including more and more scripted missions, and with plans to have a larger scripted component in the single player of future releases.There are also no unlocks whatsoever, including all in-game aircraft skins.Performance issues have been greatly reduced, my computer used to struggle back when the game (and my system) were new.  With the introduction of 64bit, the game runs smooth as butter, and Direct X 11 is on its way.			"

It is heaven. Other air craft armed with 37mm cannons, heart pumping hot lead knocks anything out of the sky in red flamming black smoke trailing detail. OK I have waited for years for a Flight SIM to have decent Explosions!. BOS has exceeded my wildest expectations. 2500 lbs bombs make One thousand foot plums of fire and smoke with Explosions sub wofferscan be heard 2 blocks from my house ! This will continue to be the best Flight Sim, and Combat Flight Sim for years to come along with more from these deveopers.			"

												I have been with IL-2 Sturmovik since it came out. The only reason why I decided to get IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad, is because I wanted a simulator that is made using todays technology, a modern game. I have hundreds, if not thousands of hours flown, all over the IL-2 Sturmovik world, as well as sorties. I have been playing most of the campaigns. Thousands of air kills, ground kills, and in general thousands of everything. At first I wanted to write a huge block of text, but after after a while, I came up with an idea, of pros/cons, since people seem to like that kind of review.Pros:- it works- graphics- sound- community is amazing, just look at the forum, look at all these ideas, suggestions etc., shame noone cares- I received refund from SteamCons:- even though it works, I would not dare to call this release an early access, it is rather a tech demo with couple features, to show of the engine- it has less than 7% (IMO, or even less than that) content of the genuine IL-2 Sturmovik- campaign is divied into chapters/episodes/phases/whatever- campaign consists of randomly done quick missions, based on which option you select [you can fly the same mission, all the time, with the same airplane]- there are 4/5 types of missions in campaign, which depend on aircraft you will be flying, expect restrictions such as not being able to get a bomb on interception mission [yeh, it might make sense, but you could always drop it on something]  - campaign is static/linear, it is not dynamic, which means noone gives a f... what you do, neither should you*- *you are a nameless pilot, in a nameless regiment, flying alongside nameless kameraden- there is hardly any birefieng/debriefing- complete lack of squadron features- made up awards/rewards- standard edition lets you fly 8 airplanes, while premium 10- user interface- IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad will be finished after 100 years, devs are busy with their new [same quality] game called IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of MoscowTo sum it all up. Get IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946, get all the updates that are available, and enjoy. Game is supported to this day.			"

												This WW2 sim has really great physics.. the flight models make you feel like you're really flying.   I look at the negative reviews and have to say GUYS THIS ISN'T WAR THUNDER.  GO BUY YOU A LOGITECH EXTREME 3d PRO FOR $40 FFS. Complaint of ""Keyboard and mouse isn't good"" is probably coming from War Thunder wannabe's who are used to making accurate shots at 1km+ and the instructor flying the plane for them.   Guess what.. nobody flew ww2 planes with a mouse in real life.  Aiming requires getting close to your target, although you might get the lucky 800 meter shot given the right circumstances, some careful thought into how you're aiming and little luck.  That being said - the single player AI need work, more radio commands to make flying without labels viable imo.  PWCG pretty much covers the rest of your needs for anything single player. The game uses dedicated servers.. AWESOME.   You can build your own missions for multiplayer..there are servers with labels on.. there are expert servers.  Make friends though as flying alone is almost guaranteed to get you killed.   I do not own the steam version, so my hours played will not be accurate.. but this is currently the sim I play the most.The IL-2 BoS Production/dev team is a small group of people compared to big name gaming companies out there and these devs regularly reply in the forums.. provide updates and while I believe they could improve upon the base game a bit more to attract newer players rather than push out more purchasable content... I have hope that eventually this game will be everything I could want from a ww2 flight sim. But yeah.. definitely get at least a cheap joystick.. although best experienced with rudder pedals/ stick/throttle and TrackIR.  VR is being implemented soon.  "

												I did a review long time ago.It was goofy and all that, but i decided to make something more serious.The game is good! But it also have flaws.Some of them are included right on this page.My opinion is, the game should be a little more acessible. For me right now, is about a hundred and eighty at full price.When i first bought it, it was around a hundred and forthy?There's also the premium planes. The OP40 is broken. Although i'm more interested on the upcoming P39 and the upcoming FW190 A5, the lot of players who bought the game because of the P40 are kinda sad about it. But there's an update from the devs, they said they're going to update it. I'm confortable with the current 190 flightmodel, i actually feel more confortable flying a 190 over the 109.I believe saying that the planes react like kites is just a goof in general.The planes are good. They do what they must do. They dont do a lot of noise like the previous game when you stall or something like that, but they do react well.The game is good. I would buy it again to support the devs, and i will buy the new upcoming DLC to help them. Even the Duck. Although the Duck is horrible. Never fly the Duck. Leave it on the ground where it's best.

												Every review on here is detesting the game for its price. Who cares what it costs, the game itself is fantastic. Its a great flight sim, with one of, if not THE best flight model on the market. It's simple and easy to get into, but allows for full engine control if wanted, and models it great. Everything from the time it takes to mix fuels, to the amount of cooling provided by different radiators is fully modeled. Every detail you're looking for is here. The speed inwhich the 109's undercarriage retracts, the stiff controls of the Lagg-3. And the damage model is absolutely top notch. From the way an aircraft wobbles, to the unpredictability and stability brought upon by bent control surfaces and struts. This game is simply a must own for any flight sim enthusiest. Well worth the price, don't listen to all these other bad reviews. (oh and dont worry about my time spent in game, i've been playing the non-steam edition up until today. I have a few hundred hours atleast.)			"

												This game currently sets the bar for WWII combat flight simulators. With amazing graphics, large scale maps, real world aerodynamics, instrumentation and physics. It's an aviators dream come true. The learning curve is steep, requiring you to invest some time to learn how to fly. Really, learn to fly! This is not an arcade game!!! Learning how to manage your aircraft systems including fuel loads, engine manifold pressure, RPM, water cooling and weapons load outs is essential. Single player is a lot of fun but the games truly becomes amazing online in multiplayer where flying with your friends will lead to some amazing moments and put your jaw on the floor. Online multiplayer consists of a good mix of servers that provide different scenarios from Training to Tactical Air War. You won't run out of missions to take part in. If you are interested in this game I recommend getting a good joystick and throttle with a lot of programmable buttons. Read the forums for instructions then join the BOS/BOM team speak server and ask a seasoned player for a little dual instruction to help you get started. Continue to practice and play, because once you learn. It will become the most epic WWII combat simulator you have ever been a part of. This game is essential for real world aviators looking for a good WWII flight SIM. Recommendations: 1. Practice in single player to program your joystick, adjust settings, and learn the basics.2. Join Team Speak and ask a vetran to help. There are plenty of good player willing to do so. 3. Online - Join training servers and “Wings of Liberty” to learn basic tactics with friends.4. Ffighter dual / Dogfight servers will teach you to handle your aircraft during air combat and practice against real players.5. Don't play “Tactical Air War” until you have a good handle on things. This is a 24/7 online war where losing you aircraft really matters. once they are lost, it's difficult to get them back. Losing aircraft effect the overall team or side you are fighting. Read the forums for Tactical Air War game rules.6. Track IR is very useful. As situational awareness is essential for survival in this SIM. Visit the Tactical Airwar details and statistics page for further info:http://taw.stg2.de/index.php "

												I like this flight sim, it has developed well over time. Its an outright sim tho, quite hard but very rewarding when you get it right. The only thing for me that would make it better is a Battle of Britain  DLC with spitfires etc. Never the less, the best fighter sim around.			"

												Hardcore flight simulators are not for everyone. Let's get that out of the way. This game is definitely that, if you want it to be.I have always been a fan of combat flight simulators, ever since Sierra's Aces over Europe wayyy back in the day. This is my first flight simulator I have picked up since Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator. It has made me realize... I'm really bad at flying. But I also have a lot of fun doing it. I am currently flying on ""Normal"" mode, as ""expert mode"" murders me. I only have two successfull landings so far out of dozens of attempts. I have ended up as a flaming wreck more times than I can cound due to my own noob-ness. But I'm also getting better. Those two successfull landing attempts were my last two.Combat is difficult but when you shoot down a plane, the elation is real. Jousting in the sky for position with other airplanes is a tense and difficult affair. Watch your airspeed or you might stall and drop out of the sky like a brick.The downside for me of this game, is the campiagn. It feels like a random mission generator rather than a career mode, which is what I would like. Fortunately, the devs have said they are working on a career mode.I have dabbled in multiplayer a couple of times so far, but it is full of experts who will shoot you down without you even seeing it coming. This is not a downfall, I simply need to get better at it and keep practicing.I highly recommend this sim to any WW2 fans. The flight model is incredible, as are the graphics and sound. Pick this one up if you're looking for a flight sim fix!			"

												IL2:BOS is a game made for me. I'm new-ish to flight sims, have a joystick, TrackIR (actually a custom FreeTrack rig), and I prefer the frantic, tactical combat of dogfights to other aspects of flight simulators like systems management and realistic navigation. For me, Battle of Stalingrad gets it just right.The game presents two preset difficulty options, Normal and Expert, and options for customization. In neither of the presets are flight mechanics or damage models compromised for ease. The fidelity of the flight simulation is top notch (maybe shy of some DCS modules, but it's hard for me to say - I certainly don't have any personal experience with WWII airplanes), and the feeling of immersion that this creates is wonderful. Dogfights are intense and breathtaking!The game has received some flak from some of the more die-hard flight sim fans (who disparagingly compare the game to War Thunder). They complain (perhaps rightly) that the ease-of-use features kill the simulation, even on Expert difficulty. I share none of these concerns. To me, a beginner, the game focuses on exactly what I like about combat flight simulations: combat flight! I like that I can choose between short (no takeoffs or landings) and long missions. I appreciate being able to turn icons on and off. I like that I can elect to use complex engine management, or leave that to the AI if I just want to focus on dogfighting. I like auto-level, time compression... all the options that allow a relative beginner like me to play the game as casually or as hardcore as I want to.I had hoped we'd see an imprevement in the single player by the game's release. Now that it's out, I'm a bit dissapointed by the fairly bland campaign. Oh well. I'll hope for a fix, and in the meantime will play more multiplayer. Regardless, the game is quickly becoming one of my favorite flight sims of all time, up there with Rise of Flight (by the same studio), and IL-2 1946.			"

												This game has the potential to be a worthy sucessor to Il-2 1946, unlike Cliffs of Dover or DCS, in my opinion.  Yes, Battle of Stalingrad is incomplete (e.g., no mission editor or documentation) and the offline, single player campaign unlock system was a poor (and last second?) decision by the designers.  However, the graphics are superb and the flight models are good enough.  The flight and combat experience are absolutely wonderful and immersive.Hopefully, the game will only get better if enough people buy into it and development continues which is a big question mark, unforutnately.  Most of the criticism leveled at the game are by long time flight-simmers that have pretty unrealistic expectations and demands.  The price for this game is very steep but it is currently the only World War II simulation under active devopment. I doubt we'll see something comparable from DCS within the next couple of years too given their track record for not being able to produce a new map and problems with large multi-player battles. "

												Great simulator, stellar graphics, and some really nice view models, but beware... This is a simulator, NOT A GAME. If you buy this expecting it to be as easy as flying a plane in Battlefield, you will be suprised, and not in the good way. The game is very realistic, and every plane has different limits as to how fast it can go, can turn, and how steady it can fly. It will take you many hours of re-playing missions before you can even hit an enemy plane. Your sights will be shaking harder than a meth head experiencing withdrawal. But when you finally hit a plane, or even take one down, you start shaking like a meth head, and you feel great! Right up until 10 seconds later when you crank the joystick a bit too hard and your plane spins out of control.			"

Early Access Review
								From what I see, it is simply an upgraded version of the classic IL-2 Sturmovik, with better graphics, flight model and AI, rather than the abortion that was IL-2: Cliffs of Dover.  And that is high praise.Despite being early access/beta, Il-2:BoS seems to be a complete, fully functional game. This is probably because it uses the well-tested Rise of Flight engine, which gives it a reliable foundation.I don't hesitate to recommend it - I usually dislike early access (and certainly those priced as much as a fully-released game).  However IL-2:BoS is definitely worth the $50 if you are interested in combat sims.  If you are not sure, try the older, but still excellent IL-2:1946 first at $10 to see if you like the genre.			"

It has a more realistic feel and absolutly beautiful graphics. Its easy enough to learn the basics of this game although I would recommend getting a joystick to play this game, prefferably one with rudder control.Looking forward to more games and more expansion in this game!

												Well, after playing for over 4hrs, I love it!I've been playing flight simulators since the early 80's, and actually that's the reason I got into computers to begin with.  I remember a time when a person could walk into a computer game store (yes, it only sold computer games, not console games), and that's all you would see on the shelves.... Flight Simulators!It's sad that now you don't see Flight Sims that much, so I'm very pleased to see that 1C/777 are doing what they can to keep the genre alive.  I played the hell out of the original IL2 games, and still do actually.  I was so excited when I heard that they were coming out with a new IL2.  And I'm just blown away!The graphics are top knotch!  The realism, again top knotch!  The fact that I can't lean my head out the window (using TrackIR head tracking) until I open the canopy is freaking cool!  The way the cockpit rattles when you fire up the engine, and the damage models when objects are hit by bullets is unbelievable!Now there are a few things that I've seen that people are complaining about, such as the inability to use multiple monitors, and the way you have to gain EXP to unlock paint schemes and new guns and so on.  But if you ask me, that's all really minor stuff.  I use one monitor, and with the head tracking using TrackIR I don't see the need for multiple monitors.  And I sort of like the EXP system that it has, gives me something to work for, other than just getting through missions.I was a little dissapointed in the number of planes you are able to fly, the original IL2 games had freaking tons of planes!  I'm hoping that 1C/777 release new planes, and if this game is as big of a hit as I think it will be, I'm sure they will.  Unfortunatly I'm also sure that each new plane will be through purchasing (looks like they will be priced at around $20 by looking at the two extra planes they have available now).  But personally I don't mind, the company has to make money, and in this day and age, where the younger generation just wants FPS games, paying $20 for a new high quality plane is nothing.  I've spent way more than that on my other flight simulator addons.So would I recommend this game?  HELL YEA!Even if you have never flown a flight simulator before, this is a good way to get started!			"

Early Access Review
								Bought this this weekend after spending a lot of time on the fence about early access, and my general inability to glean anything I wanted to know from forum comments or previous reviews. What I wanted to know was, is this anything like Rise of Flight (ROF) also by 777 studios? I happen to like ROF's balance of interface and flight mechanics and enjoyed the Career Mode even though it was only a Beta and a little thin. I expect games like this to deliver a pretty realistic feeling flight experience and beautiful graphics, and it does deliver these things, but I was worried with 1C involved it would be less like ROF than I expected. I was hoping for something of an improved ROF: WW2.I needn't have worried. At this stage in early access a lot of the interface elements look like a cleaner version of ROF and I was able to get in the action right away. I don't do MP and I think there is enough here to play around with and get a feel for the various aircraft at this stage in SP. I guess if you didn't like ROF you won't like this either, this has a much stronger 777 studios feel than a 1C feel. - Acccount activation and Log In: a Lot like ROF with a seperate Steam Key and activation needed to play. Should be no problem for anyone. - Pricing: Pretty consistent with how ROF was priced, I wouldn't expect anything different here,I did have an issue with access at first, but they fixed it first thing the next business day. Overall pretty good for early access version, I am hoping for a much more fleshed out SP experience once it's final, but I'm fine with what I have seen so far. Seems like there is room for expansion later on down the line, and that will be a good thing.			"

Early Access Review
								The flight modelling is very close to AcesHigh, and that is praise indeed.There isn't much in the early access to comment on;Great graphics but lacking in options to modify individual items such as motion blur amount and view distances. Realism can be modified to suitGreat with a HOTAS and rudder control, but individual stick can't have seperate setup options such as damping amount.Missions provided so far, give a positive flavour of the game. I am a big 109 enthusiast and sadly so far I see no evidence of any campaign mode from the German point of view, which is disappointing. Online games I've been on so far seem very capable and enjoyable for long hours. Mission to destroy factories while defnding your own as a team for tickets in which games can be set for very long hours of combat.It is so far very promising.			"

Early Access Review
								This is what IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover should have been. Bringing in the RoF and IL-2 teams under one roof was a genius move and it's really paid off. The flight mechanics are spot on and it doesn't just feel like WW2 planes with the RoF engine. This feels like it was built from the ground up to be a realistic (but fun) WW2 flight simulator. The UI is terrific, I've played many sims flight or otherwise and this game by far has the cleanest, friendliest UI of any. I hope new comers to the flight sim world start here because not only is it a great sim it's extremely easy to jump right into. The addition of short missions (optional takeoff/landing) will really help ease new players into the fun and the campaign seems  well adapted.			"

												 I have just recently gotten in to the flight sim games, and i really enjoy them. This is the first real flight sim I have actually played properly. So i am biased so you might not want to trust my opionon but well I am going to give it anyway. I think this game is apsoulutly amazing in every way ( not every way, exageration). One of my favorite things about the game is the flight model's are amazing the planes feel almost real. I love it. It is actually enjoyable to just fly the aircraft. The damage of your weapons feels like you are actually shooting real cannons and guns they feel so powerfull i love it. Also the collisions are nice sould use improvement i thing thought. the game run smoothlly and looks great. the game sounds pretty good too i like the engine sounds when inside of the cockpit or leaning out the window.One big thing about the game for me is the multiplayer. It's my favorite part. I love it, but there is quite a big problem with it. There is never enought players so my advice to you is buy the game we need more players .			"

												They only thing that was holding me back from buying this Sim was the negative reviews regarding a bad registration proccess, maybe they just fixed it right before i bought the game but for me, it was as smooth as creating a  any other account.the game looks and plays very nice, there is a great feeling of weight for the planes and also great feeling of speed.i recommend flying this game on TS with other people on Multiplayer and go for objective oriented sorties as it increases the satisfaction and feeling of accomplishement when you land your almost shot to pieces bomber/fighter back home.there are no clickable cockpits as in DCS (which is a shame) but complex engine management is there and  its a must if you are to be competitive in full realism mode; any sort of headtracking (freetrack/TrackIR) is almost mandatory to be competitive in any mode.EDIT: (The unlock system is long gone)the campaign is repetitive although they have made it more varied in latest patches, Look at it as a ""tutorial"" or ""trainning"" and you find it useful as it polishes your piloting skills.the overall experience with the game has been VERY positive and satisfactory (i even find myself making custom input devices for it ATM like throttle cuadrants and button panels), i think ive had the game for about 3-4 weeks now and have flown it for 124 hours which i find to be a lot.i would recommend this game any day, to anyone with an interest for WW2 air combat or Combat flight simulators, and maybe some more casual players who like complex tactics and manouvers with prop pitch planes.

												Review as of 4/10/17I have spent quite a bit of time in this sim over the last 2 months (I don't launch through Steam). The IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad/Moscow/Kuban series is hands-down the best, most complete WWII flight sim on the market right now. This is largely because subsequent releases (such as Battle of Moscow, Battle of Kuban), while playable as standalone games if bought directly from 1CGS, also all integrate together into one seamless flight sim with 10 maps and 26 flyable aircraft as of the date of this review. The game is continuously developed and improved by a very dedicated and responsive team. This is a whole different (and much improved) animal from what was initially released, and it's getting better all the time. Strengths: - Flight models: the flight models are superb. I've never played any sim that so well captures the sensation of flight. - Great attention to realism and detail- Seamlessly integrates with subsequent releases into 1 cohesive sim- Enough maps, planes, and ground units to create a fully-realized eastern-front air war- Great graphics- DX11 Update brought great performance- Continuous updates from responsive devs: improvements being developed for subsequent releases are also applied to BoS and BoM- Quick Mission generator + the randomized campaign + official and user-made scripted campaigns + user-made missions + 3rd party campaign generator utilities create plenty of compelling single player content- Rise of Flight-style career mode is coming later this year- VR is coming next week- Adequately populated multiplayer servers- The much-maligned single player unlock system is gone: everything is unlocked from the minute you purchaseCons: - lack of in-game tutorials could make the game intimidating to new players who aren't used to ""hardcore"" flight sims (lots of youtube tutorials and a manual are available, though)- current randomized campaign lacks depth (this will be replaced by a Rise of Flight-style career mode)- currently no Co-op (this is coming later this year as well)If you are a fan of combat flight simulation, WWII aviation, or both, this game is a must have.

Started playing Rise of Flight years ago when it first started and was amazing to see what they did with the game and the insane amount of planes and content they put out.  Truly high quality product.Looking forward to playing this game for many years to come and being along for the ride!Check out some of the youtube videos and you'll be sold. :)			"

												The feeling of flight is second to none. Excellent.If you have any interest in flight at all, whether it's modern or WWII, I can't recommend this enough.More than any other game, flight sim or otherwise, BoS captures the feeling of flying. The immersion is absolutely top shelf, from the beautiful sound design to the excellent sense of speed and altidude, this game comes closer than any of its predecessors to creating the sense that you're actually in the cockpit.Graphically BoS is fantastic, while the maps are currently entirely snow covered, they look excellent. Add in the reproduction of a battle torn Stalingrad complete with massive pillars of thick black smoke, flak that paints the sky in deadly splatters of ink and beautiful weather/time variation and you're left with something that is visually stunning.With a massive amount of content on the horizon, single missions, in-depth campaign, a creator suite that will bring a host of interesting single, multi and co-op created missions and modes it's more than worth the initial entry fee.To sum it all up, BoS brings an excellent foundation to the table that will be built upon and enjoyed for years to come, the initial asking price may seem steep at first but when you look at the package as a whole, it's a steal.See you in the sky.

YouTube™ Video: Ju 87 D-3 Familiarisation 

			Views: 11,628		

			This tutorial video covers the Ju 87 D-3 (Stuka) to get you familiar with its rear gunner, cockpit, engine start, takeoff, and landing procedures.		

I'm changing this review because they've changed the nature of the game. I don't know why on earth someone would want to simulate a donkey and a carrot in a World War 2 game. Longevity is required to force all players to play the ridiculous campaign. You unlock a bomb then loads of skins when all you wanted was the gun pods. Ya! A waste of time that's divided the community.			"

												Bought Rise Of Fliht for about a year ago. Same developer as IL-2. After a short while i bought the Logitech 3d Pro (good and not to expensive flystick) and i had some fun hours with it.. I really like rof but wanted a ww2 game more.. Some days ago i found this game and right from the beginning i loved it. Sure you have to unluck things but that dosnt matter. Only makes it more fun, cause you have something to look forward to. I really like the rank you gain. Graphis is very nice. The skyes looks awesome. The ground is not the best but they just used more resurces for the planes ,sky etc.. So if you want a action packed game yet a game where you can still chill and fly around the same time, this is it! It takes some time to get good at shooting, but if you stick to it and practise, you will be rewarded! See you in the sky..			"

												I would only recommend this game to people who use TrackIR, throttle, pedals, and joystick. If you are new to flight sims then I would spend some time in Warthunder or something similar.  While the game isn't historically accurate, it is still a fun game to play if you can max out the settings and have patience. This game does appeal to the senses if played in a realism/hardcore style of play. While playing online there are a number of things that make this simulator very fun online, having to distinguish friend from foe is no easy task, coordinating formation flights to targets in sometimes more than 10-15 planes at a time, aerial gunnery is actually realistic and challenging. Overall, I would give this game good review and worthy of picking up if you truly want to play this game on a realism setting. If you are looking for something arcady and keyboard/mouse capable then your money may be better spent elsewhre.Pros:-Great Graphics-Strong Multiplayer -Excellent Cockpit detail-Sounds are magnificentCons:-Grind unlock system-Repetitive Singleplayer campaign -Physics are great except for the DLC planes that are clearly given some sort of buff.

												- I grew up playing Il-2 1946, i remember those hot summer afternoons where i flew for a couple of hours with only my keyboard before i went out to play ball with my friends. This game gave me the same feeling 8 years after, and that is just lovely.- The game has a low learning curve; looks incredible; the sound effects are unreal; the soundtrack is awesome; and for a physics student like myself, you are not gonna believe the way the planes behave. You will have to do some reading, but i hadn't had this much fun playing a game, in a long time.- Don't worry if you don't have any gear, you can easily be and ace with only a ps3 controller, your mouse (for the head movement) and 10 cm of tape for you to attach them together.- While the multiplayer is really good, you should know that the SP gets old, really fu**ing quick. It lacks of an actual campaign, and the almost infinite amount of flyable planes that 1946 has. But hey! They are releasing new stuff every once in a while in the form of BoM and BoK, so there's that, it's just a matter of time for the final product to become a real masterpiece like his antecessor is. And i do hope we get all the versions in one affordable final game.			"

												For sure my favorite title in my library. The devs are currently working on another project, but the two ultimately work together to make a larger game. However, this doesn't stop them to adding things for BoS, like player controlled tanks, Stalingrad seasonal maps, and new campaign chapters for them (for free!).The FM, and DM are very good, and the community usually has over 100 players spread over a few servers during prime time. The planes all have cockpits for both pilot and gunner that both have controllable lights. In some planes, the gunner will have multiple guns he has to switch to or move from one side of the fuselage to the other.This game uses the same mouse control system as Rise of Flight, so you can check it out for free by downloading that. I would definitely but a joystick though. You can get the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro for under $50 from pretty much anywhere; Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, etc.  There are also several negative things worth mentioning too. There is a lot of controversity surrounding the Yak-1, and Bf-109 F-4, rendering distance of planes and ground targets are really meh, unlocks for planes are a pain in the butt untill you finish them.Most servers are in Europe, or the US, so you may not be able to play MP if you are not very close to those regions. All players have the ability to create their own server though, so you could be the one to change that. :)The game is pretty solid all together. If you are from a game like WT, there will be a learning curve, but you'll get it with practice.			"

												IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad is an accurate and substantially immersive WW2 Eastern Front experience. It provides the player with extremely accurate aircraft flight - models and physics, spectacular graphical elements, historically accurate interpretation of the area in and surrounding Stalingrad during both the batttle itself and the Soviet counter - attack and extremely accurate start - up procedures. The physics are extrodinary; the damage models correspond with such realism in accordance to the situation. In summation, IL -2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad is a very well manufactured game and leaves few mediums undesirable. The game is worth the $50 price tag, as the experiences you will endure and the duties you endeavour upon will contribute to a fully immersive and realistic experience of the most cataclysmic theatre of war ever to be fought upon.

								Onced purchaed and downloaded, (all 63% of it ?) it was very frustrating and time consuming, jumping thru all the ""hoops"" just to get in the cockpit. After many, many, un-sucessfull  attempts, finally excess was granted. At last I was able to be in a position to throttle up, taxi out, lift off, climbing to a 5 mistake high altitude. The graphics  are excellent, in both the aircraft and the ground. The effects were spectacular, the overall flight characterisics were great, very enjoyable to deal with. Granted it was an expensive purchase, and yes, I'd wait a few months to see of the extra added aircraft drops in price. I don't think I squandered my hard earned money on a useless simulator game, I like it and would highly recomend it to anyone.			"

												A continuing evolution of IL-2's famous combat sims, this visually stunning game/simulator pushes the genre to new levels of realism.  777 studios, the people who brought us Rise of Flight, which remains one of the most outstanding flight sims to date, and the definitive WW1 flight combat sim, have added their expertise to this impressive game.  The few hours I've played have not been disappointing, and I am becoming increasingly hooked into the challenges it has to offer.  Elements feel a little arcade like, but if you've had some experience of flight sims and are looking to get into it without spending hours learning how to turn on just the batteries, such as some study sims, this is a good compromise.  The purists will be happier with DCS based products, but this is a pretty decent effort, and a major improvement over cliffs of dover, which in itself is a great sim.			"

												I am not a sim player normally, but I got this game to just dabble with.  It has been a great game, and can be very challenging at times.  Overall the sim is very accurate, especially at the hightest difficulty setting, which includes complex engine management (radiators, fuel/air mixture, boost) if you are not juggling all those settings you can burn out your engine.The flight model has several different difficulty levels as well, and can be quite challenging if your like me and have not played with a really acurate sim in a while.The number of groud vehicles that you can shoot up, bomb or rocket is pretty impressive and you can even drive the Pz III or T-34.  The custom planes can be flown with any version of the game, so while I only own Battle of Stalingrad, I also bought the P-40 and fly it in the BoS campaign.The next set of premium planes will be available by the end of the year. They are the Yak-1b and JU-52.			"

As a huge fan of both history, and games, I found this game to be perfect for me. Fast paced, yet realistic combat, and a massive, beautifully detailed map are just a fraction of it's accomplishments. Not to mention a beautiful soundtrack, amazing graphics, spot-on simulation of just about everything even related to the subject, and at times it can be extremely relaxing. Setting the plane to autopilot and just watching is actually something I find myself doing quite often. I would certainly reccomend this game to anybody who is passionate abut history, or realism in games. It's not a game for everybody though. So please, look up gameplay or something before you buy it, and give it a bad review for absolutely no reason.			"

It's worth it if just to take off and fly around in the clouds and check out the scenery and then attempt a decent landing.  You'll have to do your homework and read up on each aircraft to do this sim any justice.  You won't be flying on rails into your landings, that's for sure!  And, the dynamic battle front and air combat is nerve racking.  You'll also need to read up on your ACM tactics or you'll be hitting the silk if you survive the hits. Worth every cent.			"

												If you want a WWII air combat sim, you have no choice. Sure DCS has the planes and War thunder may have planes and looks. But after you try this, there is no turning back. This one has planes, looks and feels. Nothing like the IL2 saga offers the same level of immersion.They also have tanks and mouse aim. While mouse aim is not as refined as War Thunder, it gets the job done while the available tanks (T-34 1942 and Pz III L) are leaps and bounds better than warthunder even in simulator mode.It helps that distances are much larger and that there are proper objectives (like, take this airbase or prevent enemy push).So, you can try it with a mouse (totally worth it. It made Warthunder very meh to me afterwards) and once you have the money invest in a proper HOTAS and enjoy the game to its fullest (there are a couple of nice sticks coming out including Thrustmaster cheap hotas based on the T16000 stick and a $100 stick made by a Russian company called VKB Gladiator which is a replica of the german WW2 flightstick found on the Bf109 and Fw190 and others).Highly recommend. Can't coment on VR as I don't own a VIVE yet but as far as I know, it is very early access so don't go out and buy this game just for that just now.Another good point, the devs are very involved with the community and very open for feedback if you manage to substanciate your claims and present it in a non insulting manner.

												I had high hopes for this sim, as I loved the original IL2 Forgotten Battles, and have high regard for Studio 777's Rise of Flight, on whose engine (and business model), this is based. Without a demo, the only guidance I had on how this would play was something along the lines of, take Rise of Flight as a benchmark. Rise of Flight, though not maxed out, is smooth and fast on my machine, and looks excellent, so with not much hesitation, I took the plunge.I didn't mind so much reports of few aircraft and skill points to gain unlocks, nor that there was only one map with one season.  When I ran the sim, though, my greatest disappointment was its performance. On my quad 2 q6600 2.40gh, GTX 750, 6 gig DDR2 ram system I can still get pretty much anything to play well with a bit of tweaking, ROF especially (and even IL2 Cliffs of Dover, which everyone considers somewhat of a dog), but IL2 BOS stands out in that it is the worst of the bunch. I can't get framer rates over 30, and am plagued with micro pauses and stutters. Normally, I would just tinker with the graphics options and find some option causing the problem, but here, I don't have that option. The developers have taken the stunning decision to lock the public out of the advanced settings and give you low, balanced, high and ultra. There are a couple of other options - screen resolution, shader amount (4,2,0), muliple grachics cards checkbox, and a cinematics checkbox hidden in the camera menu, but that's it. And, as far as I can tell from the official forum, there are no plans to open up the toolbox. It seems we gamers can't be trusted to mess with things.So, this means I have a sim which runs poorly and looks bland. Not ideal.What else?The vulnerability of the aircraft is somewhat absurd. I tend to fly the 109 mostly, and fly straight and and level and away from the enemy, and you might just stay in the air. Other than that, it's a case of a couple of passes and usually a wrecked engine from either the enemy or one of many mechanical. I've yet to actually shoot anything down so ludicrous is the damage modelling. If this is accurate, then it flies in the face of every single other sim I've flown (and that's about all of them).I have to admit to haveing just bought the FW190. It was on sale and I see it as a hedge hedge against the future where the developers might just open the graphics options and address the fragility issues (these things can happen).You probably know all the other stuff - no evidence of any real battle in the city of Stalingrad, no Bf 110, no Ju 52 (though both seem possibilities - for purchase, of course). Oh, and my last gripe - the IL2 itself is the single seat without the rear gunner. Damnation. I used to love playing as the rear gunner. "

												Just brought IL2 BOS in the Holiday Sale for £29.99 and here are my first impressions. Played the first airfiled mission, after some confusion customising key mappings and joystick configerations, which could have a better user interface I started the mission. WOW awesome took me right back to the first IL2 Sturmovick with much more immersion, AI and fantastic gameplay with graphics to match. This game has huge potential, alright its work in development and as long as we gamers support 1C Game Studios & 777 Studios this could well end up being a classic, right lets get back in to try more missions and some MP. Forgot to mention you need to register the game after creating your Steam game account, if you get the Error #4; wrong email or password when trying to sign from Steam IL2 BOS go here for info http://steamcommunity.com/app/307960/discussions/0/35221031626554464/ "

												I had a blast for years with IL2 '46, and ROF, and later versions of CLOD, and some DCS, but BOS is the one I've played most over the last couple of years.  There is room for improvement, as with all combat/flight sims.Continuity lacks in the stock single player 'campaign.' It is more akin to a series of individual missions.  The unlocks didn't seem to be too popular, although you can choose to bypass them with the premium version.  It's definitely not easy, and will take a long time to master even one of the aircraft.  Both the flight models and ground handling characteristics of the aircraft are, for the most part, believeable.  Wind and cloud cover adjustments are available, although cloud height is not.The graphics are excellent, and there is a lot of detail and moving parts.  Excellent physics and damage models.  All manner of antecdotes, rants, suggestions, arguments, and technical theories are discussed in the native BOS forum, with every knit picky, off the wall topic, down to the most finite details you can imagine.  Entertaining and educational, check them out if you haven't already:http://forum.il2sturmovik.com/Also, check out Requiem's excellent video tutorials.  Here is but one example, the Ju-87 Stuka:

Mostly, I love this game because of the amount of time I spend wide eyed, white knuckled and puckered, with my heart in my throat.  With regular updates and an active development effort, more maps and more aircraft on the way, this title has legendary potential.			"

Early Access Review
								UPDATED since releaseSeems the developers of BoS know their product is not up to par. In order to combat ""negative"" reviews, they have also gone as far as to pay people to talk up their game, and rebuff other sims. This is of course in addition to the metacritic campaign they pulled a few weeks ago tring to inflate the scores on that site, as well as Steam reviews.Want to see it? Check the comments section for link to a conversation with a paid cheer leader here on the steam forums.Good- Graphics are better than IL2 1946, worse than Cliffs of Dover, but could be better.The physical models looks good.SOME damage models looks good.The snowy landscape although bland, look nice.They say mods will be supported.The only new WWII combat flight game this year.Bad-Lots of flight models still wonky, and not much feedback if they are going to fix them. Single player campaign is hollow and just a random mission generator.No historical squads.No custom options on the Campaign.Unlocks, and XP points in a ""sim"" in order to get new weapons/missions/airfields. Really? In a sim?Cockpits graphics look a bit better than IL2 1946.Hollywood style smoke and fires. No plane goes down unless it is in a CLOUD of smoke.Mods will be supported, but iffy on how much you can mod, and how restsrictive it will be.Preset graphics options (you cant pick your own graphics settings).Sound is decent, but far from good.Trigger lag when firing guns.ALWAYS on connection to play the Single Player campaign.Not sure if it wants to be a War Thunder Arcade game or a sucessor to IL2 as a sim game.Also dont be fooled by all the postive reviews. Some are correct in their opinion, but some are just people from the ""Lets get good steam reviews"" campaign that was launched from the devs forums.Right now I cant reccomend this game to a combat flight sim fan. When they decide if they want to go Arcade or Sim, and how the release goes, I might have a different opinion. Until then this is my opnion of the Early Access of BoS.			"

												Hours low because I originally bought this off the IL2 website, not steam.  If you have VR then without a doubt pick this sim up.  If you want realistic WWII flying and fighting, pick this up.  The feel of the planes and the graphics are both top notch.  I can't describe how impressive it feels to land some hits on a plane and see this big, thick, realistic looking black plume come out the back that's so think you can't even see the target anymore.  I will warn you though, realistic engine management is no joke.  I've been trying to fly WWII sims for years and I feel I still don't have a good grasp on what I'm doing.  At the same time the Yak 1 is fairly simple to use and is a great turn fighter.  Also, you don't have to do realistic engine management if you won't want to.At any rate you can't go wrong with this sim.  It's worth it at full price and more is coming!			"

												While I feel that it started out on somehwat unclompleted grounds and that there are things that could be added to the game to add immersion as a pilot (which is why I waited until the first substantial update since I bought the game before I wrote a review). It appears that 777 studios does indeed have an ear to the ground and is listening to what the community wants of this game. While most games can come out as is and people will either like it or not, IL-2 has such a niche community that devs have too look at what the people want as a whole and be able to adapt to said expectations. Also upon reading their website, it seems that the developers want this game to develop alongside their next title: Battle of Moscow. With this last update, I can tell that there have been substantial upgrades to the campaign and overall ""story"" of you as a pilot. With this being said, I am interested in seeing what comes out next in future updates and will continue my journey as a pilot in the world of IL-2 Sturmovik.			"

Posted: August 31, 2015
												I was hoping for an improved Cliffs of Dover (which I recommend) with a new campaign, theater, planes, etc. but I am disappointed with this game.First, the cockpits are not mouse-interactive at all. There aren't even tooltips to make it easier to read and understand the instruments (which are in German and Russian of course). So you can't just jump in a plane and figure it out by interacting with it, and it doesn't feel so immersive or like it's a real plane. I spent way too much time in the menus binding all the different axes, which seem to be redundant in many cases. Like I tried out a twin-engine bomber and my bindings didn't work as expected even though you're supposed to be able to switch between engines with the number keys. There aren't many planes so I expected the systems simulations to be better. Like in the bf109 I noticed that the radiator control in the cockpit says auto when the HUD says manual and vice versa. Though the cockpits look nice.The graphics are impressive at first but when I actually try playing, pretty much all I can see is snow and clouds. My whole screen is white outside. All the maps are winter. It also seems very difficult to taxi in this game. The planes slide all over the place. For this reason I don't even bother with takeoff, which I enjoy in other games.The campaign has no flavor text or voiceover or story to it. It is just a theater map from which you pick a location, plane, and generic mission scenario. They all appear on the briefing as a rectangular shape. You fly to a waypoint, then to the ""action point"" which tells you exactly what will be there and at what elevation. Then you MUST fly to the ""exit point"" to finish the mission even if it takes you the opposite direction of your landing field. It hardly feels like a military sim or immersive at all like Cliffs of Dover was. And in quick mission you can choose any options or simplifications you want before starting, but in campaign you can only choose ""normal"" or ""expert"" for some reason (which turns most help settings on or off). And you must earn XP to progress and unlock new weapons etc.The UI is clean but overbearing like a mobile game or something. You can only toggle off the map separately but everything else (map icons, simplified instrument icons, autopilot icons, labels) toggles together. And it's not always clear if you're using an autopilot simplification or real auto controls (like German auto-radiator which they did have). And you start in-air with auto-level turned on (why??) which you must find the keyboard binding for or else jerk your stick sideways to disengage (and destabalize yourself).Overall a frustrating, oversimplified, mechanical, un-immersive experience. I think even the related (and free) Rise of Flight is more immersive and engaging even though it has WWI planes with ancient instruments. I recommend Cliffs of Dover for an immersive campaign that puts you in a real squadron (and it has clickable cockpits, less hand-holding like auto RPM limiter). And DCS has the best (and most expensive) WW2 plane simulations though it is lacking a good campaign.			"

												I backed Battle of Stalingrad as a founder back before release, and recently moved it to steam and grabbed Battle of Moscow, so my actual playtime is much higher than it states here. I have also flown many other simulations in the past too, from Falcon 4.0 to DCS World and IL-2: 1946.The IL-2 Battle of X series is an outstanding World War Two survey-level flight simulation.(Thus effectively REQUIRES at MINIMUM a joystick to enjoy properly) Single player is a little dull and repetitive, but multiplayer is where the fun is. Many will not like that, as flight sims have a massive trend of players sticking to single-player modes outnumbering online players by at least 10 to 1, but the shift to an online focus is increasingly common in the gaming industry as of 2017. IL-2 BoS follows this trend for better or worse.Immersion is the highest I have ever found in a flight sim, with the graphics (recently upgraded from DX9 to DX11 for FREE) audio and feel combining to create perhaps the most fully-realised representation of a frontline air war to date.The flight modelling, by and large, is outstanding. The only simulation to surpass Il-2 Battle of Stalingrad/Moscow/Kuban is DCS World, which at the time of this review does NOT have a WWII terrain, ground units or environment of any kind, just 4 standalone, study-sim level WWII aircraft. IL-2 flight models are targeted to be within 5% margins of error, and are often adjusted to even tighter tolerances when available flight data allows. There are some outlying issues however, most notably the Fw-190A3 (UPDATE: Fw-190A3 Has now been fixed) and P-40E-1. The former having issues with stick travel to stall and roll rate, and the P-40 incorrectly being rated at post-war, peacetime power settings. Also of note is the fact that the Battle of Moscow expansion pack aircraft have notably more realistic rudder/roll relationships, as shown by the Bf.109 E-7 to F-4 comparison often cited on the official forum. Both the Fw-190 and rudder issues have been confirmed to be getting fixes, and the devs have stated they are looking into the P-40. The Fw-190 issue in particular will be backported from the new Fw-190A5 coming with the Battle of Kuban expansion, regardless of whether or not the Fw-190A-3 owner purchases BoK. This has, in my eyes, (especially with the free DX11 update in Dec. 2016) shown that the developers not only care about the product, but are willing to continue work and updates to years old work in order to improve the sim as a whole.

												This is one of the best sims on the market, and the current definitive sim for Stalingrad and Moscow in the early to mid-war.There is a steep learning curve, and reading is definitely required.This sim truly shines online with scenario based events and on-going wars such as TAW, which you can read about/sign up for on the IL-2 forums.  The community is incredibly diverse, from all over the globe, but the vast majority are helpful to a fault.If you are a fan of WW2, flying, combat, or any combination of the above, this game will not disappoint.That being said, it is by no means something you're going to jump in and dominate on day one, unless you're a dedicated simmer.

												Simulator with awesome physics, accurate plane models (accurate in both flight model and look), stunning picture and... it works! It is not yet a monster with crazy amount of content like first Il-2 became after 10 years of development, but it is much fun and it is just the best thing you can earn if you want to get into air battle in WW2 plane cockpit. No matter if you are old Il-2 veteran or just want to try the taste of the sky for the first time. There are a lot of guides in communty and piloting realistic virtual warbird it is much easier than most people think.So, everything is simple: if you are somehow interested in flying airplane into battle, or whant to try and find out if you are, buy this game. The feel of flight it gives is really amasing and unique. (I flew almost all WW2 flight sims and I know what I'm talking about).			"

												I have played nearly every flightsim on the pc market (and the amiga before that) to date.Most sims are locked in procedures , buttons you have to click preparations you have to make. But something is missing there, that world does not really come to life (I love DCS for example , but it sometimes feels like too perfect). AI oponnents are either superhuman or helpless canonfodderI always had that soft spot for sims that are actually about the flying itself, fighting the sick and gravity and gliding that wing. IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad, does actually that , the ju52 actually flies different from the FW190, you just feel so powerfull in the wulf and helpless in the junkers. And then you did not press that damn trigger yet.Every plane is actually a different experience, its fun to fly the i16 and score on the bf109. This sim is never the same , things happen and you never know what to expect.yes some things are ""missing"" , the clickable cockpits it a thingy but no pilot had a mouse in the cockpit and mouses work fine in helos and jets but not in wobbly bobbly prop fighters.Map out the buttons , print a button sheet like in the old days , you will see ur soooo much faster than moving the mouse around to adjust prop pitch.A little more content (ground armour) would be nice , and i would love to fly a four prop bomber. (BIG EYES PLEAASSEEE)The developer learned a lot and is committed to show you history, that effort costs money , but if thats a point ,wait for the discounts ;) . Stop reading , go flying ( oh yeah those tanks can show you the game in another perspective) Highly recommended			"

												Gorgeous, unforgiving, and amazingly fun. This game had the potential to be one of the best flight sims ever. Yet development was infected by the modern gaming disease called ""JustPlayMultiplayer-itis""    Absent are the massive story-driven missions that made so many older sims unforgettable. History and scale that would never happen in a multiplayer match. Instead replaced by Generic Objective Maker with no context or sense of importance. That said, its a beautiful game and getting in any plane, taxiing out, taking off, and flying around is so enjoyable you forget you're supposed to drop a bomb on somebody. A wonderful addition to the IL2 series and a fantastic flight sim, just wish modern gaming hadnt given it the cancers of unlocks, DLC planes, and singleplayer-isnt-important "

												I recently got IL-2 BOS because of the raving reviews, and had to see what this was all about. I got DCS some time ago, which was impressive. But IL-2 BOS blows this confidently out of the sky in terms of the immersion and graphics. This simulation is truly a work of art. Personally, it's my killer VR app. This is it. I don't care about anything else in my games library, now. I only care to hop on to my personal Bf 109 and take to the skies. Sometimes, high in the sky, I blow off the canopy and stick my head into the incoming airstream, lol. The sensation is exhilarating and indescribable. The experience is viceral.I can't talk much about the game play or campaigns yet, but I will get there. At the moment, I'm simply getting to grips with learning to fly and appreciate these beautiful beasts from yesteryear, and having a hell of a fun time at the same time.Thank you devs for giving us this amazing experience!

												Sims always require a learning curve. But few titles actually let you enjoy learning them. As with Rise of Flight, Il-2 BOS builds a world and it uses each plane to let you express yourself in that world. When IL-2 BOS makes compromises, it does so in the name of quality of simulation. Simulators are not a dying breed, anymore than they were back in the 2000s, when only IL-2 1946 refused to let the dream die. But quality is dying. Few teams are willing to go the extra mile, to make the extra effort. IL-2 BOS went beyond that, and they haven't stopped yet. 20 years ago, when I've played my first sim, I had a dream, that one day I would be able to feel that I am flying, in a sim, in my room. Now, with VR, a decent joystick and a few more gray hairs on my head, that dream has been fulfilled. Make no mistake, this is the killer VR app we've been waiting for. As for the sim players, you're probably here already anyway.			"

												The very best WW2 Era combat flight simulator on the market at this point in time in my opinion. Very good physics and flight models where even the ambient temperature will have to be considered during a mission. adjustable realism settings for those who don't want to experience the harsh reality of the Eastern Front lolVery good multiplayer with a great community following, Do thoroughly suggest a purchase if you are in the market for a WW2 CFS			"

												IL-2 in VR is fantastic and is thoroughly great fun and immersive. As VR improves games like IL-2 will also get more interest and patronage because in my opinion flying WW2 aircraft is a great place for VR to display its value. IL-2  BOS is a great game !			"

												Before you read this review, you must know that to play this game a joystick is required. Yes, I know the page says you can use mouse and keyboard, but mouse and keyboard just don't work in simulators. I recommend the Logitech 3D Pro joystick because it has a lot of buttons available on the stick, has rudder built in, is fairly cheap (about $40), and has a nice throttle control in the front. In fact, I only use this joystick and nothing else, and I still have a lot of success flying. The game is pretty fun, and I haven't even played that long! The sheer joy of your first take off is enough to warrant buying this game in my opinion! I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I'm sure I'll get destroyed! :3			"

												Don't let yourselves be fooled by the title : This isn't an Il-2 series title. It features an Il-2 as part of the planeset, and the action takes place on the Eastern front during WWII, but the similarities end there. This game is 777 Studio's ""Rise Of Flight"" with WWII planes in a WWII setting. Bland environment, empty battlefields, a very disappointing SP experience and paid unlocks and flyable planes. In fact, ""Il-2 BoS"" may well be the very antithesis of what made the original Il2 such a great and long-running sim. I do not recommend this title to fans of the original Il-2 series, although RoF afficionados might appreciate the change of scenery within a familiar format.			"

												I'm amazed at this game. Here's my experience:I look over my shoulder to see my wingman in a line abreast formation a couple hundred meters away. His 6 o'clock is clear and I glance anxiously above every so often for the cold contrails of a 109 on the hunt, looking to bounce us. The snowy Russian steppe stretches out beneath us. Sunlight filters through a broken layer of low clouds. We flit in and out of them periodically. My engine drones on and I adjust the RPM setting. The engine note rumbles lower. I lean over the edge of the cockpit window and verify my fuel gauge reads above 20. I adjust the mixture setting. Again. I glance at my comrade. THERES AN AIRCRAFT DIVING ON HIS HIGH 6! ""BREAK BREAK BREAK!"", I yell. I slam the throttle and prop controls to FULL and dive after them. This $UC*ER is not getting my wingman I think to myself. And the game is on...ONE. WORD.IMMERSION!Play this game if thats what you are looking for in a WW2 air combat sim. Nothing else comes close.Oh, and learn to taxi. Thats is all.  :)			"

												I'm not sure I can play the old IL-2 1946 any more after owning IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad - it will seem way too easy.  I got the Moscow pre-release planes too - $160 within two days.  Could it possibly be worth that much?  What, ten or twelve bucks per flyable plane? Having spent probably something near that total figure on 777's other brilliant sim, Rise of Flight  and owning all those WWI aircraft and many paid plane mods, and knowing I'd do it all again, yes, it is worth that much to an old flight simmer like me.  I'll pay good money for a unique and excellent product.  It's probably the closest thing so far to flying the real things, though of course that is a guess.  I've never actually flown a LAG 3 but the sim just feels right. This game makes me feel very immersed and I am really enjoying it.  I am doing campaigns now - great fun.    I've already got half the paint schemes unlocked on three planes.  Very challenging flight models, gunnery, landings, etc.  Looks great - graphics are top notch.  Seemingly for serious simmers, but everyone should give it a try if you love these old aircraft and the period history.  Buy a decent joystick - keyboard and mouse won't do.   I got the premium packages because I couldn't wait to fly all the birds.  Get this game and get ready to practice your stick and rudder, as well as shooting skills.  Thank you very much, 777 Studios.  Flight simmers can count on you to keep the fire burning !!!			"

												The most realistic and immersive PC sim I have ever played. The flight characteristics of the aircraft is very realistic. The only thing I'm missing is a full motion simulator. I certainly hope that expansions can be made off this platform for U.S. and Great Britain. Damage modelling is still somewhat of a concern. The fuselage is usually one piece up to the mid tail. No worries, though. The planes react accurately to damage other than the visuals.			"

												The game had a really bumpy start, with weird design choices for the campaign, forced unlocks in single-player, auto-scaling AI where the player has zero control over how difficult it is, very restricted multiplayer servers, non-existing custom missions, and poor optimization.I'm really glad to see that basically all of the above is fixed. There are now a lot of custom servers online after the editor was made publicly available, some with really impressive campaigns, the game now supports DX11 instead of only DX9 which has done wonders for optimization, proper VR support is on the way, flight models have been improved across the board, Battle of Kuban will come with a dynamic campaign, the unlock-crap has been partially solved since it wasn't popular, and we're seeing a lot of interesting options coming for plane loadouts and even in new planes.777 Studios dropped the ball pretty hard in the beginning, but they've certainly picked it up and are doing wonders at this point. IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad/Moscow/Kuban has become truly amazing! One of the best ""saves"" by a developer well on the way towards failure that I've seen to date.			"

												If you are a fan of flight sims, you need to get this one! Recaptures almost all of what was great about the original IL-2 series. Sure there are bugs, but not like CLoD, this one is playable right out of the box and looks amazing. The flight model doesn't feel as ""real"" as it could, but it is a challenge to fly it well (especially landings!). I know alot of people are whining about the unlocks, but seriously you dont even notice it everything unlocks so quickly. What, you werent going to fly it for hours offline anyway?Hopefully they are working on multiplayer where you can host your own missions. That would be outstanding.			"

												Greedy cash in by the devs, terrible flight physics, boring maps, no ""war"" going on, just small skirmishes. DLC in pre-release, which, I'd actually tolerate if the rest of the game were amazing and it were obvious they really were putting extra effort in.Disappointing in almost every respect once you get past the initial newness of it.Also, it has the single stupidest fanbase of ANY game that I've written a review on; they seem to honestly believe that these steam reviews, which in this case were posted a full year after the game was initally put into early release, will have a significant effect on sales still, and the only way they can ""save their game"" is to complain, loudly, on reviews like this one about how wonderful everything in-game is and how the reviewers just don't understand and probably aren't pilots yadda yadda. They're actually worse than DayZ fanboys, and they have absolutely no self-awareness of any of this.			"

												pros: fun game for flying ww2 planes flown by the luftwaffe and soviet air force in 1942-43good campaigngreat graphics very realisticvery good damage model and physicscan control almost everything on the planecan fly various classes of airplanes,like fighters,ground attack aircraft,bombers and i believe they will add morefun multiplayerbig enough maps to fly in, honestly even taking off and flying around the map is fun in this gamehas various fun missionscan fly around in various weather conditions and times of the day, can make a custom mission where you decide everythingexpert mode for even more realism where you have to manually do a lot of stuff to get the plane ready to take offdevelopers seem to be concerned about improving the game consistently and seem to be objective (i.e not soviet fanboys) unlike some other developers. no op planes in my opinioncons: having a good enough joystick is a must, need to spend more money just to play an already expensive game if you are not  into flight simulators, more of a simulator than an arcade game(ok some people would prefer a simulator so maybe this is not a con) so it takes a long time to even learn to take off,land and fly properly(still havent perfected landing) and a long time to master and learn everything. of course it will be easier if you have something to do with aviation in real life, some of my friends are able to grasp concepts of the game much more easily because they are into aviationexpensivehas dlc planes that are also too expensive(seriously, cant be 30 dollars for just 1 plane)you may be better off buying il-2 cliffs of dover,looks nice enough and has as much contentif you have a laptop with a dedicated and an integrated graphics card the game somehow runs with integrated graphics even though its very demanding, can manually switch that to dedicated gpu to fix it though(this may have been fixed)			"

												This game is GREAT! I got it for Christmass, and it's by far the best Flight Sim I've ever played. I'm a WWII avation lover, and this game is spot on. I'd bet money that most of the reviews that are negative are because the authors arn't very good at flying. With this in mind, this IS an expensive game. Therefore, in case you can't fly well, I'd advise you try some free-to-play flight sims first, like Warthunder, to make sure that you are the sort of person who likes flight simulators before spending a ton of money on this. This is FAR better than Warthunder though (as would be expected, Warthunder is free-to-play, this isn't), with better graphics, aerodynamics, and just an all-around feeling of pure awesomeness as you fly your Bf-109 G-2 or LaGG-3 ser.29 through the smoke of a guy you just downed.10/10, a MUST HAVE for WWII avation lovers!

												Like all games ever nowadays, this has been released as a pre-release of what could be a really really great game but may never actually get there.Even so, it offers the best atmosphere and realism possible in an approachable package for a reasonable amount of money. The complexity of flying is scalable, so one can just have fun shooting at other airplanes rather than spending hours upon hours learning why a BF-109 hasn't got elevator trim but a FW-190 does. However, if you do like that sort of thing, IL-2's latest iteration includes a sophisticated flight model and systems complexity nearly on par with DCS (I said NEARLY; lay off, DCS fanboys/fangirls). Since you get a whole simulator, campaign mode, and a variety of aircraft for the price of one DCS aircraft, that seems like a good deal to me.TL;DR: pretty, pedantic, promising, pre-release. ""We are still working on it"", but the hard work shows.			"

												This game is absolutely a gem. Every single aspect of the game are exemplary and this is arguably the best game in the IL-2 Sturmovik franchise yet. Sure, I haven't played the game that excessively much yet, but trust me, it is. The multiplayer feature is working perfectly, but the controls can be significantly difficult to learn in the beginning. I also think it's a shame that the campaign mode of the game is blatantly too limited, and that more levels should be added. I sincerely suggest that you should buy it on♥♥♥♥♥or a similar website, though, since the price is considerably high. Anyway, if you enjoy WW2 combat flight simulators and all the other games in the franchise, I recommend this to you. "

												Ok, So im not going to lie. When i was thinking of buying this i thought ""its just going to be like IL2 Cliffs Over Dover (Clod for short) but now in russia. MAN I WAS WRONG!! For those of you that have played the oringal IL2: 1946 this IL2 is more like that!! The cockpits arnt fully clickable to my knowledge but you forgive that when you only 100m in the air skimming buildings whilst looking at your oponents tail with all the bullet holes in it. Trying to keep this short if you was to buy anyt WWII fighter game for now this will be it. I would say its unfair to relate it to cliffs over dover as it has all the RAF planes. Battle of Stalingrad has a different style of simulation where i beleive its the Dogfight/ground attack you are simulating rarther than the aircraft itself. Yes, you still manage your egine, flaps, RPM take offs, landings, turning your plane on/off but it will will be pressing  ""L"" to turn your lights on rather looking for the switch. Also it will tell you in the corner what type of failure you have if you get hit. As ever the failures are realistic as useual and it will be up to you as the pilot to decide wither to turn back and go home or to see if you can survive one last bombrun. I cant stress enough that this is still a simulator and should be treated as such. But i really think that that hint of arcade message in the corner that says "" Egine coolent system Damaged"" or ""right Airlon Rod Stuck"" reminds you that this is also a game and its here to be played rather than to be taken seriously! Bottom line is. Buy it.... its fun!!			"

												I really enjoy this game and I really think that the developers really did do a good job. The graphics and flight physics are amazing and the game is just really immersive. There are a couple problems which I think the developers should really consider; I know that this has been getting a lot of attention already but I must bring it up, the unlocking of accesories. I have a mixed idea about this but, I had to spend hours grinding in repetitive missions for quite some time. This is not really what the community and I want. Now, I said my opinion was mixed, doing these missions do make getting stuff a little bit more enjoyable and you can get some practice out of the missions although if you dont know how to fly certain aircraft from outside knowledge, you might have some trouble flying in online. Another problem is the price. I understand this is a world run by capitalism but I feel like $20 for a Focke Wulf and another $20 for an LA-5 is a little pricey. Besides the little bugs that I expect to be fixed and the 2 major problems, I absolutley love this game and I cant wait for Battle of Moscow to be out!			"

												This is by far, the best flight sim I've ever played. I have yet to see a flight sim that rivals this game in terms of physics and damage models. And as a player who used to play Warthunder beforehand I've noticed a huge difference in the game. And I had to basically relearn everything from taxiing, actual combat, and landing.Each plane has been meticulously designed and rendered in great detail. From the instruments on the cockpit, to the way the plane behaves. Every plane has it's own unique features that make it stand out from the rest. And that is all complemented by the awesome graphics this game has.Be mindful that this game has a steep learning curve, it's not your typical flight sim. Overall, I highly recommend this game to all you flight sim enthusiasts who want to have a  real  flight sim experience. Pros:	- Great physics.- Awesome graphics- True to life aircraft recreations, all down to the last detail.- A very helpful playerbase Cons: - Very steep learning curve, you won't get any ""easy kills"" unless you have a proper understanding of how your plane works.- Issues with server connectivity.- Occasional unbalanced matches.- Small playerbase, but still a great and helpful community nonetheless.

												If your thinking about buying this I would say think good and hard...Do you like a challenge, If yes then go for it it is an absolutely amazing gameHowever if it is a no I would say buy it but maybe wait alittle, go get war thunder, track ir, and a good flight stickobviusly you dont have to do any of that however it is EXTREMELY helpful.When I bought this I wasnt sure I liked it because of how hard it was so I ended up refunding it,,, Now Im not sure I should have, I have been playing war thunder quite abit recently and I have been getting better at dogfights and air to ground combat...Yes I know it really shouldnt be compared to war thunder but I am comparing it any way.If you like ww2, air combat, and a good challenge GET THIS If not, give it a little time get better at flying and fighting and then when you head into this game the challenge may still be there just not as present			"

												WOW !! I had this game on my wishlist for a year I think, before I decided to give it a try. It wasnt even on sale, and went on sale a week after I bought it, I was enjoying it so much I didnt even care. This is the reason for my HOTAS right now. The game really puts you there in the planes, the immersion is deep, the learning curve is steep ( and rewarding) and the ground is unflinching when you plummit to your demise. There are so many little things in this game that I like, the noise that your plane makes when its taken a few too many hits, the sense of accomplishment when you finally stick a post misson landing and get that 50% bonus for actually landing in one piece. The OH CRAP feeling when you unsettle your attack approch by shooting rockets off one at a time and upset the glide path of your plane etc etc etc , I really like it I swear I can smell the exhaust when I start up for a mission. I liked it so much I went and bought 1/72 models of my favorite planes to put together ha ha ha ha . Oh and the multiplayer is pretty cool too, although not a huge number of people I have been able to join at least one server anytime to find other players to annoy with my noob_ness. A cool touch also for the multiplayer is being able to crew a gun station on a friends plane and vise-versa. If you like a no-bs sim style combat game this may be for you. The only negatives that I have for this game is that it is centered around a specific time and place, and that means a limited assortment of aircraft to fly. I understood this going in ( its all in the name after all) but I would love to see the scope of this game expanded. I dont hold this against the game, but I could see how some may have no interest in the specific planes on offer, so make sure you know what is included before making a decision. the second negative is the somewhat low number of players in multiplayer, there are enough to get into a game generally during most times, the servers arent exactly bursting full. ( the unfortunate side effect being you will play with alot of the same people) this I hope will improve over time. thats all i have to say . One of the esiest thumbs up I have given yet.			"

												Alot of the reviews for this game state that its ""not what I had hoped for "" or ""dissapointing"". I was really worried when purchasing this but Im really glad I did. I played Il2 Cliffs of Dover casually as the game was a bit of a strain for me (the cockpits were so well detailed it actually hurt my eyes, framerate was generally not great, UI was awful) even so I expected a great deal of detail and polish in Il2 Battle of Stalingrad and it definitely has it. In my opinion one of the most important parts of an immersive simulator are the sound effects and this game has it spot on, the engines and various other effects sound great and authentic. The graphics are quite good as well (especially the aircraft). The game itself plays very well with  aircraft responding realistically to stalling and rough maneuvering. The game while not great as far as optimization goes still runs better than Cliffs of Dover and even when low in framrate still runs strangely smooth. The damage models are very detailed with basically any part of the aircraft being able to come off (I must've spent 3 hours plowing aircraft into the ground watching the wings flex and break). The UI is well designed and a staggering improvement from the one seen in Cliffs of Dover.But there are also a few low point in the game like the lack of clickable cockpits. One of my favorite point of Cliffs of Dover was having the completely manual control of aircraft and while Battle of Stalingrad does support it with keyboard binding available I much rather have the option of clickable cockpits. The game can also get repedetive as far as the campaign goes with you generally having the same objectives dependent on which mission type you select. But even with that in consideration I still come back to Il2 daily.I got Il2 BoS for $30 over a sale and at that price its a good deal, but at $50 im not sure I can recommend it. So wait for a sale and definitely pick it up if you have even a moderate fondness for aircraft simulators (like I do).			"

												This is a good game, unfortunately, im having problems with FPS. I probably need a better computer. This is probably the trigger that will get me to buy a new desktop, one with maybe a better graphics card. If you have a good graphics card already, and you feel patriotic about WWII, then this game is for you :). The scenery is goreous (but not all rainbows and happiness sort of gorgeous).			"

												IL-2 BoS is sort of like War Thunder minus all the things I hated about War Thunder.That's going to be controversial, because a lot of people are posting reviews doing everything they can to prove that IL-2 is //NOTHING!!!// like War Thunder... but it is. And that's not a bad thing!BoS hits the same ""accessible realism"" point that something like War Thunder (mainly sim mode, but ""normal"" settings in BoS include markers and automatic engine management) hits. Neither are the rivet-counting, absolute to the metal fidelity that something like DCS strives to be (I play a lot of DCS too, by the by), but both War Thunder (outside of arcade battles) and BoS are VERY far from the more arcadey, easy to learn experience that an air combat game like Crimson Skies might be. BoS even has an experimental mouse-aim mode for potential aviators who don't have joysticks, though from what I understand the implementation is very rough around the edges at the moment.The main differences in BoS and War Thunder are why I much prefer the former to the latter. War Thunder's primary problems are the free-to-play grind that you have to expect from... well, a free-to-play game (BoS has a progression system that is a tooooouch grindy, as well, but none of the unlocks are really game changing and you can grind them out in singleplayer if you want), and the very questionable flight models and balancing that everyone just sort of accepts as standard from the game now. In BoS, you won't be clubbed by a fighter that's severely over-performing, and you won't be crippled for flying an aircraft you enjoy because it under-performs or finds itself facing unreasonably stiff opposition. Honestly, in BoS, most of the (fighter) aircraft are pretty evenly matched- even the premiums (I fear the 109 pilot over the 190). I've even had semi-successful engagements flying a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed IL-2 up against fighters, because at the end of the day a skilled pilot (which I am not- hence the SEMI-successful nature of those engagements) will win no matter his aircraft... and the IL-2 has much better low speed performance than any fighter in the game so dragging♥♥♥♥♥♥sure Bubi-wannabes into low-speed duels is a very good way to embarass the Luftwaffe.All these comparisons to War Thunder aside- you will need a joystick to fully enjoy IL-2: BoS. Preferably one with a rudder axis (Rudder is SUPER IMPORTANT on these old prop aircraft for managing sideslip) and a throttle flapper. You can find a stick like that for like $15-$20, usually. Also, some form of headtracking makes dogfighting, especially on full-realism servers without markets, MUCH easier (maintaining situational awareness is a big part of being a successful combat pilot)- you can build a headtracker with rudimentary knowledge of how to solder and about $30 in materials, or if you have an android smartphone I hear that there are ways to use that, strapped to a headset or something, to get 3-DOF (as in, you won't be able to lean around in the cockpit, but you can look left and right and up and down) headtracking that works decently well. If you're not able or willing to do any of those, you can map your view controls to a hat on your joystick or something, and that should be serviceable.So yeah- If you enjoyed War Thunder when it wasn't harassing you with awful game design and sketchy as frig flight models, and you're okay with a more limited roster of flyable aircraft, AND you're okay with flying with a joystick (until the devs polish mouse aim), pick this game up. It's enormous fun, even flying ground attack or a bomber like the Peshka or the Heinkel (though I do wish you could get magnetic bearing to target in those aircraft, flying bombing approaches on smaller targets without it is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥, and you'll end every fight with a dumb grin even if its you who ended up a fiery ball of dead airplane on the ground. And if you're more a study-sim guy (like I am, honestly), don't gloss over BoS as just-another-WWII-plane-game, it's plenty realistic enough that really only noncombat systems are streamlined (and radios, but we all know you fly with easy communication on in DCS, anyway).

												I don't have crashing issues on this game so I feel for the people disliking the game for those reasons but everyone else is just a filthy casual. If you want to unrealistically swoop through the sky and get ez kills go play war thunder, but if you want a real sim, something that actually resembles real warfare, this game does that wonderfully.  Get a joystick and trackIR or a vive and it's go time boyo.  Also my game time is much much higher than 3 hours but it doesnt track my time since the game exe launches through Thrustmaster Target software for some reason.			"

												I bought this game before it released at steam and played it 200 hour at least I think.It was great once. Until 1.006 update, it have great FM, DM, graphics... Campaign was♥♥♥♥♥♥ but no one care about that. I loved this game at that time. After 1.007 update it going worse. Lots of flight sim gamers are tired about the words ""Russian bias"". However it is completely ture in this game. For example, Yak-1's flap make insanely huge lift without drag. With full flap, Yak-1 can turn like the cat chasing its own tail. Of course without stall. They said ""there is no information about Yak-1's flap, so we made it like that."". I have soviet official document about Yak-1. Recommand tactics to Bf109F included there, but there is no word about flap. Not even one word.LaGG-3 and La-5 is invincible. It can hold out lots of german 20mms. Even it made of woods. Yeah, maybe Saint Stalin saved them. Even in illustrations, you can find their ""patriotism"". You cannot find any illustration soviet plane shotdown by german one. The onlything you can find is reverse situation.Do not buy this game, if you want play flight. It have nothing better than War Thunder. If you really want to play WW2 flight sim game, buy DCS 1944 or IL-2 Cliffs of Dover with Team fusion mod 4.312(TF mod is free). If you buy it, they will think they doing good.			"

												So far the best ww2 flight combat sim I've ever played. Taxing on CPU so make sure you have a good one for best performance. As of latest patch 2.009c it is AWESOME!!. Realistic flight model and beautiful graphics. Dust off your joysticks fellow old timers. Everyone else do yourself a favour get a joystick or hotas and check this bad boy out. Have a load of your buddies flying in a bomber together or make a squadron with some friends. Be a lone wolf a hunt all by your lonesome. No matter how you play it's great. Now they also have VR for those interested and apparently it's really good. If you have never tried a flight sim what are you waiting for? Get Battle of Stalingrad and start dropping 109s or yaks your choice and see where it goes from there. Bet you'll end up wanting more and not in a bad way!			"

												The best WWII flight sim you can buy right now and a fair value considering the fidelity of each plane. You should have a flight stick and a head tracker to get the most control and fun. For the headtracker I use Opentrack with Aruco (printed shape sized about 3.5in x 3.5in) and a PS3 Eye cam. This cost like $5 for camera, $5 shipping, $3 CL PS3 Eye Driver, Opentrack $-free (thanks to Opentrack devs). Under correct lighting this works real good. Later on you might be able to switch to LEDS with this camera. For the flight stick a lot of people start with the Thrustmaster T16000m, now there's also VKB sticks, I use an old Saitek AV8R-01. If you got an interest in flight sims you should have an interest in owning a flight stick, so get one and you can use it with other sims too.			"

												This game has one of the best atmopheres for flight. Offline and online mode. Really good flight feeling and good sounds. Devs engage with the friendly community and they continue to work on fixes and new dlc. Collector extra / 'premium' planes are not super planes vs standard edition planes so provide a different experience rather than being a must have for online play. Ideally need a joystick, but basic mouse mode is an option.Hard game, but this makes for money well spent. I've played this game on and off steam since release and I still learn new things.			"

Highly recomended. You do need a hotas and you need to spend some time setting it up properly but once its done its very rewarding. This isnt a game, tho it could be in ''easy mode''. Its a full blown ww2 combat flight simulator with extremly highly detailed 3d moddelling and Fantastic flight dynamics. This is something youll keep coming back to time and again for years to come.It does lack a classic dynamic campain but the campain is well done and something differnt.Could do with pushing the campain to western front tho i love to see what these guys can do with a spitfire hurricane Northern France/English coast senario.

The sensation of flight is superb, the aircraft are beautiful, my first circuit and cross wind landing in a bf109F was a highlight, I was fully immersed. The game is beautiful, offline this is much better for a new player than Cliffs of dover.However the game is still not completely smooth FPS and spotting planes is a lot harder than in Cliffs of Dover, Ill not be venturing online for a while and still see Cliffs of dover as the best multiplayer option.

It may be a little pricey, but it's worth paying for if you enjoy this type of game to support the genre. This is a simulator, not a game so don't get mad if you have a steep learning curve if you're new to the genre.

												It almost feels like you are flying. I've been playing flight sims for the past 20 years and this games nails the sensation of flight better than any other. Multiplayer is a blast and it takes less than 30 seconds from the time you launch the game to the time you are flying on a server. It is also deep but accessible. You can play on Normal servers with radar, tagging of planes, a HUD, and autopilot or you can play on Expert servers with none of these assists. So why all the bad reviews? Here is a summary of the most common:""I can't get it to work!"" Read the install instructions and register online. You only have to do it once and it is the least invasive DRM on Steam.""DLC and unlocks have no place in an unfinished flight sim."" I can't disagree, especially since the German FW190 is only available as DLC. This was the second most iconic German fighter of the war and should have been made available to all from the start. The Russian La-5 was seldom flown so that is understandable as DLC but the German offering should have been one of the two variations of the 109 Messerschmitt already in the game. Even if you do not take part in the DLC or unlocks, IL-2 BOS has the most enjoyable online dogfights out there and is a worthwhile purchase for anyone interested in a combat flight sim.			"

												IL2 Stalingrad and Moscow have really come a long way since first released (more like a rough work in progress Beta initially).  They have been good about releasing on-going upgrades, and though not perfect, I think its better than alternatives out there for the mix of sim and immersion.  Not as sim as the prior Cliffs of Dover, but MUCH more playable (without the 3rd party Mods, it was broken). DCS has some great stuff as well, but missing the WWII environment (or not without a lot of modding effort).  With their recent Kuban expansion plans, it shows commitment to meaningful continued improvements.  I'm really glad I hung in there and have seen IL2 develop to the point it is now, especially with the pending improvements.  As for gripes, I believe they have a bit of Soviet bias in the modeling, but its liveable and I hope it sees some tweaks.  Single player ""story"" at the moment is a bit weak, but once flying in game, its good.   Kuban related releases upcoming are addressing the single player aspect.			"

												This flight simulation is AWESOME!The feeling of speed as you fly through clouds is unsurpassed.The flight models are so demanding, in combat, that you barely notice the landscape.The feeling of being in a war zone is well simulated, with columns of smoke, vehicles, and ground AA fire.The planes are magnificient and the air to air combat is outstandingly portrayed.It's amazing when a true love comes back better than before.Welcome back IL2.........Wow.You that don't understand my review, this game is AWESOME!Maybe that helps.

												Taxiing: Bloody hard. Tailspins...sheesh....crazy stuff. But once you get sorted, pointing straight down the runway open the throttle slowly...and away you go...open your oil radiator, inlet/outlet cowls a bit...and varoom, you're flying. After the learning curve of taking off, flying the planes is a short lived relief...then you gotta spend a few hours or more learning how to land without cracking up your airplane. It's really frustrating in the beginning, so be prepared to practice these things again and again. Then there's combat. By Gum there's stone cold air aces out there, and they will flame you more than you like  until you learn the rudiments of combat. I recommend trying against the AIs for a bit, till you get a bit more comfy with combat, including the fact that these aircraft can be very unforgiving on you if you abuse them. Spins will be common, and half the fun is learning how to get out of them. I find Cliffs of Dover to be a better sim in many ways, but this one is no slouch. It is also a lot of fun with a great community of ""pilots""...so yes, I recommend it. 4/5 stars.			"

												Pros:+true combat flight sim experience+reasonably well graphics for a modern flight simulation+great sound and damage effects+authentic flight models and no russian bias like in other russian made ""simulations""+actively played on multiplayer+still in devellopement: with ""Battle of Moscow"" and later probably more DLC's comming up   this game will stay in the attention focus of players and will be part of something bigger in the future.Cons:-Very demanding on pc's performance espacially the CPU-There are issues with the view range. You won't see planes that are further away then 10km at all and everything further then 3km is very hard to spot.-The singleplayer campaign is pretty liveless and boring (they are improving it though)-No clickable cockpits like in ""Cliffs of Dover""A few words on the pricing and DLC politics:If you think Battle of Stalingrad is expensive keep in minde that producing flight sims is at least as expensive if not more expensive then producing a mainstream game that is supposed to be bought by houndred thousands players.But flight sims aren't bought by houndred thousands players as the playerbase for such titles is quite small.Thus the ""high"" price. Even though I can understand that the company needs to make money with the game I think cutting out planes from the game isn't the best solution (Fw-190/La-5) but at least those planes aren't ""pay to win"" in the multiplayer. My recomendation: If you want these planes, simply wait for a sale to get them cheaper.The splitting of the game in big DLC's and working on them one after another to add to a greater game is in my oppinion a great idea.  For one: this makes sure that every single part of the game is finished in a state that actually can be called finished. Flight sims are prone for bugs and flight models that are simply a bit off. Thats why they need time to ""grow the beard"". By splitting the project in peaces the game gets time to do that. (Think of what happened to Cliffs of Dover: Big game, took to long and cost to much money to finish and was rushed to the marked in a horrible state.)For now the patches of ""Battle of Moscow"" with its planes are allready integrated in ""Battle of Stalingrad"" even if you haven't purchased BoM. The only difference is, that you will not be able to fly its planes  untill you buy BoM. Still you will come across BoM's planes in singleplayer and multiplayers as allies and opponents.All in all I think Battle of Stalingrad is a fun flight sim with a promising future.(Fun enough to be a reason for me to replace my stoneage CPU)			"

												Lots of points to take on this game.My previous review has been rendered unfair to this title.Graphics: amazing, you will not feel any lack of believability worth of taking out performance. There's a lack of graphic options but this subject has been discussed to entirety on the forums; head there to take notes. The way it's done is adequate to multiplayer.Performance: I had flawless performance on my previous CPU, a dual core intel E7500. Upgraded to a i5 and it's marvelous.i5 4590 + gtx670 2gb + 8gb RAM on max settings.Multiplayer is being the most demanded feature now on games, fair enough. Battle of Stalingrad had a underwhelming release. It was far from broken, or bad release, but the features in it were not quite there.Now, BoS still counts with a very active community and passionate about the genre. Steady activities of Wings of Liberty (hardcore full sim with navigation assistance) servers and the normal difficulty ones (not my thing).Overall, multiplayer is amazing. New missions come and go on the servers and generally the players care about the objectives. If bored on those kind of missions and want more elaborated ones, you can take yourself to the mission editor on the game root file, make one and send to the server's hosts, exchange ideas, participate on the community.Single player is fun, not quite the thing I expected coming from RoF but is playable and offers immersion. Differently from the release, single player missions have more AI activity, is common to encounter other fights in the path of your objective or when returning to base.Physics: The best on the market. The damage model is unsurpassed since RoF. 777 studios really put love into this.Combat: as physics, probably the also best in the market. You can rip wings off from your oponent with a flow of structural damage unique. Belly landing with precision of forces. Cartridges explosion with HE cannon shells on the wings. Engine damage and fire damage adequately modeled. Tons of parts to rip off from the plane you'll feel that every shot down is unique in a certain way. Some adjustments are made into the flight model here and there, but certainly it got better since release and expect to be even more refined as more people get into the sim.Simulation vs arcade: It's a simulator.... but DCS has clickable cockpits....... yes, it still a simulator. Philosophies differs from other flight sims and combat sims. 777 studios kept a rather controversy philosophy in relation to pilot/player workload, but the rest are there, planes feel alive, fuel consumption, temperatures, real engine values from real life, it's all there.It's THE most lively experience of flying I've ever encountered in a desktop simulator. DCS comparison can be drawn with discussing it's differences. I freaking love DCS world (non steam standalone) and have a ton of hours in it, but both these sims have disadvantages and advantages in distinct areas. Both are amazing.New expansions are coming, new planes and updates to single player and world.A new summer map for BoS is in the merge of releasing with a ton other fixes and improvements.Before stopping my BoS gameplay in late 2014 - early 2015 I gave it a 6/10 for the actual features and state of it at the time. Now I can give a 7.5 with very solid hopes to surpass 9 points with great future expansions and features.Somewhat, it's a good time to be a flight simmer.			"

TLDR : IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad is fairly limited, has a dull single-player campaign, and a poor multiplayer environment. The flight models are good, but the environment, graphics and sounds feel flat. It feels like a chore to play it.Full review : IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad (IL2:BoS) is a flight simulator set on the Eastern Front at the turning point of the Second World War. The battle and backdrop are epic, but this simulator does not do it justice. Technically, the game engine is pretty good, and the simulation of the flight, damage and world environment are actually quite good. However, the interface, presentation and engagement with the player are poor.There are a limited 8 aircraft in the game that you can fly, with a further two available as premium extras for purchase. Some of these are very similar (e.g. two variants of the Bf 109), making it feel even more limited. The implementations are okay, but there are some bugs which greatly detract from the experience. For example, there is a constantly flashing warning message telling you to retract the landing gear... on a Stuka (an aircraft with fixed undercarriage)! The aircraft have various degrees of automation, which I found frustrating. Another example is that the official paint-schemes are just a random assortment from throughout the war... such as desert camouflage in the Soviet Winter. Again, it doesn't stop gameplay, but it is detracting and unnecessary. Also, many of the interesting systems (radios, radar, navigations, etc.) are not implemented.The graphics are fairly flat, making it feel cartoon-like. The icons/interface overlay is cluttered and confusing. The sounds are okay, but the radio messages sound very repetitive and stilted (like badly automated railway announcements). There are also modern ""beep"" sounds, which detract from the ambiance.There is a multiplayer scene, but it is a bit quiet and lacking depth. However, the real let down is the single-player campaign. Rather than a career, where you can follow the progress of the squadron, get promotion, look after an individual aircraft and feel a sense of being there... the campaign is just a string of missions that feel randomly generated. There is some text and the missions work in themselves, but they feel very canned and lacking in depth. It is difficult to feel committed to them. Yes, there is an overall pilot rank and medals, but they are just for the gamer, and not for each individual career or aircraft.Even the ""unlock system"" is weak. I know that some players hate them. To the contrary, I actually really like the unlocks. It gives you a sense of accomplishing something. However, these unlocks are a bit dull. Just extra bombs or new paintschemes, and it is often possible to bag several at once, removing the sense of accomplishment.Although I've had this title for quite some time, and have an interest in the Eastern Front due to personal connection, I simply have not had any enthusiasm for this title. Given its age, it has already matured, so no significant development can be expected to improve the situation. For an arcade player, there are far more extensive titles. For the hard-core simulator enthusiast, IL2:BoS falls short.I do not recommend this title.			"

												Before reading: I have played this for hundreds of hours but only registered 6h on Steam.This game is an ever evolving product thats shows that the developers really care for it. Throughout the time, updates have been delivered in a regular basis bringing both new features and improvements. The developers listen to the community as well, which makes things great for both ways. Even though there are still some flaws (missing single player career, lack of diversity of gameplay), the future is bright, and long awaited features have been confirmed by the devs.In my opinion, this is the best WWII flight sim in the market, bringing a perfect balance between casual and hardcore gameplay.

												Got this just for a distraction from DCS :) In terms of visuals, sounds and the overall feeling of chucking tons of sheetmetal around in the air, this is quite a remarkable sim! It's spectacular to fly, yet certainly has some quirks.For starters, there's hardly any content. It must have been a lot of work to develop this sim to the point it is today, but while flying the campaign, you get the feeling that there's nothing much going on around you. While trying to fly online, hardly any of the servers have anyone playing, and there's no way to find out what the settings are.For something so well done so far, it could stand a *lot* of improvement simply by tweaking the campaign engine to include more action going on around you, to give the impression of being involved in an actual war... Instead the campaign environment feels rather desolate. It looks amazing, though.So far so good, but still a way to go. Let's say... 3/5. Still recommended, but don't expect too much just yet.EDIT: I bought this on a half-price sale, so it was a pretty good deal, the two DLC aircraft are very expensive though...			"

												This is really really good. A great sequel to the venerable Il-2 series. It's like playing the original, only in HD with the great Rise of Flight engine & graphics. It also features an awesome streamlined campaign with short missions (finally!). Totally makes up for the botched CloD release.My TrackIR messes up a bit more than I'd like but I'm having a lot of fun and $25 for the Junkers transport plane seems worth it. Can't wait to drop some paratroopers!But seriously, short missions, worth its weight in gold. I've been waiting YEARS to see ""press x to warp to next action point"" in a combat flight sim again.

For me the game feels alot more like the throwback il-2.In a word it feels ""tight"" or ""polished."" For those of you that have experience with this fanchise I think you will feel like you are with an old friend. I have no complains due to the fact that there will be content coming from both users and developers alike. I think the path ahead is very bright for BOS.			"

												~HOW TO GET THE MOST FROM BATTLE OF STALINGRAD~-You need a JOYSTICK. Assign ELEVATOR and STABILIZER trims to the vertical axis of the hat switch. Assign ROLL trim to the horizontal axis of the hat switch. Use the hat switch with your thumb to stabilize your airplane in flight. -Adjust the response curve of your joystick in the KEY MAPPING options. There will be an option for all 3 axis of your joystick, ROLL, PITCH, and YAW.  Move the SENSITIVITY slider to between 75% - 90%. If your control response is still too sensitive increase the slider. Decrease the slider if the control response is sluggish.-Developers did not include anything like what most gamers would call a 'Campaign' or 'Story Mode'. BOS has a template for the community to create new scripted campaigns. The game is basically unplayable as a single player without installing some additional campaigns. These are available for free to download at the official forums: https://forum.il2sturmovik.com/ "

												Great game and great flight models.The graphics of the game are way up there.I have a Logictech extreme 3D (I have a Microsoft FF2 stick but Windows abandonedthe support in Win 7).The Logictech works extremely well and is fully supported byLogitech with all drivers and programs.I also have a CH flight controller that worksvery well with easy input functions and  I also have a  Tracker IR 5 Pro.UPDATE on the controllers with BOS there was no controller problems but since the introduction of BOM and new patches the controllers sadly lose their configuation.Graphics as good as ARMA 3 if not better.Complex mission builder for me is a down side if you compare it to ARMA 3 's mission editorit is very complex to give you an idea.The old IL-2 1946 Full mission Builder was a pieceof cake compared to the new BOS mission editor.Multiplayer in my opinion needs a lot of work and I hope it gets better.When the playersthat join exceed 3000 miles the lag gets so high you do not see them coming one minuteyou are flying the next minute you are falling from the sky.There is NO true co-op mod likethe old IL-2 series or ARMA 3co-op mission playing.Single player missions that are made by some very tanlented missions builders run smoothwith zero lag or stuttering.And I stress it again ZERO lag,frame freeze or stuttering.I use ARMA 3 as a reference because I know 100' of thousands of people play it with7-8000 servers running at any given time.You can't just go to the multiplayer section of ARMA 3 click on ''new''  like in ARMA 3 in their server section and type in your server name and the password and just clickstart in seconds.So it is a good game but has a way to go.

Posted: June 12, 2015
												I'm changing my review entirely.  This game took some serious warming up to.  Initially, I really didn't like it, but in the interest of not wasting 60 bucks, I kept at it and things got better.  As soon as the update came out where graphics settings could be tweaked, I finally found myself seeing other people before I was dead so I must admit, this helped a lot towards actually making the game fun.Since this is supposed to be a sim, I'll do my best to list what I feel like the positives and negatives are and what their bearing is on reality.On the plus side, the game is beautiful.  Undeniably, things look great.  This goes a long way to making you feel immersed.  Spotting is great as well.  Depending on where the sun is, the angle of the aircraft and their distance from you, things might get tricky when trying to keep an eye on your prey, pursuer or even your wingman for that matter.  Surface level winds are good as well.  They can cause some serious issues on takeoff and landing if you're not prepared.  Things sound good as well, although I know certain sounds have undergone an overhaul of late, listening to your aircraft can give some important indications as to its behaviour if you choose to turn the HUD off like I do.  Multiplayer is very good.  Don't expect to waltz in and dust everyone because the fact is...you won't.  That being said, for the experienced, I do feel like a clean bounce is still a very viable option.  I've found the level of experience on some games really takes away that aspect of combat, as everyone is competent and adept at clearing their six regularly.  Also, just yesterday, the summer and autumn maps came out so you don't have to look outside at a barren, white wasteland all the time anymore, which is a relief.  On the downside, there are still some very arcade-y elements to this game, most notably, and to the chagrin of myself and several of my friends, the start-up procedure....is entirely automated.  Press one button and engine start tasks are all performed by the computer.  The irony of it all and the infuriating part is that it still sometimes fails to start!  Whereby, the computer then shuts everything down while you wait 20 more seconds, only to press a single button again, and watch it repeat the process as you silently (or not) curse the game.  I've also seen some things that are...questionable to say the least.  I do fly the 109 almost exclusively and its acceleration and energy retention is second to none (in terms of the plane set in the game) but time after time, I've seen Yaks pull maneuvers that should rob them of all their energy and somehow come out without losing anything.  I've even seen a Yak catch a 190 going balls out on the deck, having started from equal altitude.  I know this may not mean anything to some, and it's impossible to speculate on all the variables like fuel state and loadout but let it be said that more than a few times I've cocked my head to the side and wondered ""how?""  There is also the matter of single player and the unlock system.  The single worst idea the developers had and something the community has complained about since day one.  However, they still felt that implementing it into this game and the upcoming Battle of Moscow was a good plan.  I know there are some that like to play single player and for them, this won't matter.  But frankly, multiplayer is the heart of this game and to have to drag your♥♥♥♥♥through a bunch of boring single player missions just to unlock a paint scheme or two is not appealing in the slightest.  Lastly, and this isn't so much a negative as it is something I can't argue one way or the other; there doesn't seem to be much feeling in the controls.  Mind you, I don't have a force feedback stick but the aircraft does sometimes want to react very violently in circumstances where it shouldn't.  Personally, I needed to spend some serious time with my control settings to try and smooth things out to the point where I wasn't fighting it anymore.  All in all, this is a game worth checking out if you love flying.  If you want a perfect game, keep looking because you will never find it.  If you find yourself getting frustrated, keep at it because I felt the same way about it at first.  Real pilots and anyone who has even a few hours under their belt will find issue with parts of this game beyond a doubt, but the advantage here is that you get to shoot someone else down!			"

												Played 65 hours now. Great game. Just flying the aircraft is already marvelous. There is less RPG aspect in the campaign than in Rise of Flight as you are not part of a squadron. The gradual increase of the difficulty level during the campaign is however a nice feature and there is the promise that they will include a more RPG experience in the future.I can recommend to play in Expert mode. It takes some more time but it is more challenging and rewarding.The only problem with the game is that it sometimes stops working when I want to start a mission, especially when I went into the key bindings menu before (even without changing anything). No game crashes once you are in the mission so it is a not too annoying.For the rest its a brilliant WWII flight simulation. Especially the German Heinkel-111 is a masterpiece with a stunning cockpit view, the wonderfull bomsight and all the different realistic gunsights. A must buy for every flight sim fan out there. Only disadvantage is the steep pricing but this is because the number of flight simmers is (unfortunately) limited. This disadvantage is however countered by the regular sales.			"

												This game ( on a windows 8 computer) was very smooth and nice looking on the ""Ultra"" settings to enhance the graphics. The one problem is the DLC. The two planes are worth it , but are way too expensive. For example most video game DLC, on steam, Are never usally go ove the 10 dollar mark. If you get this game and the DLC planes which i recommend , but when the prices drops or on a sell like i did , you sould find a nice, fairly priced joystick to play the game because the planes are hard to handle and fly with WSAD or The arrows and with these keyboard controlls , when playing it was way easier to stall and crash the planes. So far there are a nice amount of planes with two versions of the Messerschmit BF 109 , which is nice , but this amount of planes in nothing compaired to the ammount of planes in Il-2 Sturmovic 1946 Which had  different versions from the years of the war of all the planes in Il-2 Sturmovic Battle of Stalingrade.  If you have the time or money and you are a fan of air combat this game is for you , but be warned . The three maps in the game are all winter maps and they all look the same ( with trees snow open areas and small villages).			"

												I think the sim is worth it. Beware that you really need a joystick in order to get enjoyment out of the game.Sim gaming is a incredibly niche market and thus there arn't that many good games out there. IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad is a good product, so I think the developers deserve a bit of love.The devs just released summer and autumn maps to go along with the winter map. They also extended the single player campaign with an extra part for free, which is awesome.As a very average pilot I'm having a lot of fun flying and learning the planes online and singleplayer.Cons: It uses DirectX9 which makes the performance of the game less than it would be with DirectX11.

												In my opinion this simulation perfectly combines realism and gameplay. If you are new to the genre, you can activate a lot of little helpers that will make sure that you're able to slowly grow into serious combat flight simulations. The immersion during dogfights is intense! The level of detail the developers put into this simulation is incredible. You have to remember that it's a rather small team, so things need their time. Many rather mixed reviews were posted in the past. Especially when the game was just released last year. But a lot has changed in the last months and great updates are announced for the next months, including new summer and autumn maps of the Stalingrad area and so on. Battle of Stalingrad is still growing. The strong community around it is another plus. Just look at what enthusiasts achieved for the original Il2 series and later the people of Team Fusion for Il2 Cliffs of Dover! Il2 Battle of Stalingrad is worth every cent!			"

												What can I say?  I have enjoyed everything put out by these guys, RoF, the earlier IL-2, and now this.  This simulator is not for War Thunder arcade pilots, this is as hard as real life in my opinion... Not that I've actually flown any of these planes or anything...  Anyways the only complaint I can bring against this is that I wouldn't recommend it for lower end systems, other than that, great ""game""!  (It's a simulator)			"

												Ok, Lets get something straight, i have been from the very start a great fan of the Il2 series,some more than others, but this release of  a poor clone of all the above, i have found extremely disappointing, my PC is of a standard that it has no difficulty running very complex and demanding sims and yet this one is the only one (excluding cliffs of dover, early release) that can damn well nearly stop my machine in it's tracks, with stutters, lag, pops, cracks, and sound distortion, to name a few, after spending hours trying different settings to no avail, can't even get a refund as i spent too long trying to get it to work properly.  Thats just to start with.  The game itself, and i won't call it a sim, because it isn't, is at best, boring and repetitive in single player campaign mode, take off (if you can tolerate the lag) fly to the same target( Train'artilllery,airfield) get attacked by the same two enemy aircraft. Live, or die. And thats it. Exciting Eh? This is without doubt, the worst of all the Il2 releases to date and makes me seriously consider if i would be willing to part with cash for future releases. i for one will not be investing my money. But don't let me put you off, if you want it, buy it, You WILL be disappointed.			"

												An excellent new flight sim from the team that brought you Rise of Flight. Being an actual pilot myself I can personally endorse the game's flight model in accuracy and feel. The airplanes all feel great with realistic properties of weight to power and engine management. At first I was skeptical that their were so few planes and that new ones are $19.99, but so much effort goes into them and they're all so characteristic that I didn't find this to be nearly as big as problem as I thought would be. The much maligned unlock system is in my opionion one of the best features of the game. Giving the sim and campaign a structure previously unheard of these games. Their is a reason to push and work for rewards in the game and the way it's handled is tasteful and contextual to the conflict rather than childish as some people are claiming. A strong return to form for the IL-2 series and simultaneously a smashing sequel to the amazing Rise of Flight. I strongly recommend this sim to those with an open mind an interest in seeing the genre taken in a new direction. I eagerly await Battle of Moscow.			"

												Good flight models and excellent graphics. The single player campaign is not too amazing as it is basically just five possible mission types with no ability to create a pilot/career in the traditional sense. However, the campaign can still be fun and I find it quite relaxing. Multiplayer is also enjoyable. Although as an American I tend to have to fly on Saturday and Sunday mornings to get enough people, as there are not many people playing in the evening in the US/central time zone. However the European time zone seems to get plenty of players. Overall, it is fun to tool around in the WW2 planes with a realistic flight model in a nice looking environnent. I am satisified with my purchase and plan to purchase Battle of Moscow at some point in the future.			"

												IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad is a challenging but oddly addictive game in my opinion. It is a matter of practice when it comes to mastering the feel of an aircraft when you just came from other World War Two flight games such as War Thunder and Wings of Prey, as I am. It can be a very challenging experience to figure out the expert difficulty, but as long as enough time is spent testing the capabilities of the controls and the plane itself, anyone can play this game (within reason).*EDIT - 14/09/15I have encountered problems that others should be aware of when buying this game. The Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick NO LONGER WORKS FOR THIS GAME. I have tried to get it to register properly but nothing seems to work. It is a shame that this issue has arisen and I hope a solution comes soon as I look forward to playing this game again.			"

I haven't played much of this yet but it does seem to be a great continuation of the series . I don't know why this game is getting bad reviews it has great models and graphics and handles well (even on my old pc) . Taking us back to winter on the Eastern Front reminds me of the original IL-2 Sturmovik (the game that got me playing flight sims) and that can't be a bad thing . I'm really enjoying this game and recommend it to anyone who likes combat flight sims .			"

												I picked this game/sim. up a long time ago but haven't been able to review it because it was impossible to transfer the license. It's possible now, so here we go.Doing dislikes first because it's easier to complain than to praise:-Weight: To me, the planes seem to be very floaty. This is entirely a personal thing but hey, I like my heavy metal.-Unlocking skins: I appreciate that all the attachments and modifications to the plane can be unlocked through the main site, but being forced to unlock the skins is a bit of a pain.-The FW-190 cockpit is still something for debate, and I think that it's incorrect. Close, certainly, but not perfect.-Graphics Options: Really? Can't go into detail with this? Alrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight...And now for Likes:-The game is aesthetically pleasing.-Flight models, while a bit floaty as said above, feel quite good.-Optimization: I haven't had any problems with this game. It runs really good.-It worked well with my joystick and trackIR, in fact I think it was just plug and play.-Multiplayer is alright, it takes a while to find people but that can be expected.In terms of the status of the simulation, I'd say it's a step up from WarThunder.That's about it.I've enjoyed playing since I pre-ordered last year, and it's been fun to follow the development to this point.~ Cinna			"

												I've played the IL2 series , IL-2 Sturmovik , Pacific Fighters , 1946 , Cliffs of Dover ,and now starting Battle of Stalingrad . I haven't played much of this yet but it does seem to be a great continuation of the series . I don't know why this game is getting bad reviews it has great models and graphics and handles well (even on my old pc) . Taking us back to winter on the Eastern Front reminds me of the original IL-2 Sturmovik (the game that got me playing flight sims) and that can't be a bad thing . I'm really enjoying this game and recommend it to anyone who likes combat flight sims .			"

												I picked this game/sim. up a long time ago but haven't been able to review it because it was impossible to transfer the license. It's possible now, so here we go.Doing dislikes first because it's easier to complain than to praise:-Weight: To me, the planes seem to be very floaty. This is entirely a personal thing but hey, I like my heavy metal.-Unlocking skins: I appreciate that all the attachments and modifications to the plane can be unlocked through the main site, but being forced to unlock the skins is a bit of a pain.-The FW-190 cockpit is still something for debate, and I think that it's incorrect. Close, certainly, but not perfect.-Graphics Options: Really? Can't go into detail with this? Alrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight...And now for Likes:-The game is aesthetically pleasing.-Flight models, while a bit floaty as said above, feel quite good.-Optimization: I haven't had any problems with this game. It runs really good.-It worked well with my joystick and trackIR, in fact I think it was just plug and play.-Multiplayer is alright, it takes a while to find people but that can be expected.In terms of the status of the simulation, I'd say it's a step up from WarThunder.That's about it.I've enjoyed playing since I pre-ordered last year, and it's been fun to follow the development to this point.~ Cinna			"

												I really want to like the product. I bought it on early release. The unlock system smacks of F2P but you bought the planes. If you buy the delux version they allow you to skip the unlock grind. While great attention to detail was given to RoF the 777 have dropped the ball on this one. With Battle over Moscow or BoM about to be released as a seperate but mergable product the entire project appears to be a very greedy money grab, How can anyone recommend a project hardly anyone is flying. You are confind to a single snow cover map. The single player campaign is a joke... You take off kill an onjective and land. There is no sense of immersion at all. The missions are randomly generated.I know there are hardcore fanatics who love this game... But this is not IL2 1946 killer.Honestly try War Thunder, its free and offers you way more planes.			"

												A very graphically stunning game, and a helluva a lot of fun. Quite a lot of room for improvement, but the developers are faithful and still update frequently. Realistic, but at times seems a bit over exaggerated, but then again, I've never flown a real WWII fighter, so what would I know? Takes a while to learn how to aim and properly dogfight, but it's extremely satisfying once you're able to. Here's a tip; if you're not using rudder pedals, don't aim using the rudder as it can throw off your aim completely. Ailerons and elevators are the way to go.			"

												Why this is not a prefect simulation it does have enough good things that I will recommend it. Things I like about it.The flight models are done quite well.  It is a good challenge to fly some of these planes especially a couple of the German ones.  Take offs and landings are not a given,   Each plane fly's differently and are greatly effected by load-out and weight.   The damage model is diverse and can be quite epic at times.  Bomb and gun ballistics seemed accurate.  The campaigns are open and that it lets you choose either side.  You can also fly any plane and do any type of mission you want.  You advance the campaigns by completing missions regardless of which side you play or which plane you fly.   As you complete missions you earn upgrades for the aircraft you fly and unlock more airbases to launch from.  I found myself flying planes I would not normally fly because I enjoyed earning the upgrades for them.    The missions let you start in the air close to the objective or can earn more points and do a full mission which includes take off and landing.   It does have a time accel feature but it is 2X only.  The ability to play as gunner and bombardier is cool. Quick Mission setups and single missions are availableThe abiltiy to record and replay missions is another nice feature.Things I DislikedThe missions are always the same way-points.  Takeoff, Entry point, Action point, Exit point, Landing.  You can not add or edit any of the way-points.  No mission planning beyond your planes load-out.The friendly AI kind of sucks.  While not totally useless they crash way too much and have trouble keeping up.Non clickable cockpits.Weather effects are kind of bland and the constant winter environment gets old.In summary  IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad is not my all time favorite but it us good enough to recommend to others who enjoy accurate flight simulations like myself.

												This is game is great when it comes to flight and damage models, the depth of aircraft simulation is adequate, especially compared to War Thunder and older IL-2 games. There is that feeling that you are really flying in an aircraft. However there are some problems, offline campaign is pretty much non-existent, it is more like a random mission generator, so playing it becomes boring very fast. And if you don't have the premium version of the game you will have to play it to unlock the different modifications for the aircrafts, even if you want to use them in quick flight mode or online. This is probably the biggest minus of IL-2 BoS. Other problems also exist, for example the clouds in the game are never multilayered, they are always on the same altitude.In general i would still recommend IL-2 BoS to anyone who is interested in flight sims, the game is not ideal, but there is enough positive things to make it worth buying.

												While previous IL2 titles had excellent multi-monitor support and the developers claimed to provide it in the final release of Battle of Stalingrad; they changed their minds at the last moment (or never intended to in the first place) and failed to include it.  At least they got enough of us suckers with similar expectations of previous titles to buy in early before unveiling their spectacular inadequacy.  Lesson learned: NEVER believe game developers until they actually DELIVER on their commitments.  No more pre-orders or early access gimmicks for this guy.  I will never pay for a product with claims of a level of performance that never materialize; it's a sad trend these days.			"

												As far as the flight model goes this game is perfect, but I'm not satisfied with sounds and effects at all..For example, stuka siren sounds like old Zitroen DS car..it's terrible!I know this is simulation and I love ultra realistic flight sims myself, but flyby sounds are total crap..The effects of bullets hitting airplane are quite fine, but bullets hitting ground are very bad.Ground explosions are all the same (they look a bit of static..).And most important, there are so little missions, and only two campaigns.Campaigns are very borring and only reason that you can play campaign is because you can unlock something, not because  they are exiciting..I hope that some day all of this will be changed because we all want WW2 athmosphere, but there is no ww2 athmosfere in game except in intro..Kind Regards "

												If you are an offline player like myself, you will be left wanting more from the campaign.The game incorporates some very familiar elements from 777 and 1C. However it is a shame that the cockpit is not clickable, which is fine for ROF but in more complex aircraft, I was hoping for a IL2 ClOD situation.The campaign is not your classic campaign, I would say that it is almost the bare minimum. You are not part of a squadron, you do not fly consecutive missions which have a feeling of progression like in IL2 1946. basically you click an airfield like in ROF and choose a mission. Every time.....no airfield transfers, no front movements in the chapter, you can even switch sides every mission, there is also no time progression. For each mission you get XP. Expert mode gets you more XP, as well as safely landing your aircraft. With morexp come more unlocks, which don't actually hinder the game, and don't really keep you from enjoying the game if you don't have them.When you get enough XP, the next chapter simply becomes available. There is is still a lot of work to be done here because honestly in reference to ROF, this campaign is not even beta, it is sub par.That being said the game is IN development. The campaign system IS being addressed and I am very excited for the announced upcoming updates. Maybe when the game has a more stable and finished overall environment developed Desastersoft could pick it up, who knows. The thing is the Devs are really working hard on making this game up to their own personal standards (despite various financing problems and the fact that this isn't a very sim firendly market)The game is a good successor to IL2 1946. It just needs polishing, but IL2 1946 WAS a much simpler game, where you could add new planes in a months time. This is not possible with the level of detail in BOS.The map is huge and wonderful. Cockpits and planes look fantastic. The gun effects, explosions, lighting it is all very next gen. It is a huuuuge improvement and a great leap forward. Even though I am honestly not entirely satisfied, I would 10/10 recommend this game. It's going places, and if you want to fly the IL2 or other iconic Soviet aircraft, then this is the way to go, for me not even IL2 1946 is a worthy substitute.			"

												First of: I really like the game. The game itself in MP is great. But right now you HAVE TO play single player campaign ( with every plane ) to get the ""unlocks"" like 4 MGs in A3, gunpods etc. Until you have everything unlocked that you want to have it is basically just grinding alone.If you are not interessted in playing single player do NOT buy BoS at the moment. If you enjoy SP ofc buy it.			"

												Overall decent title from 1C. This game for what you pay could be a hell of a lot better.I know free to play games with the same mechanics. I should take a step over to the creator of Heroes and Generals, and tell him that his unlock scheme was totally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from him. Pros:None - For a developer who's been in the sim business for a long long time, this is by far their worst release. They have severly ""dumbed"" it down for the average gamer. Too bad we already have one of those, and it's called War Thunder. Cons:Many-No Native Oculus Rift support (When the game was demo'd with the DK1 earlier this year)-Pitiful Flight Models. The actual flight characteristics in the air are decent, but on the ground are rubbish.-No Manual mode for engine control and startup.-Unlocks are only obtained in single player grinding, which is HORRIFIC at best. I would be ok with unlocks like this if they were only skins or ways to mark your plane, but instead they're also for weapons, bombs, machine guns, armor, etc. This makes the game unbalanced for the people who don't have hours upon hours of time to spend in Single Player unlocking basic things.-Game requires you log in at the start of each session even for single player, no internet = no play-Servers are shaky at best, you can barely stay connected for more than one round, and the rounds are only 20-40 minutes long which means it's only for those people who want ""quick"" action, and not mission based online play.-Impossible to win in ""Full Realism"" without trackIR or some form of head tracking (be warned)In final, this is not a sim. This is an arcade version of IL2 with some niceities added in for hardcore people. If you're an avid flyer DO NOT BUY. Stick to IL2 1946 or IL2 CLOD, the community is better, there's content still being produced for those by private parties. I wont deny that the game is fun, but for the price you pay it's not worth it's retail tag. This should have been released as a Free 2 Play with an item mall. Instead they charge you $XX and then give you the bare items to play, with the same UNREASONABLE expectations for grinding out unlocks. At least with Heroes and Generals I could goto the item mall instead of wasting my time in the stupid monontenous campaign to get an item that I actually need to use the plane in the first place.DO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY.I would have not bought this if it wasn't on the steam sale, and even those prices are too high.For the standard it should be $20, and the Deluxe it should be $25.That's all this game is worth. Don't buy this for $100... You'll wish you hadn't.			"

												Let me start this off by saying the game is technically finished, but still is adding and completing the game.After signing up on IL2's website, and starting up the game I was immediately hit with a few tiny problems.  One was that I have to reset the game for fullscreen to take affect, and then have to restart it again after the screen resolution was really wack.  Once that was sorted I jumped into a quick mission and was thrown into the good ol' fashioned IL2 experience that veterans love and newbies will be able to grasp like their own genitalia.  First thing you'll notice menu wise is that they're very sleek, and easy to use.  Unlike their usual menu's that are rather strange, buggy or just plain dull, this one is a very nice change of pace.  The options are clear, the writing is slick and the essential options are big and easy to see, aswell as functional unlike the previous installment (Cliffs of Dover) where loadouts wouldnt even be selectable for some strange and unknown reason, the game has a lock beside all the modifications letting you know theyre unlockables, and not just given to you.Gameplay wise the game has a ton of options, allowing for an easy 'Normal' or 'Expert' difficulties to be picked making it easy to start the game up for a quick match for those who just want to play, or just to differentiate where begginers and veterans should be starting off at.  Most noteably out of all the gameplay options is the campaign, this is (to my knowledge) the only real flight sim that starts players off with a quick, helpful tutorial that shows players how to work the campaign mission selector and standardized mission plans.  The campaign has a lot of unique features such as stats that can be viewed from the web, and a 'Full Mission' or 'Quick Mission' options that let players choose if they want to start in the air ready to go, or have to take off and land.  Combat is as standard as simulators come, detailed models, realistic flight mechanics, bullet drop, all the basic stuff.   The only complaints I have is that they removed click cockpit and gave us only four planes per faction (five if you wanna dish out some extra coin) that dont offer us the same depth that the planes in Cliffs of Dover did,Visually the game is stunning, beautiful vast open landscapes that are nicely brought to life.  The game really captures the battle as it was fought in the air, and on the ground.  All flight sims are visually stunning in the air, focusing on cloud effects and sun effects ETC....  But Battle of Stalingrad makes an attempt to make you have a bit more of a reason to look down other than trying to bomb the crap out of the place, adding some unique smoke effects that billow out from the town which drew my attention during my long stretches back to base and actually impressed me.  However, the onlu problem I have with the graphics is that there is no way to make custom graphics settings, its just four options; Ultra, High, Balanced, and Low.Overall, the game is definitely worth a buy if you're a veteran of flight sims looking for a new one to add to your library.  I do also recommend that if people are looking at getting into flight sims this is one game that can be easy to start off with, I do HIGHLY RECOMMEND that if you're getting this as your first flight sim that you buy a joystick, or you'll be key mapping for hours.  For veterans I also recommend a Track IR system, it makes the game way more immersive and gives you a tactical edge when in multiplayer.Frankly, the people who dislike this game are people who have played War Thunder and bought this on impulse.  The usual complaints are that the game is not user friendly or that it has not enough playability or plane diversity.  I agree that the dev's made a stupid decision to make DLC planes that are as famous as the FW190 and LA5 so expensive and DLC at all, but the planes we are given all have unique play styles and need lots of practice to even come close to mastering them, and the game is meant to be grueling and difficult as its supposed to be simulating.  The planes we have are all very nice and fun to use and although there arent as many as we would probably like, its a quality over quantity type deal. "

												Awesome. For me, the balance between knob-fiddling realism and the sheer exhiliration of blatting through the sky is perfect. I found this so much easier to get into compared to Cliffs of Dover and Rise of Flight (both of which are stunning in their own way, but which seem more unforgiving). I've enjoyed the progression through the missions as it has helped me get to grips with the planes. You can really feel the love and hours that have gone into this simulation. Well done, developers. 10/10 would be shot down again			"

												The perfect settingWesterners dream of Spitfires dancing over white cliffs and Mustangs crushing Berlin. There is reason to celebrate this. But history is cold to dreams, and indifferent to sentimentality. History knows that Western Civilization pivoted in the slushy depths of the Volga in 1942. And we all inhabit the world carved out by these inglorious warriors, their blood; long forgotten. 1c didn’t forget. And they’ve teamed up with 777 studios to remind another generation of simjocks what the frozen brutality of the Eastern Front was all about.The A TeamCombining the forces behind “IL-2 Sturmovik” with “Rise of Flight” is a dream-come-true and a tough legacy to live up to. Expectations could not be higher. What’s PerfectThe aircraft are expertly modeled and flying them is a pure joy. Individual aircraft showcase historic behaviors.  The atmosphere ignores, aids, or intrudes as it will. Complex flight dynamics will please veterans and challenge newcomers. Battle of Stalingrad may be considered that rarest of things: A Combat Flight Simulator. What’s GoodThe aircraft are meticulously detailed. Remaining more simplistic than “study sims”, BoS showcases enough detail to set it apart from rival ‘combat’ simulations. In-flight engine systems are modeled, yet may be simplified by the player. Engine components and flight surfaces succumb to stress and mismanagement. Everything is dependent on individual aircraft and realism settings. What’s BadWhile beautifully modeled, the plane set is anemic. And there are no (at this time) AI only planes to flesh out the missions. The settings in general have little variety and shoehorn graphics and realism settings together. Single player jocks seem especially misconsidered. The multi-player, depending on geography, may find few populated servers. There are also “unlockable” skins, load outs, and field modifications. While not much of a practical hindrance, this mentality is a poor portent. What’s UglyWhile the “early access” model is new to most gamers, flight jocks are well familiar with games that sell copies with promises of things to come. Battle of Stalingrad well takes advantage of a hard-core base by releasing a game that’s clearly not finished. We all drool at the prospect of Theatres of war to come. And I applaud studios that leave this door open. However, there are plenty of areas where this game lacks basic features. For example, there is no manual. For a game as complex, with a learning curve so steep, this is an obscene omission. Conclusion:Battle of Stalingrad is a gorgeous combat flight simulator with no qualifier. Its pedigree is suburb, even if its execution is flawed. While the game it may become is unclear, the game it is, remains excellent and should be had by every serious simjock. For the new-comer I would recommend only if you’ve a passion for combat simulation. Your orientation will be graciously met by the community, not by the developers, Only passion and hard work will see you through the steep learning curve to frozen glory.			"

												Dec 2016... This flight sim is the worst flight trash on Steam (in terms of controls).Seems sluggish on highest settings in 1080p via an Asus Strix 1070. Haswell i7, 16Gb Ram, ASUS Gaming Mo-Bo, WD Black Gaming Drive & SSD Windows 10 x64.Using Tm HOTAS Warthog flight stick & throttle, with Saitek Combat Flight pedals, but the controls have a mind of their own. Re-mapping is probably the worst of any flight sim.Re-mapping does not work most of the time, and repeately tried to set Joystick controls all to NumPad 5. (EDIT: A recent update [Feb 1st 2017]  seems to have fixed that).I dont have this level of problems in a handful other flight sims; because Some actually have functioning mapped HOTAS Flight controls out of the box (including Pedal maping).Also...Does not function properly in or out of Stereoscopic 3D. 3D is Great for getting a headache in the glitchy settings screen (due to 3D conflict?) and in Cockpit view.That said, external view is nice in 3D.Weeks pass by, ........... and it Was still impossible to map the Tm HOTAS Warthog in the game.(EDIT: A recent update [Feb 1st 2017]  seems to have fixed that).Avoid the game unless you enjoy problems.Buy Aerofly instead; or X-Plane 11.

												Game has come a long way since release. All loadouts are unlocked from the beginning now and they've added a summer map and even an additional summer campaign! Flightmodel's are very good, as are the ai pilots. Just make sure you have a decent joystick. Don't bother to play without. For arcade flying there's better alternatives out there. If you don't have one, I recommend getting a used Sidewinder Ffb 2 for 15-20 bucks. Possibly the most reliable ffb joystick with usb support out there. Also, game looks beautifully stunning and runs with a smooth 60fps+ in 1440p on a 1060. Only unnaturally fast headturns can cause a short single stutter when looking around the cockpit for the first time after loading the map. Downside I see is the pricing but if you're into flight-sims you're used to that. I wish BoM would be a bit cheaper as being sold as DLC here on Steam though. However, all planes from the deluxe version and BoM can be used by the ai even if you don't own them and afaik the bom map is even available to all pilots in mp. MP servers can always be found populated but... dem skillz man... dem skillz.			"

This is a bit exasperated to me because I really do not like to fly the first aircraft that you get. Get rid of the stupid CoD gimmicks of unlocks. I do present a suggestion to accompany my complaint. Make a sandbox versions... KSP has campaign or everything available in sandbox. That is a really nice model!

												Terrible. Absolutely terrible. The flight models are exaggerated (For instance, the ground loop on the FW190 is a real thing, but this game, not a simulator, exaggerated it to the point where I cannot apply enough control to counter it.) In addition, this latest update has added a bug which prevents missions from loading completely, and I as the owenr of the computer no longer have the ability to close the game. I simply don't have the permissions necessary, as the SYSADMIN. That's effed up. In addition, two aircraft are locked behind particularly expensive paywalls. Not even DLC, they're there in the game, just paywalled. If this were a DCS level of detail, I might understand. But $30-$40 for an IL2-level flight model and graphics? No, to hell with that. One the upshot, the most recent update added mouse controls and driveable tanks. Now, if there wasn't a literal game-breaking bug, we would have a limited-scope War thunder wannabe with a marginally better FM. Thanks 1C company! As an addendum, I'm writing this as of the most recent update, for the first time. Previously, eight months ago (Prior to BCT, AIT, and Duty Station) I did enjoy this game, not much of a dogfighter, but to practice maneuvers for the joy of flying a warbird. Eight months ago, I would have recommended it, in spite of the problems.At this juncture, I can't.			"

												dont get me wrong...the game is breathtaking and i love it visually. seting up controls....not as bad a DCS but could be better. i want to really play this game 24/7 like i did 1946, i still play that....and the biggest reason is content. this game lacks so much of anything its almost like it was created to keep you grinding for little mods thats it. 1946....has an array of planes, maps and content....thats what we expect from the il2 series lots of planes, lots of guns, bombs, skins and lots of maps. no body cares if your setting the game in moscow or stalingrad.....we get that. but stick with what created the series and made it what it is a great flying experience with an abundent and vast array of aircraft. let us the gamers and flight stick junkies fly and gamble at controlling the skies over europe , in the pacific, north afrika for gods sake with friends and foes. what this game and studios making the game has done is limit the great series into a cash grab, content for sale 20$ ......really? the old il2 series just gave us the content because they knew that they had a great fanbase that just wanted what they wanted...a great ww2 flying experience that shared one common goal... enjoyment of a simple yet sophisticated simulator. these 2 studios have robbed what was the il2 simulator experience.....and that was an experience in itself. 777 and 1C im ashamed what you have limited yourselves to and what you have produced. 10 A/C thats it?

												This game (game, not sim) is nothing but a blatant Milk the Whales campaign. The unlock system is ridiculous. This is supposed to be a flight sim, not a Call of Duty game. My Focke-Wulf 190 should come with MG FFs out of the box, from the factory. I should not have to play through the game's tepid, boring excuse for a 'campaign mode' in order to get basic functionality from my aircraft. Unless, of course, you buy the Deluxe Edition, which is rapaciously overpriced. This is a policy I would have expected from EA or Ubisoft, not from a flight sim developer.My advice? Stick with Il-2: 1946. Sure, it kind of looks like♥♥♥♥♥these days, but you'll get a hell of a lot more out of it in terms of content and fun. And you won't have to grind in order to 'unlock' the basic functionality of your aircraft.			"

												I've played this series since the first one came out in 2001 or so. Just picked this up this week and so far, I'm still impressed. I don't fall head-over-heels in love with games, but 777 studios and 1C studios has never been a let down!One thing these games have taught me - I absolutely SUCK and combat sims. I will admit though, sucking at flying the planes in this series has never felt so good and been this much fun! (Although sucking at combat sims has, somehow, made me quite good at regular flight sims)Attempt 1 = take off. Line up with my squadron. First one goes fine. Second one goes fine. I go, spin out, drop my landing gear on the runway, break a wing off, bend my plane almost in half and sit there smoking. Next plane goes, runs over my landing gear, tearing their front wheels off, causing them to face-plant into the runway and somersault for several feet.Attempt 2 = Decide to abandon my squadron (for their safety) and taxi to a side taxiway to take off. Engines good. Rudder positioned. Reach takeoff speed and plane barely leaves ground. Struggle with struggling plane, and tear off my left wing off on a tree, whipping me around in circles. Scratch my head, watch replay and realize I never lowered my flaps... DOH!Attempt 3 = Begin airborne since I seem to suffer a major case of suckage at taking off. Misread mission map and fly away from my squadron, and from the checkpoint for about 5 minutes. Fix my mistake and arrive late to the party. Fire at an enemy and damage my teammate. Take 2 rounds from enemy plane and my engine goes up in a cloud of smoke, covering the cockpit in a sticky black oil. I blindly coax my plane along, lowering the throttle and using my map as guidance. Engine kicks the bucket with about 30 miles left to go... yep, screwed. Can't see the ground, can't see anything really. I keep it level, looking out the side of my cockpit and aim for, what looks like an empty field. Landing gear is down and flaps are lowered, so far so good.Slam head-first into a house and explode in a fireball, taking the house out with me.As I said, sucking never felt so good :) "

												If you only play singleplayer then I would search up more about the randomly generated campaigns, if there is one thing this game is missing is immersve campaign missions. There are many single missions but no continuous story. It is no where near as modifiable as previous games. The campaigns are decently long with average variability, the generated missions do get repetitive but the game itself is still fun enough to draw you back.The multiplayer is much more varied and really is where this game shines. You can have a simple dogfight or partake in a long and enduring battle over a massive area with several mission to keep you occupied. Tanks have also made an appearance (for free) and are relatively fun for the small impression they've left so far (early in development at the time of writing).The quality of the simulation aspect is as expected, you will not be disappointed. The only downside is that the cockpit is not fully interactable (like in DCS) but all functions are still usable.With the release of Battle of Moscow the game community has NOT been split, in fact you will own half of BoM by simply owning BoS. Put simply you will be able to fly with and against aircraft from BoM but not fly them yourself.If you want to experience both solo and multiplayer in an immersive and top of the range WWII flight sim, you won't regret your purchase.

												Great simulation, I enjoy the campaign more than I thought I would. The graphics and flight model are great and I really like the experience system, as it rewards me for playing the game the way I would anyway- closed cockpit, no hints, no pointers etc. I tried a mission on ""normal"" mode and almost threw up in my mouthThankfully the most populated servers are also on expert mode so I dont need to put up with♥♥♥♥♥♥tier war thunder arcade ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t			"

Been enjoying VR so much that forgot to review this game bought every single plane/DLC 1C 777 has to offer!!!!! The only minor thing about vr is that u can see a small black line on the edge of the hmd screen, hope the devs will be able to fix it soon, but really doesnt affect the gameplay that much.

												Ok, I really wanted to love this game, but I am really disappointed in the campaign. First off, if doesnt feel like it's telling a story. It feels more like a grind to unlock future missions and equipment. But by far my biggest complaint is the fact that I cant change the difficulty settings in the campain mode besides normal and expert presets. This basically makes the campaign worthless to me becasue of my old joystick and lack of formal pilot training. Please, team at 1C, tell me why you only make games for a niche audience when all you need to do to open it up to a wider audience is to unlock the stupid settings that are already in the game for the quick missions? I understand that this was done for some unknown reason due to multiplayer, but everything I've read tells me the multi crowd hates this as much as I do, albeit for different reasons. So, bottom line, dont buy this game unless you have a state of the art joystick and are REALLY REALLY into flight sims, oh and you have a pilots license, because otherwise it's just not fun AT ALL!!!

												This game is a shining example of whats wrong with DRM. If you live in a area where you have poor internet connection then you will not be able to play most of this game, you even need to be connected to their servers to play the campaign, which is a joke btw. This game is absolutly not playable with a controller you have to spend more money on Flight sim junk, and it's not forgiving to new players, no tutorial and the ""Normal"" control mode had me stalling out literally seconds after if hands over control. Even with all of the control assists turned on flying with a mouse or xbox controller is wonky and disorientating. This game has hardly any content either, from what I saw in the short time i played the game there are only a handful of planes to fly, 4 fighter planes, 2 bombers, and 2 of something else.A better alternative would be War Thunder, it's free, easy to get started in and a hell of a lot more fun.

												I must explain: 150 $ and you will receive the ""best"" air combat simulation around (at least, of the last years).But this ""best"" is far from perfect and a great graphics (and superb models) don't hide a terrible AI and a game that is only a better version of Rise of Flight with little modification.This would be a good game for around 50 $ (it's surely an AAA game). But this is not Microsoft Flight Simulator. I cannot accept to buy, for 50 $ dollars, ONLY a couple of planes and one battle stage.Microsoft Flight Simulator is more cheap and have a (way) better tech value!This have to change. It's frankly ridicolous and you have to buy ALSO all the other packs in the future.Want a new (poor) campaign? Here, another 50 $! And this become 49,99 € in Europe!I have to say again: you cannot sell a game in this state for this price, is pratically a fraud, because there is no way to justify the cost!So, I will play it again? Sure, I've already bought it, but I've done with 777 Studios, I think they are one of the less professional game developers around, and continue to grab (a lot of) money for every cheap S**T they produce as DLC!!!Why I have to buy every single plane? Every single campaing? Every single module?Just release BIG DLC, BIG updates!This is not the new IL-2! It's a stupid version of ROF with WW2 planes!Oh, and if you prefer multyplayer, just stick with Wargames and so: at the end, an annual premium account is cheaper...			"

												-Premessa ho attivato il gioco su steam anche se lo possiedo dall' agosto 2013-Sim made in Russia, tralasciando il discorso FM questo gioco è chiaramente bilanciato, aerei russi modello gruviera che volano senza risentire dei danni subiti a differenza del 109 che basta guardarlo che va in mille pezzi o del 190 dove con le ali danneggiate diventa inguidabile e altre schifezze che solo online saltano fuori come i Yak più veloci del FW190,E proprio questo aereo probabilmente deve stargli proprio sui coglioni visto che già in alpha è stato oggetto di pesanti critiche da parte della community con tanto di prove cartacee e filmati, problemi corretti in parte dai dev ma con la solita scusina del ""ci siamo sbagliati scusate""A differenza di Rise of Flight qui abbiamo un sim dove offline non offre nulla se non una noiosa campagna a missioni offline introdotta da filmati da bimbominkia quando ci sono migliaia di filmati storici in giro, cosa ci voleva a buttargli un misero filmato di 30 secondi? e invece c'è una schifosa scenetta in computer grafica, nessuna modalita carriera e le classiche quick battleOnline si assistono a scene assurde dove i IL2 sono più maneggevoli del Würger, armi laser devastanti sul lagg3 quando storicamente era proprio il contrario, aerei russi che volano quasi tranquillamente anche se fortemente danneggiati nelle ali, i flap degli aerei russi perennemente giù nei dog anche se sono stati in parte corretti, per contro abbiamo gli aerei tedeschi che sono superiori nelle prestazioni pure ma soggetti a strani fenomeni di ondeggiamento stranamente assenti sui russi, ali di metallo che sono più fragili di quelle in legno e così via...Ancora adesso nessuna possibilità di ostare coop.Per usare l' editor ci vuole una laurea e infatti campagne online, non ce ne sono ancora, grandissima mancanza che a distanza di anni dal rilascio di BoS non può più essere tollerataAltra grave mancanza la distanza visiva che è limitata a 9.5km, in soldoni se si vola a 11km di altitudine a terra non vedrete gli aerei perchè non vengono renderizzati, quindi si vola nel deserto per poi imbattersi improvvisamente nei dog.Non esiste varietà nelle munizioni, e CloD qui fa storia, inaccettabile la sola definizione AP e HE... che tipo di HE o AP? no non ci siamoIl bombsight dei bombardieri è più adatto a War ThunderPeccato davvero perchè questo gioco funziona senza impazzire con mod o patch, offre una grande immersione per via della grafica e della fisica e ottime sensazioni ""closhe alla mano"" ma i problemi di giocabilita piano piano prendono il sopravvento anche sul giocatore più neutrale, non è un caso infatti che questo prodotto è criticato da una buona parte della community online.Insomma, cambia la faccia da IL2 (Oleg e co.) ma il succo rimane lo stesso, il vero problema però rimane che prodotti simili praticamente non esistono, quindi si ingoia e si manda giù, nella speranza che i dev (Russi) sistemino lo stalinwood e le armi tedesche (mg151 in primis) sottomodellateEDIT: 31/01/2017 sistemato il FM del 190, finalmente ora è un vero Würger, dopo 2 anni dal rilascio, vabbè meglio i 2 anni che i 2 weeks di Oleg			"

With huge differences between players that completely ruins the experiences. It's not acceptable for an Il-2 game a multiplayer problem like that.The positive point is that there are lots of good servers and maps.I still prefer Clod and DCS rather than BoX.I was really disappointed after trying this game since Rise of Flight is a really good flight simulator.For me this game is a big missed chance.

Early Access Review
								This game has gone off the rails IMHO. I'm an early access buyer, and I am now being forced to play mind numbingly boring tutorials BEFORE I can access planes, skins or weapons. Moreover, it looks like, at 90 percent completion, that the single player campaign is limited, repetitive and almost devoid of any interesting material. Worse still, the developers have disabled fast time compression for the tutorials, so you can't even race through them. Add to that a complete disregard toward their fan base, and I certainly do not recommend this game. I bought early access to a simulation with complex engine management and great visuals and FMs, but the recent direction if the game is turning it into a boring arcade like experience. A fail on public relations and a fail on the arcade aspects of the game. Pity, since it had such potential. Stay away from this is my suggestion.			"

												It is a beuatiful game, when it runs, it runs well. But unfortunatly it is one of the worst designed games ive ever played. Graphics options are worse than a super early access alpha, so your screwed if you need to fiddle with anything(there are NO options to change graphics! just low medium and high, your average iphone app has more options). Optimisation is non excistent. Still doesnt work with windows 10 and joysticks, the joystick numbers get swapped around each time you restart your pc so you need to rebind everything each time you play! Ive tried everything and there is no easy solution that works for more than a few restarts.Just go play something else and save your money, you might get lucky and have have a great time, but i doubt it			"

However in 1946 i was able to easily play and remap controls to a cotroller, even the ""expert"" controlls and difficulty were easy to understand, but with this game nothing is easy. The last thing i have to say is that if this game had a tutorial, (ive looked but i havent found one although it could be hidden if it exists) it would be a hell of a lot easier to catch up to and enjoy. Time to spend hours learning how to do the most basic of tasks... Unless you really want to play this game and are dedicated to WW2 flight sims, i cannot recommend this.			"

												This game is way  to expensive, $80 bucks alone for 4 new planes...or plus another $50 for expansion(plus another expansion coming out thats priced higher, with 2 collector planes that you can only buy from there website). less then 100 people on if not less. i regret the purchase. You'll need a joystick..the only populated servers play full sim,(no mouse and keyboard, no waypoints, no friendly tags, full engine mangement) if the game was less, and had populated servers on realistic(waypoints, friendly tags) more people might play. CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME...because of the steep price to have everything, and the expert only policy.. 61.5 hours in, update reset all mappings on joystick, which mapping in itself is a pain and will make people refund the game. the 60 or so people are all hardcore fans who will give you no chance to get any better. needs a balance between realistic and expert			"

												This game is so poorly optimized I've spent seven hours on it just trying to make it run at a playable condition. Too bad even on low this thing refuses to be playable, maybe is not the low fps (keeps dropping from 50 to 40 to 30 and some times to the low mid 20s) but the stuttering that makes it unplayable. When I zoom in, stuttering, when I look around, stuttering, no matter my settings it always happen. Hey is just me flying no vehicles or enemies around, guess what? Yeah, stuttering and unstable fps. I can play War Thunder with 32 players or bots and lots of action on the ground with Ultra settings at full 60 fps in 1080p with not drops just fine but this game on low looks worse than WT and with nothing but just me on the map barely gets to 50 fps, is unstable and still has the stuttering problem. I've read and many people with better specs than me have the same issues. This is obviously a problem with the game. Now as for the gameplay, the lack of content is also a reason why this game isn't worth the price. First of all the game doesn't even have a tutorial mode so for starters like me our only option is to play with custom settings while we learn how the planes handle in this game, which imo is not very good, on normal settings I can't even turn in the 109, while in simulators like 1946 with everything on full realism I can do it without any problem. I found out that I have to enable an option in custom settings to simplify turning, is strange and is something I've never seen in another simulator game so whatever I did it but guess what? The campaign can only be played on normal or expert, that's right the incompetent developers won't even give you the option to play the campaign mode with custom settings, are you kidding me? And if you want to unlock the planes skins and modifications you have to play campaign or pay. So if you can't even turn the fckng plane how are you suppose to do that? PAY. What a joke. And two of the few flyable planes in this game are behind a paywall. One of them is an all time favorite, the 190. Wanna fly the legendary 190, too bad you gotta pay us more for it because is locked unless you pay for the unlock key. Ridiculous. Oh and don't even bother with the mp, is dead. Unless you consider two out of a dozen lobbies being half full alive.Tl;dr - Unplayable overpriced game with a dead mp, very little sp content and very few planes. Good thing I bought it on sale, too bad that by the time I asked for a refund I already exceeded the two hours limit. Not even worth the sale price.IL-2 1946 is still the best ten years later. Cliffs of Dover didn't surpassed it and this one doesn't even come close.			"

												I don’t recommend this game !In comparison with il2 1946 this game is a joke!ProsNice graphicsNice physics CoinsEven on realistic settings game behaves like an arcade Very inconvenient map editor  Unlocks? Seriously? This supposed to be a flight simulator   I build my computer. For the past 4 years, it might have crashed 2 or 3 times tops. This game crashed it more than 5 times in one day.    Very little content for the money that you are paying. For one extra plane I have to pay 25$ ? and that plane is not even flight simulator plane with clickable cockpit !Very disappointed, il2 series were by far my favorite game when I was growing up.  With a lot of content ( even before mods) and awesome map editor which is very important for me , this new map editor outside of the game just sucks !			"

												I really want to give a possitive review, but the game only gives you a platform to play a WW2 simulation air combat. everything else you have to search online by yourself, it doesn't even have a tutorial, compare to other games like DCS (have tutorial), warthunder (easy to understand). but this game, unless you are really patient, otherwise you have to spend several hours to find information from internet. the game are not worth the money it can gives you, and you have to spend way much more time outside of the game in order to play this game. Before you buy this game, make sure you have a good teather tell you how to play, good internet resource, and tons of time.			"

												DO NOT buy this game if you are looking for a similar game to the previous IL-2 installations. It has gone DEEP into micro-transactions with $100+ of planes and missions. The base game has NOTHING. Only a few maps, planes, and a campaign. Even on sale at $25, that is not worth it. The actual gameplay is alright, though it feels basically like a HD re-skinned version of 1946. If the game had 4x the content it does right now, I would agree that it is worth it at the sale price. It would need a lot more to warrant $50 in my eyes.			"

												EDIT: Looking back on my review, I think I was a bit harsh. Just a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off when I wrote this review :P, If yuo have a joy stick, ignore the Gameplay, I belive with joystick it would probably go to a 8/10.Well, it's time for my first review ladies and gentlemen! So, let's start!Graphics: 8/10Needs to be way more optimized!Gameplay: 3/10 I personally hated it, seriously I lag everytime I try to play, IT""S IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY WITH KEYBOARD, I PLAY WITH KEYBOARD!!!!!!!!! Seriousy... the alierons, and rudder, and the elevator DON'T RESET WHEN YOU TRY TO TURN YOU KEEP TURNING UNTIL YOU MOVE IT THE OTHER o_O I thought you would the controls reset until you move it again...For example I move my rudder to the right, after wanting it to go straight, instead of letting go of the button I HAVE TO MOVE IT BACK TO NORMAL... This may not seem like a pain, but in those intense moments I gaurentee you, you will forget to push the button back, and then you would be wondering why the hell you hit a tree and blew up....FIX THE F***ING KEYBOARD CONTROLS!!!Only fun part is ramming your enemy to death..Even the death cam sucks ):Amount of Stuff there is in thie game: 2/10You excpect me to pay $60... FOR WHAT IS IT... 6 AIRPLANES? Plus it's only snow, like what?!?! Are you really that lazy? They litterally made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t excuse to, saying ""Not many people play this game se we need to jack up the prices.."" They even addmited they tried to do this as fast as possible so that they could go do something else...Camera: 7/10Why is it shaky?I'm playing a game not watching a movie. In total:  3/10 Go buy another game (Il-2 Sturmovik 1946) I have 3,000+ HRS in that seriously.. I'm addicted to it.Why has this game even come out yet? It should still be in ALPHA THIS LOOKS LIKE ALPHA TO ME!!!I will update my review as the updates come along. But I DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!			"

												i bought it like a year and a half ago when it came out. it had like 10 planes in it and one map and it was inferior in every way to 1946, which came out over 15 years ago, except for gunner positions.i gave it time and i gave it patience. i only reinstalled it again a few days ago. i found out i couldnt even play singleplayer until i made an account on some stupid third party website. after that was done and my email had been verified for spam and special offers i was allowed to play the one or two static campaigns consisting of a few missions. damn. no thanks. id rather play 1946 which came out over FIFTEEN YEARS AGO where i dont have to log in to play or be online constantly and it has dynamic campaigns for multiple countries and aircraft. not to mention it has several large maps and you could fly 316 different aircraft and more with mods. how do you go from that to this? from 316 to 10, from dynamic to static? oh yeah i forgot they added 2 more planes in after a year, but you have to pay 20 dollars for each of them.this is just pure, unadultered human sh*t to anybody with a functioning brain. wings of prey is literally more advanced than this. if war thunder is like the call of duty of flight games then this is the medal of honor.and for the 10 or whatever airplanes they did add in theyre fully modeled and super realistic right? nope. just some sh*t barely above war thunder ""realism mode"" even though its supposed to be on the rise of flight engine.the graphics looks kind of nice but theyre not that great.so at the end of the day id rather play the original sturmovik from 2001 than this trash even though i was dumb enough to pay for it. haha! i guess you got me! im the idiot who bought into this scam. hope nobody reading this is dumb enough to do the same.and this isnt coming from someone who plays ace combat with a xbox controller or some sh*t. i put thousands of hours into il2, combat flight simulator 3, DCS, fsx, red baron 3d, falcon 4.0, you name it. so im not coming from a perspective of total ignorance.and i hope that developer who left the smart@ss comment will come back and reply to this.

												IL2 in name only.   After shelving it for over a year loaded it back up to see what the latest patch brought, still disappointed.  Unfortunately the graphics even with the addition of summer maps are horrible, they are almost as sterile and boring as the snow covered map.   I don't like the plane interiors that much either, I think DCS and Cliffs of Dover with team fusion mod have much better interiors.  The exteriors are OK but I think DCS has better, COD not so much.   Flight models seem about the same between COD and BOS to me, DCS flight model is superior regarding their ww2 aircraft to date.For WW2 Cliffs of Dover with Team Fusion and even Deastersoft addons, are miles better than these recent IL2 products.   DCS simply blows the doors off IL2, but is more simulator than game (great for us hard-core flight simmers) and not yet really geared towards ww2 fully.   If I had to do it over again for WW2,  I would not buy Battle of Stalingrad, but would buy Cliffs of Dover (TF Mods) as the less serious game and certainly DCS if the Normandy content turns out to be good as a simulator. Tried to give IL2 a chance on multiple occasions now over the last two years but I don't like it for the reasons above.  I would normally say any flight simmer should own all 3, but in this case can't recomment Il2 STalingrad.			"

												I have always wished the best for Il2, So it was a miserable experience having to refund this game.I have had every version of the IL2 series since the start. This is the worst. Cliffs of Dover was the worst but is now possibly the best due to the amazing work done by Team Fusion. Once again German aircraft deliberately Nerfed because, Propaganda...The obsolete I-16 out performs a Bf109 E in all aspects and can 1 shot kill like a freakin sniper.Thats also probably because the Russian devs have given German aircraft ricepaper for armor.A Mig 3 which was at lvl flight following and catching a FW190 that has just dived on it from 1000 feet above and tried to climb away with its energy advantage?No more than perhaps 120 players online at one time spread throughout ""Expert"" servers.For beginners this is a nightmare because you will spend most of your time 1 - Trying to figure out where you are on the map. 2 - Looking for a dot that might be an enemy aircraft or a friendly aircraft. By the time you can see what that dot is you realise that the dot is an enemy plane flown by a pro fanboi who is going to shoot you down in seconds. You just lost your only life on that server btw and wont be able fly for a few hours or the next day. Yay how fun for beginners!!!The Hardcore community in IL2 is truly what is killing the franchise by making it so difficult and therefore unwelcoming to beginners by insisting the majority of servers are using full realistic settings.I remember when Il2 had 500+ players on at peak times and most of the servers were small maps with more ""fun"" settings. It doesnt have to be arcade settings, you can still have realistic flight models/damage and gunnery.War thunder is thriving because they have a variety of servers with different difficulty settings, BOS does not.

												It really isn't a game for casuals like me.I own a controller and all so it's not like that was the issue, but the steep difficulty curve.I understand that complaining about difficulty in a simulator is like complaining about water being too wet, but coming from War Thunder Sim and liking that a fair amount, I thought this would be a natural step up.There was also the framerate issue which even lowest settings couldn't fix, so even on that front the game underperformed.Edit:I do not have the 1-2 week time frame in order to learn how to play the game properly to begin having fun. It is not that I dislike learning how to play games, but I would much rather play a game that is fun immediately --  or almost so -- after starting.Edit(4-8-2017)I've been hearing that there was a switch from Dx9 to Dx11 which apparently improved performance for most systems. While it stopped looking like a slideshow, the framerate frequently remains below 30fps when looking at any trees or buildings or airplanes, and only goes above that when looking at the sky.The settings almost completely lock out the user, with a choice betwen low, medium, high, etc. . ., and a choice to modify AA settings. There is no way to see if many of the post-processing options that are likely available are running, and thus reducing the performance.I have tried the tank combat, but because of the rather hefty lag it was hard to truly appreciate. The AI is stupid, default controls are archaic, and the gunplay didn't feel as impactful -- no real ""oomph"" when shooting your gun, or feeling of accomplishment when destroying a target.			"

												I bought this game because I had the one that came out on ps3 before I bought my pc. thhe one for ps3 had loads of planes a custom mission editor and felt very complete. This game looks alot better, but the aircraft veriety is very weak. 8 planes.... Then they turn around and sell planes at $20 a pop. In order to have all of the planes and missions, at which point you have a complete game, its $180... and they're not done making (transfering old plane files from the games they refuse to bring to windows 10) planes. they are selling a ""proper"" port of an old game to you for a 150%+ markup. I only spent 25 dollars on the base game.. I'll wait to buy the rest untill it's outdated AND dirt cheap. Oh and it causes a total lockup upon loss of focus, making me force a reset.... I like the game. Its just broken in too many ways right now.  I'll change my recomendation in two or three years. maybe.			"

												I bought the game from Steam.  I have an email confirming this.  I have a product activation key.  I tried to follow the instructions supplied by Steam when trying to open the game.  I get an error message saying my email address and password are wrong, or already in use.  I don't see why this should be so complicated.  I've been charged for the game,but I'm nowhere near to playing it.  I've had it with Steam.  I had bought another game from Steam a while back, ""Cliffs of Dover"", never could get that one to work either, but it only cost $9.00.  I'm not going to buy any more games from this site,and I'm goingto demand my money back and see how that goes.			"

												Do not buy this game. Not for 50% not for 90% discount. - There is not tutorial to speak of,- you need a secund account aside the steam, because game on steam are pirate for sure,- in game phisics are a joke, you need at least 60% to start rolling, breakes work when they feel like, and the same can be said for other controls like auto-prop_pich and so on.- On the ground at 0km/h if you push joystick forward to unlock the tail wheel, you will go nose down in to the grond, because ♥♥♥♥ phisics,  (yes you have a ♥♥♥♥ing key for that).- To this very day you still can't have a setting for every plane,- Again to this very day the planes are at Flaming Clifs like aka get your ♥♥♥♥ing hands OFF cockpit; you need to assign keys for anything,- You have unlocks, someone decided to turn a simulator in to a grinding fest (any other sim, you jump in any plane you want/have and just fly, here, you pay for extra plane, which is fine, then you need to grind to use the f...ing upgrades) ... wtf happend to sim oriented game? Do they really think that guys play simultator for unlocks? Who ever decide this needs to be out of job ASAP- in plane writing is in russian, at least for russian planes, and some may consider this to be realistic, but let me remind you that even on captured planes or planes used by other nations, pilots would have stickers with labels, so they should add that also .- some say the fly models are good but it is so much worse then IL2-CoD... in fact fly models are really close to the WT, you don't have the feeling that you produce drag when you manuver like you have in IL2-CoD, EoF or DCS. Who ever tells you that FM are good, clearly never played a good fly sim.On the good side,- there is good graphics,- sounds are good, not sure if CoD lv or not, but good- some hidden lv editor that is not visible in the main menu/submenus, I guess we should be thankfull for that at least. I got deluxe edition at 50% and I am realy sorry. Every single cent was a waste. 1946, CloD, RoF, DCS, F.BMS, take your pick, anything will be better then this. I am sorry to see developers want to turn this game in to a payed version of WT but mantaining the ""sim"" tag while doing that; it is not going to work guys, it will not be a good arcade, nor a good sim.

												Didn't even get past the control setup before I requested a refund for this game. If you use TARGET software the keybinds will not work. For example, flaps in IL2 BOS are 'F' for flaps down and 'left shift + f' for flaps up. If I program these keys into TARGET it will register the 'F' just fine. What it doesn't register is any modifier keys from TARGET such as shift, control, alt ect. When the correct keys are mapped, it would press 'F' for flaps down correctly, and 'F' for flaps up, even though it is mapped as left shift + f in Target. There is a work around but it requires you to set up 4 commands in TARGET for one keybind. I shouldn't have to command TARGET to press left shift, press f, release left shift, release f, just so I can have one keybind. I should be able to just program left shift + f as a singular command like any other game.			"

												Don't buy this. That is, unless you're a sadist who likes ridiculous levels of frustration. Now, I didn't go into a flight simulator expecting to be an ace pilot on day one, but I did expect some kind of help or instructional tutorial to help me get off the ground and find my way around the game comfortably. The problem is; I didn't get that. What I got instead was an admittedly beautiful simulator but with comically hillarious levels of poor design from the developers in term of greeting new players. Also, before you direct me to the Youtube guides, I say this: Why are such tutorials not built into the game? Hm? Why have the developers who have created a bloody FLIGHT SIMULATOR not given instructions for new players? Am I expected to keep tabbing out to check a video mid-game just to have a basic understanding on how to take off? I'll pass on that, thank you.I think as a rule of thumb now that I'll be instantly refunding games that lack sufficient effort in the area of assisting new players into the controls, gameplay, environment, etc. It's just ridiculous. You make a game with so much complexity but then skimp out on the instructional aspects? Hell, even a game with thousands of key-bindings like ARMA has tutorials! What's your excuse, IL-2? If I stick to it then yes, maybe I could be comfortable at some point in time playing this game. My point however, is that any game worth it's salt should assist new players in doing this. If not, then your playerbase is going to die off or at the very least, be tiny in size. This was actually somewhat evident, since online for this game is pretty barren (Or seemed that way when I was on).So, no. I don't recommend buying this game. Maybe, MAYBE if it's on sale. At full price though? Given the frustration aspect and giant learning curve with no assistance? No. I'm refunding this instantly.			"

												The atmosphere and graphics are good, but I feel marketing has become the primary focus of so many gamemakers now. The game is hard, and I have played many flight sims, but frankly couldn't be bothered to try to turn my PC into a flying machine financially and otherwise.... crashed on all 10 of my takeoff attempts. In the air on low settings the game if beautiful... I love looking around the cockpit, but I just don't dare move my stick for fear of a crash... if you are or always wanted to be an amateur pilot and want to have to feel like you are pressing 120 buttons on a real vintage dashboard just to prevent your plane from going into a stall this game is for you.My negative rating comes from the following: I feel a bit fooled that I invested in an Alpha (also bought 2 extra planes) that promised me a dynamic campaign with depth of experience and instead I get a half-baked campaign I could have had in IL-2 1946. Very dissapointed... I am supprised they call this version ready when it seems to be so much less than promised.Ohh, today launch day, I know many people had Early Access version and yet there was a total of 16 pilots on at midnigth GMT +1... that is dissapointing. It is actually fun to just jump into the plane and open and close the cockpit without daring to touch the controls... I remember the dev saying in an interview ""we want a game even complete newbs to flight sims can just jump into"" ... I am no newb, I mastered Red Baron 3d, even did good at this company's Rise of Flight, but I am not a trained Messeschmit pilot nor have the time to become one.Unlock of planes for a game this expensive is INSANE. Bad choice. Ohhh and my DLC's don't work and they did in early access.Pros: Detail of aircraftCons: Game is hard, campaign is hard (is it really so hard to make something as good as Dynamix's classic Red Baron?), ""fun"" factor they promised is not really there more than game released 20 or 10 years ago.

												The Following Need Fixing ASAP!The concept and artwork is brilliant but as in past incarnations, it is (still) riddled with problems.  The below need fixing urgently:1 - The combat view is pointless.  Simply fix the exterior camera view so that it snap-centers behind the aircraft (looking foward) as in past IL-2 games.  You can then look around from there (e.g. using hat switch).2 - The HUD key (default h) should not disable in-game map, map position icon or distance indicators of visible aircraft.  This should ONLY turn off the display bar (compass, altitude, etc.) and the right-side engine control icons.  The map and right-side messages can already be turned off separately.3 - The icon key (default i) should turn off the map position icon and distance indicators of visible aircraft.  This should be separate from HUD control because casual players don't want the display bar (which is pointless anyway as aircraft have these gauges) but like to see the map position icon and distance of visible aircraft.4 - When starting the game, it should automatically attempt sign-in and display the 'play offline' option if this has failed.5 - Prop pitch should be able to be mapped to a slider.6 - In the campaign mode, the 'of' in Battle of Stalingrad shouldn't be capitalised.  This just looks unprofessional.Please at least fix the first three and I'll change to a positive review.			"

Given tha I can't boot the game ... user satisfaction is low. Flight models suck. Game graphics are non-existent. Enemy AI (I'm assuming they mean the IC Company twit who set this registration process up) ... minimal intelligence exhibited.All up ... not a happy chappy at all.			"

												As an old IL2 Sturmovik/1946 veteran and proud ex member of the former I/JG78 squadI do NOT recommend this flight simulator.Horrible plane handling, accurate aim nearly impossible due your plane do wobble arround like crazy and you will hit more the sky than the enemy plane. Horrible joystick configuration with a gui that looks like copied out from a arcade console flight simulator. Manual joystick curves by entering numbers like in old IL2 1946 are impossible. No joystick profiles per plane possible, which is a big disadvantage by so many different plane types.It claims to be the continuation of the legendary IL-2 Sturmovik series but deserves that in no way. This game is a cash grave only, DLC's with one map and few planes are nearly same price like a triple A game release. You like to have new planes? Guess what, you have to pay for it ...Support is a joke !Very strange behaving developers. I did try ask for several times if they would be so kind and implement support for the Tobii Eyetracker 4C. Each time I got the answer that I have to ask this Tobii. They simply do not understand that this would be the job of the game developers to implement the Eyetracker API into the game. So finally I wrote a not so kindly email to the support and since then they do ignore me completely.Yeah this is also a way to treat paying customers... well done.A developer that needs to threat he will shutdown the game if reviews do not get mostly positive, http://www.gamerheadlines.com/2014/10/il-2-sturmovik-devs-metacritic/well this does tell everything about this company.Why I ever did buy this digital garbage...

Early Access Review
								i know it is early acsses but the settings to control the plane are for people with 100 fingers. the key bindings make no sense and compared with other simulations it is wildly over complicated			"

Early Access Review
								Lamest controls ever, I purchased this to have fun, not to learn how to fly a real plane, all that bobbing around with real physics is quite frustrating, even with a joystick, it is rubberbanding all over the place, I have pretty much all simulators and this one is the worst, plus, it is bug ridden, STAY AWAY FROM THIS!

												the graphics are really good. but there is a major problem in the gameplay. this game is too realistic  , does not have a good arcade mode , does not allow reloading of weapons by default. this made the game too much of a chore to play bcoz of too much realism. Will revise this review if the reloading of weapons is made more practical / good arcade mode is created.			"

												I have bought every single Maddox games IL2 Sturmovik title since the first one, and even had an email exchange with Oleg (flight sim god) himself. I ran a squadron for 8 years on the old Ubi lobbies through the whole series. I bought Cliffs of dover, and never before had i felt so saddened at how unfinished it seemed to be. I really felt for the developers because it always showed in the past how committed and helpful to the IL2 players they were. IL2 Clod was so disjointed that i put off buying IL2 BoS for a long time. But let me tell you this. I beleive IL2 is now the Sim that Oleg was dreaming of. Its great in this release, and i really feel like, theres no way i could go back to 1946 after having a go of this. I thought i had seen this series die, however now it has been resurrected. Sure i understand some peoples comments about lack of aircraft, however, the detail and damage modelling is tremendous compared to 1946 which i will say, does seem very arcade like in comparison. It would be beutiful to have all theaters, Pacific carrier landings and everything you had in 1946, yes that will be missed. Maybe one day Oleg will add all this in DLC, that would be the next dream. Its a great engine this time. Smooth, and polished way beyond what Clod was. The immersion in this sim on full real settings is superb.			"

												No regrets about getting this one (especially whilst on offer @ 50%). I own a few flight-sim's and despite this, I have found this one quite complicated to set up. I'm using triple screens at 5760x1080 (which BoS copes with fine). X-55 HOTAS (used for control axix's only) and a touchscreen running Helios custom profiles (for all other keyboard commands). BoS seems to run fine on Windows 10 getting 70+FPS with in-game settings on Ultra.			"

												Fantastic flight sim. This past year, I have been resurrecting an old passion of mine: Flight Simulation/Space Sim. I grew up flying with my father and my granfather was an experimental test pilot in the USAF. I have been an enthusiast all of my life.Because I cannot afford to fly in real life (due to  both time and money), so I currently fly a Saitek X-52 Pro and a TrackIR5 setup. My 'cockpit' is still in the beginning stages, but I hope to add little by little over time. Even though my own setup is rudimentary at best, this game is still likely one of the most realistic and immersive experiences I've ever had.I highly recommend IL-2: BOS, especially if you are a fan of the franchise. They have improved many facets of the game.The one complaint I have (if I must), is that it kind of boasts a narrow focus. In some ways, that can add to the experience. However, there is also a significant drawback. In an ideal world I would like to see a more varied, fleshed-out campaign/story and more aircraft. If nothing else, I wish 1C Studios would put out more content. Whether that be in the way DCS World does it, Expansions on current titles or something else entirely. Really this Con only speaks to what a fan I am of this franchise. I hope to see more from them in the future.In terms of experience, this came can be slightly brutal at first; even to an experienced pilot (virtual or otherwise). However, if you stick with it, you'll quickly get the hang of it. I Spent a week hitting it hard each night for an hour or two, and finally started to get the basics and get a feel for the aircraft.Anyways, pick the game up, it's great!			"

												Updating my intial negative review which I wrote due to problems with getting the confirmation e-mail when signing up on the developers website, which is mandatory for playing the game. That aspect still sucks.Its however not by far as big of a problem that it makes the game itself a bad buy. On the contrary.It is a fantastic simulator. I foresee myself playing it regularely for a long time. I find it challenging partly due to lack of tutorials etc but there is some help available online anyway. Also I probably suck in general since I find it hard to even land some of the planes consistently. Still great fun and its really rewarding when you get better.			"

												after spending a major amount of time with this game, i have decided to redo my review to reflect my feelings better:You have let down our country and our Red Army. You have the nerve not to manufacture IL-2s until now. Our Red Army now needs IL-2 aircraft like the air it breathes, like the bread it eats. Shenkman produces one IL-2 a day and Tretyakov builds one or two MiG-3s daily. It is a mockery of our country and the Red Army. I ask you not to try the government's patience, and demand that you manufacture more ILs. This is my final warning.- iosef 'stalin' vissarionovich's angry message to some lazy dicksmack, 1941			"

												First the negatives;BoS does not support clickable cockpits and have directly stated they will not. Clickable cockpits give a direct visual way to familiarize players with a given interface, especially with the helpfulness of mousing over different elements in the pit to help figure out where things are. This is especially important if you are going to switch between multiple aircraft to deal with the workload. In all honesty had I known that the clickable cockpits were not to be featured I would most likely not have bought it. Had I figured it out sooner I would have had it refunded. It's a personal thing; your mileage may vary. This wouldn't be so bad of course if the mapping for HOTAS setups wasn't so... rigid. My HOTAS Warthog for example would benefit greatly by being able to assign modifier buttons to chord multiple controls to a single hat switch for engine management. BoS as far as I can tell does not allow you to use anything but ALT, SHIFT and CTRL for modifiers. This is a limitation that even War Thunder  doesn't have.BoS has serious issues with configuring any of the multiple position switches on the Warthog to do anything useful.The game also has multiple interface issues that range from annoying to exasperating. From icons in the navigation menu being horrendously cryptic (If you need to exit the game to find out the difference between blue and orange bullets you are designing it wrong.) to old-hat keybinding of 20 keys just to get friendly AI to do anything (Come on guys, commo rose is a modern standard for a reason.).Precious little is known about any sort of mod tools for the game as yet, which would greatly benefit from it's expansion the way that IL2: Cliffs Of Dover has. Also when your most complete manual is written by a 3rd party; you have a serious problem.Aside from that BoS gives a solid simulation experience. The sensation of flight is superb and the level of polish is the highest of any simulation in its class at current. They have done amazing things with the spotting system that sits it head and shoulders above it's contemporaries. Moreso than any other sim is the feeling of being ""in the moment"" above a wintery Russian warzone.Now if only the game would tell me what those stupid bullet colors meant without resorting to the Steam forums.

												I felt it was time to update my old review in line with the many changes since I first made it.Pros- Solid Flight Model- Great Graphics- Regular updates- Friendly community- Scalable difficultyCons- Steam key setup for DLC confusing for new players- Too many Luftwaffe pilots online! ;)The game still looks beautiful and I still find myself taking screen shots all the time because of this. Thanks to the recent expansion, IL-2 Battle of Moscow, there are now even more planes and another large scale map if you decide you want more. The flight models of the aircraft feel very realistic and 1C studios, despite the fact they're a small team, are constantly working to make the aircraft as faithful as possible. The next expansion, Battle of Kuban, looks very promising as it brings a whole bunch of new aircraft of course, including the lend-lease Spitfire and a stunning new map. The new map is very different from the previous ones as Kuban is characterised by the sea and mountains. Furthermore the campaign system is receiving a complete overhaul (for all campaigns) and should feel a lot more dynamic and progressive than it does currently.Overall I'd say that the core gameplay and flight experience is solid, the graphics and great, the singleplayer experience is good and set to be vastly improved upon and the scalability and flexibility of the difficulty settings means it can suit everyone. And for those less interested in the Eastern Front you should know that the Pacific theatre is coming next.I started flying with the mouse and keyboard which is viable and still fun but have since upgraded to using a Saitek x52 Hotas, keyboard, HatTrackIR set up... and I love it.

												I am new the flight sims.  I have a cheap logitech extreme 3d pro, but it works fine for this sim.   It is very challenging at first.  For Newbies to flight sims, spend allot of time in the Quick Missions to get a feel for flying, shooting, and bombing.  Then your ready for fun on real missions.  Great game for the price (got it for 1/2 price when steam had a sale).			"
