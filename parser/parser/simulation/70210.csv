												Lets get this straight. I don't play poker or any other games similar to that in real life nor did i ever like the idea of playing. But:+This game is awesome! Firstly i got it on sale for 5euro (Premium Edition).+Easy to learn even for noobs like me. (Has a full tutorial about poker)+Its not JUST poker..its poker with Storyline!+Combines the storyline and buying stuff(hats for your character,houses for rent) with the thrill of playing a card game.+Has achievements which even for me are fun!+Time passes nicely -No multiplayer :(			"

												Governor of Poker 2 is an enjoyable poker game set in the Wild West, that offers more than just poker. There's a long campaign where you travel to different cities, play in various tournaments, encounter a variety of different opponents (including notorious ones), purchase buildings, and best of all, you get to buy new hats!

			Governor of Poker 2 gameplay, showing the beginning of the game and one poker match.		

A big feature of real poker is the tells on your opponents faces, but in this game you don't see faces, just hats! In spite of this, the game does a pretty good job of giving different personalities to the characters through their voices and actions, and there are tells in the form of comments they make and other information, such as getting steamy when they lose.A big part of the game is travelling to different cities and buying buildings, which provide you with passive income. At first you can only make money from playing poker, but once you own a reasonable number of buildings you have a steady income trickling in. The idea is to build up your reputation and take over different cities. You can borrow money from the bank if necessary, or sell buildings if you have any, and of course, you can buy new hats. New hats impart some personality to the players and allow you to enter new tournaments.The gameplay is fairly fast paced, it's an ideal game for a quick poker fix, but I'm not sure whether the cards played are truly random and whether the AI cheats or not. Some reviews claim that it does. I'm not experienced at poker so I can't really tell, but as a casual player the gameplay seems decent to me, even though I find it pretty hard to win, even on the standard level. The Telltale poker games are a lot more fun if you want personality and banter, but for a simple poker fix, this does the job and is better than other poker games I've tried. There's no multiplayer, so look elsewhere if that's what you want, but it provides a good single player experienceThe graphics are fairly basic, and low res too, but they're functional and pleasant to look at. There are free versions of this you can play on the internet but this version, the premium edition, provides more depth.Overall I'd recommend this game for casual players, especially because of the extra interest that the campaign provides. Serious poker players may want to look elsewhere though.			"

												One of the best casual poker games out there and for sure the best one on Steam, at the moment, in my opinion. It's important to note tho that this game is for casual players who are not very much into serious poker strategy. I do play online poker for real money at gambling sites versus real people and I can tell you for sure that strategies applied there, even on lowest stakes against dumbest of players, won't work very often on AI in this game. AI in this game is rather silly and most of the time plays nothing like real thinking player would. All tho you can certainly still learn how it ""thinks"" and use it for your advantage to predict it's behaviors. It's not like AI is completely random and doesn't make sense. But still, if you want a serious poker game where you could apply in-depth poker strategies this game is not for you. But it is excellent if you are newcomer to poker or just want to casually have fun time. Game has very attractive graphics and nice progression system where you buy houses and cities, what gives you profit every day once you own them. You gain fame and stars what allows you to challenge stronger and stronger opponents once you get more famous. You can walk around the city and talk to it's people, it's like a tiny poker RPG. The game also has a story which is told through newspapers what pops on your screen and NPCs what you can click to talk with. Not much of a story but it is there. And you can spend extra money you make on hats to customize your character. Obviously poker play is this game's main focus but it's nice that these RPG features are there.   Would I recommend Premium Edition? Yes, for sure! Would I recommend it for 20$? Probably not. Wait till this game goes on sale and then get Premium Edition. In the end of a day it's very repetitive and AI is not smart enough to justify paying 20$ for a flash game, which is what this game essentially originated as. If it would have multiplayer, like Governor of Poker 3, then it would be worth 20$ in my opinion, but it does not.			"

												21 hours in, really enjoying the game, while it is ""just Texas Hold em"", the ""RPG"" elements keep it lively and want to keep me playing to be able to buy ""one more house"" or ""get one more mine"", or beat one more ""boss"".   I am probably 2/3 to 3/4 of the way through.  The PC players are varied enough to keep it interesting as well (bluff a lot), occasionally make bad bets but it seems random enough to make it like playing a bunch of friends.    Fun casual game that is keeping my interest.Edit - 38 hours to finish the game and become ""Governor of Texas"".   Could play a bit more if I wanted to complete all the in-game achievements.    I continue to enjoy this game!			"

												Well if you like getting zero cards when going head to head or getting beat by a 2-6 off suit that over bets by 500% on no cards played yet....than this game is for you.  No one in their right mind -- unless they are just in a game to give away money to the poor would bet on 80% of these hands (which they will win..because they hardly deal cards to your character.  Played now for about 20 hours--non pro setting -- which may be the problem.Lets say the lay out cards are 8, Q, 10, 4, 9 / and you have A, J hold cards....they will win with a pr of 4's...the lowest cards possible - and I raised on the flop...hoping for a straight or high pair.  They stayed in with 4 and 7 off suited.  ...WOW...who in their right mind unless they are card counters, cheats or getting signals from the dealer at the table.  Software needs refinement...way too stupid - pure chance on any hand you get what so ever...high bets or no bets do nothing better.  I will get a streak of 10 hands in a row, but win on a high card Ace....which I was just trying different things - blinds were 50/100...just over betting to see what they did.  Showed cards, etc., whomever wrote the software has no clue about a real hand at a real poker table...just playing pure luck of anything.On the train - played over 200 hands against 4 players.  When down to the last one...I was up $5000.   Blinds 200/400  If I would bet low on a good hand - he would fold.  He would try and bully the hand - raise before flop.  With my guy hardly getting even suited cards ...much less anything else to play -- for about 15 hands.  He just took control..playing hard without anything.  Could not win against him no matter what.			"

												Before getting this game I read several reviews that said something like, ""Even though I don't like poker, I loved playing this game.""  I enjoy playing poker. I find this game tedious and boring.  You travel city to city playing poker and buying properties, which isn't bad; but in many of the poker tournaments you are forced to play are against ~50 or so opponents (as other players lose, they get replaced with new players).  A single tournament can last 6-8+ hours.  Then you move to the next city and repeat.  The AI you play against is varied -- some players will bluff, some will fold unless they have a pair or better -- this makes for enjoyable and realistic play.  Only buy this game if you love this tournament style of poker playing.			"

												Looking at my time played you would guess this is an awesome game. It really could be, but the poker engine is so flawed at it's core that I find myself playing terrible poker to compete with terrible AI. So much so that my RL game suffered.It's extremely addicting though, right up to the point where you just can't play it anymore without screaming in frustration. Good thing I got it on sale, as I'd be REALLY annoyed had I dropped 20 bucks on it.			"

												This is an excellent approximation of what it would be like to play poker against a series of children with ADD and only a basic grasp of the rules. All-ins pre-flop are routinely called by the computer player holding 4-6 off. 2-7 off is a must raise hand. It's impossible to put your opponents on anything as they basically play mostly randomly. Don't buy this game if you like poker.			"

												Since online poker was banned in my country, this satisfies the odd poker craving.++ AI seem realistic and vary their play. ++ With the option to set the game speed, you can quickly go through the hands. ++ No in game chat from NPC's like other competitors, you can just focus on the game.+ RPG element is a bit meh, could have done with better ideas, but at least gives a sense of progress. - Resolution is low, I don't mind 2D, but looks a bit washed out.- Could have given more interface options, like showing the river card.-- No multiplayer? Anyway, so far this is the closest to fun money internet poker without people selling your email and physical addresses. Worth the few dollars.  "

												I have the same issue I had with the original game. It looks at your cards and then bets accordingly.  Example I have a pair of cards in the hole. Computer will fold if even challenged. Another example computer gets a crap hand and then raises me when I have the better hold cards. Computer ends up with a flush. The computer knows in advance if its going to win or not and bets against that. So basically it doesnt matter if you show your cards at the end of the hand or not the computer knows exactly what you have. So instead of being a game of skill it becomes a random game that depends entirely on the computer allowing you to win. Just for the record I have played online and in real life poker. I suppose if you want to learn the basic rules of poker its good for that. Other wise the game is just a waste of time.			"

												This is a surprisingly engaging poker sim!  It mixes heads-up, cash, small (8 player), and large (80 player) tournament play well enough to help you procrastinate and (astonishingly) develop some useful poker skills.The AI is decent - not impressively smart, but overtly stupid, either.  On the whole, I didn't really notice trends or styles particularly to AI opponents, but their play was varied enough to keep you on your toes and make the challenge feel relatively real.  They bluff, slow-play, etc.  Real tournament players would probably be a touch more conservative, but the AI was skilled enough to make winning the bigger tournaments genuinely difficult.I struggled a bit at first, but gradually became smarter about playing conservatively early in tournaments, then opening up the throttle once I'd secured a spot in the money.  I also became much better at learning how and when to effectively bully opponents with shorter stacks.  Let's be honest, a video game won't make you a pro, but this game does force you turn off any casual poker instincts you might have and learn to play competitively.Whether you want to put in the hours to fully beat the game or just take part in an occasional AI tourney, this game is worth picking up, particularly if you're patient enough to wait for it go on sale.  I played here and there initially, then more obsessively as the tournaments got bigger.  Definitely worth whatever beans I traded for the bundle it was in.			"

												I play this game every once in a while because i like the simplicity of it.However, after downloading and installing this game again, a few days ago (and today), the only thing i get out of this game is a virus alert from my anti-virus saying that my laptop is infected. I get this message right after i try starting the game. The game itself crashes right after starting it. I only get the virus.			"

												First i played the demo and now i bought it. Nice poker game with many options.You can buy the houses on the cities to earn money to pay for the buy-ins.Hat shops, where you can buy stylish hats to combine with your cowboy style. (hehe, funny)Nice gameplay and graphics too.  "

												The AI cheats and second guesses every move...you rarely get good hands and if you do everyone folds.			"

												A fun game, but the AI players make their winning hands (from garbage hole cards) waaaaaaay too often on the River for it not to be programmed that way.			"

												Fun! Easy to learn, easy to play!  And it's just like real poker, I constantly lose my shirt!  Good thing this is only play money or I'd be out on the street right now!!			"

												Favorite Poker game of all-time! I love everything about this game and I will never stop playing it. Played it when it appeared on a game website I used to play on and had to buy it. You should try this game out!			"

												Playing cards with friends is convivial.  Gambling with meaningful stakes is tense and (to some) exhilirating.  Playing cards against a machine for imaginary money is neither.  To make up for that deficiency, a computer poker game needs to add a lot of bells and whistles.  Governor of Poker 2 tried to do that with an investment mechanic and hats to unlock and  a few other extra features.  For me, it still wasn't quite enough to counterbalance the tedium of slowly playing cards against a collection of uninteresting opponents represented primarily by oversized hats.			"

												This game is fun and frustrating at the same time. I enjoy playing it regardless and definitely rate it one of the better Texas hold em poker games out there.....			"

												It's a funny game but don't make the mistake to pay 20 euro for this - IT DOESN'T WORTH THAT KIND OF MONEY. Especially because I can't get rid of the feeling the game is ""programmed""to give you the cards you need each time you fold....			"
