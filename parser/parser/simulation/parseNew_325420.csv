Early Access Review
								EDIT: The game went into alpha recently. Most of the points made in my review still apply, but I will no longer be playing this game due to optimization issues.So im almost at the 500 hour mark... time for a real steam review.Homebrew Vehicle Sandbox is exactly what it says on the tin. There is one large map populated with several islands that you can roam around in, and there is also a garage where you can create literally any kind of vehicle you can imagine. Their is no questline or story (as of yet), just exploring the map with wacky vehicles and your buddies on the many multiplayer servers available.+The only limit to what you can build is yourself. Build planes, jets, boats, hot air balloons, tanks, jet-powered flying shlongs. You name it, it can be built.+Easy building interface. The building mechanics are a cross between voxel-based and components-based, with 'pipes' acting as frame pieces which specialized components can be attached to.+Incredibly realistic physics engine. Aerodynamics plays a massive part in air vehicles, and at least a basic understanding of real-life physics is needed to make more complicated vehicles.+Playerbase is incredibly nice and helpful. The devs are very communicative and can often be found playing on their own servers, where you can then bombard them with questions and reccomendations for the game.+Online multiplayer. Once you're done exploring the map, you can join an online ""party"" and blast people out of the air with hellfire missiles >:D=Large learning curve due to the realistic physics. You cant just slap a few rockets on a car and fly rings around towers, a lot of tweaking and testing is required to perfect your vehicles.=Controller support is largely incomplete, limiting controller use to the simpler vehicles.-Button mapping is just god-awful. Homebrew implements a button-mapping system that allows you to assign keys to basic functions, and then assign those functions to components. To be honest it would be a lot easier if I could just assign keys to components, rather than this in-between system.-Still very buggy. None of them gamebreaking, but it can be quite annoying when a vehicle ive been working on for an hour gets corrupted and no longer usable.-Graphics arent that great (I honestly dont give a fart about graphics, but there are people out there who think otherwise).

Early Access Review
								Update: 01/15/15--I highly recommend downloading the demo (which I had no clue was available at the time of purchase) from the game's website (http://www.homebrewgame.com). Personal experience will tell you far better than any review whether or not you'll find this game worth the money. --My ""no"" recommendation is MUCH more qualified than earlier. The game has been streamlined a bit, optimized a lot, and shows no signs of ceasing improvement.In addition, the developers added a link in-game to community YouTube tutorials and improved its in-game manual. The physics are still cardboard-balloonish, but I feel like they will improve with time.In addition, as you can see below, the developers definitely care about this game and LISTEN to criticism rather than trying to squash it, which makes them ok in my book.I still honestly think it's too rough to justify the price, but I sincerely think that could change if development continues at this pace.----------Previous review----My ""No"" Recommendation is qualified; please read the full review for an explaination.If you're anything like me, you played Banjo Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts and fell in love with the vehicle-building system.Ever since I played that game, I've been looking for a game that was essentially -just- the ""screwing around with vehicles"" aspect of BK:N&B. When I saw this on the store page, I thought I'd found it.So far, I was wrong. It definitely has promise; don't misunderstand me. Conceptually, it really is a neat vehicle-building sandbox. But it's in rough, ROUGH alpha shape. The physics are currently of the ""cardboard balloons"" variety, the camera is weird and unintuitive, and the game still isn't great at explaining how to use all its features. It's not egregiously bad and it's not unplayable, but it feels like it's a very long way from the finish line.Now, then: If I don't think it's -that- bad, why am I not recommending it? Well, because of the price. So many Early Access games do this; they take an early build and charge way too much for it. If this game was $4.99 in its current state, I'd recommend it pretty solidly, because there's enough here to be mildly entertaining for now and enough promise to keep an eye on the game. As it stands, $17.99 (or $15-ish at the moment) is just too much cash to drop on something this rough.If the dev keeps working on it, this game CAN be the game I've dreamed of, and when it's closer to that, I'll heartily recommend it. Until then, I suggest wishlisting it and checking in every now and then to see how it's coming.			"

								First and foremost, it needs to be said that this game is in very early stages of development. Additionally, if you don't enjoy things like geometry, physics, engineering, aerodynamics, etc, this  game may not be up your alley.THAT SAID, I personally find this game extraordinarily brilliant. There is a learning curve, absolutely, but the complaints that there is no information available to guide you are blatantly false. Granted, it isn't the typical bright and friendly hold-your-hand walkthrough sort of tutorial that lots of full release games have nowadays. People who are capable of reading and following directions will have no trouble, though.As an avid, lifelong fan of all means of transportation, Homebrew has allowed me to create functional versions of daydream vehicles once confined to the realm of doodles on scratch paper.There has never been a game quite like this one, and it only stands to improve as time goes on.

								Game is a very interesting concept; you get to build custom vehicles and drive them around in a sandbox-type environment.  On the surface, I really like the idea of this game.  Unfortunately I have some problems getting past the distinct issues it has (as an early access):+The game is buggy - This is to be expected, and I am really hoping that they will address these things soon+Instructions are limited - Yes there is a ""manual"" of sorts, but things like not being able to delete parts once you have attached them lends to a very frustrating point where you continually have to stop and start over.+Random freezes - Pretty self explanatory+Limited parts options - Again, I recognize that this is an early access, and I am simply hoping that this develops over time.  At current, there are only a handful of parts available for creating vehicles, which lends to a frustrating limit on what the user can create.Overall, the game is conceptually very interesting, and I look forward to seeing it develop and address some of these issues.  Homebrew, if developed correctly, could be the next combination of Minecraft and digital Legos.			"

								This is a great game! Even though it is an early access game, the content that you recive is quite alot! Pros:-You can build your own frames and vehicles.-Large open world to explore.-Lots of parts to build with (they will be adding more)-Decent quality for the price.Cons:-Physics needs tweaking.-Unlocking parts at the start can be a challenge since you need to collect orbs using limited parts. (over time this becomes easier as you unlock more parts)-Moving around without a vehicle is slow, when you run, its like you are jogging.-When you are building a vehicle, it can be a challenge to link parts correctly (but practice makes perfect)Overall, i rate this game 10/10.

Early Access Review
								Due to life being life, I haven't had as much time to play this title as  I'd like to.  But I've played enough to realize that this game is downright awesome.  Sadly, for some reason, it has remained criminally underrated here on Steam.  It deserves far more attention and DEFINITELY does not deserve the negative ratings it has gotten recently.  Most of the negative reviews I've read stem from two general complaints, both of which are stupid, as I shall now explain...Stupid Complaint # 1 - ""This game is tooo Harrd!  How doo I vehicle more?""Explanation: This is a physics and engineering sandbox game,  consisting essentially of two elements: a set of tools with which players can create machines; and an environment in which they can observe and interact with those machines.  The more robust and detailed these two elements are, the more complex the software will be.  This is inevitable.  If you want the power and freedom to create fantastic, interesting machines, you MUST be willing to learn how to use the advanced tools required to do so.  There are plenty of avenues to learn how to play this game.  If you don't want to learn anything new - fine.  Go play Doom or Flappy Bird or whatever.  But don't blame this game for your laziness.Stupid Complaint # 2: ""This game has bugs / incomplete features.  It's like they're charging us for EARLY ACCESS to their unfinished game!  WTF?!""Explanation:  Firstly, learn to read.  Second, use your newfound reading skill to acquire knowledge about products BEFORE you spend money on them.  This strategy will reduce the likelihood that you will purchase something you do not actually want, such as an early access copy of a game that is still under development.  If you review an early access game, you have to review it AS SUCH.  As of the writing of this review, there have been 71 announcements from the developers.  Seventy-fricking-one!  A little research will quickly show that the game is under active development and there is a great relationship between the devs and the community. This is pretty much all that can be asked of an early access title (and it's a hell of a lot more than you'll get from most games currently listed as early access).  If you don't like early access, don't buy it until it's finished.  But don't criticize the game for not being complete when it isn't claiming to be so. Ignoring the negative reviews based on the two stupid reasons I just debunked, you'll see that this game has gotten a lot of positive feedback.  And it clearly deserves it.  There are very quality few games in this genre.  I have scoured every corner of Steam, and I can name every one I found on one hand.  Kerbal Space Program, Space Engineers, From the Depths, and Homebrew Vehicle Sandbox - if you know of a single other title worthy of being on that list, I'd love to hear it.  In the meantime, if you like any one of those games, I suggest buying them all.  Between the four of them, you should have enough to keep you occupied for at least a decade or two.			"

								Vehicle Sandbox has come a fair way since the last iteration of it, the presence of paneling is a welcome addition (though requires patience if you wish to do anything extravagant), and the game on a whole runs a fair but smoother. I especially like the reworked tuning system. It requires a bit of getting used to but it gives the player much more control, and one can organize their workspace however they wish, separating systems and keeping it all neat and tidy. I still recommend this game. :p			"

								Let me be clear and short here. This game is not ready yet. The controls are quite strange and the building system don't help much (which is normal, assuming it's on early access).Then why am i recommending this?Simple. The developer of this game is the most communicative developer i ever saw in steam early access. Just check out the steam forum over there and see for yourself. Or even better, ask him something!There is also a very big update coming out soon. One that may possibly change everything i just said about the game up there for the best, with a new and better building system, more parts, better controls and a much larger and richest world.Just give the dev some time and the game will be awesome!

Early Access Review
								::DISCLAIMER:: This review does not represent some of the newer features/fixes that have been introduced as of Jan 15, 2017. I understand that new parts have been added and a procedural wing genereator has been added as well but I haven't extensively looked at these updates. There is still no mirror/symmtrey mode from what I can tell. That, more than anything is discouraging me from playing. I will update this review accordingly next time I look at the game. ::DISCLAIMER OVER::It pains me to write a negative review for this game but at this point, i'm left with no choice. To sum up my experience with this game (more specifically the building component) I find myself getting frustrated and annoyed everytime I try to do something.BuilderI only really enjoy building planes, but that's not the games fault, i'm just not interested in building cars. One of my biggest gripes is that there's no mirror mode. You want to build a twin engined plane? You'll have to build the engine twice. You want to put windows on it? You'll have to build them twice. You want a gear retraction mechanism? You'll have to bui..you get the point. It makes EVERYTHING more tedious and difficult than it should be. I've spent hours trying to build and ""skin"" an aircraft only to find that the skin plate on one side was like, one notch off. IF THERE WAS A MIRROR MODE, I wouldn't have even had that problem in the first place, or at least, it would have been easier to fix. But instead it took me another 2 hours just to nail down what exactly was wrong and pretty much re-adjust every single other skin plate in order to fix it. I don't know why this feature has not been made a priority, it seems like it's pretty standard with most other creative building games. Aviation PartsAnother issue I have (granted it's not a huge issue) is the lack of plane parts. I don't mean the number of plane parts, I mean the types. You're basically limited to general aviation 4 seater aircraft or SUPER-SONIC FIGHTER JETS!! There's no inbetween. If you want to build a mid-sized aircraft, you're pretty much stuck either slapping a bunch of cessna wings on it or putting up with a weird looking wing that's the same size as your plane and intended for speeds above mach 1. I would like to see a procedural wing generator but I understand that's probably not the easiest thing to do so I would be happy to even see wings analagous to something like a Beechcraft 1900. BugsIt's unfortunetly got a lot of bugs. It seems like everytime there's a new update, there's a new bug I have to deal with. THIS time the clickspots are offset from the actual menu so your mouse has to be below the button to actually click it. It the button is near the bottom of the screen then you're pretty much screwed. It's not present in fullscreen it seems but that just means you're committed to using full screen mode. That and there's a meriad of little things that are annoying such as not being able to hook up strobe lights to batteries making them completely useless. EARLY ACCESSThis game has been in alpha for almost two years. Really? It's another example of an early access game that just never leaves this state, or if it does, it's at the expense of the player base(see SpaceBase DF9). If I had to make a guess, it will never leave alpha (PROVE ME WRONG COPY-BUG-PASTE!), that just seems to be the trend of early access games these days. Updates are few and far between, offering (usually) little in gameplay content. An exception to this is the ""recent"" multiplayer update, but even that was riddled with bugs and we had to wait a few more days for it to be in a USABLE state. Even today the multiplayer button still says [EXPERIMENTAL] on it..The Good NewsIt's not all bad. If you have the paitence to learn how to build and to do the actual building, it's actually pretty enjoyable. There's nothing more rewarding than building something that works just the way you want it to. Making small adjustments and tweaks to fine tune your ""creation"" is surprisingly fun. The physics has been improved since HB13 and while it's certainly a long ways from being considered ""realistic"", it feels good for what it is and most importantly, it's fun. It's no X-Plane 10, but the aerodynamics are decent too. SummaryThis game is very close to being worth 20$, but it's not there yet for various reasons. The lack of updates is the biggest killer for me. I hate waiting a month for a feature that is either buggy or that i'll likely never use. Don't get me wrong, for the most part I enjoy this game or else I wouldn't have played it for 93+ hours and I WANT it to succeed! I think it has a lot of potential but I can't recommend a game on potential alone. 15$ is a more reasonable price for this in it's current state, also taking into consideration it's been almost two years since it was initially released on steam. I'll give this a thumbs up when meaningful updates become more frequent, and I can actually play it for more than 10 minutes without my blood pressure going through the roof.			"

Early Access Review
								great game! its in early access pre-alpha right now and it's really quite awesome already. the developers are friendly and quite active in the community.every update brings either new parts, new tracks for racing, or some kind of optimization or improvement.Homebrew allows you to build almost any kind of vehicle, even hybrids like gas/electric cars or a boat thats also a jet fighter... just about anything you can think of. once you finish the tutorial, you will unlock the full sandbox mode with access to all of the parts for building.the best part is probably the multiplayer where you can see and use other peoples creations, take on the alien threat together, or engage in wild land/sea/air vehicle combat. you can also share vehicles via host/download sites like dropbox.*UPDATE* 11/23/16 game is still amazing, and has been ported to the new engine beautifully. the improvements that have come in the past year are SO GOOD! i still play this game daily and have racked up 1200 hours game play time. the community has grown and its a non-toxic community, we all help each other with builds and the multiplayer is frequently full servers. there is also a very nice discord community with many players with over 1000 hours experience willing to help anyone with problems either through steam/in-game chat or voice comms on discord.there are ALWAYS new competitions and events being held by players so if you lack building inspiration, just check out one of the many build challenges and competitions set by players!WORKSHOP support! did you build an amazing creation and want to share it with the world? just upload it to the workshop and others can download and play with your vehicle! and you can try the 1200+ vehicles already uploaded to the shop! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!			"

								My advice to anyone considering buying this game is to go watch some of the user videos first.  The ones made by shakenbake are really good.  This will give you an idea of what you can build and some idea on how to use the ui.The ui/building can be a bit clunky but the devs are working on that.With that being said, this is (in its current state) a vehicle building sandbox only.  There are no challenges, missions etc....yet.  I am having the most fun building and sharing vehicles.  Its pretty cool to see what others come up with.  In multiplayer you can drive each other's vehicles.This game has real potential, and is fun in its current state if you like building things.  Just keep in mind that building  is 90% of the game at the current time, although I assume that will change in the future.  The game is very playable with minimal bugs.  When playing I feel as if it's missing features as opposed to having bugs, which it should be that way considering it is alpha.I'm having a blast playing and am looking forward to seeing what this game becomes.

								So Homebrew.  Lets see, where to start?  Is the game good?  Yes!  Am I good with reveiws?  Absolutely not.  But how else are you gonna know it is good unless people tell you it is.  Whether or not they're good at telling you it is good.  But enough of that, on to the actual reveiw I guess.So yeah.  Homebrew...  Obviously this isn't a game about brewing moonshine in your back yard over a can of beer.  Which is kinda pointless, since you're drinking other alchohal that you payed for while making alchohal that you sell to pay for buying other alchohol, so WTF.  Anyway, we're not doing any of that in Homebrew.  In Homebrew Vehicle Sandbox, you're making your own vehicles and enjoying created vehicles within a sandbox environment.  So sorry all you moonshiners, but this is not a game about making moonshine.  Instead, Homebrew is about embracing creativity, in whatever form that may come in, and making vehicles with it.  Be it cars, trucks, planes, boats, airships, helicopters, Gundams, trains, hoverbikes, rockets, etc.  You name it and, with enough creativity and the right know-how, you can make it.  You can even sorta ""code"" videogames inside Homebrew!Homebrew does this by offering an expansive vehicle builder allowing you to combine all kinds of parts to make whatever you want.  Including a unique take on logic systems that most other vehicle building games simply don't offer.  Certainly not Space Engineers or Scrap Mechanic.Homebrew really has something in it for everyone.  If you like a certain car a lot, you can replicate it in Homebrew.  If you've got some crazy idea for a plane, you can build it in Homebrew and enjoy all that wackiness from the safety of your living room.  If you're an artist, Homebrew certainly isn't any kind of sculpting or painting software.  However, you can still make brilliant artwork by using it. Even for those fancy coding ninjas out there, I've personally made several videogames within Homebrew, including Pong and Flappy Bird, to name two popular examples.  While I'll admit there isn't currently a coding language that you use to create these games, it is in the works and will definitely be featured later on.  For the time being, it is a little clunky to code games within Homebrew, but I think I've proven it possible.Not to speak lightly of it by making it my last point, but Homebrew also has amazing developers and community.  If you're having trouble with anything related to the game, or even things not related to the game, shoot the community a question and you'll get a friendly answer fairly soon.  And if not, the devs themselves will usually come help you out!  How awesome is that?Personally, I love Homebrew.  It is no doubt my favorite game.  Granted, Homebrew has more than its fair share of bugs (at the time of writing), but those are being steadilly ironed out, and Homebrew is steadilly growing as well.  It's hard to say where Homebrew will be in 2 years.  But I can definitely say the devs are on the right track and are well on the way to making a game that pretty much everyone can enjoy.- - - - - Now I suppose I should add a few downsides (cons) as well, shouldn't I?  Well, I'm really having a lot of trouble thinking up some, but I'll give it a go.First major con:  The game has more than it's fair share of bugs.  I know I already said that pretty much word for word before, but it is worth mentioning.  Granted, none of them are really game-breaking, but they are noticeable.  There are usualy workarounds that us players can utilize, And the devs are constantly at work fixing up one bug or another.  But certain bugs have remained in the game for quite some time, and are fairly easy to spot within the first 50 hours of playing the game.Second major con:  Updates can be rather slow.  At times we've been over 2 months between updates.  While Homebrew devs are not the slowest, it can feel like it at times if you're  really  invested in the game.  Granted, they're always hard at work on cool new features, often times these are even features suggested by the community.  But my point still rings ever true.  The updates can be rather slow.			"

								Update Dev 2015: The v14 patch is here! This is a big one. The devs basically remade the game in Unity 5. Some of the systems are entirely re-done and it is overall a big improvement. I'll highlight a few great points below, but this isn't an exhaustive list of all the great changes / addition. + much more flexible building tools (like being able to adjust pipes _after_ welding them to your vehicle, etc). + you can save vehicles / sub-assemblies and spawn / weld them in other projects :)+ flexible plating / skin system: It's only the start right now but there are already some easy to use parts for making body panels that far surpass the rigid old dog plates from v13. + support for the most wanted thing in this game: servos! Actuators, servo motors, whatever you want to call them. Finally it is very easy to make all manner of things from turrets and landing gear, to swept wings and shuttle bay doors!+ Great kismet / wiring system. Most of the parts input and/or output (as required) float numbers (generally normalized between -1 and 1) for their functions. You can link inputs and outputs as you want, and there are a variety of modifier parts for combining / shifting / gating / etc the values as you go along. This makes it possible to do things like have a gyrosensor used to adjust the flaps on your plane to keep it level, while still combining it with the input from the user's seat. + better physics. I suppose that matters. Center of mass / lift calculated in much better fashion now. It means if you make something that looks like it should fly, it probably will ^___^+ waves on da ocean ----------------------------------------------Update Jan 2015: The devs removed the orbs a few patches ago, and now it is a proper sandbox mode (once you complete the initial tutorial). Now you can unleash your creative potential almost immediately!  It is much better this way. As the game stands now there are lots of things to play with in terms of vehicle parts, and the devs have a lot of cool things in the pipeline too. It's damn fun. Looking forward to future updates :)Pre-update review: This game would be great if you didn't have to go about collecting annoying little orbs to unlock parts. For a game advertising extensive freedom that seems like an unnecessary and arbitrary restriction, especially for a pre-alpha or whatever it is.(recommended nonetheless)			"

								Is this game one I would recommend? Yes. Are there some problems with it? Of course, it's still an early access title. It's much more optimized, so it can definitely be played on some slightly lower end PCs. I use my Xbox 360 controller for vehicles, which makes things a bit easier on me. You have lots of options as to what to build (and there is still more to come). I've built everything from small 110cc powered boats to hypersonic jets that can go past 7,400 km/h before hitting the world border (took me 3 days of continuous testing and improvement.The one thing people don't get about physics and this game is that this is not something you'd find in Forza, NFS, GTA or CoD. This is all about solid and fluid dynamics. It's about what you can do to improve the quality of whatever you build. Build it faster, stronger, more efficient. This is something that takes practice, not something you can just pick up and go. But, once you do get the hang of it the possibilities are nearly endless. I just hope they make longer runways and bigger worlds. My hypersonic jet can go much faster than 7.4k km/h.			"

								This is a very underrated game, I bought it when it was first released and was blown away with what was possible, if minecraft was Lego then Homebrew is meccano at an advanced level. So I thought they'd keep on adding new parts, which they did.What I didn't expect, didn't even think possible (within unity) is they developed the graphics, better physics, really clever on the fly pipe deformation, panals so your creation doesn't look so bare, but they keep on going, they surpased my expectations but also what I thought was possible in unity, I've not researched this company but if this is their first game, then I'm happy to invest!

								Homebrew in short: ""A better lego game than lego have managed to make!""A Vehicle building sim, you're given the ability to make your own ""pipes"" as if you're welding metal beams together, the set them up as a chasis for your build, before adding the components needed to make, whatever you're building, work. Then you tune it up! Link the fuel tanks to engines, the engines to the wheels and the control hub (Currently a car seat but the devs have said more types will be added in the future!) to the needed parts to make it all work!Then leave the workshop, take your build to the (bigger than it seems) outside world and give it a test!And the fine tuning options in the final building stage are vast! You really can make and change so much!Limitations?Your imagination and skills.If you're after something to build and play with your builds this is the game for you! None of that modula building, no hand-holding or baby sitting either!A very good game, and a great, very friendly and involved Dev team!			"

								Homebrew is a vehicle building game where its worst feature is the vehicle building.The graphics are okay, the sounds are... ehh, the prebuilt vehicles are *awesome*, the game world is huge and varied and the idea of building the stuff of your dreams is enticing enough to get you to build.And then you realize how sucky building is.For starters, the builder has physics on it, meaning every part that's not tied to the starting node will fall to the ground and tumble, making you adjust your camera, go around to the face you want to weld to your vehicle, click it, and then back to the vehicle to select the part to weld it to. It has no symmetry tools either, which will force you to do each thing twice for the other side of it. You can build custom pipes which is great in theory but then you realize you have to do it *again* for every single one you build. On top of that, parts are throughly premade and scaling is almost non existant, limited to a handful of *components* (not whole parts), and the few that include rescaling only allow for very limited options (you can make a rectangular  wing wider and longer, but not change its shape). You can't move stuff easily either, if you want to shift a set of parts sightly forward or backward you will have to disconnect the root part which will make EVERYTHING disconnect from each other and fall to the ground. The selection of parts is adequate, but with fixed dimensions and with the busywork of having to do symmetry manually the frustration will quickly set in.You do link parts manually, which is great, letting you make very complex inner workings, and stuff like gears and logical connectors also opens up a lot of ideas, but the game sorely lacks a lot of the basic building blocks that would make such a product enjoyable and accessible.3/10. The building really mares this game down to the point of unpleasantness, and though the more advanced options are really juicy looking, making anything in this game is an exercise in busywork, unpleasantness, and frustration. It has advanced very little since I tried it out a year or so ago, and it has no excuse for being this intensely clunky in a world where games like KSP and Empyrion exist.			"

								HomeBrew, It's pretty much a game where you make ""stuff"" (and I say that because its to broad to specify).You can litterally make anything you want, hovercrafts, helicopter boats and more. It's even got multiplayer and for a game this new this is awesome.You may be thinking ""Oh I played other sandbox games like GMod"" but HomeBrew is different;-The map is HUGE, and that is no exaduration either-You can make your own parts (Pipes for all you MLG's out there) allowing you to make any vehicle you can imagine-Proper sandbox, none of this ""Oh you can spawn stuff in. SANDBOX GAME!""-No BS mods required to make it fun, its got it all (Including weapons :P)-Advanced design engine, the way you design things is simple and easy to get for sandbox vehicle builder meaning you dont have to google tons of videos to find out how to use it-Information, you dont have to but you can read about every parts origin (History lesson in a game!)-No lag, it may say it needs 3 cores to run, but it really doesnt it runs great at decent settings on my dual core laptop with dated graphics card (I have better ones, I ain't no scrub!)-""123 No lag for me"" cheat command takes you to a less laggy world even if you do have issuesBy no means am I saying this game is the king of all sandboxes, but if want to design things and test them with your ""friends"" then this is the game for you.Bad things about this game (even though you read this far in a posative review)-Can be labourious at times, such as wielding a part rather than a quick place without having to do multiple clicks, but for Beta I can accept this-Not many parts, again  I reviewed this when it was EARLY ACCESS but the amount the game gives you is sufficient to keep you occupied (Not saying that there isnt enough, rather theres thinds I'd like to see in the future E.g. Stairs)-Graphics outside the valley can be a little lacking such as ""streched"" textures but its not frustrating you dont need to leave the valley unless you are using the ocean (water does look nice tho)-Getting round the map, sometimes this can be fun such as making the player use vehicles they have made, but if you just want to use a new boat you've made then you have to go quite some distance to get to it.I dont want to knock this game for what it is right now, to be fair you couldnt tell this was a Beta release from what it is now. -S.C			"

								Should you get this game? Short answer: DefinitelyLong answer: See belowHomebrew - Vehicle Sandbox (AKA Homebrew AKA HB/hb) is a sandbox vehcile builder as the name suggests and is probably the most most under-rated one out there. The problem with most sandboxes is that they just don't feet rewarding or it's hard to get help for specific problems; this is not the case with Homebrew. Homebrew has it's own official Discord server where you can meet new people, ask for help, share your creations, and even talk directly to the devs who are probably the most responsive devs I have ever known as they will listen to what you say and try and help or even just brainstorm with you. Homebrew is still in an alpha stage but there are few bugs (every game has them) and they are constrantly getting ironed out by devs and beta testers.Why should you get Homebrew over any other sandbox? Because it's not like any other sandbox, it's not just as simple as adding parts such as a fuel tank and an engine but then connecting those two parts in the ingame tuner which only serves to give you the sense that you really are creating your own new thing. The building itself is fairly simple to use but to master this game is a feat I have yet to experience, even with nearly 300 hours at the time of writing, but mastering the game although useful is in no way neccesary to build craft that are truly unique to you! At the moment, most land vehicles are possbile as are planes, helicopters, blimps, and boats (and many more). However the game is still in an alpha state and soon will be adding parts dedicated to submersibles and helicopters ETC, note that these vehicles are still possbile to build and use in the games current state. Weapons are also making a come back very shortly along with a damage system!I can't reccomend this game enough and can not wait to see more people playing it and in the fully active Discord community with people from all over the world. The devs deserve the money for this game and more as they are only a team of 4 people who are constantly completely rewriting how certain physics works to keep the game fun and realistsic.This game is AMAZING, full stop. Buy it.			"

I say would, because there are still a LOT of bugs and annoying issues in the game that need to be addressed before more people purchase this. But keep an eye on it, because if they fix the broken camera angles and add a more informative tutorial (because the amount of confusion I experienced firsthand was unbelieveable), this game could definitely be the simulator you're looking for.

As with all Early Access Games, there can be bugs, please exuse them as they are constantly being searched for and squished. Do not purchase unless you fully understand this.Another Sandbox Vehicle game, But wait.... this might be different,Homebrew opens the mind up to a few more challenges than usual and even offers a multiplayer that we haven't seen in many sandbox vehicle games besides those stricly with PvP. When you spawn into the world for the first time you might be amazed with how much stuff there is to do, and plans for more and much bigger maps are in the works, so you can expect to have a fair bit of exploring to do. From quarter pipes to insane ramps launching you over waterfalls, you'll have a fun time doing stunts and flipping your vehicle all over the place. There is a vehicle editor that allows you to build your own creations. The building system is a little difficult to master at first but once you figure it out, building your own rides is actually the best part of the game. Pit them up against your friends on a racetrak or go for the most airtime on a quarter pipe with your rocket powered dragster.  Sharing will be made available to upload and share your creations with your friends and others, I'm not sure if this is going to be via Steam Workshop or not but sharing is planned for the future. There is a story line planned as well which could add a lot more playability to the game in the future, could we even possibly see a coop mode? As of now, it's still a little buggy at times but the future of Homebrew is looking really good. If you like creating and building, I suggest you pick this up when you get a chance. Just remember, It is in early access.  "

Okay, it's not a true sandbox yet as you have to collect three kinds of orbs to buy parts you can use in the vehicle builder. But what's the point in building vehicles if you don't want to take them out for a spin. just collect some orbs along the way and before you know it you'll have enough orbs,Even though i had a really great time with this Early Acces game, it's not for everybody. if tinkering and experimenting is your thing, this game will be right up your alley!

(Edit #2 : Not True Anymore, And they are still adding more and more parts.)(- -)The physics itself, which is also ""very lacking "" in implementation and scope.    (Edit #2 : Not Anymore, The Physics is prettty decent now, and I am sure it will be improved even more.)  (+/-)Plus, the game looks ugly as well, not that it matters this early in it's alpha.       (Edit  #2: Not True, The Game Looks pretty decent now, and with time I am sure, it will keep getting better.)TL;DR: This Game is just too early in alpha, so things might look better in due time, keeping fingers crossed, and hoping that the devs will deliver. (TL;DR: #2 And they are delivering, judging by how much the game has improved over the last year.)Edit: Waiting for the new update, hoping the devs will deliver.Edit #2 : The devs are delivering, the new update is totally rad, and the only thing that (still) holds the game back, is the unintuitiveness of its control/camera scheme and it messy UI.

								So I played homebrew a lot already. And I absolutelty love the game and the best community I ever saw that it offers. Most people that think this game is not a good vehicle builder/simulation fail at the steep learing curve this builder has. When starting you have to invest some time into tutorials, trying to understand how the basics of homebrew work. Once you got your first car built, you will learn things quickly and the fun starts. Of course, a vehicle simulation should be near reality, when considering physics and graphics. Homebrew offers both. The graphics are quite advanced and physics work as they should. This way it is also not that simple to build for example a plane. And I think that's how it should be in every builder. Understanding the physics behind a plane or how acceleration, speed and grip effect the way your car will drive, help to build working vehicles. That's what's most fun about homebrew. Getting a challenge and mastering it. In Homebrew you are able to optimize your work until you are completely satisfied. The possibilities in this game are endless. There are nearly no restrictions that will let your creativity suffer. From simple and fun to complicated and challenging, homebrew offers projects for everone. - Cookiie -my personal tips: Having problems to get started?: Homebrew has the best community you will every encounter. The dev-team and many players are really active. The best place to get some help is the homebrew discord:  https://discord.gg/0lxdMnkIRKg7WiDiYou want the game, but find it too expensive?As there are commonly building competitions, many game keys are given away to the community. Maybe you can find someone willing to give you their key.			"

As soon as you hop into the game you are greeted with a tutorial that may seem confusing at first but if you actually read it its very simple and tells you the basics, if not the complexity of the game within one tutorial. It may take some time to figure out how the vehical mechanics work but after about 10 mins of playing arround with the vehical creation after completing the tutorial i can officialy call my self an advanced builder! I think.....Im actually loving this game right now and i can see huge potential in the future, and regarding that this is an early access, it contains a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of creativity and objects with endless possibilities to creation.

If youre interested in Minecraft or Roblox or just any other sandbox game this is the one for you. Its simple to learn but gets a bit techy at times. Worth the buy if you're creative or just a lover of science/engineering/design. 11/10			"

								This Game has MASSIVE potential if the devs know what they're doing.I would hold off at this point though, as making vehicles is slow, and based on trial and error. That, and the only things you can make end up looking like dune buggies, even blimps.The UI needs serious work, and remapping controlls is an absolute nightmare.But besides that, this game is unique and fun. It is aiming for a realitively untouched genre and so far handles it quite well. The tools are simple enough for a beginner, but complex enough for people who want to fine tune things down to the fiftieth decimal and create extreme, realistic things.I just hope that this does not end up like starbound, which ceased development right after being put up and was left in alpha for a shamefully long time, with only a few fun things to do. If these developers could NOT do that, it would be great.Unless you cannot resist the idea of making your own space rocket submarine blimp that looks like dune buggy, you might just want to hold off on this one.EDIT (Half a year later): The dev team working on this is amazing! They listen to all forms of ideas and recommendations, applying as much as they can at an unbelievable pace. I remeber recommending them to add panels to make the vehicles look more realistic. Sure enough, just look at it now in the screenshots. They added it. This is truly a great early acess game that promises so much, while delivering at the same time. It sets the standard for how an early access game should be managed. If you enjoy racing, simulation games, building and sandbox games, this game will be the magnum opus of your Steam library!			"

Early Access Review
								Probably my first very in-depth review:Updated 11/19/14This game is exactly what Minecraft, Terraria, Starbound, Starmade, Space Engineers, all of those games can't be. Even with their fancy mods and workshop items. This game is a sandbox that goes down to the pipe, to the engine, to the little motor you wouldn't think to place in a plane. It's exactly what it says on the box:Step 1, Make object.Step 2: Fly/drive/boat (soon)/etc object,Step 3: ????Step 4: Profit may vary.As a bonus, there a sort of free roam aspect to the game where you can roam around as an actual living human being instead of just an entity that inhabits the menu system. Along with that, I downloaded this getting something I didn't even expect to get: Multiplayer. I don't know how it works yet since I haven't forced this game onto a friend, but that'll change.As of this review, there've been many updates over these past seven days alone. A good sign that this is constantly being worked on.On the downside,however, this game is still taking some getting used to even now, and the controller settings really aren't optimal yet. And it's not really just the controller, but the keyboard controls sometimes either don't work, or are just weird. There's a TON of Engrish in just about every bit of dialogue (while it doesn't hinder gameplay, it does hinder game quality), and do I even lift? (An engine? Into a freaking plane without glitching the wing into the other one and forcing a tail fin onto the ground without breaking it off?).Finally, the price tag as of this moment is probably not worth it if you're into waiting for Steam Sales only to buy all of your games. Maybe at a later date when issues are fixed and a lot of things are added, sure, but until then, maybe $9.99 USD.Despite all of the bad, I still recommend it if you want more detail out of your building time.

								One thing before I start is that I want to say that this game is in development by a very small team, a very dedicated and easy to talk to, but very small. That being said, those of you not familiar with the early access process should probably have taken the time to read a little bit about it before buying this game.  I have purchased many early access games on steam and while I wouldn't mind it if games had to be a bit better before being released to the public, I still enjoyed the process of just about every game I became a part of.  Some early access games I have been apart of took years to get to a playable state.  Maybe I'm just too patient.Now on to the review!As others have said, this is a sandbox building game where you can connect various pieces to make various things to drive and fly around a fairly large game area.  The build system, while a bit tricky at first, is surprisingly flexible and for those of you who know gmod/source welds, it is refreshing in how rigid the various components are and how easy it is to lift the hood and really customize things from gear ratios to fuel tank sizes.At this point in development, there are few different components ranging from small gasoline engines to vectored thrust jet engines plus all the necessary connectors and logic components needed to make them do what you want with them.  A huge selling point here is that it is not a voxel based assembly system but rather more like legos where some of the legos come in different sizes and you can even bend them to meet the way you want them to.Once you bring your creations into the world they behave more or less how you would expect them to.  The physics need work but they are quite usable and in a lot of cases the developers took the time to really get things right rather than ""cheating"" like some other games do when it comes to the calculations behind the scenes.I personally like making 6 wheeled monster trucks to drive on a tight cliff track or to try to optimize my propeller on my small scout plane so that it rotates just shy of the speed of sound to keep it at optimum efficiency.Having followed the forums a little bit, I can see that there will be some upcoming updates to physics _and_ multiplayer which is quite exciting as I can't wait to race my solar powered cars around a huge oval track or try to find and shoot down other planes that encroach on my building area.  I won't use the word potential here because you really never know, but from what I see as an armchair designer/engineer, I can't wait.In conclusion:  Don't buy this if you don't want to be in an alpha test of a physics sandbox game that changes a lot for the better.  There are other games out there in a high level of development that will satisfy your desires better...but I can say I have never found a game like this that quite captures what it is I love to do-design and test vehicles in a varied and interesting environment.  Sprinkle in some multiplayer and some exciting new parts and you're looking at an excellent addition to the world of sandbox games.			"

Early Access Review
								This one has grabbed me. It's not so much a game as a great kit for building things and trying them out in an expansive world. In fact, it's the closest thing I've found to an actual sandbox game. On the upside, the tools are easy to use and there are enough parts at this point to build a wide range of wacky contraptions. The world is simple, but it's attractive enough to enjoy, and it provides a good sense of space and motion as you invariably crash into it - repeatedly. The physics are solid and flexible enough to give you feedback on your design choices, but on the downside, they aren't realistic feeling. Just like any driving/flying game, it's a compromise. Once you stop trying to make it behave like the real world, it turns into a lot of fun. I'm experiencing some graphical flickering here and there, but I'm sure that will get straightened out. The devs are actively updating and involved in the forum discussions. There is no free build mode. You have to gather orbs to pay for parts, but it's easy enough to get a full kit of parts pretty quickly. There is apparently a way to get around the orb gathering, but I'm not smart enough to figure out the hints on the forums and I got tired of standing around in the pyramid with a dumb look on my face. :) Anyway, if you like to build and test and basically fiddle around with mechanical systems, this game will keep you entertained for many hours.

It can be frustrating in the beginning, but when you´re catched you get addicted to it.It´s very stable for early access game, it´s better looking than most building vehicles games.It lacks on the physics, sometimes driving feelsreally weird, but maybe there is some way to tweak that.Some games I seen of the samekind have some more realism on the building part, with bendig and cracking structures of the vehicle, that not happen on this one.

I absoloutely love the customization this game offers. I would recommend this game to anyone. I even like the fact that you can go through trees, because if you would collide with trees... this game would be a little bit more frustrating. I can't wait to see what's coming next! I may have bot played this game for long, but I can definately say, I will play this game a whole ton more.

								You can pretty much build anything. That crazy Hotwheels car with 4 engines you saw as a kid? Yup. An offroad crawling jeep? Yup. A high speed vehicle that breaks the sound barrier? Yup. A monster 6x6 truck? Sure. Flying toaster? Yup.Learning some of it's features and the tuner menu may take some getting used to, (It's not as complicated as it looks unless you have a million working parts.) but it's rewarding spending time on something and seeing it brought to life.There are occasional crashes while skinning (Adjusting metal plates to form a body) but it is a work in progress.There are a few odd things Iv'e noticed in the physics though, like the amont of engines you install and wire up don't affect speed or acceleration, but simply having bigger wheels does.Also traction and friction could use adjusting. Even at maximum traction in the tuner, the tiniest slope, even a 1 degree downhill spot of terrain causes your vehicle to slowly slide as if the terrain is made of black ice.Small issues aside it's great. Once it gets weapons, it will be the best and most powerful vehicle builder there is.  "

								The game may be early access and have a few things missing here and there, however for what it does have the promise is unreal. Almost anything you can think of can be done if you are welling to put the time in to build it. I will admit the tutorials help a little, but not too much, in fact I had to learn most of the main mechanics through trail and error which is quite a lot of fun. Overall is I reccommend it to anyone who loved Banjo Kazzoie Nuts and Bolts or is just interested in a vehicle sandbox game. Those of you who do decide to buy it, keep in mind that sure the price might seem a little out there for an early access game, but remember it supports these developers so they can make this game from this moldable greatness into something truely great.

								Overall, this game has alot of potential. Though at its current state, its not very detailed, in the way the mechanics work. If this is changed, then this could become a very fun tool to create new ideas in. Though at the moment, it feels more like a lego game. The Tutorial System Is very odd, and brief. Though if you can notice the little ""?"" Icon, there is more detail within it.Unfortunatly, when you finally finish creating something, it doesn't react the way you wanted it to, at all. Not because you failed at realizing the physics engine, but because it just isn't indepth as it needs to be.Physics, are, well to say the least, quite bad. For instance, If you were to make a basic plane, put four wings on it, and One Prop, and go full RPM, you will just go up in the air, and spin chaoticly in circles. Also there is no individual part physics involved. What I mean by this, is it doesn't seem like the prop (for instance) has its own weight, causing it to have no centrifugal force. Meaning there is no torque/pressure rotation in the given direction the prop is spinning from. - Aswell, as there is no way to view (while building your vehicle) where the weight lies within the vehicle parts and/or the completed vehicle. Which partially leads me to believe, that the weight is only cut into a hand full of segments on your final vehicle, instead of each part having its own weight. Now this may not seem big now, but it will make a significant difference of  a realisitic inventive experiences, down the road.- Due to the lack of realistic physics in this game, It makes your inventions feel... well, not so inventive. More like you've put some lego together(for an hr or two) and then started running around your room going... VROOOOOM!!! (not saying those weren't epic times, Just saying theres a time and place, and this isn't it.)The Keyboard layout, is boarder line. There are some odd keys like, P & M, that adjust your given throttle. Where R & F, would be significantly more suitable. (In opinion)HowEVER, if they can fix these things in updates, then it will become very rewarding. Though at the moment, when you are finaly done your craft/vehicle, the reward is very underwhelming.The way this Game sits, it should be roughly $9.99 CAD. Not $19,99. Future Updates, like Gear boxes, and/or Gear Systems, and 360 Degree hinges, Would add much more diversity. And of course, a better physics engine. :)			"

								It's hard to find a building game that isnt just sticking blocks together and is really good. this game is alot of fun and easy to get into, all you need is some imagination. The comunity for HB is very friendly and everyone is very kind. the devs are really helpfull and interactive with everyone. The game its self is easy to learn and play, if there's anything that your unsure about its to find out by looking at a tutorial or asking on discord. another great feacher about this game is that you can easiely get in contact with other people who play the game by using discord with is accessable by pressing Esc and the discord link is on your right.over all i probably mist some stuff out but... nm... the game is worth every peny it cost and a bit more. hope to see you playing along side us if your not already :D			"

								Ever had an idea for a great vehicle?  Ever wanted to spend hours designing it - tweaking every joint until it was perfect?  Ever wanted to feel the satisfaction of the physics engine realizing your genius and completely submitting to this amazing design?  If so, move along.  This game is a dreamshatterer - in a way.  I have so many ideas for vehicles and I can build them in a few hours, but that is just the beginnng.  After it is built, you still have real world physics to deal with.  Take KSP, throw in tons more customizations, and of course remove the whole space thing (for now?), and you have this game.  ;)My only complaint is a minor one.  The world is really small.  I finally built a jet that could get up to 4500km/h, but I hit the end of the world before it reaches its full potential.  When this happens, you just pop back up at the garage.  It is a minor complaint, because I am sure the world will be vast and much more populated (with challenges - like inside the arena area).  And yes, it has sonic booms.			"

								I've played some fantastic games in my time, but the Dev's for Homebrew pull out all the stops. On the 16th of this month, a letter was found, and was followed by two other clues, and a huge hint from the dev's. Everything is easily accessible, you just have to do a little metaphorical digging on the forums. The reward for the searching, well, it's really something special. It's worth putting some time into finding the secret of the pyramid...A big thanks has to go to ""Neothehitman"" for the hints that he created and placed around the Homebrew community. He didn't just come out with the solution, instead he made something of a mystery from it, giving me and others a good time investigating and trying to work it all out. Look out for more from him in this game.Of course, the Dev's need some love too, they've created an already fantastic game, filled with easter eggs and mystery. As well as the obvious great gameplay, which lets you build pratically anything. I don't think I've been unable to make something I have imagined.It's true that the game is tricky to get to know and learn at first, however it more than makes up for this with the amount of content and freedom it gives you. Even at this extremely early point in development, I haven't faced any game crashes, or even that many bugs. Which for an early access at this stage, is extremely good going.All in all, this game is a must buy. Why are you still reading? Buy it NOW!!! "

Some things I would like to suggest...Maybe instead of cubes, why not have the pipes be joined together using node like spheres? Everything can join together at one point and be nice and smooth. When it comes to adding engines or other things, same node feature, except you can add stuff anywhere on the pole. Of course anything added would remain horizontally flat unless adjusted otherwise for the neat freaks.We have the boats. We have the Planes. And we have the cars. What about trains? Maybe later? "

								Very enjoyable game. Those who say it's extremely confusing, didn't play the tutorials. Which you should almost always do considering some games give bonus currency or something for playing them through (wink wink, nudge nudge, devs ;)). With that said, there are some things that could/should be added/fixed. The devs have heard enough about the UI, I think they know it needs some patching. So glossing over that. There's almost no control over the helicopters (and I know they're adding joystick support, but not everyone has one). Vehicle part deletion; it's a serious pain the way it's set up. Wrapping this up, the game is still amazing. With one of the most in-depth vehicle creation systems out there combined with a good physics system, multiplayer/single player offers hours pleasure.

								A very fun vehicle building game with multiplayer mechanics and a powerful method of building which can be used to create anything you can think of. There are weapons and enemies to use them against but I don't want to spoil too much. You can obviously fight other players in your vehicles which is good fun, and since the devs have an armour plating system planned, thats gonna get really interesting.There is a varied map with roads, a swamp, large bodies of water, mountains and sand - so you can test your vehicle offline or with friends on a variety of surfaces/environments. The map hides lots of secrets, I haven't found them all and the community is still trying to figure out a few of the more enigmatic ones.People seem to be complaining that it is difficult to use, I have to say I wouldn't agree. I have nearly 42 hours on record at the time of writing this plus more before it was on steam. At hour 42+ I'm obviously a much better builder than I was at hour 0, but even at the start the system seemed intuitive and anything I didn't understand was cleared up by tutorials or help from the amazing community and dev support on the website.It's in alpha yes, and I am apprehensive about buying games in alpha sometimes but not with this one. There are bugs present as with all alphas, but there are no major gamebreakers. There has been regular updates and the devs are literally in constant communication with the players, and I know if I had a pressing issue with the game or needed help with mechanics of the game I'd be able to get it faster than pretty much any of the other games in my library, plus the community are always happy to help on the chat on the homebrew website or the group chat on steam.Overall a really good sandbox vehicle builder with massive potential that is going in the right direction. I'd reccomend it, just take half an hour to learn the building system at the start using tutorials (like you have to do with all other sandbox building games like KSP etc) and you'll have a blast. "

								Homebrew Vehicle Sandbox has been around for awhile now but never ceases to amaze me. The developers are a crew of friends constantly active on all forums to make the game as Fantastic as possible, in the year of the game existing they have constantly strived to make this game perfect as a team of four could. *Gameplay:Homebrew is a smooth playing game that doesn't demand much from the pc itself, and is extermly fun due to a few gadgets and randomly spawned vehicles. Be aware Homebrew can get confusing when building due to the tuning areas updated design and falling through the fall is normal(just use teleporter gadget)*Community:Homebrew uses steam but the real community is in Discord, the discord community consists of the awesome devs, pros with nearly/over 1000 hours that are willing to help every step of the way and normal people how just chat, suggest and many other things. You as a player will always be welcomed by the community.*Bugs and Bug fixes:The CopyBugPaste team is always and i mean ALWAYS fixing as many bugs as possible in the shortest amount of time, from gamebreaking all the way through to shadows dancing on their own.*Don't get mad:It is easy to get mad when stuff like planes not taking off, cars sliding out of control, etc. Just take a breath, watch a tutorial or ask the community. There's always a solution and don't rate the game badly or complain on the internet becuase you can't figure it out, don't ruin this game becuase you weren't calm.(may update review soon)			"

USE ALL THE PARTS!!!!!!!!(5 hours later)us-use...all....the parts? *mentally breaking down*(2 days later)OooOoo. New workshop upload.(Thus the building cycle restarts.)All and all, it's a fun and interesting game. But this is a title that will not appeal to everyone. With the current version of the game, the building is fairly in depth and some of the parts are tricky to use. Yet, more parts are coming to the list. Which means wilder creations. The limit is your own creativity and what you can figure out. Tho there are people in the community willing to give a helping hand/tips if you need it. Visuals look good but there are still a few bugs the devs are working on getting fixed. For me that doesn't affect me, or my creations. A solid game about building vehicles and having fun with them.			"

								Very cool game... I think the vehicle editor is straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. What you had going on in v13 was a hell of a lot more managable. I love the components list so far. Keep expanding water capabilies... Remote options, hubs that are universal, dampeners, FLUID POWER options! I think I would love to see these included! Overall a kick♥♥♥♥♥game though. Thanks!			"

								This game has a steep learning curve (the wikis great), but once you learn how to use the builder properly the things that can be built are mind blowing, a pong game for instance. If you don't like games without a real purpose though, then this isn't for you. It has an active developer staff who actually listen (I know right!) and the community is extremely kind and helpful both in the ingame chat and on the games discord server.			"

								Best Enginering game ever build anything. your mind is the limit.Pros- build any vehicle you can think of right now im working on a helicopter and a mech suitCons- with the v14 and up they made it more realistic (looking) and complex normaly a good thing but with it being more complex its harder to create things 13 is easier.lucky they still support v13 as of this moment idk how much longer well worth the money if you love building.this is still in progress so guns and better mechanics are on the way. maybe i wont have a small hatrage for the v14			"

								This is not my kind of game after all, but if you like to craft things like cars, planes and submarines, you will enjoy this game. The realistic physics system and the limited amounts of parts are constraints in this game, and you are driven towards making realistic constructions.There is nothing else to do except crafting, at the moment of this review. I highly suggest you look at 20mins+ gameplay videos and the DLC community content to know if this is for you.There is however a small but active community around this title, and caring developers who actually are live on forums.This is why I rate it postively, despite it not being for me.

								This game overwhelms you with complexity, but then severely limits your ability to actually play around. My biggest complaint is that the physics are terrible, so what's the fun of building something if it doesn't have any behavior other than brick?Bummed I spent cash money on this, time to go back to KSP for my vehicle sandbox fix.

								This is something that will keep your mid set for hours, days, weeks... Even though this is still in early access. I'd like to see a mirroring tool introduced soon though. When building something you want to be exactly as on the other side of the vehicle, you'll have to do a ridiculous amount of work. A tool to mirror a panel or a pipe would be welcome. BUT, as said this is still in early access, I think the devs will get on it at some point. 10/10 would buy again.			"

								Game is great so far, but it is early access. Building aint that hard as long as you aren't one of those types that just want to rush everything.....if the default tutorial aint specific they do have pics of what to do...plus a more detailed tutorial if you still have problems. Also a big help, in the menu for each part there is a blue question mark that gives details on what each setting for that part does and is for etc. I mastered the building within the first 5 minutes once i got to start, but thats just me.....i ain't a mechanic or engineer etc, so i originally know nothing of what everything means so i occasionally have to check the parts question mark description until its burnt into my brain. Yes the interface needs a bit of work, and its hard to control any ariel vehicles making it hard to acquire any orbs within the air (orbs are currency for parts....there are 3 colours,   and one is harder to get then the other.....and some parts recquire a certain amounts of each orb. This makes you work to create your mean machines but once you get everything its rewarding enough making your sick ride....but a creation obviously never works as intended on the first get go....like real life there will be adjustments over and over. Yes there are physics so if you spawn your vehicle on a hill....it will go down duh!!!! Textures need work as well as shadows. there are a lot of parts to buy with orbs to create your own vehicle. the only part you dont have to buy is frames/pipes to build your vehicles shape. Give it moment of your time, and if you feel like its not enough then wait for some updates. I believe it is worth it, and if you still think that the tutorial isn't specific enough to you, then please just go to there sight, log into forum and ask questions like a human being instead of right away complaining, and or wasting a reveiw like i see some people. Thank you			"

								CZECH/ENGLISH REVIEWCZERecenze na simulační hru Homebrew1.) Hra s velkým potenciálem oslovit milovníky sandboxových her a kreativních nadšenců, avšak už při prvním spustění hry pocítíte, jaké to je když vývojář zapomene na uživatelsky přívětivé prostředí.Nyní bych rád rozebral všechny neduhy této hry.-GrafkaJe v celku nenáročná na to jak je zajímavě zpracována. U tohoto typu her je grafika skoro poslední co bych chtěl řešit, avšak vývojáři dostávají bod navíc za dobrý grafický kabátek.Malinký detail který bych vytknul je moře, které je průměrné což by nevadilo jako tak výrazné okraje břehu a naprosto 0 absence vln, ale to sem nepatří.-FyzikaTo je asi něco o čem vývojáři slyšeli maximálně na základní škole, protože jezdit s lodí po souší 40km/h není vtipné, asi tak jako když jsem jezdil autem na dně moře. Dále bych rád podotknul, že při bouračkách, jak je zvykem se s vozidlem něco děje, tady to neplatí. Občas se nějakému vývojáři podaří ze spackané fyziky ve hře udělat zábavnou věc, ale tady budete asi víc brečet než se smát. A jen dodatek, pokud jedu na své lodi 180 Km/h očekával bych vlny, tady vás moře vesele ignoruje.-ZvukyPříjemně zpracovaný soundtrack a hudba, okolní zvuky zní líbezně, tedy dokud si neuvědomíte, že spousta zvuků ve hře neexistuje. Pro příklad při jízdě na souši kromě motoru toho moc slyšet není, tak jako při bouračce. Kromě absence spousty zvuků jinak nemám co vytknout.-ŘízeníTaková samostatná kapitola této hry. Pokud nemáte ovladač a hrajete PC MASTER RACE, tak vás zklamu. Při zatočení tlačítkem D doprava ihned točíte na plno doprava a to samé doleva, čili naprostá ignorace přirozeného a reálného řízení. To se opravdu nepovedlo.Shrnutí:Hra, která ve vás objeví veškerou kreativitu a pohladí vaše oči na první pohled příjemným prostředím, vám naprosto zničí iluze dobré hry, absencí realističnosti a spoustou chyb, avšak od doby kdy jsem psal první recenzi se hra změnila MNOHEM k lepšímu a už to není ta hra u které bych litoval že jsem si jí kupoval nicméně tohle chce ještě spoustu péče.Hodnotím 5/10Při prvním hodnocení jsem udělil 1/10ENGReview of the simulation game Homebrew1.) Game with great potential to reach fans of sandbox games and creative enthusiasts, but at the first start of the game you will feel what it's like when a developer forgets the user-friendly environment.Now I would like to talk about all the ills of the game.-GraphicIt is quite undemanding at it as interestingly handled. In this type of game graphics is almost the last thing I wanted to talk, but developers get an extra point for good graphic jacket.(The tiny detail that I rebuked is the sea, which is an average that would not be so strange as is so significant edge of the shore and absence of waves, but that's something what doesnt belong to the graphic section)-PhysicsThis is probably something that developers hear last time in elementary school, because when you ride a boat on dry land 40 km/h is unfunny as much as when i was driving the car at the bottom of the sea. I would also like to say that when someone crashes, as is usuall with the vehicle to something happening here does not. Occasionally, some developers manage lack of physics in the game as fun thing that people like, but in this case there will probably be more crying than laughing. And only supplement if I'm going on my ship 180 km/h would expect waves, the sea here will cheerfully ignore you.-SoundsNicely processed soundtrack and music, ambient sounds sounds sweetly until you realize that a lot of the sounds in the game missing. For example, when you driving on land except for the engine there is not too much to hear, like in a car accident. In addition to the absence of many sounds I have nothing to say more.-SteeringSuch a separate chapter of the game. If you do not have controller and you do PC Master Race im gonna disappoint you. Button D for steering to the right immediately spins as much as possible to the right and left is the same, or sheer ignorance of natural/realsitic steering. This is really wrong.Summary:A game that makes your whole creativity appear and caress your eyes at first glance, a pleasant environment, in a 10 minutes will completely destroy the illusion of a good game because of the lack of realism and plenty of mistakes, but since I wrote the first review of the game has changed a LOT better, and it's not the game that I regretted that I bought. however, it needs to have a lot of care.Im giving 6/10Last review i gave 1/10---------------------------------------------------------------Stále hru nedoporučuji, avšak chválím vývojáře za masivní skok dál a věřím že jednou budu moct hru doporučit./I still not recommend the game, however, I praise the developer for a massive jump from the very first alpha stage and i hope that someday I will recommend the game....And sorry for my bad English :< I did not pay attention in school xD			"

								Since the new engine update, Best way I can sum it up - The old version was for the kind of people who you would find in machining shop. Craftsmen and women skilled in any number of fields, pouring blood sweat and tears into their creations and contrapions. Breathing life into heaps of discarded metal and garbage. Walls lined with white boards with countless diagrams and measurements.The new version, well, seems to have misplaced the soul it once had. It no longer has that very mechanical feeling. From building, designing or driving.If you never played or seen the old version, you very well love its new form. But they havent even updated the guides on steam for it, so trying to learn the new system is going to be much more difficult. And the new ""instuctions"" are video links to youtube.			"

So when you write a negative review, please atleast help out the developers by writing what they need to change and how to make it better and let them do their thing from there on. They really deserve the support, wether it's positive reviews or good critisism.			"

Believe it or not All feed back was used to make the game better , They are now more and more involved with the community and working faster than ever to update the game with as much quality features as they can . This is how a developer should work and overcome the critisism , They won my vote of confidence .The game is now much more stable and Very fun to play following the latest big updates.OLD --------------------------------------------------------------------------Developers dont even seem active on forum or its chat . Dont get me wrong the game is fine , but it has now been too long and its not out of pre alpha even .The promised vehicle physics update is no where to be found and it feels like we are driving cardboard on a oily smooth surface , literally .no real weight integration or dynamic physics like modern engines have . no separate tyre traction , just one friction value for everything.  feels unpolished , performance is suffering on a card like gtx 670 super clocked and i7 with 6gb ram yet there is nothing in the world			"

HomeBew Vehicle SandboxIs Homebrew a good game?While it may seem hard to grasp at first, Homebrew is actually one of the best vehicle sandbox games on the market right now. A lot of people tell people who are just getting into Homebrew to start off with V13. Given that V14 has been implemented with a lot of new (and complex) features.I'll admit I was worried I would have a tough time trying to make sense of the whole system. The tutorial made up for a lot of my concern by being direct and clear. Once you get the hang of it Hombrew becomes a really open and entertaining game to indulge yourself in. If Space Engineers had a car related counter part I bet Homebrew would be it.I would absolutely recommend this game for those who like cars and something a bit out of the ordinary. If there was one word of warning I would give to someone it would be this: Be patient with V14. As V14 can be quite complicated and will take time to master.This game is 10/10. Would recommend.			"

								Lacking of a mirror build mode simply killed this game. I can't imagine a Build-Yourself game without all kinds of tools or hotkeys to make everything EASIER. This game makes me feel like being tortured instead of enjoying myself! As if everyday working is just not hard enough, so I have to find something that kills my braincells even faster ! By simply counting HOW MANY TIMES I CLICKED THE WHITE DOTS!! The idea clicking and pulling DOTS is the very worst idea I've ever seen in a Steam game. I just hate it so much that I have to speak, and give it a NOT RECOMMENDED mark at the same time. Maybe someday they really want to make this game easier to play ,and I shall change my mind.			"

								There should be a Pre, Pre, Pre-Alpha tab for these kinds of games. Asking £14 is pushing it. Playing it would take you about as much time as it took to download the thing. The game is featureless, awkward controls, bad physics, awful sound effects and servicable graphics. If you think games suchs as DayZ or H1Z1 were laughably boring don't buy this game. Get a finished indie game for half of this game's asking price.			"

First time playing and I have already fallen through the ground, and I can't figure out how to bind the controls of vehicles with my joystick (if you can at all).

While the game technically lets you do almost anything, in practice the building system is very complicated and confusing, and there are no in-game tutorials whatsoever.On top of that, the physics are glitchy and buggy, which results in your vehicle bouncing around uncontrollably more often than not.This game is not worth anything near the asking price at this time. The fact that it came out in 2014 and is still in this sorry state is baffling to me. The devs are still working on it at least so hopefully it will be a good game some day, but right now I really can't recommend it.			"

								This game is okay, and sure you can build vehicles, but it has some big problems.  First of all, the physics makes vehicles very difficult to control.  If you stop a vehicle on a hill, it just slides down.  I haven't built my own planes, so I'm not an expert, but for their example plane, it flies nothing like a plane, it has to use a gyroscope, so the whole plane spins, but it doesn't even change direction very easily.  Second of all, the building process, although now a little simpler, is still overly complicated, and sometimes parts which you place don't even appear in the menu to connect to other parts, so you have to find the part, disconnect it, and add another.  This game has neat, fine, and classy building tools if you can get past all the flaws.  If the idea of the game appeals to you, I might suggest Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts if you own an Xbox 360, or Scrap Mechanic looks good, and similar, with less fine tools, but better physics and such.

								Homebrew is exactly as the title states, a vehicle sandbox game.  You create your own vehicles from scratch, frame, gas tank and all, and then take them into the medium size sandbox world surrounding the garage area you created the vehicle in.  You can design and craft anything from go-karts, golf carts, 4-wheelers, cars, dragsters, tanks, motorbikes, planes, helicopters, hovercrafts and more.There is a really extensive crafting system in this game, although I feel the tutorial and instruction set is lacking and the overall crafting system feels a bit cluttered, very unrefined, and generally clunky and lazily put-together.  There is multiplayer, which is a nice touch, but really doesn't fix any of the problems with the game itself.The vehicle controls are clunky and weird, making many of the vehicles hard to control, and the fact that the physics system in the game is very odd certainly doesn't do this problem any favors.  Also, not that a game like this should be about graphics, but the developers have obviously tried to bring something at least mildly modern-looking to the table, but last I saw, they have failed terribly.  The games graphics look like the industry standard as of 2006, and for a game that tries to have decent graphics, I consider this a failure.All-in-all, I do not recommend this game in its current state.  The graphics are outdated and poorly designed.  The physics is quirky, which compounds the issue that the controls are touchy, buggy and generally difficult to use, and the crafting system is really unrefined and includes part names like pipe_001, pipe_002, curvepipe_001 and so on.  The whole game seems like it's just way too early in development for any kind of early access release.  I have hope that the developers can improve upon the games issues, but until then, I will advise people to not make this purchase.			"

								First impressions are important and boy are they bad. Start the game and it asks for the key that you have copied to the clipboard. No problem except you cannot paste it in. So restart having written the key down. The key boxes do not skip to the next when each is flled neither do they switch case for you. Not serious, yet. Then its time to start the game but it pushed hard for you to create an online account. Do that and start again, having noticed the offline option.  You are then dropped next to a building within which is a broken beach buggy. The screen keeps going very dark and there is no clue about what to do. By no clue I mean nothing, nada. Then follows blundering around, pressing random keys, getting stuck in a corner of the building and having to crash out of the game which by this time has gone dark, yet again.I need to slow down with buying games and try the demos first. The game key messing around would be enough for me to walk away. Maybe its getting old but I have zero tolerence for any fluffing about. Everything has to be slick, obvious and work the first and every time. Any crap and in the bin it goes.The developers need to revamp the game start experience. Its rubbish. Then maybe have tutorials, and a video. Maybe they are there  but I have not found them and am not going to waste time finding them. So this game is going to get another 15mins of effort and no more. It might be fabulous but I simply do not care if it is this imvolved to even get started.			"

But the possibilities are huge, as I have seen on the Workshop.But there is a big problem : it's a game where physics matter, and in this game, physics suck.If you want to build vehicules, this game is good, but if you want to try them, good luck.

								The older version was great! I loved this game until they added the tutorial, which took me over a f*cking hour to complete.The glider is impossible to control, but fortunately, a nice guy helped me out. I like the community and the style of the game but all in all, its just something I can't quite recommend.			"

								I purchased this game based on the many positive reviews it has garnered so far. Unfortunately, it has fallen well short of my expectations. The vehicles feel like weightless toys rather than solid constructs, they are difficult to control, flip over at the drop of a hat, and feel like they are sliding over the terrain rather than interacting with it. The graphics are rudimentary, the explanations in the tutorial were less than clear, I have not been able to find out how to put some panelling on my vehicles so that they look like anything more than a frame with parts bolted on, and the map is so bleak and basic that I have no interest in going out to explore it in one of my shoddy homebrew vehicles. Disappointing!!!			"

								so this game is really complicated. You don't get any previews of the pipes, just names. For the most part, you are using your keyboard to navigate everything (unless walking). Some of the parts only work in one direction (wheel hubs) so you can't slam it to the ground unless you build something over it for that look. Also the camera control is really hard to get used to. You do get pre-built frames but still, very complicated. Lol and you have to read everything, no voice acting.			"

								I had a few issues with this game when I first started, this is why I gave it the thumbs down (for now)!You can eventually work your way through the tute (not easy as they don't explain things very well), but after that it says to go out side and take the vehicle for a ride. Problem is, you have to actually go up to a console inside the garage, (no idea why the vehicles are not inside the garage) and tell it you want to go outside, once outside, there is no vehicle, you have to press i to get a list of vehicles, then press i again to stop displaying the list of available vehicles, then point up in the air and press left mouse button to throw the vehicle in the air (again, no idea why you would do this), and then chase the vehicle as it will most likely start rolling away, no hand brake. Once you finally get a vehicle (remember to press x to start the motor), it is very hard to control it, there does not appear to be a button to press for brake, also it says to press page up and page down to zoom in and out, nothing happens. Not being able to zoom out a little makes it hard to see where your going. Editing vehicles is a little daunting at first, being unsure which parts fit with what, the tute vehicle requires a motor (when putting this in, it would be handy if the default angle of the motor would be suitable to put it in with out having to rotate it first), which I gave it, but when I went out side, it did not have a motor or even a left front wheel. Going to quick edit, it had a motor so you can not give it another, it also had all of the wheels, then switching to tune it had no motor or wheel (wtf). They could make this game a little more user friendly. Maybe add to the tute a highlighting function that lets you know where to place the parts that it is telling you to install!Controlling the ground vehicles is very hard, because the camera is doining its own thing, so not controllable by the user. Most of the time is will go behind the vehicle, so long as you are going in a straight line, so it is not too bad. What is bad, is that the angle of the camera is not high enough off the ground behind the vehicle, so you will have trouble seeing where you are going when going over hills. It would be much better to provide an option for the user to have some controll over the camera.Controlling the vehicle is also rather hard, especially at speed, it has major oversteer problems at speed, as well as the camera problem already mentioned, of not seeing where your going when going over hills.There does not seem to be much to do while driving, collecting objects and going over ramps. I have not progressed to air travel at this time, so don't know what there is to do up in the sky.At present they need to make it more user friendly, they are actively working on it and answering comments left here so I remain hopeful that this will end up being a really good game!!!

								nooo. simply a no.[Edit]After receiving feedback by the developer, i'd like to take time to express construcrive review rather than just saying ""no"" to this game.For a person coming from a completely different genre, i'd really liked the idea of homebrew. Sure - for gamers who are into bulding/sandbox games it must be quite easy to build and enjoy something cool. For me unfortunately, dreaming was the only thing to do as i had no guidance at all to get into this game.The goodGraphics are well (as well as it usually is in such a state of the developement i guess).Very cool ideaMaybe much more if I were able to build a vehicleSarcastic developer who demands constructive reviewsThe badNo real ""help"" featureNo preview or ready build vehicles to change or rebuild			"

(don't think there are, its quite vital for a game like this)Would like in future:- be able to paint (using color, decals, pattern and custom patterns)- floating object in air or something similar to be easier to rotate, move, adjust space and so on.buggy with some gameplay issus:wheels sometimes don't respond (don't move you forward when it should, so very buggy movement on ground for now)			"

								Gameplay -Homebrew is a very intuitive game which allows as much creativity as your mind can bestow. It has a complex paneling system which allows you to create a car eaxactly like you dreamed it to be. This game is very open world, so finding a place for your newly though of vehicle is very easy.Glitches -It has no game breaking glitches for an early access game and it has no inconvienient glitches as well.Leaning Curve -This game is quite advanced so learning the game takes perseverance, however, the devs are amazing at responding to your questions as well as other players (I got a response to my question in half a day). If you can pass that the only way to go is up. The game becomes more fun the more you play, so dont uninstall the game and forget about the times you had learning the broad variety of things in the game.Multiplayer -The multiplayer function of this game is very thought out and allows you to create servers for you and your friends to play on or join a public server and interact with the community.Overview -If you like the achievment of finishing a project, the feeling of progress, or riding in your respected build, then this is the game for you. It has many features which allow for a game which will make you daydream of what to build next. The feeling you get playing the game is very satisfying and relaxed. You can either race with your friends or fine tune your vehicles for the best preformance. I personaly love it and think it is worth well over its current cost. I would give it 9001 thumbs up if I had that many.			"

								I've been searching for years for a similar vehicle sandbox game like banjo kazooie: nuts and bolts on the xbox 360. I played that game for hundreds of hours, I just really like building and testing vehicles. I've had this game for around a week and I've put over 30 hours into it, because the building style is similar and more detailed, although there isn't much to accomplish with your vehicle after you've built it, besides some not so great race tracks where you try to beat your score. It's not pretty, it's got plenty of bugs and some grammatical errors, but building is addictive, and it has the potential to become amazing as long as they continue to listen to the players (which they seem to be doing). As long as they keep adding parts I'll keep playing.			"

								This game is good, but still, it has plenty of room to develop. Of course, building a vehicle is hard if you just started to play the game, but in 5-6 hours you can get a good grip. Thus, with that said, controls are a bit quirky. Sure, it is still at dev stage, and I am really amused by it, but you will have a little hard time getting around things because they are a little bit irregular. There is no objectives as far as I can see, so this game is a good companion for those who love open-world games like minecraft and terraria.If this stage was the last stage of the game, I'd rate it as 6/10. Altrough it is still alpha, so in this case, I really believe that this game has the potential to be 10/10.I just wish that we can create our own systems for auto control, and develop some stuff. This goes to developers : Think of a on-board computer that you can adjust your outputs accordingly to your imputs. What will it do? For example, You want your thruster to be activated only if you are above 20kmh. Maybe gradually increasing thrust to avoid the vehicle to flip. Which language? Lua would be ok, since it has been used on ComputerCraft in Tekkit, Minecraft, and it is indeed easy to learn. Maybe python or ruby would be good as well.The thing that I requested is pretty complicated indeed, but if it could be done, this game would be skyrocketing trough other simulation types. Think about you can program like a plane autopilot or something. Wow.10/10 for a game that is in alpha. Good job devs.			"

								Picked this up in a Humble Bundle.  Game looked really interested and has potential to be really good.  Vehicle controls need some work though, as do the vehicle physics.  I drove a basic card over a small hill, did not even hit anything and it just went nuts and flipped over.  The building controls also need a bit of work.  I like the core concept of the game though and hope they make these much needed tunings.			"

								EDIT: Im taking back everthing I said.First off, awesome game and awesome support from the developers.As previously stated, ""the game is in alpha, so there may be bugs.""When I first played the game I had an issue where none of parts were showing up in the parts menu. If you're having this problem, a developer told me to type ""tesla over edison"" in chat. That solved my problem. The game is kinda laggy, but thats NOT the games fault. My computer is kind of a POS. However, after setting the graphics and such to low, the game runs a lot better. I previously said, ""the multiplayer dosen't work;"" FALSE. The multiplayer DOES work, we just didn't mess with it enough. Sorry to the developers on that false claim. <3After I play alittle more, I'll add on my new findings. Im just glad I was able to get passed the tutorial.			"

								I don't even know where to start...I know I haven't played the game for very long, but I can't play the game because the tutorial is horrendous, and the layout scheme is absoluetly terrible. If you can manage to get passed the creepy **** in the beginning and work on dansvan you might get somewhere. Yes this is a early access game and I think the idea is amazing, but when the tutorial fails to show you what to do or how to do something it's pretty damn hard to recommend it. eh..5/10 for now.11-18-14( I have played it a little more, yes it's a beta there will be bugs but it is fun to see your creation come to life. There are some fixes you must fix though, the screen where you're building, you can't leave them game through there..and overall the spawning of items isn't so neat. I recommend it though, once you get passed the tutorial and understand it things become easier.			"

								Spent 3 hours figuring out how to build a working car, it's ♥♥♥♥in hard. I think there are way more user friendly ways to build a complex and customizable vehicle. The concept is nice, but it's really finicky to even build the base for a car and how to connect all the parts with each other that they work or what parts you even need for a working car is nowhere explained nor (how an editor should be) self explanatory at all, so you gotta really love exploring this stuff and google all the time.NOW I KNOW that this is still an early alpha, ̶b̶̶u̶̶t̶̶ ̶̶t̶̶h̶̶i̶̶s̶̶ ̶̶i̶̶s̶̶ ̶̶n̶̶o̶̶t̶̶ ̶̶w̶̶h̶̶a̶̶t̶̶ ̶̶i̶̶ ̶̶w̶̶o̶̶u̶̶l̶̶d̶̶ ̶̶c̶̶a̶̶l̶̶l̶̶ ̶""̶p̶̶l̶̶a̶̶y̶̶a̶̶b̶̶l̶̶e̶"". Instead of trying to invent a own vehicle editor, they should better inspire it by the editors that Kerbal Space Program or Scrap Mechanic uses.

								I think it is a bloody brilliant game! However I know it is a pre alpha but there are a few little things that let it down a bit. 1) There are bugs (A very few), but I'm sure that they will be resolved. 2)There are not enough parts, but, once again I'm sure they will add more soon. 3) If you gain enough speed and suddenly stop it will do random spins and flips, to solve this, In my opinion if ou are using an air brake it should snap off and parachutes should snap (there should be an option to toggle this). Overall I highly recomend this game as it really tests your skills and knowledge of vehicles. If you want a good chalange and a game that will last you for ages, THIS is the game for you!			"

But just walking doesn't cause any lag at all. I go from playing from 60 FPS to having my frames drop to 20 FPS when just moving my camera. Turn them off completely though gets rid of this though.Online works, but you can only connect directly through the IP as the servers list doesn't work yet. But when it does work, i'll be getting into this game more.Overall it's a fun game, but i'd wait to get it.			"

The concept of the game is amazing if your into garrys mod and building things.  The reason i cant recommend:  The development apperas to have stopped.  This game has been waiting for an update for months now.  Looking as what that update offered is what made me stop playing because i was so excited for the changes. I understand that the game is Early Access, but it seems the money we put into it isnt going anywhere anytime soon. If i see the same headway as before from the developers and the UPDATE i will definitely change my review.  This game has great potential.   Edit.

								The builder is fun, sometimes jittery when it comes to moving nodes on certain parts like panels when the camera is facing the same direction as the movement. The text when moving a node (to show what the measurements are compared to the adjacent nodes) is hard to read when looking at the sand, because it is grey, a similar color to the sand. it would be interesting if the text could change color depending on the time of day to make it easier to see during the day as well as at night.I have built a few vehicles, some simple and some not too. I have not gotten to building anything that you might call complicated, though.I am very entertained by the most recent version, now that I know what it is for real. previously, in the singleplayer version, I did not encounter a tutorial, so I did not know what to do. I built a chassis and downloaded some workshop items, did not know how to operate many of them. I drove some cars, but I couldn't control them, and they went out of control a lot. I had not explored any of the other islands because of these reasons, nor knew of their existence. That is all in the past now, and I like the game more than ever.Overall I would reccomend this game now. I should probably leave out the 'overall', but the game does need some improvements to the physics and a few other things. The upcoming update will fix most of these problems, though, so there isn't much to complain about.			"

								Great game very interesting concept and very fun but the controls are a little weird and there is somewhat limitied replayability because it doesnt have multiplayer yet. Overall, very good game maybe a little over priced for how much is on it now.			"

								Its a pretty fun game!    I spent 5 hours playing it on my first day and you learn how to build easily.  If you watch the youtube tutorials it makes everything easier.  That said I spent 4 of the 5 hours trying to build a airplane but i couldnt get it to work good.  Ill try to make a truck next.  I have never played a game like this though, you get to build the frame of the vehicle and you just add on from there.  What makes things easier is that things like motors and other things that need to be next to each other in real life, can be far away and still work in the game.  I recommend getting this game!			"

								The builder is fun, sometimes jittery when it comes to moving nodes on certain parts like panels when the camera is facing the same direction as the movement. The text when moving a node (to show what the measurements are compared to the adjacent nodes) is hard to read when looking at the sand, because it is grey, a similar color to the sand. it would be interesting if the text could change color depending on the time of day to make it easier to see during the day as well as at night.I have built a few vehicles, some simple and some not too. I have not gotten to building anything that you might call complicated, though.I am very entertained by the most recent version, now that I know what it is for real. previously, in the singleplayer version, I did not encounter a tutorial, so I did not know what to do.

								I will just say I got this game a while back when it just hit Steam, and it was fun.  Had many parts to use to make about anything you could think of, but still had a few bugs which I put it on a shelf to await a few patches to try again.  Well its NOTHING liket he game it was, and to be honest has gone BACKWARDS!  I have very few parts to work with, and no way to do Multiplayer, or anything.  I would even go as far to say this is about as much as a demo version may have to give a taste of the game.  I will not recommend, nor tell you not to get this game until I figure out what is going on.  I will only say if this is what the game is now, then its the first time I seen a game go BACKWARDS in production of a game.  (But as for the game I have played yes its GREAT, just hope it gets there again soon!)* After going to the website and downloading the older version I am use to, I am changing my review.  I really hope they combine the items in the old version into the newer set up which is better at building in my view.  Going to keep my eye on this game and hope to see it reach a ledgenary status when out of Alpha / Beta.			"

								i bought this game exactly two months after it as first released into early access, and even though i have a short play time into the game over the year that it has been around, i am very proud to have bought this game, i do recomend it to anyone who loves to build their creations and then drive/fly it around. if ou are looking for a perfect game, look somewhere else. the devs know whats up, they listen and respond in a timely manner. i love playing this when i have the time (which isnt very often as i work a lot and i play other games...) but when i do i usually spend hours upon hours playing without realizing.

								This game has a good Idea, but it's in way to early of a development stage to be playable. There are more complete sandbox games out here on Steam, such as Beseige or Autocraft (or vehicle games such as BeamNG).As far as the game goes, The main thing that stood out to me was the textures. This game puts me right in the early 2000's when I look at the environment. It's a step up from Minecraft (in the graphics department), but not too much.The vehicle physics leave something to be desired as well. You couldn't be able to perform any of the acrobatic stunts that this games' video depicts, due to the poor handeling of the machines. The dirt and grass are actualy like glass or ice when racing on it.I like the Idea, but this game has a long way to go before I would consider buying it again (got a refund). If the graphics and vehicle mechanics don't matter alot to you, I would say go for it. Otherwise, there's BeamNG and Autocraft...			"

								Its certainly a very interesting game which I enjoy a lot. It might be pretty complicated in the beginning with a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it its a lot of fun. I personally would wish for an alternator module with an axis input for power generation and regenerative braking for hybrid cars.			"

								(STILL) Early access review (19. Nov 2016)I belive there was a fair deal of work in 2015, but it didn't peak my interest last year.This year, however there has been some changes.Phyzikov reached out to me and asked for some honest feedback on their current system to identify areas where they need to stabilize the system.First off the improvements I noticed:* An interactive tutorial to get you started with the game and understanding how to drive, sail and fly, as well as using your gadgets.* A lot of new islands that you can travel between, making the game feel less isolated.* Physics seems more stabilised.* Embedded video tutorial for building vehicles* A more lightweight interface for assembling vehicles, reducing the difficulty.* Scattered vehicles though the games are clearly marked with the glowing object and it provides a reason for the player to explore the islands.*MultiplayerIssues that needs improving:* Building isn't intuitive before the video is seen, an interactive tutorial would be good.* High speed can result in skipped collisions or rotations that goes on forever.* Surfaces that are not straight can result in wheel boots not being correctly applied.* If you swim in the deep ocean, you might risk being randomly teleport inside the center of an island under the waterlevel - in other words inside a mountain. (teleport gadgets resolves the issue)* No consequences of your actions - this can be considered good and fun, but it lacks immersion.So how would I rate this so far?The good part is that the developers are still working on the game and they seem to be doing some things actively, however sadly they have been working on this for 2 years now and is also being surpassed by other games who perhaps allow a certain amout of ""arcadic physics"".As a developer myself, I know it is really hard to model physics properly, so the challenge they are up against is a big one.My two cents would be to simplifly the physics with the aim to stabilize for playability and then add some gaming elements, so players can try completing challenges and build vehicles that are good at performing those challenges.I think it would be great to see with the multiplayer - not only because you can create content, but because you then can compete with that content - this could also be of interest for streamers.With that said, the current development seems to have focused on some different milestones than I had hoped for, and even though there are islands around me, which I think is nice, I would have prefered fewer islands and more ingame activities than building and exploring.Even though I might convince a friend to play pretend races with me and do some streaming with him, I doubt I could do it with the price tag of 17.99€, because the game itself simply lack activities or game mecanishms that challenges you to improve your vehicles.Make the most eco friendly vehicle and complete the lap.Make a solar powered plane, that is efficient enough to complete the lap without crashing.Complete a set of checkpoints (that requires a certain movability) and be the first to complete the lap.Do stunt jumps with various goals.And for the vehicle you can find when you explore the islands, it would be wonderfull if they got saved to your build projects, as a collection, making exploration even more meaningfull.I do hope the developers will look at the activites after working on stability, as it is my current main concern with the game. The improved physics over the past 2 years can clearly be felt and it is much more fun roaming around on the islands and flying planes now.I clear this review for a tiny positive recommendation, as i belive the developers are willing to put more value into the game for the customers and because a lot of the gamebreaking issues has been resolved. If you like making the most crazy vehicles and roam around in them, then go for it, and why not try the multiplayer with a friend while you are at it?While i'm a little skeptical about the pricetag, consider that buying the game from steam with its retail price, as it supports the development much better than going for a cheap key somewhere else.I leave my old review below for the sake of continuity, and because Igniuss's reply is related to that review.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(4 of 13 found the old review helpfull)EARLY ACCESS REVIEW ( 19 Dec. 2014)tldr: Wait for a better version before investing.I agree with this guy: http://steamcommunity.com/app/325420/discussions/0/626329820885200239/There have been some updates, which i haven't experienced from play, but just based on writing they seem to be really good.It also seem to be quite the alpha version, with a fair deal of ability to change the game design, but also a fair deal of doubt in how it will turn out to be.My experience however is that most games tend to be feature complete while in EA. It doesn't seem to be the case here, so there might be changes to all the downsides i consider for this game.1. Physics:While this game tries to cover water, land and air at the same time, i don't expect a overhelming great physics in each part, as in a simulator. However there are some parts to the physic that i consider too flawish for a game like this. Mainly how breaking and a reverse vector applied to the resulting vector seems lacking.Also using a handbrake on a slope, should not give you more speed....When it comes to flying, it is quite clear that you need to consider how you balance the weight is important. That is a plus, but unfortunately some of the engines seems to be a bit extreme and will put you in a loop regardless of your controls.2. Game loop is too simple.  (build -> test)*While The game is indeed all about building and testing, it just seems like the testing aspect could use some sub-loops to create some kind of challenge or a feeling of achivement.While removing the orbs, from what i read and would determine myself, was a really good idea. Perhaps there could be some challenges which could unlock some non essential, or bonus like content.This is one of the things i hope will be improved in the future.These issues are the ones feel is most worth mentioning, as they make the game feel incomplete or borken.The constructing part is really good and interesting, so if those issues aren't important to you, then it is worth giving it a go, especially if you can get the game at discount.There are a chance that these will be improved, but it depends on how far the development is at the current stage. Hence I suggest people to wait a bit and see if these parts get any changes to the better.			"

								I love the freedom of building in this game. I love the every improving physics in how the vehicles handle and fly. I don't love the UI. It has a fairly steep learning curve, and is probably the biggest barrier to enjoying this game. I wish the current UI was the advanced builder and that the developer would include a Kerbalesque builder that's a little more plug and play. That being said, I have high hopes for this game moving forward.			"

								Great game overall! The graphics, physics, community, and dev team. For newer players, it is fairly hard to understand much about the game, but tutorials have been added to builder to help them out. Its one of those games where everyone is friendly and extremely, helpful. I really think this game deserves more attention than it has, especially with things that are to come.			"
