												This game is no way or shape ready to be considered a final release. I purchased the early access so that I could be part of the development process, which I was expecting to last 12-18 months. Here we are a month or two later and its considered ""retail"" ready. No, this is yet another embarrassment to the Early Access/Kickstarter way of doing things.If you are looking for a ""simulator"" do not buy this. Anybody that considers this as a simulator doesn't know the meaning of the word as it has no simulator aspects to it.  I am very disappointed in the game, the developers and Steam for continuing to allow developers to release early access games that they have no intention of finishing and just want to make a quick buck. If the game remained in Early Access I wouldnt have an issue, but this is not a finished product.Early Access and kickstarter products like this are legalised theft, that is all I have to say. "

												At this point, the game isn't really worth buying (I, unfortunately, can't get a refund.  But, maybe I can help you save a few hard earned dollars).I have a decently beefy machine.  Not a monster computer, but a 6 core 4.2ghz machine with an AMD R9 200 series video card and 8gb of RAM.  It doesn't struggle with any games I play - except this one.  The frame rate is just horrid (sub 10fps).  And changing the video settings doesn't seem to do anything for me.Additionally, the gameplay is, well... lame.  I absolutely love sim games (days of play time on ETS2), but this is a huge disappointment.  Other ships in the harbor will run right into you, even if you run your horn.  The controls are poorly implemented, in that you can't easily reset them to ""0"" by adjusting them left or right, as you do to increase the throttle.I haven't played a ton so far, because it is frankly frustrating to play.  I was suckered in by the decent reviews that were likely posted with this being an ""early access"" game in mind.  Now that it is a real release, I can only call B.S. on this one.Devs - feel free to credit my account for my $20.  I know you won't, but that'd be the right thing to do.			"

												The release of this game is clearly premature. It will require at least an additional 500 man-hours to reach the status of what I would label a “final release”. In every other industry, a company would lose a tremendous amount of money and market value if they would decide to put such a product on the market. Unfortunately the whole game industry seems to take the same path of laziness, which is why I cannot personally blame the developers of European Ship Simulator. Another thing, I understand the word “Simulator” as a software that tries to emulate reality as accurately as possible within technical feasibility. And by this definition that game does not even come close to a simulator. Maybe I will come back to that entry next year in the hope to see the positive changes, but as for now, I definitely not encourage other people to buy this game. "

												First, European Ship Simulator was not created by the same development team that brought you Eurotruck Simulator. Arguably, there was an effort by the Euroboat team to make it appear that way. Unfortunately, with European Ship Simulator, what you get is a shallow experience at best without any campaign mode, meaningful objectives, or even a sense of immersion to say the least.  I've completed 4 of the missions so far, successfully I might add, and it wasn't challenging at all. You have a short selection of ""Missions"" along side a mission editor. I started off with a tug boat mission. The tug boat itself was sufficiently detailed and breaking into open sea from the harbor was satisfying, the choppiness kicked up and there seemed to be correct current physics to deal with. That, unfortunately, was about all there was to be impressed by.   Dropping the tug was a simple press-this-button, which displays a bunch of balloons around your boat. All I had to do was select one of my ballons, and click on the balloon from the ship I would be towing. This easy process connects the two balloons together with a rope, instantly. At this point I'm ready to tow. The massive tanker's front end would dip inappropriately into the sea while towing, which was weird. The physics aren't perfect but I can get passed it. There is no complicated mooring procedure either once you get to your destination. You simply float to the next arrow and you're done. Congratulations. *yawn*  Later, I tried the speedboat. A speedboat mission! My objective was to drive my speedboat to a yacht and pick up a rich lady in distress. On my way, I clipped through just about every bit of ocean, I was practically a submarine. Additionally, the reaction of the boat to the choppy water felt so unauthentic that it made me feel like the developers included this irritation just to force me to press the A and D keys a whole bunch of times and not fall asleep.  To spice things up, I tried the cruise liner. I figured, this should be a challenge. Wrong again, and that brings me to my conclusion. European Ship Simulator is a disaster at the price it is asking. I've played more complex and immersive sims on the iPad. I don't know how some people came the the conclusions they did by recommending this game, it really does make me wonder. The game offers you nothing in return for your effort. It is over-simplified, unrealistic and broken. Wait for the massive content update it needs and in the meantime there are better boating simulators out there.			"

												I actually liked this Game and the progress it was making in Development [of course it had it's problems in many aspects]. However, this isn't a Negative Review for how the Game is, but European Ship Simulator was a Project that came to a complete halt and all Development stopped. Once the Project was dispanded, the Developers stated that a new Sim ""World Ship Simulator"" is in the making and everyone who bought European Ship Simulator gets it for free, which they did live up to, and we do own the new one. However... This Game stayed on the Market and everyone who bought it up until the 24th of November would still recieve World Ship Simulator for free.It is now the 26th of Novemeber, 2 days after the Deal ran out, and I am absolutely disgusted that the Developers are now continueing to sell a Game that wasn't finished, and is no longer under Developement...An absolute disgrace to the Gaming world... This Game needs to be taken OFF the Market completely.			"

												It is called a simulator, but it is not. This is a genuin arcade game. You just can steer the boat and dock. You can not set a course, you can not navigate (the most important activity onboard IRL!) you just have to leave the port, go to the point on the map (that isn't a seamap!!!!) and done!A proper simulator would let you set a course on a real seamap, calculate the time of arrival, calculate the need of fuel, fill your fuel tanks, check the engines, maintain the engines, make repairs if the boat is damaged, communicate with a radio to the port and other vessals... I can keep going on but you know what i mean.I've noticed that a lot of games call themselves ""simulator"" but only a few are...			"

Early Access Review
								I'm not really sure why this is getting such rave reviews.The graphics are OK, but not ""breathtaking."" Also, there is very little actual game here, even for an early access title. You have very constrained mission areas to play around in, no roaming the high seas. The largest area is a trip across the English Channel at night.Also, the physics are somewhat suspect, as your boat cannot so much as touch anything else without sinking, no matter how gentle the inpact.Another black mark is that the UI and menus are very unpolished, and very little exists in the way of tutorials. Even yourincoming radio messages are simply texts, with no voice acting. You truly feel alone in the world they are presenting.Even though the game doesn't feel in the least bit like a finished game at this point, it is leaving early access.			"

												I tried to help this poor game with a good review before, but I can't anymore. I'm sick of the lack of many tools and actual SENSE in this ""simulator"". How come there are no tugs to assist large vessels? And why do I have to stop when the other vessel is at fault and purposefully came into my way and make me sink? This is too robotic and unrealistic.Save your money and don't try it, folks, especially if you're a merchant mariner...forget it. Stick to the simulators that they will provide you in your academy. European Ship Simulator is bad and I no longer recommend it.			"

And the Dev team has given up, it's only been out for just under a year..   The publisher found a new Dev team for the game, they now have World Ship Simulator in the Store. They've given it to all users of this game for free.   But I didn't buy an archaic looking arcade game, I bought a nice looking ship simulator.     My refund is on it's way.

												What an utter pile of rubbish..No I really do not like this game. I am pretty sure my graphics are on high / ultra, and it looks like it was made back in the 12th Century. It is possibly the slowest, most tedious game i have ever played to date. The missions are not too bad i guess, but they take ages to complete, and the control over the ships is awful. They are really slow, which wouldn't be so bad f the scenery was nice, but even that is a pixelated blob of colour. I will be honest, i don't have a moniter, i use a TV screen, that is like 7 years old, so that may explain a bit of the bad graphic quality, but nonetheless, it is not a game that grabs me. Better off getting Euro Truck Simulator, though by now i imagine most people that will see this have already got Euro Truck Simulator 2. Oh well, American Truck Simulator cam out the other day, get that instead. P.S. I have not played American Truck Simulator long enough yet to comment fairly on it, so maybe wait until i give the all clear :) Or just...you know, read someone elses review of it :)			"

								Looks great especially water lots of seagulls also handles life like internal camera looked really nice, there is not alot to do but i knew that before i purchased, this game has great potential if it stays on current path.I will follow this game and see how it pans out if your into the whole shipping aspect this game is for you so grab a copy and help the developer build the ocean version of ETS2.Only suggestion more detailed graphics selection, also the only resolution is native resolution so for me i had no choice but to play on 5760x1080 but the game ran perfect at this resolution, but i do think there should be option for this in game.Reel Big Kris does have a working suggstion in my comments also check out community hub for sticky postLooking foward to future updates and will adjust this when needed			"

								Hmm, mixed thoughts about this:Firstly some instructions might be nice!Gave up on tug scenario as too hard without instructions as to how to control engines.Moved onto ferry scenario = fared better but unable to dock in time after a couple of attempts.So tried the Calais to Dover freight ship opton instead:Enjoyed this more as no time limit and had time to explore steering options.One of the world's busiest shipping lanes was scarily devoid of other traffic!Slightly lost my bearings half way across Channel - better maps needed?Then just sank for no obvious reason which really annoyed me! Was doing a reasonable 14 knots in lumpy sea with no prior damage to ship!Pretty slow framerate when another ship passed me in Dover = given I have decent computer and graphics card.Looks promising - so long as additional ports and ships are added to initial release for free and not some exhorbintanly priced DLC!Also note that there is no option to save game in present release - have to play till you 'timeout' or sink (for no reason) in my case!

								Well the Early Access is here for European Ship Simulator, I must admit I have been waiting for this one.So far I've not experienced any issues launching the game or with game performance although I am aware others have reported, please keep in mind you are buying into a game that is in development and you may find issues along the wayYou can check out my first experience with this title here (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=344921077)  as i attempt to pilot the Ferry from Dover to Calais...how hard can it be right!?This game has a very solid set of game mechanics from the helm controls to the handling of the ships, all have a feeling of authenticity that I hope will be built upon with the continued development. Good points:Graphics and modeling are good The audio for both ship effects and ambient sound is good.Game mechanics (controls/ship handling/other craft) is goodWeather effects are impressive.An enjoyable & rewarding experience  Need to work on (would like to see added):A Tutorial to introduce the player to the controls etcMore ships and tasks to complete (I realize this is Early access so this will be in development)The game mechanic to transport deliveries (goods or people) from port to portMaybe a management aspect to build a shipping company upAI crew on the bridge (its a little bit lonely as the captain)The time skip button didn't seem to work for me More options in the graphics settings etc The game looks like it has a great deal of potential and I look forward to seeing the development and evolution of this game. This is an Early access so the options are a little limited but so far it has a very solid base to build from. This could be a cracking little game!TaffTaff In Exile			"

								Below you'll find a video and written impression of the game


YouTube™ Video: European Ship Simulator: Early Impressions 

			Views: 1,278		

			European Ship Simulator: Early Impressions European Ship Simulator video created on version: 633 European Ship Simulator is an up coming simulation game of boats, ships, and all sorts of things that...		

European Ship Simulator is exactly as the name states, it is a simulation of what it's like to take control of a variety of European style ships. It's in early access so there is still a ways to go for this game but it does show some promise.Graphically the game looks mostly top-notch. The interior of the ship's cabin are well detailed with high resolution textures and great quality models. You'll find all the small intricacies that you would in a real ship, switches, knobs, GPS, etc, which helps with immersion. The water and weather effects are also some great stuff as well. Though the ship's interior, and the ships them selves show some good quality, the game isn't 100% consistent at the moment. Some of the environmental models, such as buildings, the docks, and streets, are very low polygon and features low resolution textures. I'm hoping that these lacking elements in the visuals are just place holders until a later / final build. Audio wise I got no complaints as the sound effects are realistic with great background noises from the boat's motor and the sounds of the ocean itself keeping you company. As far as gameplay goes, It's surprisingly easy to learn and to get adjusted to, as the main controls is ""WASD"". Some ships will feature the option of more intricate controls with the num pad, allowing you to manipulate each of the ship's engines individually. Even at it's early stage, the game does a good job at simulating what it's like to drive a ship...for better or worst. I say this because, though the game achieves good results as a simulation, due to what it's simulating it may make it an incompatible for some gamers. Unlike Euro Truck Simulator, where you have the micromanagement of traffic, following traffic laws, avoiding cars, etc, European Ship Simulator is mostly ""set sails to full"" then auto-pilot straight. There will be lulls where you are simply doing nothing but watching the waves as you wait for your ship to arrive in a straight line to your destination. For enthusiast of simulation games or sailing, this won't be an issue, as that demographic probably already understand this before jumping in, but for the average gamer who is just curious to this game, know that this is a simulation before it's a game.Currently at the time of this impression (version 633), there isn't much in the way of options, graphics, or audio, and there is only 4 missions available with no linking campaign or side features. This is early access I do understand, but at the same time I think it's fair to let people know that in it's current state, it is the bare minimum.Overall, European Ship Simulator shows a lot of promise, that I think will shape up to be some thing quite interesting. But currently, it does feel rather unfinished. If you are a simulation game or ship/boat enthusiast, it might be worth your cash to check it out, even in it's early stages, but for every one else, keep an eye on it, but wait for later versions or even it's final release.Pros:- Mostly realistic and high quality visuals- Feels realistic- Varied amount of ships are enjoyable to cruise around in- Shows promise of a bright futureCons:- Visual quality not 100% consistent- Feels very incomplete currently (ver: 633)- Subject matter might not be as universally appearling as Euro Truck Simulator			"

												This is a most enjoyable game, but there is some room for improvement. The graphics, especially of bridge interiors, are excellent. While I'm not an expert on ship physics, they seem pretty good. The learning curve for this game is not too steep, by and large, and after a couple of early failures, I have played about 75% of the missions and passed them all. However, the game does have one or two little bugs, and there are some areas where it could improve:1) The text goes weird when you try to change the settings. It's OK initially, but when you go back a screen after making your desired change, it all gets screwed up somehow.2) Ships seem rather too fragile. You can sink by hitting a pier at low speed! The level of damage needs to be more realistically adjusted.3) The AI boats behave strangely at times. In the cruise liner mission for example, a boat that appeared to be going past me suddenly turned in a sharp circle right in front of me! They are also unrealistically indestructible - bump into one, and you'll sink, but it won't!4) In the ""berth the ferry in a severe storm"" mission, the weather is actually perfectly calm!5) As others have mentioned, there is no career or campaign mode. This would boost the game enormously, as currently there's not a lot left to do after you've played the missions (although you can supposedly make up your own, or edit existing ones, with the Mission Editor).I also think the game could possibly benefit from time being sped up a little à la Euro Truck Simulator, or maybe players could be given the choice between ""real"" time and ""fast"" time. Some missions kind of drag a bit, even when you're going at your boat's maximum speed. But these bugs and irritants notwithstanding, the game is generally good fun, which is why I recommend it overall. Also, it is a fairly new product that the developers are giving a lot of time to right now. Already since I bought it, there has been an update. So hopefully this promising game will soon be even better in the future.			"

								Positive: The graphic is great. The ships are beautiful and the water looks amazing. The landscape is also ok. Furthermore the ships are moving quite realistic! *You feel a bit like a captain*Negative: At the moment the whole game is a bit bugged and about three minutes after starting the game it crashes.All in all I recommend it because the animations are great and I hope that the bugs (especially the crash after three minutes) will be fixed soon.Edit: Since the last update it isn't crashing anymore and now all graphics work very well! But it is still a bit laggy although i changed the graphic settings on ""low"" (but that is maybe my computer...).I also made now some playing experiences: Positive: The animation of the ship, the water and the ports are great. You might think it is real. Furthermore the sounds are also very good.Negative: In my eyes it is a bit too easy to sail the ship. All moves, like acceleration, breaking, turning and so on, are performed very fast by the ship (quite likeley that those movements are performed too fast for a big ship like the ferry). Furthermore the ferry mission is very easy; I don't even have to stand close to the port to finish the mission. It is enough to get close to the port with the back of the ship.All in all, I keep recommending the game because the animations are awesome and I think/hope that there will be coming way more content in the future.

								As a current student at a Maritime Academy, I am really enjoying this game. It runs GREAT on my laptop and I hope the further development on this game strives. I hope this game will have a lot of new content in the future because I will be using it in my future to practice maneuvering. The game is very smooth and realistic other than the tug mission where you can slam a bulk carrier around with no consequences. Once again this is the best ship simulator that I have played since ship simulator extremes which is outdated and won’t run on my laptop. To the developers, keep up the good work and PLEASE add a container ship and maybe the ability to walk around the whole vessel not just the bridge. :)			"

								I like the game. I have high hopes for it. I like the handling of the different vessels. The tug is fun to run. At first I did 360's and crashed into the dock. I have completed the 3 missions and felt like I was on a real boat. Almost could have got sea sick looking out the window of the tug. I know the sim is in the early stages but a list of things I'd like to see:Map/mission editor, create my own waterway after a real port. Very important to me.Multiplayer.Create/edit  your own vessel.Options to toggle on/off all audio or extras.Put some real waves in there, look at bf4 they have some 25 foot waves which are a blast to run through.On the minimap show other boats to scale.Put in buoys, lights.At this price and since it's not going to do anything but get better, I'd say get this game.

								This looks promising! You can see there's been a lot of thought and detail put in so far. You can control your ship via keyboard or just using the mouse to handle the levers and switches yourself. Being able to walk around the bridge is awesome too. You get a nice sense of scale when captaining a large ferry that I really enjoy. You're currently limited to 3 missions, which is understandable given it's Early Access, each with a different boat and in different conditions. Involving both Dover and Calais. I take this route a lot and can say attention has been made towards the skylines of both these towns and ports, which again is a nice touch. You can even sink the ship and stand on the bridge as you witness the area filling with water, if that's something you're into.			"

Now that early access is here with three missions to play I must say the wait was worth it. From the graphics to the physics of the ships to the ambient sounds makes this title very enjoyable so far.As will all early access games there will be some glitches that appear in the game and the devs encourage reporting these as they happen to help remove them from the final product.I preview the Tug Boat mission on a Lets Play and really enjoyed the mission. There could be some minor tweaks on the ropes that connect to the ships that you are tasked to tug and  I am sure that the devs will continue to strive to perfect this game.Overall this game has so much potential and I encourage anyone who enjoys simulator games to give this a try- you wont be disappointed in my opinion. I salute the Devs and Excalibur on a very successful start so far!Akiic ToDaHeadCasual Games "

								Well, first things first, I just LOVE simulators like this. And the more life like they can be, the best they are. Non violent games where you can just relax for a few hours are rare. One or more things I would improve  or change are.Damage is WAY to easy to get. I have been on fishing boats and ferries. They do not  sink by just touching the dock.Weather should vary. And should be selectable.Free movement camera. How come we cannot get out of the cabin?Splash on the ship from waves and ship wake. Those are some of the most impressive effects that I look for in a ship sim. And when turnimg the prop flow should follow the rudder directio. after a small delay of course.Towing cable......please fix those..... they are awful right now.But at least frame rate is not choppy as in the other ship simulator, and it is at least playable. It has the potential to be great... PLEASE do not let it go as a mediocre game ...PLEASE.			"

												I enjoy this game alot. It is just one of the best ship simulators in the gaming industry, even though it's within hours of it's first release, I can tell that this is going to go well. I think if you love Ship Simulators, you should get this. Pros:*Very realistic water physics*Detailed Ships*Very detailed Bridges*Tugboat Physicis*Realistic Weather*Wipers on Bridge window that WORKS*Mission Editor*20 MissionsCons:*Tugboat line gets messed up when you tow a shipEDIT: Removed one Con. :)			"

								The graphics and water effects are well done for a game still under development.  I would like to see tutorials added to help new players get acclimated to the game, as well as the ability to free-roam outside of the cabin.  Since the game will be $30.00 at launch, grabbing the game for $15 bucks now (the sale price as of 11/21/14) is a pretty good deal.

								I agree that European Ship Simulator (ESS) has amazing potential. The graphics are excellent, and it is a challenge to operate your ship right. Being a game in development, there are still some things to work on. Based on my limited experience with the game I do have some thoughts. See my comments in the suggestion forum.My concern is that this game becomes just a mission oriented simulator. Driving the same ship, over the same course, at the same time of day, with the same weather, with the same AI ships in the same positions, with the same sea state… you get the picture. It will quickly get put away and not played.If it becomes a true simulator, with a purpose for my ship to leave the harbor, and ability to sail to multiple ports in a variety of conditions, then this sim will be fantastic.I always thought: build it and they will come. Look what happened to MS Flight Simulator and Kerbal Space Program when they opened it up for developers to mod! Wow!! Both are sensational products. ESS has the same potential. Let’s see where it goes….  It all depend on the budget and capabilities and desire of the producers.For now I like what I see. Grandpa1955.			"

								Been playing this game for a while now, mostly on my way to work. Works great on my laptop despite it not being intended for gaming. Having played most if not all ship simulators presently on the market, this is among my favourites. While it may have its problems at times due to it being n Early Access, the team behind it are dedicated to creating a brilliant simulator and clearly have the skills required to do it.Something that really immersed me was the way you can see the bow of the ship lifting as you pass over waves. The immersiveness of the bridge is something I've been waiting for, as previous simulation games of this type did not create a realistic feeling to me.The texture work, especially when in free walk mode, is something you should take the time to look at. It may be a little boring to sit and stare at a wall, but if you do, you'll see the amount of detail this game has already.All in all from what I've seen of this game so far, it's primed to be an excellent title that many simulation fans will enjoy.

								Ok so here we have anouther Ship's Simulator.. But this time it seems the directors and staff are listning to the users and not blundering through to bogdown and same as the other sim that come out before..Yes if the Simulator is going to be maybe the best ever produced then they are off to a good start.   We Simulator buffs all know what we want so this time around you have the chance to say your bit.. Don't just bull on about unreal mods or patches. Think of the real world and persue the near real requirments, for this will surly become the Market leader for Shipping Simulators I think it's well on the way now!!Thank you for this great sim.Please give us a free world for sailing :-) Happy new Year!!

								Alhough this is a Early Acsess title, it is very good right out of the gate. There aren't many missions and the options menu is sparse (to be polite) but the actual gameplay is fun and feels right. The interior views of the vessels are very well done and the water effects are some of the best I've seen recently. The game has it's problems such as horrendus FPS and a fair bit of stuttering and lag but for an imcomplete game, you get the feeling that the developers are moving in the right direction.

								I'm sad to say I don't think this was a well spent $20. I'm aware of the current state of the game and that it is a work in progress but I was so disappointed in the physics I had to write a review. Even the original Ship Simulator game made 8 years ago blows this one out of the water (not to mention the newer versions). The response of the vessels is unrealistic and when I saw the lines (rope) I was amazed at how strange it looked and jumped around.. Other than that, the graphics are good and I think there is potential here but the developer has got to get serious about this being a ""simulator"" and not just a game. Ship Sim set the standard and this just doesn't measure up...for now. I work on tugboats currently and I really want a good affordable simulator that does the maritime industry justice.			"

												An excellent ship simulator (if that is what you are into).  However, the game could have been so much more, but a dispute during development spoiled all that.  I had no trouble installing or playing the game.  I have decent frame rates on the highest settings and have not had a crash as of yet.Pros:  The graphics are very good and easily on par with FSX and are more like Silent Service 5.  The bridges are very nicely done indeed and remind me of some of the addon planes cockpits that I have for FSX.  Highly detailed, large in some cases and very nicely executed.  The exterior orbit camera mode is very nice too and the ships look very good.  I am not a sailor, but the player ships do seem to move very well and are not overly responsive.  There are even seaguls flying around the ports.Cons:  No freeroam mode with missions only.  There are not a lot of missions either, but there is step by step guide on the Steam Forum to teach you how to create your own missions.  I could not find any downloadable missions, addons or mods on the internet.  You are locked into the bridge and cannot wander about the ships (fair enough - you are stuck in the cockpit in FSX as well).  There is no career mode or campaign.  The water within the ports should be far calmer than the outside sea.  That is the whole point of the water break haven walls!  The water break on the bows of the ships is static and stays in place even when the bow is lifting up out of the sea on the crest of a wave.  It does not move with the level of the sea.  There are no other crew members or people to be seen, nor is there any radio traffic, so it is a bit lonely and quiet.  There is no full world out there (hence no free roam), just some routes built in to enable travel to and from specific ports only.  The other AI ships have a ridiculously amazing ability to turn on the spot at speed.  Not very realistic to watch a large container carrier turning on a sixpence like a jet-ski.  There are far too many controls, buttons and screens in the bridge which do not work and are not interactive.  Lastly, the Time Jump button is only active for a short time.  If you do not use it in time, you will have to do the entire voyage in real time!Conclusion:  This game by graphics is streets ahead of it's intended successor 'World Ship Simulator' which looks very childish and rudimentary by comparison to this game.  The fact is, this game could have been so much more.  The day will come when someone finally makes a ship simulator along the lines of FSX and X-Plane.  This game could have a full world out there, with more controls working in the bridge.  It could have been done in such a way that other developers get involved with building addon ports, ships with fully working bridges, interactive port communications as per FSX, etc and giving some of the take to this games developers.  Just as we have with FSX.  A missed opportunity there.  I have Ship Simulator 2008 which is let down by it's old graphics and I also have the early access 'World Ship Simulator'.  So far, European Ship Simulator knocks the socks of those in terms of beauty and bridge detail.  For it's current price of £5 ($7.50) on sale at time of writing, it is well worth a look.			"

												PROS:+ You can control different types of civilian vessels, from small tugboats to huge cruise liners+ You can walk around your ship in first-person mode+ A wide variety of missions are available+ A mission editor is included so you can design your own routes and objectivesCONS:- Options menu is bare bones (three non-descript settings for graphics and an audio slider that controls both sound and music at the same time)- Graphics are on the low end and except for the odd suicidal AI-controlled ship, the entire world seems lifeless- Music is incredibly annoying- Physics and handling of ships feels a little off- No freeplay or sandbox mode, just scripted missions (unless you use the mission editor)- The mission editor is overly complex and very unintuitive- AI-controlled ships won't adjust their course, so if you happen to be in the way (even if this means you're simply docked), they will ram you- Crashes to the desktop so often it's unlikely you'll ever play through an entire mission without losing all of your progress at least onceVERDICT: As much as I wanted to like ESS, I just couldn't. Even if I could forgive some of this game's faults, the constant crashes and restrictive gameplay are just too much. Unless you find this game as part of a package deal (on Humble Bundle, for instance) or at an extremely low price, I'd have to say ""No, don't buy this game.""			"

												do not buy this if you want a ship simulator, it is not what it says on the tin, passenger ferry expected to make right angle turn 50 yards from a sandy beach ( what captain or pilot of a multi million pound vessel would get that close in reality ) way point passed over to find next point is 200 yards away and at a right angle  with the passage between 3 fishing boats  (Dover ferries make moves like this everyday ) fishing boats that expect  larger vessels to alter course to avoid collision, games that end when the unavoidable collision occurs this game has it all in spades, no radar, limited waypoints (one at a time ) no instruments, no mini map just a small square box with a arrow on top of a ship like  shape, this needs serious development before it even approaches the description that sold it to me, it is really a poor shadow of what it should have been.

								Pretty darn good game so far.  I would say that if you are looking for a fast and furious action type simulation, this game isn't for you.  I you are looking for a realistic simulator designed to test your skills at navigating ships, then this is one to buy.  The graphics are good for an early release game and the physics of the ships seems pretty accurate.  I have owned boats most of my life and I would day that they control pretty much as I would think a ship would with the exception of the tug boat which seems a little overpowered.  The modeling of the water is incredible.  You really get the feeling that you are out on the ocean in the weather and waves.Here is my wish list for this game:The ability to visit different ports to pick up jobs instead of having the game be all mission based.If the game is going to be mission based, include a mission builder to allow third party down loadable missions.It would be nice to have the ability to walk around the entire vessel instead of being confined to the bridge.Improved physics for the tug boat so that moving a large freighter isn't as easy as it seems now.I look forward to the updates to see what the developers have in store for this game!

								I had no real problems. The third scenario (bulk carrier) from Calais to Dover was slightly difficult to find the right position for the scenario to end, but I did it in the end.Gameplay is really good; at the moment it's more about manouvering your ship around port, as you can skip the bits at sea. Would be nice to see some traffic on the channel since as well as being one of the busiest sea lanes in the world, it is meant to be quite challenging to cross with traffic coming from all directions. I'm sure things like this will come in time though.Some tips:The green arrow on the map points at where you need to go, not the direction of the ship (which is the black underneath). You can hit 'P' to get a waypoint marker, but it's usually off-map, and the green arrow is less obtrusive.Learn the keys - they aren't that complicated (basically WASD and keypad) and it makes it much easier to control the ship precisely.When you do the tug mission, click 'T' produces some markers on your boat. You then need to drag a line to the vesselyou are towing to connect a line. Don't make it too short like I did, otherwise you end up pulling the front of the vessel down as you tow it :-) You can also push with the tug boat. "

								Date 23/11/2014Good game so far. nice graphic's feel's like  a more modern ship simulator extremes (graphic's wise)atm you get 3 missons on the dover -calisis route in good sailing conditions. other user's have reported crashes of the game i have had one crash but i guess these will be fixed in the future so i wouldn't worry about that. if enough money is given this game could be potentially very good.what i hope they will incude in the future :1. more routes across europe eg, hull to rotterdam and all across europe2. money system to buy bigger, faster ferry's or updgade ship capacity on cargo ships3. choice of sailing conditions.4. route planning5. auto docking (although this does take the best bit away so this should be optional)6 live weather (this would be cool if they choose to put a route planner)7. ships get unlocked at different xp start small and grow to bigger ships.This list could go on forever so ill keep it at that. you should buy this game since it is only £11.99 and help surpport this awsome game!

												I was a little bit apprehensive about the game, having read mixed reviews here.  Anyway I bit the bullet and am very pleased.  I have a fairly average PC, but it has still allowed me to crank the graphics right up.  Admittedly, there was some chop in early 'missions' immediately after installation, however, a full defrag and restart cured that.I work in the commercial shipping industry, and quite enjoy this game.  As far as ""simulation"" goes, it is a nice simplified ship driving game without too much depth that I use to kill time.  Do not expect procedural realism, but you will get a genuine appreciation for the techniques required to move the included vessels around in their daily work.If you are wondering about your PC specs, I have an AMD A10 processor, 8GB DDR3 and an ATI R9270 and it works perfectly with room for more.  The difference between the LOW and HIGH graphics options in-game isn't huge either so most modern PCs should run it with nice visuals.			"

								The game is amazing, with the ferry, tug, speed boat, fishing boat, and bulk carrier. The ONLY downside is that there isnt a free roam option...... Other than that i highly recomend this game for ship fans.			"

												It's realistic enough and fun. However, it would really make the game more interesting to have some sort of a shipping company game mode like in Euro Truck Simulator. The gameplay and graphics are solid. It just needs something to tie it all together and give you a reason to keep playing.			"

								It can be great game but path of ships and sinking ship need improve. It is very irritating now. In third mission at destination is small ship which enter port on one side then sail through port to oposite side where leave and then return to starting position. I stopped my ship far away from port and waited until small ship leave port and i will have free way to dock. It was mistake because small ship was heading directly to me and was too close when i recognize small ship. Sinking large ship after collision with that small ship is crazy and if i know it's  task for smaller ship to dodge. Because i was on place without any move for few minutes i must presume it was some sort of terrorist attack which is implemented alredy...			"

								Hey,I have installed European Ship Sim on a laptop Asus ROG G750JM with a GTX 860M and a i7 4710HQ CPU at 2.5 GHz and 3.2 when on turbo. I have also updated to the latest Nvidia drivers.  At first I had some troubles with starting a mission in ESS. But after an update was released I could complete a whole mission with no problem at all. All you need to do is update the game/sim in Steam to latest update released and it will/should work like a charm for every captain out there.I really like that games like this one comes out as I am studying to watchkeeping officer for merchant ships in Finland at the moment.

You can sit in your gamechair and enjoy the high quality graphs while your ferry is cutting the waves in a bad wether situation.; very nice indeed.

								This game is in early access right now, but this is one of the few early access titles I can recommend without reservation. While there are only a few missions available in the game at this point, these missions are fun and appear to have all features. Also, the ships are very detailed and look great. Finally, the developer is releasing regular updates containing new missions and is thoughtfully interacting with the community. If you have any interest in ship simulators, I would recommend picking up this title to support a developer who is making a great effort to provide the community with a quality game.			"

								This Simulator has great potential, the Scenarios that are offered so far are sure to satisfy every taste, from a small Speedboat to a big Cruiseship. The level of detail is good, though i would wish for a more detailed bridge with more buttons and levers to use. Overall i think it is well worth the money, since you are supporting a Simulator that could easily become the new industry standard.

								Just completed my first mission - the tugboat.  I'm on a purpose built computer running Windows 7 64 bit, I3 2300 processor, 8 gb RAM, AMD Ratheon HD 6800 graphics card.  No problems running on ""high"" visuals setting.  Visuals, lighting, ambient sounds - all are great!   Looking forward to trying out the other missions and will update my review as needed.  I highly recommend this as an easy to play yet challenging game - great for relaxing with a cup of coffee and focusing on something other than work or school!Recommendations I would have (with my short play time) - I liked that in the outer camera view the engine RPM's were shown.  It would be nice to have an indication if I had both throttles set evenly while in interior view.  It is difficult to ascertain (at least for me) just from their visual position.  Perhaps a small indicater either with a number equal either to how many ""clicks"" I've moved the throttle from zero, or an RPM indication?  Don't want to clutter up the screen though, so maybe another clickable icon along the side?  And I apologize if that's already in there, didn't find it!Other than that, I agree with others who say some sort of career would make the game more in depth and focused.All that being said - thoroughly enjoying this so far, and looking forward to getting some more time onboard!

								Hello There           This is my first review for European Ship Simulator and first of all I would like to congratulate the company and all the people responsible for creating this Simulator.Furthermore I must point out that the overall concept is very interesting and well captured,so lets get some things clear first of all I would like to mention that I am an Apprentice in the Merchant Navy and that I have been on board a Tanker ship and seen real Pilot Boats and Bulk carriers so I guess my giving this simulator a positive review might mean something to the designers,so to tell you the truth I am pleased that we (the people) finally see a Naval Simulator in the market where we can purchase at a reasonable price but at the same time very informative especially if you are interested in not just playing a game but experiencing a simulator.       Keep up the great work and I would love to see this Simulator becoming a realistic and wonderful perhaps even educational and why not training programme for future merchant marine Academies at least for starters.I Am aware that this is not easy at all however this Simulator has the potential to become a very powerful and still very simple programme to use,enjoy and more importantly learn from.I can not wait to see what the future holds for this remarkable Simulator so do create more ships,improve the way larger ships behave in the water and add ports like Rotterdam,New York,San Fransisco the whole world would be great (perhaps in the form of updates from time to time like you do for Take On Mars).I like the sea behaviour and changes while in and out of the harbours and the Navigation Lights are incredibly detailed.I Did not like the fact that I am unable change the Graphics in more detail or change the weather conditions there is also no day/night change I hope that you will add these later on as the Simulator evolves.     That's about it for the moment will write more Reviews soon.			"

												This is an okay simulator with decent gameplay and fair graphics. It's a fair amount of fun if you're into this kind of nerdy stuff. The only concern I have right now is the fact that the devs have already fully released this game.I bought this game while it was in Early Access because it seemed very promising. It's a decent simulator with devs that listened to input from the community. When I opened up Steam to see that this game had been released like I♥♥♥♥♥♥a brick. This game is in no way ready for release. I expected to put another few months of work into this game before releasing it. Right now, there is a minimalistic amount of content, and there are just way too many things that need to be polished. Seriously, it's currently an unfinished game. Until new content comes out and this game becomes a proper simulator, I would not really suggest you buy it unless you're so strapped with cash that you roll your joints with hundred dollar bills. I'm disappointed in the devs for releasing this game so premature, but seeing that they still have new content coming, maybe it's not so bad. DEVS CAN YOU FIX THE WAKE BEHIND BOATS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS QUITE UGLY.			"

												This game is EXTREMELY worse compared to older ship simulator games. I bought this out of the screenshots, but today I made the mistake of forgeting to look at the reviews due to my ""sugar rush"" of browseing games. This is the first game I ended up buying without looking at reviews. I am really disapointed from a variety of resons. First, some parts of the game aren't finished. Second, there is no free mode/roam. Third, the cameras are really bad. Compareing to Ship Simulator Extremes, there is no walking aroung the ship, just the bridge, camera angles are limited, and the HUD is werid. I do not recommend this game. If you want a good ship simulator game, just don't buy this.			"

												To be honest European Ship Simulator was quite a nice game. After 2 days of enjoying the game I stopped playing. It just got boring. European Ship Simulator is not really a ""free world"" game. The game also only offers missions so you must follow the orders the game tells you to do or else there's no point into playing. The graphics are great on  all of the ships which was probably the only good thing about the game. This game is should not be a final release and to be fair with the editors and developers of this game, please don't release something thats INCOMPLETE!			"

												This game is, sadly, not even close to being what I would consider a finished game that's worth the asking price. As other reviewers have said, there is almost no actual game here to play. Essentially, every single ""mission"" is just ""go from marker A to marker B. Done. Now go from marker B to marker C. etc."" There is no real difference in playing the various ships (from a speedboat to a tanker vessel) other than their speed in getting from point A to point B. This game needs a lot more content, mainly in the form of context and rewards for getting from point A to point B, before it will be much fun.			"

								Navigating the ships requires some skills, but other than that there's not much fun to be had in this game (in its current form at least). Considering it's a simulation I expected a lot more realism and attention to detail. Now it's basically a ""go from point A to B"" kind of game and all-in-all everything feels very unrewarding. I was really hoping I would be able to navigate my ships through some rough waters, battling the waves and fighting with the forces of nature. But the water in this game is pretty static and the weather effects are (as far as I can tell) purely visual.Graphically everything looks very unpolished. The bridge interiors and ships look okay, but other than that everything looks pretty bland and unfinished.  The UI is horrendous and handling the controls is very tricky. The graphic options are limited and not what you would expect from a current generation game (for example: no real-time shadows, no AA, low resolution reflections).The developer has announced that this game will leave early access soon, which seems odd because there's still a lot of work to be done before it can leave the alpha stage. Definitely not worth the money at this point.			"

I have spent a lot of time getting use to at first, seeing that I crashed into the pier the first few times. Only three big suggestions I would make at this point. They are:1.ADD A TUTORIAL! There is no real tutorial at the start, you are just expected to know how to play.2.Add a free drive mode. Have a free drive mode were use can just drive a speedboat around or something.3.Add controler support. I think it would probley be easier to controlif you were using a wheel or Xbox 360 controller.Overall, I would highly recomend this game			"

								Second Review:Hi, now that ive played for more than a little while i will post something positive:The good thing about this game is the graphics, the feeling and how you play it. It's really nice, but the sthing that puts it doewn is: It doesnt have free-roam, because its in early acces and the physics of other ships being towed behing your tug boat is very bad.It's still in early access, but as of now i find this game really fun and challening! It's worth buying!_____________________________________________________________First Review:I was looking forward to this game.. exept theres a ton of cons/minus about this game:Pros/Good:Graphic'sCons/Bad:Cant go out of cabinThe ship sinks VERY easelyCant sink other shipsSlow reaction (Ofcourse, reality..)Go buy ""Ship Simulator Extremes"", so much better than wasting your money on this.

ProsLooks better than World Ship SimulatorHas Steam AchievementsMissions can be entered and exited at anytime, skipped or start any missions at will.Bridge views very detailed and there's room to walkabout.Sufficient different types of camera views which are practical and facilitate gameplay.Water waves and reflections look amazing!Sufficient controls to turn and pivot a large ship.Player controlled ships movement and inertia seems accurate enough though ship to water interaction seems to be only approximation. Possibly due to the game being glitchy, laggy and buggy, missions' success conditions are greatly simplified; mooring need no ropes to be tied to pylons, hull damage won't cause gradual sinking. Critical crash at port reducing hull to zero still considered mission success. Possibly due to hull being too fragile to begin with hence win conditions are extremely easy. Time skip allows fast travel to vicinity of destination port but can only be triggered at a single small area en route. Miss that and it will be a long arduous journey.ConsRuns poorly, worse than WSS but this is partly due to my potato chips notebook PCMenu text glitches and gives garbage when go into settings in full-screen modeThe Continue function only works in mid mission, never after completion of missionBecause of the above, no real continuity and therefore no career modeMission based, no free-roam or sand-box modeNPC ships runs on script, no randomization nor AI therefore scenarios play exactly the same way. Correction NPC ships do have AI and stop, preventing collision. Player ship too fragile, e.g Bulk Carrier gently touched tug boat, hull drop to 37%Bridge view locked - literally locked doors everywhere.Clipping issues between ship and sea but this is common in any game.Graphics quality settings makes little difference and there's only 3 basic setting; low, medium and highVerdict - You may want to consider getting it in a bundle if you like these sort of basic task based (non technical) real world simulators (non-fiction or fantasy). 5/10 due to poor optimization and glitches. Why 5? because this is a niche market. Recommendation: Yes if you can tolerate glitches and poor performance. No if you expect a polished product. Since there is no maybe, i give it a thumbs-up.			"

												This game was not ready for release.  A couple glaring issues is the physics model.  When making quick S turns in a small boat, the boat will tip from side to side.  In this simulator the boat stays perfectly level which is highly unrealistic.  The other thing I noticed was a lack of options?  Where is the anti aliasing?  Turning it on via the Nvidia Control Panel doesn't seem to work for this game.   Now I'm not totally negative, I do like the selection of ships, and the models look very nice.  I also enjoy the ship traffic, and the weather modeling is very good.  So this game does definitly have some things going for it.  I hope it continues to be worked on and patched and more features added.  I really wish that it hadn't been released prematurely.  I don't understand the strategy of releasing it when it wasn't finished?			"

This Game is more like a simulator for me, what trains, to be a captain. you have some maps you can chooose and then you have some boats/ships you can choose. there are missons you can play! and there is an editor So in my eyes, its a good game for someone who wants to be captain =)			"

Early Access Review
								ESS (European Ship Simulator) is a game where you have a list of missions that you can do. My personall favorite thing to do is sink a ship full of passengers. The game is pretty enjoyable at times, and can be fustrating when new to the controls. If a free roam/open world element were to be added where you could explore the open sea and own your own boat buisness and start by driving other peoples boats until you have enough money to buy your own and then you could hire others to work for you, and then when you get to a certain point in the game, just explore without the worry of losing money since your employees will be making you endless amounts of money. Or a Euro Truck Simulator but with boats. It's definitally worth a buy if your into boats and driving them.TL;DR?7/10, would sink again.			"

												Well this is just a Game and far away from a ""Simulator"". The Ship Physics are totally unrealistic, and a lot of People ( i included) told the Developers in the Forums, that some things a more then wrong, but they did not change it. One simple thing is, that the Engine from (i think it was the ferry) goes up to 4000 RPM, and that is totally unrealistic (the real Maximum of a single Marine Diesel is aprox. 650 RPM). The Speed must be shown of the propeller shaft and not such Fantasy Values like 4000 RPM. Then its funny, that you can drive the heavy Ships like a Car, and the Steering of a heavy weight Ship is like driving a Go-Cart. All this shows me, that the Developers never really invested Time to make some inquiries about the Physics and Basics of a real Ship. Also funny is the Cruise Ship, if you have 0% Power on the Engines, the Ship brakes immediately like a Car within a few Meters. Everybody who has a little bit physical appreciation knows, that you cant stop such a big and heavy Ship within a few Meters so easy.Well positive is, that the Graphics are better as in SSE, and that they implemented some famous Ports in Europe, like Rotterdam, Hamburg and Rostock.

												I like the idea of the game but feel that it was a waste of money.Positives:Great ideaYou can walk the bridge (albeit very slowly)Negatives:Glitches in graphics (water in boat, distorted edges, poor water effects)No tutorialNo campaign modeOther traffic does not give way properly ( boats randomly change paths and crash into yours, damaging boat and ending mission) In real life a fishing boat doesnt uncompramisingly sail into the side of a ferry, there is communication and giving way on both sides.....No simulation speed increase so you can sail entire mission, if you use the option given to you, you just jump to the end for docking.Don't waste your money is the bottom line, the game although finished is not in my opinion in a finished state.

												Now the game is full release I am disappointed. Its not really a simulator and the missions are lacking details, and its boring with little replay value - Even completing a mission gives no rewards (its just misison over) or even a points or scoring system. Other ships have no AI and use predetermined parameters meaning they go the same way every time and physics between the different boats does not seem to change much (they all seem to turn too quickly). Its also far too easy to sink a ship by tapping a dock. Game optimization is awful with task manager showing it using 1.8GB RAM and 93% CPU (on a Core i5) taking my CPU to 100%. Judging by the other games the Developer has made (one where Speed Bumps was one of the major features of the game) I now get the impression they do not have the technical skill (or finances) to make this game have the basic features the community have been asking for (realistic physics, steering wheel support, in cockpit HUD, Maps), where this game is missing many basic features that were present in the last generation of Ship Simulators. I will however praise the dev for updates and being active in the games forums and replying to people (I wish all companies were like this), although more often than not the reply is negative, stating they are a small team with little finances and the feature will not be added. These days any kind of simulator is a massive undertaking as ETS2 has really raised the bar. I just get the feeling they are in a bit over their heads and a game like this is too ambitious for this developer.			"

												(please note that I decided to write this review is interspersed with comparisons between this Ship Simulator and the older Ship Simulator by Vstep)Bit of a mixed bag this one, frankly not very impressed with it, espesially given that I myself am a sailor (though by no means a captain) with a little boat handling experience.When compared to Vstep's long abandoned Ship Simulator series this one's got quite a lot of catching up to do, even though the Vstep shipsim has numerous faults of it's own.First thing I noticed about this game that kind of set the trend for what I was expecting of it was the poor terminology used in the manual, for example referencing to the 'Front Engine' and 'Rear Engine Throttle' controls, the proper names for these being the Bow and Stern Thrusters.As far as I can tell this game has only two features better than that of the Vstep shipsim. The first being the inclusion of independent control for port and starboard azimuth steering units, as found on the Tug, though unfortunely let down by the clear fact this game's developers obviously don't know exacly how these units work in real life. The second, possibly more obvious one, being the distinct lack of bugs which were a notorious problem with the Vstep simulator. As far as thing go thats about it for being ahead of it's (dormant) competition.Where graphics are concerned this game isn't too bad, all things considered, it's fairly level with the Vstep one, though I would consider Vstep to be slightly ahead. So far I can't say I've found much in the way of issues with the physics, but I may be wrong. However there are a few things with the physics and general effects that could do with attention, such as for some reason the ships seem to create a bow wave when going astern (reversing), and one thing I found when I came along side the cargo ship in the first tug mission, I lightly brushed the side of the ship with the side of the tug, a move that would be fairly common place in reality, resulted in severe damage and caused me to sink. In reality the tug would be fitted with rubber fenders, as can actually be seen on it's sides in the game, which are there to dampen any very light brushes resulting in minimal damage, if any.This game has a little more in the way of interactive/functional controls on the bridge, though frankly their functions being fairly unrealistic, such as light and horn switches. The horn seems to operate on a repeating pulse setting when turned on and won't stop until turned off again. Personally I think they missed a trick here as they could have opted for a selective horn signalling system as used on real ships, one-uping Vstep. The lighting is something they really put no though into as it only turns on a few deck lights, not the more obvious navigation lights.The steering isn't that great, though thankfully is much better than the horrible control setup of Ship Simulator:  Maritime Search and Rescue. One rather nice touch with the controls is that both the throttle and steering are set so that they take time to complete their movments, as in real life, rather than just instand full rudder or power. The steering/rudder angle on the featured ships only goes up to 10 degrees in either direction, both poor and unrealistic as the typical maximum rudder angle for the average ship is 40-45 degrees, as reflected in the Vstep game. As I mentioned before, the developers of this game decided to include the use of azimuth steering units with certain vessels, as did Vstep, but unlike Vstep did have enough of a brainwave to program in individual steering control, but unfortunately They don't actually know how these units work, where as Vstep do. Just to clear up, an azimuth unit is effectively a pod fitted with a propeller mounted under the ship which can be rotated though 360 degrees thus eliminating the need for a rudder or reverse gear and giving the ship better agility than with a conventional rudder and fixed-shaft propeller setup.Just like the Vstep shipsim, this on comes with a mission editor. At first it seems quite simple to use but I still haven't got the hang of it, so I suspect looks may be deceiving, also not really helped by the camera being in a fixed birds-eye-view, only the height above ground being ajustable. Good luck to anyone who can figure it out.To sum it all up this game does have potential here, but I'm not convinced by it. The best thing the developers of this game could do is have a good long shot with Vsteps (now possibly abandoned or furgotten, jugging by their website) Ship Simulator series and see where this game has to improve. So I don't recommend this game, at least not yet.Instead I recommend you try out one of the Ship Simulator series from Vstep, The newest one Ship Simulator Extremes (2009 release) being available on Steam, but be prepared for bugs/glitches which are likely to appear.

												As someone who bought this game during Early Access because of the typeface that reminded me of Euro Truck Simulator, I was disappointed to see it out of it in such an unfinished state. Graphics options are almost non-existant - you get to choose between low, medium and high quality, neither of which tell you what's changing; also, the game doesn't look that great and runs just as bad on either setting - CPU usage is all over the place, it's lacking content, it's unpolished, can't turn off the menu music, etc. These are issues that are normal in alpha/beta/Early Access games and usually I'm willing to turn a blind eye if the gameplay is good.Early Access shouldn't be replaced with promises supporting the game in the future. When I bought it during Early Access, I knew what I was getting into. People buying the game now, however, may be unaware that the game is unfinished.			"

												Just bought the game for my brand new MacBook Pro 15"" Retina with both i7 cpu and 2GB dedicated graphics memory. Most games are truly fluent but this one acts like nothing else. FPS from 8-12 and not fluent at all. Could expect more from a release like this. At this moment I would'nt recommend anyone to buy this game. More work has to be done in the development process.			"

												This game is NOT ready for release. It lacks the most basic features of any good simulator, there are not enough missions, ships, or instances to play. I am genuinely appalled that this game is being sold for £15, while there are older games which are much better and cheaper.I would highly suggest you do not buy this game until the devs take time to improve it ten-fold.

												At the current state, I can recommend this game only for die-hard ship simulator fans. For these people, it'll probably be like heaven. At first. Currently there are only a few missions to play but since this is an Early Access-game, it's totally understandable. Some missions have a time limit, if you exceed it by 1 second, it doesn't matter if you played for like.. 2 hours. Mission failed, that's all, plus an immediate return to the homescreen. The graphics are still quite buggy and unoptimized. But hey, it's Early Access. What really annoys me though is that the developer seems to focus on new content, not on bug fixes. And of course, it takes a loooot of time to create new content. Meanwhile you have a buggy game with a couple of missions, and perhaps every month a new mission. That is what I see here right now. CTDs are quite common, happens to me 70% of tries to play a mission, it crashes within the first 10 seconds. What I fear is that the game might become like the other ship simulators. Buggy, repetitive games with minimal content in terms of different things to do on the vessel.Also, there are only the Steam Forums to communicate with the developer and well, I haven't seen him responding to any recommendations whatsoever on what to change in the game.I think it is great that there's finally someone who wants to bring a new ship simulator to the market, but at the moment, I cannot recommend the average player to buy it, especially at this price. Wait a couple of months until major enhancements have (hopefully) been made so that you can see in which direction the game goes: the old Ship Simulator games or something new and really different.// Update: 13.02.2015 - I was quite astonished when the developer announced that the game will leave early access next week, which means that it'll be on steam as an officially finished game. Although the developer said that they'll ""continue to work"" on it, I do not think that this is a good way for a game. It still has minimalistic content and is very unoptimized, containing disastrous bugs such as the horizon which is full of weird blue lines, flickering around and destroying the game's atmosphere. They have not been able to fix these for months. And how can you say that the game is finished when even the menus of some indie games made on unity look better than this one?			"

Early Access Review
								It's an ok start, but too early for being on sale. Criminally unstable and buggy, and I say that not because I don't expect an alpha game to be buggy, but it often makes to where 5% of my mission attempts actually let me finish a mission without crashing or locking up. There is also no save function(manual or automatic, so you will lose your progress.)There is also effectively no settings menu. Low, Medium, and High and none of them seem to affect how the game looks. No vsync, reflections, distance, AA, nothing. The game certainly looks pretty, water reflections and physics are nice. Sitting inside the tug boat out in the ocean feels very realistic, however the actual buildings and cities a long the coast look like something from HotWheels Crash. It performs really well on my system, but that's something I'd expect, again looks nice, but not amazing. The game has nice sounds, the roar of the engines below and the horn on the ships all sound fitting, though that's mostly all you'll hear. That and seagulls for hours because the skip time function will probably break for you as well. Like I started with, it's a decent start, but under no circumstances would I suggest a casual player to purchase this. Only someone who is a big fan of ships and ocean simulators. Even then, they will probably go through all the content very quickly.Launching February 2015 seems pretty soon, wait for launch before taking the dive off the starboard.			"

Early Access Review
								Changing my position since the Early Access Review (read below). This simulator is still bare bones, and lots of bugs. It would be really fine if it was still under Early Access, but sadly it is not anymore. This is not the final product I was expecting. Here's an example, starting my tug mission at somewhat 13:00 hours, it should be bright outside. But it feels like dusk. The brightness and daylight is wrong. I start moving my tug to two ships that collided a few miles from my position. The movement of the ship in the water feels superficial, as there is no proper wake and although the bow wake seems fine, it still needs work. The water displacement, which you would expect from a couple of tons ship is barely noticeable. There is also water transparency missing.  A few other simulator and games have done a better job at wake too, like Total War: Rome 2, Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm, Silent Hunter Series, and even Spintires(The best water simulation and wake I've seen in a while).Moving forward...There is no depth radar, and only basic instrumentation. Reaching the two ships I receive the order to attach my tug boat to one of them. Sure, the line attached to my boat is also bugged, as in it doesn't look tied but like a big gigantic straight piece of rope glued to the ship. Moving on, a few minutes later a Coast Guard ship collides with the ship being towed. Showed no desire to slow down or deviate from the collision. In fact, it kept going even when it still collided to my towed ship. A few minutes later, my ship and the towed ship jumps around and I'm suddenly sinking! I hope the devs doesn't get dishearten over their product, because there are still a lot of love in it. Which I explained in my Early Access review. Like the texturing of the ships, the lights, and the water. But this is definitely not a finished product and I sadly CAN NOT recommend it as such. As an Early Access, sure, but not the way it is now. Buy it when it is on sale or when they fix this (which I will update this review accordingly if there are changes and if those changes are positive, I will recommend the simulator at a later stage)__________________________________________________________EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:So far, the simulator seems to be scratching an itch that hasn't been scratched in ages. I love the attention to detail, and how they really bothered in making the ships. I love ferries but I fell in love with the fishing ship. Life huh! I also love the water, although I feel it needs a bit more love as in transparency (side of boats and docks and depth) refraction and reflection. But I would also love if we had proper ship wakes. A few games that managed to nail wakes, that I've seen are Silent Hunter 3/4/5, Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm(dynamic wakes) and Spintires(Dynamic wakes), and I would love to see that beautifully well-formed foam around the ship, giving a sense of movement, or that you are displacing tons of water.And the developer's approach to the community and how they are handling criticism, suggestion and even the comments are very commendable. I think this simulator has shown a lot of promise, and I can't wait to see the developer’s dreams over this simulator come true. I also like how the light reflects over the surface of the ship, tiny things like that immerses you more than you can imagine. In other words, it is still Early Access, bare bones, probably pre-alpha, and still needs a lot of work, but what it already has is fun and worth the money! So, if you like simulation and ships, this is definitely something you should buy!			"

												 i just bought it after hesitating a long time, i already owned the extreme boating version and they looked alike in the stills, but you already made great improvments , the water looks great and the textures too Only thing missing is people add some models on the boats, doesnt need to be gta standard just something simple so you see who you are taxiing and ordering around like a real captain ;)			"

												Although I enjoy shiping of all kinds, this game has nohing to do with any form of proper seamenship. The AI is completely unintelligent, and a better name for the game could have been ""Demolition Derby on Water""!! Towing ships back to port is just laughable, and one ship I was towing looked very mugh like it was riding a very rocky seabed, with punctures in all 4 tyres!!Not recommended for the ""unintelligence"" and ""non quality assurance""!

												Not impressed... constant crashes to desktop, always before I can even get out of port.  Check the forums... people experiencing CTD on a consistent basis.  The publisher seems to think this ""game"" is ready for delivery, but it isn't close, and should still be considered beta.  I actually had fewer issues during early access.Mr Publisher said ""When claims over the game being “unfinished” arise, I can imagine that you are expecting more content than has been delivered.""  Well, Mr. Publisher, my first guess would be, their claims are referring to the constant crashing... not more content, necessarily.    Purchase at your own risk.			"

Early Access Review

												I love vessel simulation games and that is the reason why I tried this one in spite of the negative opinions i had read.... but i was disappointed.This is not a real vessel simulator.Controls inside cabin are bad... there is no indication or mention about the course you are heading. There is not havigation chart, sounding, bearings, radar, distance to ships, cpa data, the map is bad, etc, etc, etc....it is more like driving a car than a ship in the water... there is not wind nor current effects, theres not wind indication and ship movements are not real.

Early Access Review
								Changing my position since the Early Access Review (read below). This simulator is still bare bones, and lots of bugs. It would be really fine if it was still under Early Access, but sadly it is not anymore. This is not the final product I was expecting. Here's an example, starting my tug mission at somewhat 13:00 hours, it should be bright outside. But it feels like dusk. The brightness and daylight is wrong. I start moving my tug to two ships that collided a few miles from my position. The movement of the ship in the water feels superficial, as there is no proper wake and although the bow wake seems fine, it still needs work. The water displacement, which you would expect from a couple of tons ship is barely noticeable. There is also water transparency missing.  A few other simulator and games have done a better job at wake too, like Total War: Rome 2, Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm, Silent Hunter Series, and even Spintires(The best water simulation and wake I've seen in a while).Moving forward...There is no depth radar, and only basic instrumentation. Reaching the two ships I receive the order to attach my tug boat to one of them. Sure, the line attached to my boat is also bugged, as in it doesn't look tied but like a big gigantic straight piece of rope glued to the ship. Moving on, a few minutes later a Coast Guard ship collides with the ship being towed. Showed no desire to slow down or deviate from the collision. In fact, it kept going even when it still collided to my towed ship. A few minutes later, my ship and the towed ship jumps around and I'm suddenly sinking! I hope the devs doesn't get dishearten over their product, because there are still a lot of love in it. Which I explained in my Early Access review. Like the texturing of the ships, the lights, and the water. But this is definitely not a finished product and I sadly CAN NOT recommend it as such. As an Early Access, sure, but not the way it is now. Buy it when it is on sale or when they fix this (which I will update this review accordingly if there are changes and if those changes are positive, I will recommend the simulator at a later stage)__________________________________________________________EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:So far, the simulator seems to be scratching an itch that hasn't been scratched in ages. I love the attention to detail, and how they really bothered in making the ships. I love ferries but I fell in love with the fishing ship. Life huh! I also love the water, although I feel it needs a bit more love as in transparency (side of boats and docks and depth) refraction and reflection. But I would also love if we had proper ship wakes. A few games that managed to nail wakes, that I've seen are Silent Hunter 3/4/5, Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm(dynamic wakes) and Spintires(Dynamic wakes), and I would love to see that beautifully well-formed foam around the ship, giving a sense of movement, or that you are displacing tons of water.And the developer's approach to the community and how they are handling criticism, suggestion and even the comments are very commendable. I think this simulator has shown a lot of promise, and I can't wait to see the developer’s dreams over this simulator come true. I also like how the light reflects over the surface of the ship, tiny things like that immerses you more than you can imagine. In other words, it is still Early Access, bare bones, probably pre-alpha, and still needs a lot of work, but what it already has is fun and worth the money! So, if you like simulation and ships, this is definitely something you should buy!			"

												Many have slagged this game off for being ""too slow"" or lacking gameplay, some say it is boring. I have helmed ships big and small in real life and have to say that the reactions to engine and helm are spot on. This is the best shipping simulator I have been on. Graphics are brilliant, plenty of single player missions and the ability to build your own missions as well. The 3d enviroment within the bridge of each ship is stunning, and controls whilst simplistic, are sufficient for anyone. The introductory mission of tug and tow, is quite accurate, and the final ""nesting"" of the  cargo freighter into its assigned berth is testing but fun using both towing skills, knowing when to drop the tow, and final pushing along the hull to adjust freighters position. In real terms, these jobs on full size vessels must be done slowly and with care to avoid accident or damage, this is reflected in what you do here. For a fun game simulator, I was a bit dubious about purchasing at firest, but now I am glad that I got it.			"

												This looks promising! You can see there's been a lot of thought and detail put in so far. You can control your ship via keyboard or just using the mouse to handle the levers and switches yourself. Being able to walk around the bridge is awesome too. You get a nice sense of scale when captaining a large ferry that I really enjoy. You're currently limited to 3 missions, which is understandable given it's Early Access, each with a different boat and in different conditions. Involving both Dover and Calais. I take this route a lot and can say attention has been made towards the skylines of both these towns and ports, which again is a nice touch. You can even sink the ship and stand on the bridge as you witness the area filling with water, if that's something you're into.			"

												I can say that the game looks very promising and has a lot of potential. Graphics are fine (especially water animations), sound is realistic (great horn and weather sounds) and the game runs smooth in general. I also like the option of skipping to next port. Then there is a ton of features I would like to see in the future. Things like leaving the bridge and exploring the whole ship, being able to zoom in from the first person view, more camera options and functional lifeboats. The damage system is not so great either. My ship sunk in a few seconds after colliding with a small vessel.  I'm waiting for the upcoming updates and patches. Keep up the good work :D_____________________UpdateDevelopers abandoned this project and no longer support it. Game is broken and crashes frequently. Many players are unable to start the game at all.
