												Wait, is that Zombies, Monsters, Robots? I am pretty sure i have seen sth like that absolutely same game with same missions....Okay, that was not a reason i delete it. The reason is because it is another poor Point Blank/CSonline clone game, where you buy guns for a month with real money, not so interesting gameplay (Zombie fights are pretty same as Call of Duty zombies, even PVP fights are not so interupting), very bad translation (yeah, i am looking at this too).This might seem unfair or just stupid, but this is my own opinion: Do not waste your time on this Game + It doesn't have a lot of players			"

												И так, начнем с того, что я не смог даже поиграть! так как, я зарегистрировался, захожу в клиент и мне предлагают зарегистрироваться еще раз, я искал 10 минут кнопку "" Войти или Авторизироваться"" и не нашел. Разработчики даже не смогли банально сделать кнопу ""Войти"" из-за этого, вам просто надоесть сидеть и дрочиться в этой тупой систме, даже нету видио с примером, как зарегистрироваться.			"
