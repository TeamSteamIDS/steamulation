												Seems like a rather nice casual TurnBasedStrategy game. Simple mechanics (for a turnbased veteran at least, but not too simple that it gets booring) that are still rather engageing and forgiving.Small quick maps, that can still potentially overwhelm you.It's not X-com: Ufo Defense or Jagged Alliance 2. (Or the newer ones: Xenonauts or JA: Flashback) but still lots of fun.The turorials are nice and clear. The random newscasts are somewhat entertaining :DI have not had any problems with it so far.

												If you enjoy Turn-Based Strategy, Ghost Busters and/or Business Management, there is no way I could recommend this game more highly than I do right now.Pros: Ghost Busters Simulator (but not so much like Ghost Busters it feels like plagiarism), a great depth of tactics and strategy afforded by different character classes (not so much) and a huge arsenal of weapons with varying abilities (this is what truly adds the depth of strategy), a decent amount of monsters that handle uniquely and require different strategies, decent replayability, great humor in dialogue and missions.Cons: Buggy achievements, certain combinations of enemies can lead one to feeling like it was a cheap defeat, eventually you WILL run out of things to do (and unfortunately this doesn't take a HUGE amount of time to happen), rather limited party (three in the field at any given time even though you can hire quite a bit more, there just isn't any reason too, especially since stats level up with character usage, it's rarely beneficial to use anything but the same 3 characters in the field.)Of course, pros and cons paints a pretty limited picture. This game has a lot of interesting systems and mechanics from weapon upgrades, vehicle upgrades and even base upgrades. There is a lot to do in this game and a lot to see, but most people will probably beat in a week with casual play times, a few days with more dedicated time and for the truly dedicated it could easily be beaten in a day.As much as this game is amazing, and especially with additional content currently in limbo as it's been some time since an update, I would only recommend this game at full price to people who are FANS of all genres this game caters to and fans of the Ghost Buster angle. For everyone else, I recommend waiting til this goes on sale.Personal Rating: 9/10 (charming pixel graphics, great audio, good controls, amazing game play and content.)Unbiased Rating: 7/10 (short ""campaign"", aka list of objectives, buggy achievements, unsure future for the game, steep-ish price for the amount of current content.)Also, my biggest gripe with this game is how ridiculously overpriced the emotes are, I want to collect them all!

												Ever since that fateful incident with my neighbor lady's cat and a vacuum cleaner (sorry Cinnamon!), I've tried to find a healthy outlet for my ghost busting fantasies. Until now it has been fruitless. UNTIL NOW. ""Ghost Control Inc."" provides such an outlet. Part management sim, Part XCOM combat/base strategy, this is a fun little distraction of a game. You name your starting character (My guy is Fat Indiana... you'll know him when you see him) and start your own paranormal cleaning service (I named mine the Ghost Murderers). Time passes as you sit in HQ, upgrading, hiring, firing, and managing equipment - that is until your cell phone rings and your services are required. Then you load up your vehicle, prep your team, and head out; make sure to beat the competition there.Combat is deceptively simple. Your team opens doors, turns on lights, and encounters nasty ghoulies. Hit them with your lasers until they're worn down and lay down a trap. It's pretty satisfying to wreck ghosts in a fun, lighthearted atmosphere. Your team will suffer physical (and mental) wear-and-tear, so you'll have to swing by the hospital. Your car needs gas, so you'll get that too. And obviously as your business expands, the ghosts will amp up their game. You'll need to buy more equipment and hire new people.If you like XCOM, if you're a fan of management games, or if you have fond memories of a certain iconic franchise, I can recommend this wholeheartedly. I've just got one question: who ya gonna call?PS: Do NOT call the Ghost Murderers, they are highly unprofessional.			"

												+ Ghostbusters nostalgia+ Cool retro graphics+ Plenty of upgrades+ X-com turn-based combat+/- Just a few things to buy for your base, therefore moving to a bigger building doesn't really do anything except to give you the illusion that you're getting bigger as a company+/ Insanity is a cool mechanic but instead of permanently limiting your character for the entirety of a battle (for example, by limiting your AP, or decreasing weapon damage) they become completely useless when the bar is (almost) depleted+/- Buildings can feel small and crowded, some of them not built with a few of the unlocked weapons in mind (weapons that require a certain distance before you can actually fire them)- A couple of gamebreaking bugs- Upgrading your crew not really worth it if you have to wait for longer periods, especially if they could go insane later on- Competitors don't really influence your business, feels underusedSmall note: the game would've been more fun if it was in 3D I think, giving you a better overview by using a rotating camera. But obviously I understand the decision to make it 2D, as it probably would've cost much, much more.[Rating: 81/100]			"

												Tl:dr - Overall, this is a decent game, but lacks some of the tension and tactical flexibility that would make it great. Probably not worth the full sticker price.GhostControl Inc. is a turn-based small squad tactics game. Very small squad. You never get more than three people in your deployable team, and never wind up clearing any buildings larger than a three-bedroom house. The mechanics for laying and picking up traps is kind of cumbersome, but works in the framework of the game.The real thing that the game lacks is a sense of immediecy and danger; even the most gnarly of spectors will take several rounds to force one of your hunters to flee, and even mid-level spooks will themselves take several rounds of concentrated fire from your whole team to deal with. This really reduces what makes most turn-based tactical games exciting, being on-edge while waiting to see what the enemy winds up doing, since it could make or break you.Also, many areas have so much stuff scattered over such a small playing area that they are effectively reduced to networks of single-file corridors for movement, which is super frustrating.

												Essentially a modern day non IP related version of the classic Ghostbusters game from the 80s. Great music despite not having any of the actual tracks from the movie and the gameplay of running a ""Ghost Control"" business was fun. The only catch is that there isn't much meat to the gameplay either in terms of running the business or capturing ghosts. But it's a great foundation and something that I hope we see developed further or get a fully fleshed out sequel from.			"

Posted: November 25, 2015
												In a nutshell, what you're basically looking at with Ghost Control is not so much a business simulation game but something more akin to an X-COM with a ghostbusters theme. Just like X-COM, you have to manage and upgrade your HQ, but the HQ management doesn't really require much careful decision making or strategy. It's more like just waiting until you have enough money to purchase a thing and then purchasing it. So there is base management, but it's not complex enough to really feel like a true business sim, and it's frankly not even as complex as the base management in X-COM.You're going to be doing a lot of tactical battles in this game, and this is another area where the game is basically similar to X-COM but a lot more simplified. You have 2 action points per turn, you fire ranged weapons that have a certain % chance to hit or not based on the particular character's aim stat, and your objective is always to eliminate all ghosts. Where it is different from X-COM is that there are pretty much only two weapons at your disposal: beam guns and traps. However the guns can have different effects (e.g. pushing enemies back, pulling enemies toward you, stunning enemies, multiplying dmg dealt by allies' beams, etc). The traps can also have a range of different perks (e.g. some traps require a ghost to be on the same square, whereas others have an AoE trap effect. Some traps can only be dropped next to you while other traps can be slung a short distance toward the target. Some traps only capture ghosts, while some traps can still stun or dmg a ghost even if failing to capture it, etc).One thing that is a notably creative feature of this game that makes it more interesting than X-COM or other similar tactical games is the ghost trapping gameplay. This is a truly original idea that in my opinion is the game's most interesting and defining feature. In a lot of these tactical games where you're controlling squads of dudes with guns, you're usually tasked with shooting all the enemies until they are dead or incapacitated. In Ghost Control, all of your enemies are ghosts, so you can't actually kill them. All you can do is shoot them to reduce their ""energy level"", which can greatly reduce their mobility if low enough, but it also makes them susceptible to being trapped. Your ghost traps have a ""max energy level"" requirement, which indicates the max energy level ghost it is able to trap. But lowering the ghost's energy level below this maximum makes the trap more likely to succeed. So what you are trying to do is shoot the ghosts to drop their energy level to 0, then position the ghost over a trap to permanently remove it from the field. But remember how beam weapons have certain effects, such as push/pull? This means you can throw a trap on the ground and hurt a ghost AS YOU ARE PULLING it toward you and onto a trap. Or an ally can throw down a trap and you can use a push-type beam to push the ghost onto an ally's trap. Or you can position a ghost on tap of a trap and hit it with a stun-type beam to prevent it from escaping the trap range and boost the odds of a successful trap. This is pushing/pulling ghosts onto traps to eliminate them is an excellent way of capturing the spirit of ghostbusters in a tactical game, and I commend the designers for thinking of it.One kinda negative thing about the combat is that many of the maps are very cramped for space. You'll be fighting ghosts in a lot of houses and offices, and it really limits your tactical options when the hallways or paths around furniture only allow one ally to pass through at a time. Based on conversation with other players, though, it seems that some people enjoy the challenge of having their mobility greatly restricted in this way. Another positive is that it also restricts the mobility of many ghosts (save for a few ghosts that will teleport or phase through walls). So it could be that you'll find that to be a positive, but just know that residential/office levels put you in VERY tight spaces. The designers realized that the residential/office maps are very cramped, though, so as a counterbalance there are also park/tunnel missions that are more about battling in wide open spaces.The negative of these tight spaces is not just how it affects gameplay/mobility, though. It also means that there is just a lot of.... STUFF...  piled up on the screen. If you are using the default view on residential/office levels, it can be almost impossible to see your characters or where the possible walking paths are. There is some helpful tools in the game to cope with this. For example, walls and furniture become transparent when the cursor is within a certain range. You can also press shift to turn walls and furniture completely off. So there are ways of dealing with it, but some may still be slightly put off by the default view feeling so cluttered.In terms of the flow of the game, it does feel like it starts to run out of steam after several hours. There are objectives to meet, base upgrades to buy, weapon upgrades to buy, and of course the ghosts will become more challenging. But the game sort of has the same problem as The Elder Scrolls, where at some point you realize that the game basically boils down to 1) kill everything in dungeon, 2) sell everything from dungeon, 3) use money made from selling everything in previous dungeon to buy better things that let you kill everything in an even bigger dungeon, 4) repeat times infinity.If you love ghostbusters and you love x-com style games, and if you are fine with the old school look/feel, then it may be a game worth checking out.My verdict using the criteria below is that the game ranks around a 4.. 7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.

												GhostControl Inc. is an enjoyable turn based game with some management sim flavor. The closest game I can think of would be XCOM, but in GhostControl you are running a ghost hunting company (think Ghost Busters) instead of running a secret government agency tasked with defending earth from alien attack.In GCE you'll have to manage your team, a base, and your car. You can recruit additional members for your team from your home office and must keep their sanity maintained, periodically visiting a hospital to ""repair"" that sanity. Your base is where you'll drop off your ghost goo and perform various other tasks. And while out roaming the town waiting for calls from new potential clients, you have to remember to keep the car gassed up with a few gas stations around the town.*[While the game is actually quite enjoyable from my experiences thus far, there are a couple minor issues that can be frustrating. One such issue is the fact that every time you select a team member for their turn, their inventory screen pops up in the bottom middle of the screen blocking your view (they can be moved and if you remember to move them, and not close them, on your first couple turns it's easily fixed).]*[Edit: 6/10/2014: This issue has been fixed and I haven't noticed any other real issues]All in all though, a very enjoyable game. I'd give it a solid 8/10 from my experience so far.*[Edit 2: 6/10/2014: As you can see from the comments to this review, the devs care a great deal about their game. I'd give the game at least a 9/10 now]			"

												GhostControl Inc. is still very new. It's refreshing game that let's you relax after a hard day of work (for example.This game is just like the Ghostbusters, equip yourself with gear and weapons and you're ready to fight the ghosts, banshees and poltergeists.aThe graphical side of this game is not something to tell about a lot. It's not much, but it somewhat gives this game an extra flavor.It's a small map you play in, which is easy, but on the other hand I get the feeling it's too small.A lot of options can be used in the game: Recruit people and let them fight ghosts or use your laboratory to upgrade your items.If there is a ghost somewhere, you get a call, you decide if you want to go there or not! After a battle you can use the 'ectoplasm' you get (or money to call it that way) to upgrade items or just turn it into more money so that you can buy items.The battles are pretty easy to understand. It's a somewhat turn-based game. The goal is to weaken the enemies and put them in your vacuum-device. The thing I find 'well-thought' was the ability to turn on the light. Without the light you won't see the ghosts of course! It's also funny that the ghosts can turn off the lights if they want to.If you like these kind of games, you might have fun for some hours with this game.Pros- Easy to understand controls- Fun battles- Lot of options- Relaxing game without too much thinkingCons- Map might be too small- controlling time is annoying sometimesRating6.5/10It's not a AAA-game of course, but it's nice to play something else now and then.Recommended?Yes, it's a relaxing game and it could leave you playing for hours. It's a really small map though, that might get bored at some point. If you like these games, it's sure a game you should buy. It's not that expensive either.			"

												This is a very good concept and awful execution. The UI is clumsy, controls seriously lacking in any design and there is no real depth to this game. Gamapley is also riddled with, lack of, design where you receive mission calls at random times, and random positions with random stength that you won't know until you get on site and realize that your single crew member, because you've just started, is not good enough to go against 6 ghosts, hell you don't even have that many traps on you!Progression is also very liniear and non-imaginative, as new weapons are simply +1s to various stats and super powers, quirky abilities are rare to come and see.

Lets me fufill that dream by letting me manage my own ghostbusting company and also catch ghosts in a simple to learn hard to master comabt system(Think X-com but with ghosts) Now Dear reader I hear you say But user man this sounds too good too be true surley thier must be some kind of catch Well first of all dont call me surely and secondly your right the game has some light bugs and an interface that might take a while to figure out(maybe like 5 missions) But considering how dirt cheap it is at the time of writing and also just how much love and hardwork went into this by the awesome developers you would be a fool not to check it out AT LEAST FOR YOUR OWN SAKE TRY THE DEMO.

												I've had a lot of fun playing through GhostControl Inc. The game merges turn-based strategic combat with business management to allow you to run your own ghost hunting business while busting the ghosts with the team you put together. As you advance through the game, you'll be able to upgrade things like your headquarters and vehicle, as well as hire (or fire) new hunters that have different classes (such as shooter, scientist and brawler.) With an upgraded headquarters, you'll be able to pay for training for any of your ghost hunters in order to improve their skill set. The weapons and traps are also upgradeable through research, so you can improve the weapons in your arsenal as well as purchasing new weapons and traps (that can also be upgraded).A typical mission will start with a call coming in on your phone with someone telling you about their haunting, and you have the option to accept the mission or hang up on the caller. If you accept the mission, a ghost icon will appear on the map where the mission is to take place. You'll need to speed your team over there as quickly as you can, as there are rival ghost hunting businesses in the game that will get there first (if given enough time). This is where the faster vehicles come into play, as they will give you an advantage in speeding to your next mission. If a rival company makes it to the mission location before you, then the mission is cancelled out for you, and you'll have to wait for your next call. Once you arrive at the mission, you and your crew will be responsible for rounding up all the ghosts there using your weapons and traps. If a crew member's 'sanity' stat drops too low, they'll go running from the mission, leaving the rest of your crew to finish cleaning up the haunting. Once you've completed capturing all the ghosts on the premises, you'll want to swing by the hospital to cure any fears (lowered stats) that are affecting your crew, then head back to HQ to store the ghosts. Stored ghost energy can be sold, but you may not want to sell it all, as you'll need some ghost energy (as well as cash) in order to upgrade your weapons and traps.The art style is decidedly retro, and does a good job of giving you the feeling of playing the classic ""Ghostbusters"" game from the old Commodore 64 days. While I'm happy with the advancements we've made in graphics technology since the days of the C64, this is one of those games that brilliantly shows that it is the gameplay, and not the graphics, that really make or break a game. A game can have the prettiest graphics on the planet, but if the gameplay doesn't back it up, then it doesn't make for much of a game. Here, the opposite can be expected. Very old-school styled graphics on top of a great game make it a great game, period.It took me a little over 11 hours to complete the game, without rushing through. Fortunately, when the game's 'campaign' is finished, you have the option to keep playing so you can keep on busting ghosts. According to the developer, they have two more cities planned for the future (Cologne and San Francisco), so we can expect more ghost busting fun in the future. They have not specified whether the additional cities will be made freely available or if they'll be paid add-ons, though I would expect the latter, and frankly have no complaint about paying for some add-on cities since the price of admission for the main game is so low to begin with.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original Ghostbusters game on the Commodore 64, and to anyone who enjoys a game with a solid retro vibe that is a good blend of turn-based strategy and business management.

												In short:Ghostcontrol Inc. is a solid and fun turn-based strategy ghost hunting simulator with very good humor.Ghostcontrol Inc. style and feel is that of a casual and fun game (but not easy :) ). The graphical style, sounds and music are similar to Theme Hospital. Gameplay is sufficiently deep for a turn based game and incorporates a simple 2 AP system which makes the game flow nicely. Menus and action are understandable and there is enough amount of micromanaging to have variety. The story of the game is humorous and well written. On the negative side:There are some minor bugs which have been addressed and worked upon by the developers (a lot of communication from their side) They main story itself isn't that short but by the end I felt it could go on more and the game could evolve more with more special missions. They are planning other cities so I guess I'll have to wait for those.The mechanics and variety of enemies and maps are just at the edge - if the game would get any longer the variety should step up in the future.All in all:Sound: 10/10 - Very fitting for the style and found myself humming the themes later on.Graphics: 8/10 - Clear style and fitting, some problems with UI.Game-play: 7/10 - Very polished, balanced and quite fun. If there would be more mechanics and moves and tactics the score would be higher.Story: 8/10 - Love the story, dialogues and setting. A longer story and a more rewarding ending would get a higher score.Will look forward to additions and improvements to the game. It has style, nice feel and seems to have potential to be even greater.			"

Yes it could be more complex, and it has one or two bugs (although I've found nothing gamebreaking) - but these are just indie devs doing their best - it's not like this is a AAA title.I'd highly recommend giving it a go - especially while it's still so cheap.

Occassionally when you pick your ghost trpas back up while on the battle grid, the game re-equips it to your character's headslot rather than their hand and makes it so that you can't use it again until you exit the battle you're in and re-equip it properly.

												Enjoyable and fun, worth the money I paid in the sale. A Ghostbusters theme is really a great idea, the whole running a business whilst catching ghosts in a turn based tactial combat sim is something we don't seem to get much of, although Xcom comes close - it's still not ghosts. Some ideas I would like to have experienced in this game are:- A new city, the game promises another city but as it stands London is the ONLY city.- The option to take more than 3 team members. Some ghosts are very difficult to defeat when one of them starts to panic.- Strategies that work together, like all team members firing at the same time to trap a ghost (much like in the Ghostbusters films). I realize this is not Ghostbusters the game, it is Ghostcontrol Inc. but the inclusion of Ghostbusters themes are ineveitable. As such, I would recommend this game, but I am slightly dissapointed that it doesn't quite reach my expectations. I am very glad that I played this however.			"

												Pros*Turn based tactical ghost hunting, similar to the playstyle of 'UFO: Enemy Unknown'. *Character development – spend time developing your characters in order to make them more resilient in tackling hordes of the undead.*Lots of in game items - purchase new vehicles to get you to and from haunted places quicker to new weapons in order to subdue / capture ghost faster.*Unique ghost bosses requiring shrewd team tactics in order to take them down effectively. *Pixel graphics.*Hard mode adds another level of depth to the game.Cons *The in game music is repetitive in places and could do with more variety.*Character catchphrases can become annoying as they tend to say them every turn.Verdict*A hidden indie gem that will keep you entertained for hours on end, definitely worth buying at any price.

												(edited)from what i've played so far the game is great. loved it straight away because i was itching to play this since i saw it a while ago on youtube and i haven't encountered any bugs so far so that is great but i also believe there will be new cities added in (hopefully, would make for some change of scenery). but all in all, i would recommend this to any strategy/ turn based games (and any fans of ghostbusters ;) ) anyway i hope my review helped anyone in purchasing this very enjoyful game. Also i just found out you need to progress and complete most of your main objectives before you can get all the other cool and awesome upgrades (they are really cool by the way :P). For a small team of developers, they have made themselves a gem of a game and i enjoy it quite a lot :). recommend all the way			"

												This is a really cute and fun mashup between two iconic old games, X-Com / UFO (The original, not the remake) and the old Ghostbusters game. A great deal of care has been made to give the game a very specific and consistent 'feel' . Expect siimple but rewarding mini-battles wih spooks, between battle planning/logistics, endless popular references and snarky one liners. Developers are active on Steam, quick to respond and very personable.			"

												This game is a lot of fun, has a a lot of strategy, with a lot of funny bits sprinkled in. Want to know what it's like to run your own Ghost hunting business?... the game has that, you like turn based strategy? the game has that, you want to bust silly ghost? the game has that too. There is a story, but you can play at your own pace and catch ghost as long as you want, so lots of replay value here too.			"

												Duplicating items, fights that don't end when you've beaten the enemies (and won't even let you quit the game because you can't continue it), a variety of other serious glitches, and the bare-bones tutorial make for a frustrating experience.

												I was a big fan of the old Ghostbusters game that came out in 1984, so this game certainly has nostaglia working for it. And I admit that it's pretty fun for a $15 title. But it's not perfect.Pros: - As mentioned by others, this is essentially a cross between X-Com and the 1984 Ghostbusters game. Your job is to use energy beams to weaken ghosts before snapping them up in traps, all the while trying to limit property damage and stop your employees from being drained of their sanity (the game's version of a health bar). The mechanics seem natural and understandable, and thanks to a wide range of equipment you do have several tactical options availble to you. You also get to upgrade equipment, though it's not a requirement.- Graphics are serviceable, and the retro-feel serves the setting well. - A wide range of baddies assail you, and there's enough adequate progress and randomized maps to keep the game interesting... for a time, at least. Cons:- Still a lot of bugs, though I didn't encounter anything game-breaking as of yet, or ones that hurt my enjoyment.- While maps are varied, they aren't very big, and they often have tight quarters. - The game does start to get repetitive (though it takes some time to get to that point), so unless the developers add more content down the road, I suspect this game won't have the longevity of X-Com.- The one major complaint: the dialogue. The developers were trying to capture the same comic feel of the Ghostbusters franchise, but... they fail. Your team constantly quips about the situation, and the quips are pretty painful cliches. Thankfully you can turn them off if it becomes distracting.Verdict: it has its problems, and it could use more polish and content. But hey, I had fun. You want some cheap spirit-blasting fun? This has it.			"

												GhostControl Inc. is an excellent game about busting... I mean controlling ghosts.  I've played about 12 hours now, and I'm confident that I'll play at least a few dozen more.The gameplay is heavily influenced by X-COM, which is of course a great thing to be heavily influenced by.  The graphics and sound are polished and attractive.  The writing is a bit hokey but solid, and I'm eager to see where it's all leading.Combat can get a little repetitive, though.  I played for a while on Normal, then restarted on Hard because I often found myself just standing in one place and spamming attacks while the enemies flailed at me with little effect.  So far, Hard difficulty is making things rather more interesting.  I haven't reached the highest tier of enemies yet on either difficulty setting, though, so possibly I have some nasty surprises waiting for me.  I hope so!Overall, GhostControl Inc. is very good, and a definite contender for my Game of the Month.I bought the game on sale, but If the developers released an expansion with more content, I would snap it up, even at full price.

												Fun game, but in SERIOUS need of patching.This game can be summed up in the phrase ""Ghostbusters by way of XCOM"". Old pixelated XCOM, not new 3D streamlined XCOM. You start off with a small team of ghost hunters armed with vacuum cleaners and repurposed radios as their tools to hunt the paranormal, and are given a single objective to work your way towards: earn this much money, buy a new car, buy better facilities, etc. Calls come in Ghostbusters-style of locations being haunted, you try to be your competitors to the job (with mixed results), and then the game becomes XCOM where health is replaced with ""Sanity"".As per XCOM, you can upgrade your weapons, progressively buy better equipment, upgrade your car as well as buy better cars, and even expand your base. It's very involving.But there's just one thing holding this game back: the bugs. Holy crap, is this game full of bugs. And now, a list:-Items not transferring to an inventory slot even though it counts against your Action Points only to show that yes, the item did transfer.-Items duplicating themselves and eating another item when you try to swap them.-A team member's entire inventory copying itself to another member when you only wanted to swap one item.-And, the one that drove me to do this review, a team member getting stuck on a tile while walking from Point A to Point B whereupon the walk animation loops itself and the entire game becomes unplayable. I couldn't move other members, I couldn't issue a different command, I couldn't end my turn, I couldn't even quit the game. The only way I got out was by going to my computer's Task Manager and manually ending the game.So, yeah, the game has some issues, but it's still a really fun game. Aside from the last one on the list, none of these issues were game-breaking or eye-gougingly angering.Pick it up while it's on sale, only get it for full price once they've fixed the bugs.			"

												Game is what we really always wanted in a Ghost Busters game.  It's easily accessable, has quite a bit of death and can really suck you in for hours!  Not to mention it's cheap. The graphics aren't cutting edge but done well, my only complaint is the small selection of voice over stuff from your team members gets a bit repetitive, the ghost fighting however feels fluid and dynamic, keeps you thinking many steps ahead or failing horribly if you aren't careful.

												This game is simply charming, especially if you are a fan of Ghostbusters, and lets face it, odds are thats why you are interested in this game in the first place. you start off with one hunter and a not so great car and HQ, Do a few missions, hire another person to come with, and make more money. Eventually youll get a better car so three people can go ghost bu--- controlling.The graphics are nice for what they are, a throwback to the 16-ish bit days, isometric view. A lot of the ghost sprites are simple, and theres only two sprites for hunters, male and female, but over all it works. I really like the beam graphics when you fire a weapon, and the music in this game is awesome in my opinon. I think if you like or dislike the style will depend a lot on if you are used to or can at least appreciate the old school flare, its certainly not for everyone, but I like it. It can get a little cluttered when you have 3 hunters at the same time, or theres many ghosts about, thankfully, you can hit shift once to remove the walls, and once more removes any remaining view obstructing items. be careful though because in this mode you may think theres a path when you are really trying to walk through a wall. one more click of shift puts the objects back and solves any confusion. The actual ghost hunting part plays similarly to games like Xcom or Omerta for quick reference. You can do so many actions a turn. Shooting, placing traps, moving, all use up Action Points. Shoot the ghosts to lower their energy, Place a trap below them, and then return to base to empty the traps. repeat. The ghosts can damnage furniture during the fights, and if they break enough you fail, if your hunters sanity drops too far, they will run off from the mission. You can heal and remove effects at the hospital.Better equipment unlocks and you have different beams, some suck (that is, they pull ghost towards you, not that they are crap) and some push, some can only be used at a distance like a ghost sniping rifle. There is a variety of traps, beams, and sensors to use. The sensors tell you how many ghosts are in the building, and better ones tell you what they can do, etc. Theres also equipment like jumpsuits and goggles that affect your stats. I gave one hunter a long range beam and a sensor since she wouldnt be getting close to the ghost, for example, and let the other two handle trap placement duties.There are other ghost control teams out there, and they dont really do much other than steal your mission if you dally to long.Items are also upgradable, requiring ectoplasm from your hunting excursions and time and money. You need a scientist, and the money, then let the ammount of time pass. For the asking price, I think this is a gem of a game, its simple, but fun. and has a sort of charm about it, such as how sometimes your people will say something like ""Controlling makes me feel good"" after finishing a mission.

												If you expect indepth tactics, large-scale battles, or action that will keep you on the edge of your seat, you're looking for a different game. GhostControl Inc. is much more geared towards the 'casual' player, trading in dark and gritty battlefields for delightfully oldschool pixel art environments. Throw in a bunch of horrible puns (which are the best kind), a lot of pop culture references and a succession of almost comical ghosts with distinct abilities and personalities, and you get a great little gem that is not only charming and entertaining, but will also keep you hooked for hours.Highly recommended, especially for this price (14€) you just can't go wrong.

												This game is rather hit and miss. The graphics are fun in their own retro style, and the theme works very well with the nostalgia look, but there are some definite rough patches. First and foremost is the cramped level design; I understand urban encounters are the goal, but most of the designs don't allow creative solutions or flanking for strategy. Put a tank in front, give him/her a big gun, and seal the exits. This is not to say the game isn't challenging at times, it's just that most of the challenge comes from conquering high health or high damage monsters. On the positive side, the gameplay works well and doesn't try to be an epic adventure. It's a point and click combat mechanic based around a goofy B-movie universe. On that metric, GhostControl is a huge success. There is a charming and easily immersive core underneath a very bland exterior. I would recommend it, but be prepared to play for 60-90 minutes at a time. Anything more than that and the game starts to feel a bit tedious.			"

												GhostControl Inc. is a quite interesting game. You become a leader of a team of ghost hunters and take care of different hautings all over London. The gameplay is similiar to the original XCOM, but with several differences. For example, ghosts can't be killed, instead you reduce their energy with your weapons untill they can be caught with a trap. Your hunters don't have health, instead there's a ""sanity"" stat ghosts reduce with their attacks. This stat measures how long the hunter can't resist close encouters with ghosts before he panics and starts running towards the exit. The lower is your sanity, the higher is the possibility that a ghost will cause panic.If you manage to catch all ghosts, you get paid and you can spend the money on all kinds of stuff: new equipment, bigger HQ, better car, new employees, upgrades, and (mostly) healing your hunters and refueling your vehicle.Now that's basics, but the important question is - is the game fun?In my opinion, it definitely is. If you are a fan of Ghost Busters, this game is a tasty treat. It has a lot of references to the movies, good humor and the voice acting is so cheesy that it's good.Summary+Ghost Busters nostalgia+ lots of humor+ many kinds of ghosts+ voice acting+ fun gameplay+/- music is good, but there's only like 5 tracks+/- some may like the XCOM style graphics, others might hate it+/- so far only one city, might change soon- some bugs- can get a bit grindy after some time8/10 "

												A surprisingly fun X-Com-style Ghostbusters homage.The Gameplay takes the driving mechanic of the original Ghostbusters game from the NES, Master System, Commodore 64 era, adds an X-Com battle element and douses it all with a lot of ghostbusting-themed items. Mostly reminiscent of Ghostbusters, there is some Scooby-Doo and other ghostbusting TV show and film references, such as the use of weird, homemade ghost-hunting items that has been a long-running trope far before the Ghostbusters film was made.In the game, your characters have Sanity instead of health. Once your Sanity gets dangerously low, the character will panic (saves vs Morale) and try to flee. If they lose all of their Sanity, they go insane and it's off to the looney-bin for them (they're dead, Jim)! There are 6 attributes: Sanity (health), Strength (carrying capacity), Constitution (affects movement), Aim (shot percentage), Morale (saves against fleeing), and Intelligence (not sure, will amend when I find out). There are quite a few items that unlock over time, you can get better cars, your characters level up, you can expand your base, and you can even have your Scientist upgrade certain items to make them better. You will receive jobs through your smartphone, which also controls options, saving, an encyclopedia of the ghosts you've encountered, team management and some other stuff. On the overland map, you have a base, gas stations, a car dealership, and the item store that you can visit. And you're not alone in this map, either. There are two rival ghost exterminators that will take up your jobs if you don't get there quick enough. Basically, you can't just take a job and then sit around. There are linear objectives that will unlock more things over time and present difficult boss-missions.The graphics are sprite-based and not that amazing. Very simplistic, very cartoon-like, and very much from the Commodore 64 and NES era. Sometimes, the environments can get a bit cluttered, but there are visual modes to hide walls, hide objects, and hide everything (including doors). Ghost types are varied and there is a bit of tactics that can be used trading off damage to push and pull the ghosts towards traps. Some of the levels are small, and some are bit more open, but there usually isn't too much open space, so you need to plan out your movement well. There is a good deal of map variety. You will, obviously, repeat maps, but enemy setups will change and the variety is fairly large. While in combat, you can sometimes destroy furniture, and certain ghosts will destroy furniture, too, such as poltergeists. The amount of furniture destroyed will affect your payout and if too much furniture is destroyed, you will lose the mission.Sound is simple synth bit-tune stuff, again reminiscent of the older days of games. The music is entertaining enough. It never really grated my nerves, but it is bit-tune kind of music, so don't expect too much. Sound effects are similarly synth-like, and certainly passable. I doubt anyone is going to be knocked over by how amazing the sound is, but it isn't bad and fits with the whole retro motif. The barks from the characters can get rather repetitive, but that's true of nearly every game that has barks.I've enjoyed the game a lot. It is simple, and there can be times where navigating the maps is a bit more difficult than it should be, but the game does have a lot of depth to it and it does provide a challenge. The sound and visuals all give a solid retro experience, which can be a turn-off for some, but I think it provides a lot of charm and it feels, overall, fairly consistent. The enemies are varied enough that even when you play the same map again, it never plays out the same. Tactics are surprisingly varied, especially once you unlock some of the slingable traps.I would definitely recommend this title, especially if it on sale.			"

												Such a fun little game, pretty addictive and hard as the ghosts get stronger you have to change your strategy. Similar to an old school xcom.			"

												If you like the original Xcom and the Ghostbusters, You'll love this game. Classic original Xcom gameplay with slightly better graphics and a Ghostbusters-style theme pasted on top of it. Music is reminiscent of the ghostbusters 80's. Voice soundbites of the characters with British accents is nice. It doesn't sound great but it works perfectly. My only issue with the game is recognizing character selection when in battle. Otherwise, the game was made by true Ghostbusters fans for true Ghostbusters fans. They did as much as they could without copyright infringement. They have my utmost respect.9/10 Check out our short gameplay in v3.0.

												Not since the days of the C64 have I played a ghost hunting game like this.  It really brought back some nostalgia for the old Ghostbusters game and I really enjoyed playing this game.The visual styling and humour in this video is great and really adds to the enjoyment of the gameplay and team management.  There are varied environments for ghost hunting and a good selection of weapons and additions to improve your company's ability to defeat ghosts and get paid.  I also think the bigger HQ is a good addition and allows for more progress.On top of these optionals that you can buy, your team also increase stats as they are out in the field which I think is a helpful aspect of building your squad and their abilities.The only downside that I can see so far is the map limitation, as there is only London available.  I would really like the team to revist this game and hopefully add other maps and environments as paid DLC so you have the option of continuing the game with new missions, enemies and surroundings.  But this is probably a pipe dream as it was released a few years ago now.None the less, it's a fun game and I'll have many hours sunk into this before I get bored with it as there is nothing else that I know of out there at the moment.

			Ghost Control Inc is a turn base strategy or is it? On Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/280540/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

Ghost Control Inc. is a turn-based strategy with money managementaspects wrapped in.  Paying homage to the 1980's movie, you playas a off-beat 'ghost-buster- that combats ghosts for fame and fortune.Graphically, the game is pretty basic, and the UI is distinctive,but basic, and it comes off feeling more like a management gamethan a turn based strategy game due to the lack of depth in thecombat.As you grow and develop your base, the more team members you canhire, and finish bigger jobs for more money.  What can be adeterrent to some is that the size of your base limits the typesof jobs you can do.  For those with the tank mentalitywho like to conquer the big jobs, you have to wait until your teamis larger and your base is more developed.There is no accountability for the choices you make, as I detailin the review video, and unfortunately you are forced to completethe missions as the game dictates, instead of when you choose to.The game has a strong base, but the lack of unique content and itscurrent price leads me to not be able to recommend this game.For more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basicsummary of what I cover in my video.Thanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												Ok for what it is, a low budget indie. Great idea for a game, but lacks the tactical depth of any of the old-school XComs or other similar titles like JA. Maps are very small, combat is quite flat, and it lacks RPG elements that would have made the game far better. At the $15 pricepoint I'd pass, it feels like a $5 product			"

												Supposedly, this was the game that GhostBusters should of been for Nintendo or whatever. Frankly, I found the game lacking on all fronts - graphics, stages, options for weapons or characters (yes, there are options, they are just not very engaging to me in the gameplay), story, replayability, sound - all sub-par compared to other games out there. If you REALLY like ghosts, and REALLY like the ghost busters, then maybe it's worth getting.			"

												I really want to love this game, but right now, I can't.I'm a huge Ghostbusters fan and I also like strategy games, but it's almost unplayable for me.There's no way to change the resolution, and since I switch between two screens (one is a TV with a lower resolution than my PC screen), I kinda messed with the resolution detection and now the game always starts in a very weird resolution in fullscreen mode, without any way to change it. The developers were very nice and gave me advice to fix it, but nothing worked, even after deleting everything, including savegames.Another bug I encountered was that the Ghost traps didn't empty on it's own anymore. There's no option to manually empty them, so if they don't get emptied when you reach your HQ, you're in a lot of trouble. The next mission I started failed because I couldn't catch any ghosts. Then I thought I should just buy new traps... but the newly bought traps were full as well. Even restarting the game didn't do anything, so I can't play the game anymore.I feel REALLY sad for the developers that I'm getting a refund for this game, but it's unplayable for me. I understand that they're in a pretty stupid financial situation and barely have the resources to keep the company alive, so I thought maybe I should just keep GhostControl in my list and they can keep the money as a donation... but then again, I really hope to re-buy this game somewhen in the future, when the problems are fixed. As for now, a refund is more of a statement that I really think this game needs quite a few updates.			"

												Short Review: GhostControl Inc.I finally broke down and bought the game after having it on my wishlist for quite a while so I thought I'd talk about it.It's a cute little retro-Ghostbuster-em-up where you have you own little paranormal elimination franchise. It hits all the high notes, you have an HQ, a car, gear and you can upgrade stuff. You go out on jobs and try to catch ghosts without wrecking up the scene too bad.If it had actually come out 20 years ago it would be pretty cool.Unfortunately, while it covers all the surface expectations the gameplay itself feels really, really shallow. The actual missions are slow and wrote, the commands you give your little busters aren't robust enough to really amount to much more than ""Stand here and shoot the ghost until you can trap it"" which involves walking up and sitting a trap right underneath it. You will do this over, and over and over again.If you really need that feeling of owning a Ghostbusters franchise, this will scratch that it, but it won't hold you attention for long. I didn't even manage to upgrade my car before the 'busting' got tedious enough for me to walk away.Recommendation: Sims 3 with the Ambitions Expansion has a Ghost Hunter career that, if you stick 4 sims with it in the same house, provides a much more satisfying Ghostbusters sim.TL:DR - 3 Unlicensed Particle Accelerators out of 5, A diehard fan might get some fun out of it but even then you'll be struggling to keep interested.

												Good premise, but fails to deliver.You don't actually manage anything, as there is so little content in the game.Tactical battles are not very tactical. Low AP, cluttered space, ranged ghost special attacks and low-success-chance traps mean you cannot avoid taking damage, and resort to just tanking with health.			"

												Picked this up because the promise of XCOM + Ghostbusters, but the game was a huge disappointment. The clunky interface was not intuitive, it was hard to find anything, and there isn't much help or hint that you're clicking on the wrong thing. The gameplay was immediately repetitive, and the refuel mechanic makes exploring a management chore.			"

Product received for free
												Received the game as a gift - I thought it was tediousIf you're into those business simulations where you're managing resources and clicking and pointing around to accomplish tasks for money and then managing MORE resources (gas in your car, buying new traps and upgrading equipment) all that is not fun.For starters brevity in these types of games are your friend - save the create a character options for later and just generate a stock hero character and just GO!Stop to tweak your look and personality stuff later - that was a big show stopper, i'm sure it mattered to the person who programmed it; I'm telling you it is a waste of time. Get to the action and move the action forward after the player gets used to the functions.If anything it just makes me want to help make the game better - it is a savage waste of time on such a great ideaI cannot recommend this game if you are an adult who works for a living - because it is literally a game about working that is significantly worse than real life (somehow) since youre NOT getting PAID			"

												First of all, I have to say that yes, this is a fun game. However, I definitely wouldn't recommend it at the price point.The game feels amateurish, with not much depth compared to games it claims to be like (FTL, X-COM, etc), and it's littered with glitches, grammatical errors, and glaringly bad design choices.The devs don't have any interaction at all with the community, so it's hard to suggest any changes/fixes, too.Overall I'd give this a 5/10 at a reasonable price point, but at this price point it's no more than a 3.

												Getting this game on sale may be the only time to get this game.With that said I just about experienced all of the game within six hours. The best pull for me, at first, was the busting of Ghosts. Sadly the charm wears off quickly as you realize things peak with better equipment. Any nervousness goes away and not much of a challenge is left.  I believe there isn’t much of a game once you hit that point and nothing to really drive towards with all of the bust and making money.The best part of this game is the art, music, and honestly the humor. I found a lot of it charming and had fun with it for a few hours.Mostly I would recommend, as is, if the price comes down. If there was an overarching drive for the player to keep going then I’d feel much better about the game and feel it was worth playing the time I spent. "
