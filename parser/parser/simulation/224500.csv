								Yes, it is a Dwarf Fortress Clone. No, I don't care.DF has the problem of no or weird graphics and is not very user friendly.If you are looking for a similar experience and/or got shafted by Towns, this is the game you need to buy. Early Access done right. Weekly Updates, a living forum on the developer website and a caring developer round this package up. Buy it, there is no reason not to, if you like games like this.			"

												Gnomoria is a detailed base-building game in which one pits a tribe of gnomes against evils from the depths of their mines and evils from other, invisible, villages.  Gnomes are able to mine a variety of resources, process them, and manufacture everything from furniture to armor.  They have to sleep, eat, and drink, and they can even become powerful zombies after death, returning later to slaughter any former friends that are caught unaware.It's a fun game with plenty of opportunity for strategy and mayhem.But, here's the thing: this game has been in Early Access forever, updates are slow, bug fixes are slow, and the game is using outdated technology (XNA, which was discontinued by Microsoft in early 2013) that doesn't even support some relatively common desktop features like 1440p resolution.A year ago, I would have said Gnomoria is a hugely promising game and worth buying for double the price, but that's about when the developer slowed down.  A lot.  The game I was playing a year ago is very nearly the same game I could play today, were I to click the Play button again.My advice: hit that ""Follow"" button on the store page, and if Gnomoria ever releases, give it another look.  I certainly will.			"

												I wanted to love this game. I DID love this game. I have series of it on YouTube, I had a lot of viewers on Twitch. This was an amazing game.The game wanted to be Dwarf Fortress with a graphical interface. A great goal, and it very nearly succeeded.Then it became abandonware. The developer released it, saying the game was completed. It was not. At all. It is buggy as hell, and there is absolutely no way to fix it. Combat is horrible, the Gnomes are brain damaged, and endgame is nonexistant. The modding community adds a little bit of flavor to the game, but it is still buggy abandonware. If you're going to abandon your much loved game, at the very least give the community that loves it the ability to fix it for you, okay?Graphics: 4/10. Cute, but 8-bit and jumpy.Music: 8/10. Probably the best part of this game, and highly addictive to listen to.Gameplay: 4/10. Would have been great if it were not for the constant game-breaking bugs.Replayability: 5/10. If you enjoy re-building the same castle over and over again because of game-breaking bugs anyway.Community: 10/10 (single-player only). Highly supportive and helpful community, since the Developer sure doesn't help at all, or even answer anyone.Developer: 0/10. If you're going to 'officially release' a broken game, at the very least give the community that loves it the chance to fix your broken product.			"

								This game is a legendarily crafted sapphire in the rough melded to a platinum ring.  This is the Dwarf Fortress with graphics you have been waiting for.  While it is not as complex, not as unforgiving, it is far easier to get into and get immersed in thanks to a UI that works well.  This game is so fun that I've ditched most of my other games to play it instead, and after several abyssmal failures I finally have a stable kingdom.  The game is still in development, but the developer seems determined to see this through and make it the best game possible.  He typically updates every two weeks, adding things, fixing bugs, balancing values.  He listens and posts on the game's forums, and has implemented a bunch of changes suggested by the community.  The man has earned my faith in him.I cannot overstate how happy I am with this game.  I bought it on sale, but felt so guilty that I got it for cheap that I made my girlfriend buy it as well.  I told her that if she didn't like it, I'd pay her back, and consider it a donation for the development of the game.  Please do yourself a favor and try this if you enjoy management sims, building games, minecraft, or ant farms.  At the price it's sold at, it's a steal if you love it, and small loss if you don't.

												The first hundred hours of gameplay was spent mostly trying to determine if I really loved this game or not.The second hundred hours was spent mostly trying to figure out the most extream form of combat goblins were capable of (my personal favorite was watching them pick up fallen limbs/heads and using them as weapons... although that goblin who brained three of my gnomes after picking up a door was also quite amusing... and somewhat sad).At 600+ hours I still find those 'whoa' moments.  That alone should say something.This game, like many others have said, is a dwarf fortress clone.  But unlike that game you don't need to feel like you are looking at the matrix to be able to play it.  The developer has taken the time to create simple yet fairly good graphics (considering the fact he's basically doing this by himself) that quickly gives you an idea of the state of the world as it exsists.  No two games are really alike due to random happenstance, layout of the world, invasions by annoying goblins and mants, etc.  Difficulty can be changed at the start, so toying with the options will quickly create either amazingly simple worlds you can craft to your hearts content... to war torn worlds where your gnomes will likely be missing body parts in a matter of days.There are some physics in this game, mostly dealing with water.  There are alot of worries in this game, mostly dealing with food and safety.Standard pros and cons:Pros:You get to build a gnome city/village/fortress/slave labor campSaid gnomes are independant but will take ques from youCombat is entertaining to read, especially when limbs start flyingSwords and guns.  Steampunk at it's bestYou can build epic wonderlike structuresYour gnomes can starve if you are overzealous with expansionYou have to actually care about placement of structuresYou can make pet rocksDiplomacy was added recently to add some options to irritate your neighborsIs somewhat modable, mostly just graphically at the time beingConsNot as advanced as dwarf fortressNo sickness/diseases to combatNo magic systemNo cannibalismNo annoying elves to get to chop upNo vehiclesNo animations (once again, one man show here so give him a break)No moral system as of yetBasically if you like the idea of Dwarf Fortress but can't stand looking at ascii all day, gnomoria is definitely the way to go.  It's easy on the eyes, easy to figure out (if nothing else go on the web page and look up a basic tutorial, lots of them exsist and all you really need to know is the standard build order to get you going, the rest is there just for you to learn on your own and die alot.  Alot.)This is the kind of game I wish exsisted back in the 80s-90s when I was in school.  Me and my friends used to imagine building forts/castles with various creatures and defending them from hordes of annoying goblins and the like.  In this case, it's not on paper, it's a living breathing world where you hope that your gnomes armor isn't going to break when that ogre swings at him, seeing as he's your best builder.It's worth your time.

I FINALLY UNDERSTAND THIS GAME!Took me 3 tries to understand the whole thing, it should take just one for people that doesnt distracts so easily.it will take you 3 times too, dont lie to yourselfcheck steam guides with more images than textIts awesome, you get a group of mentally challenged gnomes and you have to guide them to victory and keep them away from dangers (those dangers include themselves in most of the cases).You can mine, build, fight, farm, yell at your idle gnomes(this will become your usual activity), laugh at occasional catastrophes involving your own stupid gnomes getting trapped in walls or floor and trade one alpaca for 500 strawberry seeds with near kingdoms!Theres some weird mechanics thing that havent tried yet but looks awesome some kind of electric stuff with power and traps. And you can customize almost everything. Dont like that the woodchoppers go around picking dirt from the floor and stocking it elsewhere? Well then just uncheck hauling from their job list. Need someone to go around picking the stuff all your stupid gnomes left on the floor? Create a Janitor job!I stopped playing Dota 2 for 2 whole days for this, my friends hate me and this game nowRecommended 10/10			"

								Of all of the Dwarf Fortress inspired games, Gnomoria is without question the farthest along. It manages to bring much of what I loved from DF to a sensible, usable, but still powerful user interface, along with having a unique flavor of its own. in particular, this game has the best crafting system of any builder that I've ever seen, combining flexibility and ease-of-use.The developer is extremely professional; every bug I have reported has been fixed within a week or two, and he frequently implements awesome suggestions from the forums when they agree with his vision of the game.If you are not coming from a DF/city builder roguelike background, expect a steep learning curve. Well worth it in my opinion, that is not to say that the game is extremely challenging, in default difficulty the world is forgiving enough that you can probably get by.The early and mid-game are extremely interesting and fun, but unfortunately late game variety is limited to training yet more powerful soldiers to curb stomp goblins, mining ore to train your blacksmiths and then smelting it down for better quality weapons, and building giant temples or awesome structures. While this is enjoyable, I do feel like a late game should be fleshed out. Given the developer's track record however, I have every confidence this will occur. I don't know how he will do it, but I do know it will be awesome.Easily worth $20 in current form, $7.99 is a steal.			"

								It's our second winter. Mel was torn apart by a goblin horde before we could arrive to help, Garth lost an eye and poor Karragan is now a cripple. Mants are raiding our farms and our last Yak had to be butchered for food to make it through the winter. To make matters worse the new gnomad I set to smiths hall has been making ingots for 4 days and has produced only 1. Perhaps I should return Mel to the smith's post... o wait, his face was chewed off and his corpse is starting to bloat...On a good note we have nearly 80 kegs of beer and the Ambassador loved the statue I placed in his guest room, so I guess things are looking up. Nope, spoke to soon, a skeleton just slaughtered all three of my miners. 10/10 really fun game.			"

								As a DF veteran and long-term fan I really liked this game. Especially UI that is a lot better and easier to navigate than DF one. Graphics is also nicer (if only DF had this it could be a lot more enjoyable for casuals and newbies ).Gnomoria lacks content  and you get bored pretty fast, it gets update's very often but still DF is years ahead of Gnomoria's content.  So that means at this rate Gnomoria will never catch up to Dwarf Fortress.Also this 	 game is very easy , sieges are boring and monsters level up as you progress and get more wealth.  I don't feel any threat, its only hard in the beginning later when you get your gnomes a decent gear and experience nothing will stop you.Meanwhile in DF ; you get werebeats, undeads, necromancers, vampires, megabeasts and you get also a threat from the inside like tantrums or a lot more surprises.Also you can't tame or capture monsters in this game. Really Gnomoria? Why I can't capture the mantis, train him and use him against neverending goblin waves? Or capture goblins and use them as a live targets for my beginning marksgnomes?Don't forget its an early access game  but it stable and enjoyable so far. It just needs something more to keep you playing Maybe mods and workshop feature will fix it in the future.Definitely	 worth a try	 . But remember its a Dwarf Fortress without a balls.			"

								UPDATE 11 - 13-2015As a resource-management / society building game, Gnomoria covers all the basics.  Basic tools, basic foods, basic livestock, basic weapons, basic combat.  It does basic very well.  What innovations it has that sets it apart and above some of the other games of its genre is how it presents itself.As a small collective of 6 Gnomes settling the hilly (or flat) wilds of Gnomoria, you are allowed to destroy and build as you please.  The ground can be dug up and used to build homes or sifted to find rare metals to make weapons or gems to make jewelry.  Cotten can be grown in farm plots to make bandages, bags or armour or the fields can be used to grow food.  How your Gnomes live and work is up to you.Initially, you are left to yourself, but eventually you will have to deal with Goblins, skeletons and other beasts bent on your destruction.  Build up your defensives and research new tools, like guns and steam-engines, to protect your Gnomes.Though well-balanced and well-coded, there are some things missing.  For example:1.) If your livestock gets hurt, you cannot heal them and if all your livestock die, you must establish a trade route with a neighboring kingdom to buy new livestock2.)  Livestock is also the only reliable way to get meat and leather, as there is no hunting of wildlife in the game.3.)  The only way your population can grow is through Gnomads, who will only come to your city if material worth of your city is high enough to merit a migration.4.)  Determining what job your new Gnome is best suited to perform requires you to scroll through their entire talent list.5.)  Distant kingdoms only exist as text on a menu screen and visiting diplomats don't do anything but wander around (and in my case, get killed by bears)6.)  Trying to do anything more complicated than ""All units kill this thing"" makes the game look at you funny.But, these are minor considering the price and the over-all feel of the game.  For $8, it is a decent but basic game.  The creator hopes to have the game released as ""complete"" by the end of the year and raise the price to $14.99 and in that case I would ask for, at the barest minimum, the option to bred your Gnomes to increase the population and a way to heal my livestock after a goblin raider has tried to carve its buttocks off.--------------------------------------------------Originl PostFAIR WARNING!!!!As of October 6th, 2015, the creator has removed the game's development plan from the website.  He is only focusing on optimizing the game as it is right now, fixing bugs, and on improving mod-support.  He is NOT going to add any new features or content.  New content MAY be added after the game is released, which he is hoping to do by the end of the year, at which time the price will go up to $14.99, but he has said the best place to find new content is from the community.The game is fun, I will not deny it, it is both challenging and creative, but it is not complete.  It is missing content and the creator seems content letting the community finish his game for him.  Now, maybe he has a job and this is just his hobby or he realized his original plan was just too ambitious for him to do alone; maybe he has a good reason to turn the reigns over to the community.  But as someone who cannot create mods and whose computer automatically deletes them because of some security setting I don't know how to disable, being told I finish the game myself using mods is like being told to write the ending of the book I am reading.Again, this is all the game you are going to get.  So, if you have been wanting it, get it for the reduced price.  As it is, this game is NOT worth $14.99			"

								Been playing this before it even got on steam, if you like a village building survival(sort-of) sandbox game then this is for you. Now it is a early access and has been updating every now and then thus there will be bugs or kinks in the game, but from all the times I have played I haven't ran into any yet. The game has a fully destructible environment where you can break down anything and build it somewhere else if you wanted and there a ton of crafting items as well as all kinds of building material. But depending on your difficulty level you will run into dangers, from honey badgers to goblins. If you are still interested then get it and start telling your Gnomes how you want your kingdom built.			"

								A really simple yet fantastic micro-management game. Despite being in Early Access the game still has an abundance of features, fantastic gameplay and i've encountered no bugs (which may or may not be just my luck).The game focuses on micromanagement in its purest form, just like older games such as Dwarf Fortress and Theme Hospital and manages to keep you entertained continuously rather than it becoming tiresome quickly like some sim/micro management games can.The game is regularly updated (once a month) and brings new things to the game to keep it fresh.At this price it's worth every single penny, and even if you don't want to pay full price, make sure you grab it on sale. You won't regret it.I look forward to seeing the final product.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a simplified version of Dwarf Fortress. As a DF fan, I decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed. It's far more streamlined than DF, such as having fewer animals to herd, fewer types of soil, fewer types of stone, etc, yet there is beauty in this simplification, as it significantly decreases the learning curve. Gnomes are also much easier to manage, and can be done without a third party application (i.e. Dwarf Therapist). Some skills have been combined into one skill (such as masonry and stone crafting), which helps to make the game easier to play. No longer does every aspect of a job need be managed (such as which particular type of material does the dwarf haul), but with Gnomoria gnomes can simply be told to haul. You are also given several professions to start with, which work well. The game also relies far less on the keyboard, and more on a mouse, which is a great feature. It's also easier to decide which material is used to create an item. The simplification, however, does go a bit too far sometimes. Many skills are simply taken out, such as fishing and hunting. This makes it so that meat must be acquired through ranching, by killing the occasional animal that appears with military troops, or by butchering goblins. Also pets have been taken out of the game. Apart from animals, trading has also been too simplified. Gnomes may now only trade with other gnomes, and the player is initially only able to trade with one other settlement. Others may be unlocked, but it takes years to do so. The other gnome settlements are given types, such as agricultural, which makes some variety, but it still feels lackluster in comparison to the difference between dwarves, humans, and elves in DF. Also, biomes are gone. Instead of being able to choose which type of area you settle in (which can lead to big differences in DF playthroughs), gnomoria has the player settle in the same type of area every time, which has the exact same plant and animal life. Water also needs serious overhaul, and the developers need to decide to make its physics easier to manipulate and give it more purpose, or be simply used as a potential hazard. Lastly, there is still a learning curve in this game, as the developers give no form of tutorial. Players must instead watch Let's Play videos to learn how to play the game.While the game does have drawbacks (most notably DF is free to play while this isn't) it is still a great game. The game is still not in it's final version, and some problems may be addressed before it's released. The difficulty is still here, a player should expect to fail totally several times before they begin to understand what they're doing, but it's a much, much easier game to learn to play than DF, while still offering the enjoyment. Anybody who likes city builders, particularly the Dwarf Fortress-like sub-genre, should add this game to their library.			"

The Game has been AbandonedGame breaking bugsNo instructionsBad controlsBasic features missing after ""release""I really wanted this game to work, I put a lot of hours into it hoping it would turn out great, now it's been released with none of the major bugs fixed.  Wheelbarrows don't work, gnomes will pass an unused wheelbarrow hundreds of times that I carefully placed between the Item they're picking up and the stockpile they're taking it to.  Goblins can't find the door to my settlement so they bring tunnelers, this would be more of a problem, but they can't seem to find the tunnels they dig either.  When goblins can get in you're screwed, soldiers won't pick up or wear armor even though I told them to retreat to get armor, gnomes like to attack one at a time and fan out instead of all attacking the same target like I selected.  Production will stop waiting for applewood logs, despite specifically telling the workshop to build it with pine boards instead of applewood boards, my sawmills are set to only make pine boards because I don't have apple logs; but the game has decided it wants applewood so I have to delete and re-enter my instructions and hope.  Workshop build queues are a suggestion instead of a rule, it doesn't matter that I have sticks and coal and have torches on the top of the queue, the workshop decided now was the time to make a barrel out of applewood because the last thing in my queue was pint barrels.There are zero instructions within the game.  You have to go to a wiki that's security certificate has been expired for three months.  Then the info there is often out of date.  The guides on the internet by other players are all old from non-relevant versions of the game.You can navigate three menus deep or use a shortcut to the exact thing you want.  If you're in the build menu you can't go to the mining menu, you have to go all the way out and then all the way back in.  You can setup hotkeys for things like ""mine wall"" or ""dig ramp down"", but if you want to ""dig hole"" or ""dig ramp up"" or ""dig stairs down"" you would have to have a separate hotkey for each of those commands.  You can't go to the dig up commands or the dig down commands you have to go through the hole menu again.  There are three dig up commands and three dig down commands, but these are on different menu bars despite there being enough space on one bar.  You can't mine more than one level at a time, if you want to make a mine shaft 10 layers down, you have to manually dig on each layer and hope they line up, otherwise a section of your shaft is now one square off.  You should be able to click and drag on more than one layer.You can't copy professions or their task priority, if I want to make a mason that's exactly like a miner except he does workshop tasks before mining you have to re-make the entire profession from scratch and hope you get it right.  You can make a new profession in the character menu, but then you can't give that new named profession to anyone else, you would have to re-created it in the correct profession menu.The game is out, but we still need immigrant gnomes, no new gnomes can be made in your kingdom you just have to hope you get enough new gnomes to cover from your last goblin attack.  No baby gnomes.  No copy and paste, Gnomes still ignore dirt piles while putting seeds in my stockpiles to just let dirt golems spawn.  The problem isn't just that you don't have any control, but that the game gives you options to imply the illusion on some kind of control.  I know you can't control the Gnomes directly but I said to pick up dirt piles and ignore those seeds!!!			"

												This is your FAIR WARNINGI LOVE(D) this game. It had great promise, a solid plan, and was the fortress builder of my dreams. Now, it goes in the same bin as Towns, another building game that will never be finished.Upon full release,  content promised upon EA purchase, and content the game still sorely needs,  was cut out because the developer simply didn't want to work on it anymore. As a result, new features and support are expected to be added by the community. In short, this game is now MODware, and even the origianl Modders didn't stick around for long because there isn't much about the game that's modable aside from the appearence of items, resource requirements, and growth timers.Let me be perfectly clear about this, as many continue to attack me over the issue. You WILL NOT realize how incomplete the game is until you have played for several hours, at least. Much of the incomplete content and game balancing issues rear thier ugly head only after you have played for around 4-8 game years. Those years generally take around 2+ hrs each depending on how meticulous you are with building and how grand your designs. I cannot be more honest in telling you that the game becomes an absolute bore as a result, even to the point it effects your later playthroughs, because you realize there is just so little to look foward to.People have asked for a list of Pros and Cons so I made one.PROS:- Closest thing to Dwarf Fortress on the market- A solid early game balance that's fresh every time.- Excellent building customizeability that's sadly rare in many DF clones- A solid (if simple) in game economy that requires all of your gnomes working together in order to progress.- A cusomizeable military- A gadget research path that allows the use of advanced player made mechanisms, ranged weapons, simple and complex traps systems, and automoton population replacements.CONS:- Closest thing to Dwarf Fortress, still far from it in terms of depth and gameplay- Late game is incredibaly boring due to balance issues and stale enemies.- Enemies are easy to manipulate. Even on harder difficulties it is easy to control how many and how much they attack you.- Enemies have no ranged attacks, making gnome ranged weapons OP, especially from behind walls or on cliffs- Enemy and gnome AI is very basic. Enemies will never try to avoid trapped entrances or find another way into your fort.-The military customization becomes pointless in late game. Many perks and traits are just not worth taking, or are for a game with considerably more advanced enemies (heres a missing content hint). Eventually evey melee gnome will simply have plate armor. There's just no reason to do otherwise.- Combat gnome training becomes rediculous to the point your soldiers become combat gods. Goblins, mants, and skeletons become limbed in seconds and the only way the enemies remain a threat is if you intentionally overwhelm yourself or your army decides to sleep through the attack.  - Farming options are INCREDIBLY limited. You have 3 types of livestock. 2 types of fruit trees. 2 ground fruits, Cotton, Wheat, and underground mushrooms. If you want to build underground, your stuck with just mushrooms.- Music becomes very repetitive for this type of game. You'll eventually mute it and play something else. Unfortuneatly, goblin warnings are tied to the music, so preventing yourself from going crazy gimps you. Not that it matters after a few playthroughs.- Building is virtually limitless but the blocks used to decorate it are incredibally limited. Again, this is more of a veteran issue and some may have no issues with it at all. Also solvable with mods.- The gadget research is also limited. You learn everything there is to know in about 2 to 3 yrs of in game time, with just one researcher.- Heres one many don't know about, but as a deep dweller I'll tell you. The bottom 2/3 of the map is ALWAYS the same. Every playthrough I've had has had the same layout of rock formations at level 50, the place I started building kingdoms after getting bored with how easy the surface is. THIS GAME IS NOT TRULY ROUGELIKETLDR: The game is missing content such as diplomacy, enemies, and building/farming options, that are required to keep one's interest beyond the first two or three playthroughs. Even after release, I just couldn't get back into the game given how dull I knew it would become. Some of the game breaking bugs have been ironed out, but I just can't play it long enough to test all of them, so I'll assume the game is considerably less buggy than it used to be. Again, the developer abandoned his project before release. This is now MODware. Whether its worth the $15 or not is up to you, but I can't in all honesty reccomend a game I know is incomplete.			"

Early Access Review
								By far the game I've played the most the last decade! And it's great!Other than appearance of a gnome without armor, you can customize everything about a gnome, even its name. Want a Miner to tend to the Farm when no stone-working is needed? Sure thing! Want the warriors to do menial Hauling after training for half a day? You bet. Want a guy who does nothing but slouch around all day? That too!Crafting stations can also be assigned to a specific gnome, so no other gnomes will take jobs from him. Great if you want to train a single gnome in a job. Gnomes need water and food though, else they die. Make sure those jobs are a priority.Gnomes can also be given default uniforms, which means any armor and weapon you want. You can design a military formation with ranged and melee gnomes, which has their own custom uniform as well, even the quality grade can be set, keeping the best armors and weapon for your best gnomes.There are Position Perks which give you bonuses to almost whatever you want, and there is synergy between perks. You can set one position to Knock Em Down, which will result in more knockdowns, and another position can have Finish Him, which does more damage to knocked down enemies. Ranged units can be set to aim for the eyes, making it easier for your melee units. Having at least some diversity is important, and that counts for weapons as well! Enemies are stronger and weaker against certain weapon types.Lastly, putting gnomes in a squad will allow much, much greater control over them, and a squad can be given a Perk as well, which becomes more powerful the more gnomes are in the squad.Lastly, a gnome have skills in every weapon and every profession, but they need to be trained. Your starting gnomes start off with good skills in their profession, making the beginning a bit easier, but nomadic gnomes who want to join you have random skills. If you want someone to be really god at a specific thing, you need to train her by setting her to train or work as often as possible. Don't allow your gnomes to idle! Personally I take it slow, and just build stuff. I really like the building aspect of the game. Gnomes just chop down, mine ore or stone, and you can use these to build block walls, effectively allowing you to create your ideal fortress or any other building you want. There is a huge variety of trees, farmables, stone types and ores as well. And everythinghas value of different kinds. A Gold sword will be worse than a Steel sword for instance, but will sell for more. That's right! There are merchants who can visit from time to time!There are so many, many, many more layers to Gnomoria, so I recommend going to the steam community and read some while you play. The controls become very easy after a while, so study them a little to avoid annoyances. There is also a gnomoria wiki online with valuable information. Also, watch some videos on youtube; some of the castles and creations are really good.9/10 would read bloody combat log again!			"

												You know, it really sucks this game turned out to be abandonware, because honestly for me it was the most promising dwarf fortress clone out there, with even more potential than really solid games in the genre like Rim World and Stonehearth.  This game was the closest to dwarf fortress out of all them, it was like playing a dwarf fortress-lite with a proper visual representation.Unfortunately the game is just bugged to all hell which makes any playthrough just get to point of weirdness where there's really no point to continue playing.  That's pretty much the story here.  Yet another early access title that took the money and ran.  Tons of potential wasted.I sincerely wish they would ban early access from steam.  It has NOT improved the gaming industry, 95% of all these early access titles are ending up this way.  Meanwhile games like Stardew Valley never go through early access and get released in absolutely stellar shape - AND EVEN GET more content added afterward than any of these early access titles add to their games.  Early access is just an enabler for shitiness, plain and simple.  You can probably count on one hadn the actual success stories from a gamer's perspective that early access has brought about.  The main thing EA has done for the gaming industry is ensured an easy road for developers to take instead of pushing them to actually release proper games.			"

Early Access Review
								You can literally play for 2000 hours (yes 2000) hours of this game, over a year and a half, and not get bored of it.  It's that good.  You can create limitless amounts of new kingdoms with each new game, set difficulties, peaceful or not, metal/gem/coal resource abundance etc.  There is much more than meets the eye of simple gfx and sound.  After a while you figure out that if you want to build a stone temple, you have to dig a hole down and get stone, turn it into stone blocks (with workshops for each type of thing) and craft the blocks and tell the gnomes where to build.  It's total freedom but with that comes the complexity of running your own little kingdom.  Are you up to the challenge?  It's like simcity or warcraft meets minecraft.  For those that don't like FPS games or need a break from them, this is a great break.  Actually... it is more like a black hole from which you won't want to escape.  It is that fun.  Oh, and development is constant.  No fears as with some in-development games... the dev is at the ready and giving many new features on a consistent basis.  Don't starve, die of thirst, or get killed by bears, or anything that spawns below level -7 (that is where monsters can spawn, at level -8 and below).  Monsters also spawn on the surface but they are usually wild animals only.  Occasionally, depending on difficulty you get goblin raids (not too rough at first, again depends on your settings), but after a while they can get pretty tough.  You will have to grow your own food, or forage from the naturally occuring fruit trees, or clip and plant some more of your own to make sure you always have plenty of spare food.  Performance, for most this won't be an issue, though this game is entirely cpu-dependant ghz-wise.  SINGLE COREAny relatively recent CPU will run this game on anything up to including a medium sized map, but for those that want to build on large or huge maps with many gnomes (40-50+) and mine deep, a pentium-anniversary edition OC'ed,  i5k or i7k cpu is recommended.   At 4.2ghz on an AMD FX will run a small or a medium kingdom up to 60 gnomes.  On a 4.6ghz i7 4790k cpu a large and huge sized map will run well with the same amount of gnomes at a better frame rate.  Older cpu's such as Athlon II's will incur stutter a bit when mining deeply (past -50 or -60 deep) when you have.  A newer i5/i7 overclocked past 4.4ghz will pretty much let you build anything without too much framerate lagging associated with mature kingdoms.  Don't let all my talk about performance scare you away, but this game is so awesome, you might just want to upgrade your computer if it's a few years old just to build more :)  A fancy video card won't do you much justice with this game so if you video card isn't too recent don't worry a bit.  Just give this game a shot.  In it's current state, it rarely to almost never crashes, and with autosaves, you wouldn't lose much progress even if it did.  It is feature-complete enough to surpass most other early-access (and some fully released) games.  This game, at it's price, is an absolute steal.  The community on steam discussion forums here is very helpful if you have a question to ask or some hurdle you cannot overcome (expect to lose once or twice, or three times even when you first play, this is how you learn!).  For those wanting to build more above ground instead of living in a hole in the ground I personally have made a simple gfx mod that adds windows to some of the game textures, you can look it up in the steam discussion forums under 'mods' for this game.  Visit http://www.gnomoriawiki.com/ for help with various ambiguous parts of the game, and see youtube.com for some (RECENT!) let's play videos.  RECENT being the key.  You want something from spring 2014 or newer since this pre-release game is still-a-changing.  A demo of this game is available.THIS GAME HAS NO BUILT IN TUTORIAL.  EXPECT TO DO SOME READING ON THE WIKI (or on steam discussion forums) FOR HELP.  I have been playing this game for almost 18 months, it's a vortex that sucks you in like no other, and if you need a game that you can just quick walk away from (to tend to the pets, or your kids, or do the wash) then this is the kind of game for you, things will still be (usually) where you left them.New features added just this past month include AUTOMATONS!  Yes!  Gnome-cyborg-robot things that do the work for you!  Prosthetic Limbs can now mend limpy gnomes back into action again.  Did the goblins attack your kingdom and now you're angry and want to throw a stone back at them?  Do one better, have one of your gnomes hand-deliver 1000 Goblin-meat Sandwiches to the Goblin kingdom and watch the mayhem ensue!Build a mud temple that Adam Ant would long to live in, a Stone temple or pyramid reminiscent of civilizations of yesteryear.   ... or just a bunch of red brick townhomes that look like a gov't housing project!  It's all up to YOU!Combat is handled in the beginning with sticks, stones, logs, soon onto swords of various materials (yes, material each has different strenth), bronze, iron, and steel being the best options.  Research can be done via Tinkering at a specific workshop to research various new technologies.  Just a few are ranged weapons (bow and arrow, blunderbuss, pistol), prosthetic limbs, traps of various types, power-plant type devices to power mechanical walls, and now automatons.You can (after researching) even build pumps to move water, make water, or move LAVA and make a volcanic eruption!Water+Lava=Obsidian, a very very tough stone.Basically, the skinny on all of this is, no matter what you want to build, if you like a game where the goal is only to survive and the rest is up to you, this is totally it.  You are limited only by your brain, and ability to cope with situations that arise.  A little bit of simcity, a little bit of warcraft (1 and 2), a whole lot of inspiration (admittedly so) from Dwarf Fortress... and new features all the time.  After you spend a few dozen hours figuring things out and getting yourself adjusted to this game, to peruse the discussion forums for cool kingdom seeds and figure out how to use the custom-map-generator in the game,  With the right digits and a bit of trial and error you can have a map that's 40-50% water and easily surround your kingdom with a moat... or dig enough small holes on any map and eventually they'll fill with rain water and you can make it that way.  This is what makes Gnomoria so fun...there is just so much to it.  So deceptively simple, yet so deep.  The combinations are endless.  Smart Kings can also make their kingdoms self-sufficient to a point, or just wall in for total safety and stand atop the kingdom walls to watch the wild animals beat each other up.  Either way, give it a shot, it's only a few bucks and what's a few bucks for what may very well be thousands of hours of fun.			"

												Once upon a time, there was a game called Dwarf Fortress. It was a magical game that spawned infinite stories for those willing to read its tea leaves of finely-detailed content, from the most epic slaughter by rampaging elephants down to the tiniest thoughts and details of its dwarven citizenry.And the masses looked upon Dwarf Fortress and said, wow, these stories are fantastic but are you really going to make me learn hotkey controls to use this mess of a UI? And you can't see a hill except as a series of layers of dirt?And so many, emboldened by the newly-released Steam Greenlight and Steam Early Access, took it upon themselves to remake Dwarf Fortress in their image. Some of these early attempts died on the vine, like Towns and Spacebase DF-9. Gnomoria is the most long-lived of these early re-imaginings, releasing to 1.0 status after three years of early access. Instead of dwarves, it's gnomes, and instead of ASCII and tiles, it's 3D isometric graphics, and instead of a hotkey-driven UI, it's a graphical mouse-driven UI.And Gnomoria, in many ways, delivered on its promise of being ""Dwarf Fortress, but properly 3D."" Players create a colony, dig underground (but not too deep or too greedily), create an economy piece-by-piece, and defend themselves from unruly neighbors.However, time has moved on, but Gnomoria hasn't. Gnomoria's feature list at its 1.0 release in 2016 is still nearly identical to Dwarf Fortress circa 2013, without nearly so much of the flavor that attracts so many to Dwarf Fortress. And more games have come along that evoke the magic of Dwarf Fortress without resorting to mimicry - Rimworld for small-colony storytelling, Factorio for intense production optimization. And even Dwarf Fortress itself continues to evolve and outpace Gnomoria, not only through the development of its core gameplay, but also the development of mods like Stonesense (isometric 3D, like Gnomoria) and Armok Vision (fully 3D visualization).As a game releasing to early access in 2013, Gnomoria made sense. As a game up for purchase in 2017, Gnomoria no longer makes sense except for those interested in the history and design of Dwarf Fortress and the games surrounding it.			"

												This game's AI is some of the worst I've ever seen. Constantly building walls closest to them, and then blocking themselves in with that wall until they starve to death. Carrying 63/64 blocks of stone in a wheelbarrow and would rather walk past the stockpile to get 1 apple the other side of the map to fill it up first. THEN he decides ""I'm tired"" drops his stuff all over the floor and then comes back... WHILST HE WAS ON HIS WAY BACK ANYWAY. My gnomes then go out to clean up his mess, and no-one uses his wheelbarrow. They pick it up one at a time...BLEEDING GNOMES who are dying would rather bandage a sprained ankle than stop the bleeding. 3 bandages used and my gnome sill died...Digging, a major part in this game, is something you have to manage constantly! You can't leave the gnomes to do it themselves because they can't do it right. Telling them to dig a square out of the ground, they end up going for the closest line, which cuts off access to the rest. Or worse, they trap themselves in the middle, stuck on a single block.Bandages are insanely important in this game where gnomes hurt themselves daily just trying to eat and drink or sleep. Don't even bother having one try to fight a wild animals for food, because you'll lose 4 gnomes trying. Except, you HAVE to kill wild animals to get bones, which you need to make needles, to make bandages...This game is like babysitting 9 children that live in a knife factory. It's not fun. Basic tasks are like trials. Everything has to be micro managed. In a game where you have no control over your gnomes, it needs you to control them, constantly. This game needs to either have it's play style overhauled totally, or they need to hire a programmer who's not lazy to fix the AI.I wanted this to be the Dwarf Fortress with a decent UI that it claimed to be. It failed horribly. The UI is staggeringly basic and makes me think back to the days of Windows 98. Menus and submenus in awkward places with unhelpful icons. The one thing this game is meant to be better at than Dwarf Fortress, and it's awful. Seriously, for a game I PAID for, I was expecting more. DF is 100 times better. Gnomoria is nothing more than a cashgrab aabusing the pupularity of DF.If you want a decent DF style game with graphics, I suggest RimWorld. It went for a scifi theme probably to avoid copy-pasting from DF, but keeps that gameplay. Focused more on a small colony and survival, it's different, but is fun for the same reasons. It's still in Alpha, but has a thriving mod community and hard working programmers.----Another playthrough later:5 months ago this game left early access, implying it was finished. This game as it is, is how they think it should be. I'd be more understanding if it was still a beta.I gave the game another go today and found a gnome sitting at the bakery, I guess trying to pick up some bread? Only they couldnt, their wheelbarrow was full, so they just got stuck. Until finally getting too tired and dropping all 30 items on the floor. Which disables a workshop...I've also noticed in combat that no-one has any health. The only way to kill an enemy is to make it bleed out. Even after injuring every single limb on an enemy, my gnomes will keep whacking away at it pointlessly. Sometimes even bleeding to death themselves before the enemy does. This lack of HP is why I just had my 15 dwarves killed by 4 beetles. Goblins are easy, but beetles which give no loot are as unkillable as any wild animal. The combat is simply broken.I just still can't get over the fact this is called a finished game. I played it again just now because I thought I was being too harsh. And I'll probably do the same thing a month or two from now. Only to keep proving I wasn't being harsh enough.			"

Early Access Review
								A fantastic sandbox village management. It might not be as good/complex as Dwarf Fortress, but it's cleaner, it's beautiful, it's simple, it's a very loyal ""copy"" overall, except with a friendly UI. As for artwork, it depends on you, how much you like retro-styled art, it certainly pleases me ... I fell in love with that game, and it's only early alpha.Basically you ""kinda"" take control of very loyal dwarves and you have to do everything in order to keep your dwarves alive, since getting food and drink to defend them from goblin attacks.It's not that sort of game that you drag a selection area and command the selected units to build something: no! Your dwarves act for their own, you may change their job, but they do the rest by themselves.Oh it does feel and look good building shelters inside the mountains, with levels fulfilled of goods... there are no possible words to describe it, that is so beautiful and so pure.Pros:- Excellent mechanics- Friendly ui- Simple and Clean- Few games of its genre (besides Dwarf Fortress, we have Towns, Castle Story and dungeonkeeper right?)- Pretty colorful- Stunning artworkCons- Lacks tutorial, you've to spend some time watching/reading tutorials/guides- Alpha (?) is that a con?- It's not Dwarf FortressPersonal rate: 9.7/10			"

								If you like dwarf fortress, and always said to yourself ""gee, this sure is fun, but I'd rather suffer a tantrum spiral than deal with this interface,"" buy this. Also, if you have a weird fascination with decorating things EXACTLY how you like and ""no I want the chairs blue and wooden and the table stone and red in my room shaped like a cactus,"" buy this game. Unfortunately, it's just not as deep or ambitious as dwarf fortress, so there is potential for dissapointment there.If only we could get the developer of gnomoria and the developer of dwarf fortress trapped in an elavator, or force them to work together at gunpoint, they could make the perfect DF-thingy.

												Extremely buggy. Worse than it's ever been. Gnomes regularly fail to path right and starve to death. Gnomes regularly fail to path right and get stuck doing nothing. Pathing in general is atrocious. Gnome AI for stocking items is horrible, they will travel 200 tiles distance to grab a single item, take it 200 tiles to stock it, and repeat, when theres dozens of wheelburrows, buckets, and sacks laying around. The game is playable... up until you get some bug seriously ♥♥♥♥ing you over. And it can ♥♥♥♥ you over massively. Akin to wasting real life days worth of played time. The only way to manage avoiding this is manually going into the save files to make backups because the game wont let you do it from the menu's. There are a ton of other flaws, but I can't really complain about those. Their cosmetic. I could accept the cosmetic / UI issues if the base game itself would at least ♥♥♥♥ing play right, but alas, it doesn't. TL;DR A potentially great game ruined by cripplingly damaging bugs. RIP Gnomoria.			"

												I've been playing this game for over two years. It is a settlement sim, where you create a settlement, design the layout, dig it out or build it up as you prefer, and try not to starve or get slaughtered.Heavily reminiscent of Dwarf Fortress, but far more accessible, you don't actually control any of your gnomes. Instead, you give them jobs (which you can customize), and put orders on the map for gnomes with the appropriate jobs to do. The ability to define the jobs, combat roles, and priorities gives you a lot of control over the behavior and efficiency of your gnomes.Like many similar games it is a balance between expanding your economy and taking care of your defenses. Gnomes that are learning to swing a sword better are not helping you shear sheep, harvest fruit, or brew wine... and if you don't have enough food and drink for you and your livestock to make it through the winter then starting over is pretty likely.The game recently (~8 months ago) added modding support, and already several interesting additions to the game (like Glassworks) have been added. Now that the game is public, more are likely to come.Some downsides:Combat is unsatisfying to watch, and unless you look through the text logs it's hard to tell what happened.Building large structures can be tedious, as you can't order all the steps at once and trust the gnomes to do them in the right order. Having gnomes trap themselves is not uncommon, though relatively recent changes have made it not happen constantly.I bought the game for $9, three and a half years ago, it's gotten vastly better since then. I'd happily pay $15 now, as the game is far more than twice as good as what I originally purchased.			"

												Promising in alpha-beta, sadly ""abandoned"" by the Devs after release with lacking content, bugs and a horrendous and non-intuitive UI. Isn't really worth the full price, pick it up on a sale if you got the money to spare and maybe have some hours of fun.If you like hardcore RPG micromanagement and world building games with a touch of old (REALLY OLD) graphics and menus/interfaces, you'll like this one if you manage to crawl through the bugs. Needs a lot of time to learn to play properly, so I'd recommend using a guide.Not my cup of tea, but maybe yours.			"

								If you've ever heard of or played Dwarf Fortress, this game VERY faithfully recreates it in most aspects. At the time of this review it's not quite as deep as Dwarf Fortress is, but considering DF is 6-10 years old and this is still relatively new, and with how often the Developers seem to update & actually pay attention to this game to make it work unlike alot of other Early Access/Greenlight abusers, your money is well spent if you enjoy this type of game. I'm very eager to see if it can rival DF but with these much nicer(read: any) graphics and a MUCH more User-Friendly interface with full mouse support.			"

												I am a fan of Dwarf Fortress so I purchased this game for $10 a few years back when I first heard about it. And although initially I enjoyed playing Gnomoria it got boring quickly during my second playthrough. There just isn't enough content to keep me interested in playing anymore after 18 hours(a chunk of which being spent AFK), which I felt was disappointing. Even with the excellent mods people are producing for this game, the developer abandoned the project leaving it lacking and unfinished.			"

												ABANDONED!!!!I gave this game a positive, deleted it, negative, deleted it, positive, deleted it, and here we are. I'd really like to give this game a neutral. It's not the greatest, but it's not the worstIt's fun when it works right. Currently it's an unoptimized bug ridden mess that came too soon out of Early Access. The further you go along, that laggier it gets, to the point where you're hitting the keyboard in frustration trying to get it to pause.This is another game that suffers from the 32-bit curse, the bigger the kindom, the more the lag. the more the frustration.The game does have mod support, well, that is when the mods actually load. I've not had much luck in this, only have gotten the mods to load twice in 10 games. I typically end up abandoning games due to 20+ minute loading times or the lag that piles up after about the 8th year. Oh and it only supports one mod per game.There are a lot of behind the scenes that aren't explained anywhere or shown. For instance armor affects your gnomes ability to make items. Depending on the armor is how fast they make items. Or what exactly do automations need? Do they need their own personal quarters? How are they powered? How do the different cores afftect them? And the list goes on and on.If you're wondering, updates comes about every 6 months. In the August 2015 patch, ores was made very scare to the point of not being able to find any. I managed to wait 4 months before I ended up hex editing the terrain file to make more ore. I don't know if this was fixed or not. But at this point I just don't care anymore until the rest of it gets fixed.I currently really can't recommend this game.  I have over 300 hrs play time, but this game gets to a point where it just frustrates the hell out of me and I have to quit it for a few weeks or months. Then I start a new game and it's the same BS again, lag, lag, lag.....			"

								It's like Babby's First Dwarf Fortress, which isn't really saying much considering it's still will-crushing, sprit-murderingly difficult.  Those screenshots there?  Good luck ever attaining a fortress of that size without being murdered by goblins, mants, or golems.However, the Game is fun, in the same way that Dwarf Fortress is, just in a far more accessible package.  Gnomoria is a nicely gift-wrapped box full of fun, as opposed to dwarf fortress's duck-tape tied with ribbon impossible to open gift-box full of fun.Do yourself a favor and buy it while it's on sale!

												Gnomoria is a God complex waiting to happen.  Want to build a little quaint village with windmills and wells? Make the gnomes do it.  Want to build a castle with death traps and stately halls? Make the gnomes do it. Want to build a huge pyramid?  Make the gnomes do it.  Want to mine out entire veins of ore and gems?  Make the gnomes do it.  Train your gnomes in a myiad of jobs by creating professions, or have them train to fight in training grounds.  Create military units even to the level of assigning equipement types and combat strategies. to defeat the aggressive goblins and food stealing mants. Protect your little community from the dangers that lurk in the untamed lands and below them.  Forge legendary sausages and serpentine chisels.  Make every gnome a hero in their own eyes.I have enjoyed this game so much that I spent 888 hours through the steam version during the early access of this game.  I even bought a seperate version to run on my bench machine for validating bugs.  I saw it's guts and grime get washed out by a sole programmer and turn into this polished game of minion management.  If you like minion management games, get this one.  It has a great community around it as a bonus.			"

								First review ever here - Gnomoria is just a game that has inspired me to add my two cents for the first time.Gnomoria is an excellent game.  I'm made several tries at Dwarf Fortress (DF) in the past, and each time I'm just bounced off.  Though Gnomoria lacks some of the intricacy DF is always credited with, its user interface is really quite friendly once you've spent a little time with it, and it puts solid tools at your fingertips for competent Gnoministration.  If you enjoy more personalized, hands-on management games, particularly those with a fantasy setting, I can't Gnomoria strongly enough.  Also, in terms of return on your purchase investment, there are few games out there that can rival its bang-for-the-buck.  I'd also like to tack on a shout-out to the music track for this game - it's extremely pleasant to the ears, and I find it very soothing for those late night Gnoministration sessions.			"

												I have been playing this game off and on for the past two years, and have been loving it, but I'm going to have to delete my positive review and replace it with a negative one.I dont know what *exactly* happened, but this game has become unplayable. It worked fine back when it was in Early Access but, with every patch, a few more crashes were introduced and never resolved, and now, well after the game has been finished, I can scarecely finish the first in-game month without it developing some fatal error that prevents me from continuing, and ruins my save file.Basically, the game will run just fine for at least fifteen minutes, but never more than a couple of hours, before it crashes on me, and when I try to load my save file, it will proceed to crash again a few minutes afterwards *EVERY* time. There is no getting past it... once that first crash happens, too bad, that game is over.The forums and customer support pages are riddled with various fixes and solutions so numerous that trying to go through them all one by one to figure out which one is causing the problem *this* time would be like browsing IMDB completely at random in the hopes of running into that one actor that you kind of remember from when you were a kid, but can never remember his name. It is a joke that this game runs more poorly now than it did when it was still in developement, and since the developers are no longer supporting it, you can safely bet that this is just going to be the state of things from now on.What a shame... this game used to rock, but now it's just a frustrating mess. How can I recommend it, based on how good it *used* to be, when all it does anymore is make me mad?			"

												Normally I don't do reviews but I felt that w/ all the negative reviews since release I should do so. I have 528.5 hours in this game, so I can safely say that I've been through a few releases up to version 1.0. I can't speak for the bugs folks mention, as I have never run into any that were game-breaking myself, but I can say for the folks complaining about lack of tutorial is that it's difficult to write a tutorial for a sandbox game that leaves the details completely up to you. I can recommend you watch youtube videos, there are some excellent let's plays that will teach you the basics. You're also able to turn off enemies if you want to go through the learning steps a few times.Some cons though: Now let's be fair, this doesn't have the complexity of Dwarf Fortress, I don't know if that's possible for any game right just because of what I know about DF. But it doesn't say that it's trying to be a DF clone so that's OK. One other thing is I hope the developer continues to develop the game and add new features, such as more workshops, more armors, more weapons, more traps, etc...right now the game has JUST enough material to justify $15, but I can only say that because I've played it. If I did not play it maybe I could not be convinced to pay that amount, I don't know.All in all I DO recommend this game, if for nothing else but a step towards Dwarf Fortress.			"

								Excellent game. Outside of DF itself, this is the closest anyones come to capturing the essence of Dwarf Fortress.I've had a great time getting my little gnomies to build grandiose structures for my amusement. Its like commanding your own ant colony. Even when you dont have any mega-projects going, its still fun to watch them run around in their daily chores.It also runs very smooth and stable for an Early Access game. The ""meat & potatoes"" of the game itself is all there, & it all works, the game doesnt crash all that much, in fact im not sure if its -ever- crashed on me. The devs are still tossing in new things from time to time and seem very dedicated to their vision for the game. But theres already enough there to have loads of fun with.Highly recommended.			"

								You start with couple of gnomes that do different tasks — some of them are wooductters and miners, while others are builders, farmers and ranchers. You gather resources and start digging, making your own underground base. As I'm huge fan of Terraria, I bought Gnomoria on Steam Sale. And you know what? I don't regret it! It can be unfinished, it may need to be polished, but I like it! Without in-game tutorial it was quite hard to understand how things work and yet I enjoyed thinking what I can do and how. Now, I am able to defend myself from randomly spawning enemies, make huge caves and nice looking houses. If you're looking for something similar to Terraria but with managing people — get Gnomoria ASAP. You won't be disappointed!			"

												First review I've written, but I must point out that this game is broken as is. I put a lot of time in to this game during early access and was excited to see it go full release. I understand why the mechanic of goblins tunneling was introduced and it is a good idea, however every time goblins tunnel in to my base the game crashes. I've had to quit playing altogether because this is just too frustrating to deal with constantly. Twice per season the game crashes and if I forget to save I can lose a couple hours of progress. If this gets fixed, I'll pick the game back up and change my recommendation, but until then, I'm done.			"

												Got it for $7 years ago It could have been worth it but as others have said many gamebreaking bugs still exist and have for a long time and are most likely never going to be fixed. Don't click on what I assume is a tunnel made by the goblins it will crash your game.... You'd think it wouldnt be that hard to make a couple of lines of code that either displays a box that says goblin tunnel or something instead of crashing your game. Also I don't know if it was ever fixed and dont feel like playing for 20 more hours to see if it happens again but as of .97 there was still a bug where your world would randomly flood the entire map all the way up to the tallest mountain and never go down ending your game. DO NOT PAY $15 FOR THIS.... maybe 5 or less if your ok with a bad UI poorly designed AI and a buggy crashy game.			"

												This game was fun and exciting for a while, until I grew frustrated with the countless amount of bugs. As a colorful and user friendly clone of Dwarf Fortress, this was very promising. However, I would like to stress out that I would never be playing this game again. Incidentally, my plan was to wait until the game gets updated with the latest bug fixes from the one and only dev before playing it back. That will never happen anymore because the dev disappeared into the aether.Yes, the dev literally disappeared. No updates whatsoever after the last hotfixes for v1.0 was done. Last time I noticed activity from him, it was when he deleted his reddit account this June (or July, I forgot). That was the time I lost hope for the game.Yet still, this game gave me loads of fun, for the time being. So this is what I think of the game:Likes:A simpler, less complex isometric clone of Dwarf Fortress.User friendly UIAmusing combat logFantastic pixel graphicsDislikes:Buggy AI pathing, especially in buildingSeasons look the same (4 seasons mod no longer works)Lack of updatesCountless other bugs that I won't enumerate hereThis game is far from finished. Don't be fooled by the version. That was the dev's technique of Houdini-ing his way off the stage without getting that much negative impact. It was a clever ploy to not break his promise of not leaving the game until it's release. The modding feature does not help with the bugs either.Conclusion is that I don't recommend buying it. If you want to see what the game is like, you're better off watching some YouTube videos. This game belongs to the same pile as Towns and Spacebase DF-9. I have learned my lesson of not trusting devs who make building crafting management games until they absolutely finish the game. I'm glad I bought this game on sale.			"

The game is addictive and fun, relatively easy to learn, although there is no 'tutorial' to speak of, you soon pick up on what it is you need to do.

								Gnomoria is an interesting game with a dedicated developer. Starting out with a small crew of gnomes and a few necessary sundries your goal is to survive and grow into a thriving community. In a sandbox environment you can build to survive and grow however you want.I feel it has a fairly steep learning curve however not as challenging as many other sandbox style games that are available and the settings allow for a simpler or more challenging playthrough.One of the best features in my oppinion is the seed sharing feature. If you find a map you like or that a friend likes you can keep or share the seed and play that map again and again.Gnomoria is already a good game and is growing better with every update.			"

								What's not to love about Gnomoria? Even in it's early access stage, this game feels very complete. Harvest resources, build your empire and vanquish your enemies. The foundation for a great game. A little imagination and you're there. You'll find yourself becoming attached to your Gnomes, caring genuinely for the welfare of those under your command. You'll start naming things, creating the story yourself, in your head. That's the beauty of sandbox games; the beauty of Gnomoria. One game, infinite possibilities, countless stories. It does take some getting used to. Newcomers may find themselves slightly overwhelmed in the beginning, and the first winter you experience may be less than pleasant. You learn as you play, just like with any other game. This is a game that can bring out the best in a persons imagination. Whether that means you're a brilliant general, creating new strategies to ensure the safety of your people, or a master builder drafting the blueprints to a castle. Gnomoria is the game for you.

Early Access Review
								So the developper's solution for the unfinished state of the game was to implement mod support and let others finish their game for free (they wont). I'll always remember gnomoria as the game that convinced me that early access is a terrible idea.			"

												NOTE: IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED DWARF FORTRESS, THIS REVIEW WILL BE MOSTLY MEANINGLESS.Most of the reviews do not understand this game at all.This game is an almost exact copy of Dwarf Fortress, except with many of the extremely horrible aspects of the UI improved. Any negative review written by someone who doesn't mention Dwarf Fortress in any way should... well, not exactly be ignored, because they really do have a point. It is insanely difficult and frustrating to get into this game. But just know, there is a game called Dwarf Fortress, which has all of Gnomoria's downsides to a much greater extent, and yet is generally agreed to be one of the deepest and most satisfying games ever released for the PC by a surprisingly large dedicated playerbase. If Dwarf Fortress is a good game, then Gnomoria certainly must also be a good game.But if you're a fan of Dwarf Fortress, then you already know what all of the bad reviews are saying. You can bet that if DF got put on steam, it would garner exactly the same hugely negative criticism: impossibly buggy, horrible UI, horrible graphics, brings your computer to its knees in the late-game, etc. Make no mistake: Dwarf Fortress's UI is atrocious. And yet, the game has such incredible depth that it is beloved anyway. Once you become competent at it, though, once you actually understand what you're doing and develop the muscle memory required to drive the UI, the game is magnificent.Well, Gnomoria is essentially the same exact thing, except the learning curve is about half as steep, and the end-game is about half as deep. No pun intended.I started out as a Dwarf Fortress purist, just played Gnomoria a little because it was in the same genre and it seemed decent enough to give a shot. Nowadays, when I go back to Dwarf Fortress, I am *amazed* that I ever thought such a truly awful interface was playable. All of the super aggravating aspects of DF are just gone in Gnomoria. Many of the things in DF you would need external tools for (Dwarf Psychiatrist, autotask, many of the dfterm functions) are included in-game natively. They're far better integrated.Also, much of the unnecessary crap around the edges has been eliminated. Why on earth do you need to generate a whole 1024x1024 world when your fortress, and the absolute boundary of your gameplay experience, will be contained in a single 3x3 square of it? The idea of of generating a huge pool of starting locations is that (after waiting forever for your CPU to do the horribly intense calculations involved) you can select the very best starting zone on the whole map, and so get a skill-based advantage. But this is just another stupid barrier to entry; should new players be penalized for not knowing that the 'aquifer' tag on a particular tile means that any mines they dig will fill up with water? When barely less than 1% of the map is even inhabitable, why even bother? Gnomoria just generates a 3x3 tile guaranteed to have access to all resources and with low variance when it comes to bad luck like large surface lakes or elevation changes.I dunno, there's lots of stuff like that, little ways the game has been improved by cutting out some in-retrospect-unnecessary element. The reason the ""game was abandoned"" and ""development stopped"" was because they had finally brought the content up to where DF is.Now, when I feel a hankering to play DF, the program I actually open is Gnomoria. I think you'll come to the same conclusion, if you try it out.If you're familiar with Dota, then you might remember a game called Heroes of Newerth. People were sick of having to use Warcraft 3's interface and scripting engine for Dota, and it was obvious that some change needed to be made, so some rich fan developed a whole external engine, and built dota as its own game, and it was therefore much easier to do things that are hard to do in the warcraft 3 map editor. He changed the names of all of the heroes, but, for the most part, their abilities and gameplay stayed the same (although, as a fan, he had a couple ideas for new heroes that he soon implemented). And it was a thousand times better than playing Dota 1 on Warcraft 3.And it had its own problems, of course, but they were nothing like the problems of a decade-old battle.net-connected game. So all the dota players flocked to it.(Later, of course, Valve published Dota 2 and then HoN kind of died or something? I don't know what happened to it, everyone I know switched over.)Anyway, I see Gnomoria as being the HoN to Dwarf Fortress's Dota 1. It changed all the names of everything, even renamed the dwarves to gnomes, but the actual gameplay is exactly the same. Except all the problems with using an ncurses-style command line interface for a GUI are fixed, much like HoN fixed the fact that players couldn't reconnect to the game in Dota 1. I think it's a good analogy.So I think this game is worth getting, if you're a DF fan looking for perhaps an even better DF experience....if you *haven't* played Dwarf Fortress, on the other hand, well. This game might be *easier to learn* than DF, but it is still a very far cry from easy. You will probably have a ton of trouble understanding how to do things like build workshops or plant crops. The UI will fight you. Your basic understandings from other games will be actively hurting you. Your gnomes will die repeatedly while you are alt-tabbed out looking at the Gnomoria Wiki's ""Getting Started"" page. It will take you a long time before you understand what you're doing. You probably won't enjoy it. And so I don't recommend this game to you.But that doesn't mean this game shouldn't exist. DF has an enormous following, and (let's be honest) there really *ought* to be a version of it that doesn't have such a truly unbelievably bad interface.			"

												Definitely a good game, and I enjoyed my 32 hours with it. But the thing that kills it for me is the clunky UI, which makes building complicated things time-consuming, and micro-management inefficient because it's hard to get the information you need at-a-glance to inform your decisions.I do like the core mechanics and micro-managing everything, but I just can't stand the UI anymore - even with lots of keyboard shortcuts enabled.If you decide to play the game and aren't familiar with the genre, I'd *highly* recommend reading a wiki because there's tonnes of cryptic things that you need to know about.

												I really enjoy playing this game, and still pick it up a few times per year and enjoy it for a short time.  Haven't played much else in this genre, so I don't know what to compare it to.Typically, I'll forget how heartwrenching the remaining bugs are and give it a go... get 20-30 hours into a new world and things just start devolving to buggy madness.  :(-Gameplay-I call it macromanagement, as you can't give any direct orders to the gnomes.  Instead, you configure the gnomes to do certain tasks, then make sure the necessary workshops and resources are also configured.-Bugs-""Retreat to equip uniform"" is THE most frustrating of incomplete features.  Always happens... a key gnome rushes into battle with a wheelbarrow instead of retreating to grab a crossbow and gets murderized by an ogre.  This isn't a ""quirky bug"", it's sheer frustration.  Absolutely nothing you can do about it.  That gnome that spent 10 years perfecting his crossbow skill and is a wicked shot?   He's going to kamikaze against a two-headed ogre weilding a pine bucket full of hooch cuz... reasons.Cascading stockpiles... doesn't really work, sadly.Beetles.  Maybe not buggy, but definitely bad mechanics.Mant SFX will get stuck on a certain location, and continue to chitter away, years after you slew it.  One of several reasons I mostly play without sound.Floating helmets?  I dunno why.  They dance merrily about my kingdom.Performance... Not great.  Single-threaded and will crush any PC once there are too many objects.  The better the PC, the more it can handle, but I've seen redditors set up big battles when they know they can let Gnomoria run 3-4 hours uninterrupted.-Overall-I LOVE THIS GAME.  I wish some of those bugs got fixed.  :(			"

												Gnomoria. It is hard to review this game. I love this game and have played many hours in it. It is in my top five games of all time. But that is where the good parts of this review end.This game is a backstabber. It is like one of those people you meet in high school or college. They seem to have everything together, and you can't bear to be away from them. Any flaw you can see is outshone by their shear awesomeness.The trouble comes after knowing these people for a while. The quirks and the minor flaws start to dominate their persona. They can't get out of the frat boy phase. They never seem to have found themselves on that soulsearching trip they were taking.Gnomoria is the same way. It promised a fun game and sure it was fun. But when you build up in those first few years you ignore the bugs where the gnomes stop to pick up something on a tile where there is nothing. You ignore when the gnomes don't seem to understand that they can't pile an entire mountain of stone on a single tile without spawning golems. You ignore when items become glued to the ground and it seems you have found the sack that arthur will have to come pull out and become your king. You ignore this until every minute you have to go and change a profession or else a gnome will die of thirst trying to pick up that sack.I used to play this game almost every week, but I just can't stand it any more. Boo I say. Booooooo! your true love lives! yet you marry another. :*(			"

												Overall if it's on sale for <$5 and you'd like to ease into Dwarf Fortress I'd say consider it a paid tutorial for the free game.  Gnomoria's gameplay is pretty straight forward, but there's not really any endgame, or enough variety to maintain much replayability.Back in 2013 I had high hopes for this game, and put a fair amount of time into it, although a lot of that was seeing how long self sustaining kingdoms would take to die to FPS.  Unfortunately the creator followed the typical EA method of stalling out development after the first year, entering into a long phase of minor updates, and then releasing a partially developed game.  If you can brave the UI of Dwarf Fortress with a starter pack, then that offers a much better game for free.			"

												Having played Dwarf Fortress a long time ago, I was interested in this title, as it clearly wear it's influence on it's sleeve. This game is literally trying to recreated DF but with actual graphics and UI (and vaguely replaces dwarves by gnomes, but that really easy to miss). Sounds great on paper! ...however, it fails in execution and content.- While it's trying to emulate DF, it keeps very little of the charm of the original, and only covers about 2% of it's content. The only feature that seems to be unique to Gnomoria is the tinkering mechanic, which I haven't been able to really use as it takes literally hours to produce anything.- The isometric view, while prettier than looking into DF's matrix, makes it pretty damn hard to see and target constructions correctly. Half the time, you realize you just ordered to build a floating staircase. A lot of the UI could also be improved, it's serviceable but not very good.- The game might be promising if it was still being updated, but the developer disappeared about 2 years ago. Currently, it's bare-bones, and there's a serious lack of diversity in the content.- Balance also seems pretty poor. It could just be bad luck, but a single goblin naked wielding a door (that he broke down), killed 2 of my fully armored and armed soldiers that had been training for 1 year straight.- Bugs, lots of them. ""Oh what's this odd thing on the ground? I never built this"" No clue as the game crashes everytime I click on it...I know the learning curve of Dwarf Fortress is basically a cliff, that has been oiled up... and is on fire, during an earthquake... BUT trust me, it's way more worth it than this poor imitation, and it's also free (with optional donations). The DF wiki has lots of info for beginners (meanwhile the official Gnomoria wiki has it's domain expired...).If nothing else, encourage devs that care about their games instead of devs that runs away with the sale money without saying a word.

Early Access Review
								God do I love this game... it is so incredibly addictive to play, but if you decide to pick it up you'd best prepare yourself for some unforgiving failures. A burgeoning kingdom you've meticulously built up and spent tens of hours or more on could easily fall simply because you weren't prepared for a goblin invasion or a beetle infestation... oh, and don't even get me started on the zombie plagues... But seriously, don't let that scare you. The developer constantly adds new features, and the game finds itself with a lot of them and as a result a lot for you to do and ways to run your kingdom the way you want. If you aren't a fan of the frustrastion of the intense difficulty of this game as you progress on, it has variable difficulty that you can specifically choose how hard what aspects of the game are and even what kind of enemies are allowed to spawn. Of course, it can be played in peaceful mode, but wheres the fun in that?			"

												This game can be very addictive. You choose whether to settle in the flatlands or the hills or mountains, you can preiveiw the area or just jump in for a surprise. You choose the difficulty of your enemies and whether they get strong. And you plan and build. I just when you think that you are getting bored, there are mods that change the game up, easier, harder, more variety. But be warned, this game can be addictive.If you get stuck, look at the wiki or the guides online on steam, check out the screen shots, or ask for help, there is a very active communitiy. Once you learn to play the game, get out your graph paper and design the perfect town then you can go in roman camp style and throw down a design that will be efficient and easy to remember. Only you have to adapt to the terrain, and you have to survive long enough to be able to change what ever you want to change. And you may have to adapt to mods that introduce new workshops.While the game is not multiplayer, you can agree to start in the same location of the same map with same settings and then compare screenshots of the results. If you both should survive so long.			"

The visual quality of the game is underwhelming, there are few to no animations, I couldn't stand the music for more than five minutes before turning it off, and even with a mouse-driven interface, the management/interaction menus were not as intuitive as I had hoped.

Early Access Review
								This is a tricky one. It needs a Neutral review. If you are going to rate this, at least read it first-ThanxIf you know what Dwarf Fortress is, and liked it, you will love this game. The learning curve is more of a cliff face, it's a long, hard slog to figure out what everything does, what order you should craft in,  learning how to use the dwarf professions, Military, Stocks tabs, and how to use Priorities to create effective farms. I suggest that 6-10h of play time will get you to a point where you are proficient enough to be able to enjoy this game. Be aware of that going into it, and you shouldn't be dissapointed.Being Early Access, one needs to remember that bugs that I mention here, will likely be fixed by the time you read the review.So the screenshots that you see of vast  fortresses? don't expect to get that far in the game for  a long, long, long time. What you are looking at there, is beautiful, but it takes a lot to get there. I'm sure I'll persist with it one day, I will manage it myself, but not today.There is one particular thing in this game that I dislike above everything else I want to say about it, good or bad; Mining isn't as intuitive as it needs to be to make this game align with more casual players, such as myself (I'm not really a casual gamer, but I play this game with a Casual mentality). This game is not ready for casual players. Read the reviews, and you will see they are filled with fanboi's. This is fine, as it can be a great game, and it deserves it's positive following. All I am saying is, prepare for something hardcore, or look elsewhere ATM.Mostly, I'm gettting OK with this game, and the more I persist with it, the better I get at not having my Gnomes Derp out. It's the ONLY realy frustration that I have right now, otherwise I would say it's an OK game.ControlsYou dont control Gnomes directly. you give sets of instructions, and they prioritise their tasks. So if a Gnome is hungry, he will go off and eat from the Food Stockpile, before he will pick up that strawberry off the ground. (its just a bug that needs to be looked at.) mostly they manage their own sleep/food/drink needs and you ensure they have enough supplies. I actually like this idea.The UI is clunky and slow. it uses the same system as Win95 where you have to track your mouse across several dropdowns to get what you want. you have to double click lots of things that should be single click. you have to click - move click to select, rather than click drag. I keep hearing from fanbois ""it's better than DF (Dwarf Fortress)"" That may be true, but it doesn't make it OK. You can't pause if you have a menu or context box up. you can only pull up the context menu if you click on a blank area of the map.This is understandable, as designated areas/ objects/enemies are interactive via said rclick. but still annoying.Graphics.Although I get it, i do - it's a throwback nod to the 8bit era of DF, it's not right. I feel the art style is archaic and unclean. tiles have a lot going on in each one and it can actually make it hard for less experienced players to 'read' the layout of the land, especially as we are talking about a mining type game with multiple layers of rock face and myriads of tunnels. I feel that this game would benefit from a clean, crisp tile set. I just looked at the gmae Project Zomboid, and it's graphics are simple, but clean, allowing you to focus on the gameplay. I feel this title here would benefit from such a make over.Sound.Turn it down, turn it off. Play your own. It gets tired quickly.Gameplay.Back to the brutal. I think this game is meant to be fun, but I'm not having any. I think that once I figure out how to mine without getting my miners trapped with no way out every 5 mins, I will like this game more.-->Pathing: gnomes getting stuck is because it's possible to work them into a corner. If, say you were to ask them to dig a pond by selecting an area that is wide, they will potentially dig themselves into a 1 tile island. because they have done this, the dirt that they need is down below their reach, so they can not build themselves a bridge out... you have to get another gnome to come resue them, and this may mean retasking a farmer to become a miner for a little while, etc etc. The pathfinding itself seems not too bad, but it pays to dig / mine in small areas/strips..-->Mining;It's hard work. not from the perspective of it's a grind... it's actually very accessible, and you can get pretty deep, pretty quickly... just remember that depth = harder monsters. Monsters Spawn anywhere that is dug that is within about 12 tiles of a gnome that is not lit by a torch. Pro tip, right there. Anyway, what I find hard, is the pathing. building stairs up/down isn't always easy. gnomes get stuck/freeze. they can remove their only way out, and then they don't build stars back up afterwards. Maybe I found a glitch, maybe I'm doing it wrong. It's annoying. There is a key (E) to make all uncovered tiles invisible, so it's supposed to make deep mining easier, and in some ways it does, but it's still really easy to lose track of where your little minions are. Then there is the whole stock piling and stacking mechanic, which is currently broken. EG. Dirt can be stockpiled, and can be stacked to 64... but gnomes will not stack dirt on a stockpile. you have to make a stockpile, get them to fill it, then destroy your pile, and the game will then stack your dirt for you. I hope this is addressed in the future.Survival.It's meant to be a Rogue-lite Procedurally Generated Crafting Survival Game With Permadeath. this is achieved with map generation at the start of the game, and a Save feature, but no Load... so youcan't go back to previous Save games. really it just feels like it's missing the load feature. I think it's because the game talks about saving so much that it becomes a thing, something that you think about, rather than just lettign it happen so that you can focus on gameplay.On enemies; figure out how to craft a bone needle, and make yourself some bandages. Minor cuts during combat will have your gnomes bleed to death if not treated. Enough Said.Crafting.I like the crafting in this game. You can see what the prerequisites are for items, you can even order an item, and your gnomes will make all the prereq's for it... if you have created/farmed all the needed Craft stations / ingredients for those (wood, stone, bone, cotton, etc) you can see what can be created and what's needed. I Prefer this to the Terraria / MindCrap style of play where items only become available to craft (aka you know of their exsistence) once you already have all the items needed to create it.The Negative Reccomend is mostly because I feel that this game is not yet ready for the Casual gamer, even though I will likely persist with it for now.Casual: well, it's Don't Starve again, but with a steeper learning curve at the start - a science machine in DS wll get you through winter if your an OK player... so, one crafting table, basically. In Gnomoria, you craft 1 table specifically so that you can craft the next 6 that you will need for winter / food / drink / stone / wood / butcher etc etc. And i pretty well need them all. Then once I have them I need to use those tables to build a loom and a  tailor, just so that I can make bandages for when my guys get injured in battle. That's 8 crafting tables in the first 6-10 days, pretty much. I've learned this with about 10h of play time, so it takes about 10h before you can start to learn the game well enough to begin to enjoy it... Thus - not for casual gamers - those who want to pick up a game and know how to play it in 5 mins. If a tutorial is good enough, even if it is really long, a player can feel like they have freedom in the game, and yet still be taught as they go. hints that pop up on events, like yak @ 50% hunger... start the ""build a trough"" tutorial... etc			"

												Gnomoria is the type of game for those who've taken a long hard look at Dwarf Fortress and asked ""Can you meet me half-way?"" It adds a graphical interface and pleasant aesthetics to the fray (and isometric camera), but it loses a great deal of depth from its source material. You don't have children, you don't domesticate wild animals (you instead have Yaks, Emus and Alpacas, which do not appear in the wild), the monsters are fairly linear and small to choose from, and the invading Goblins escalate at a routine pace.Gnomoria shines brightest when dealing with Professions- the jobs your crew handle. In Gnomoria, you have 8 or 9 Professions by default, but immediately, you're able to add, or remove them, and edit existing Professions. Do you want separate jobs for Miners and Stonecutters? Carpenters and Woodworkers? Do you want to separate your Gemcutters from your Jewelers? Do you want your soldiers to help out other professions when they're not training? Gnomoria lets you micromanage exactly how you want your Kingdom to function, and it that is perhaps what kept me going. Allowing us to choose which blacksmith worked which station, and allowing us to choose different gnomes to smith weapons as opposed to armor, enabled a sort of ""assembly line"" approach to kingdom management, that made the entire process a lot more fun and interesting. By the time my kingdom was ""finished"", I'd automated nearly every task to give me a nice, healthy stockpile of every resource available within the game.All in all, the game is great for the price. If you like city builders and kingdom management, buy the game- wait until a sale if you must, but <$10 is more than a fair price for a game that fulfilled all of its promises, and actually made it out of Early Access. Gnomoria, for me, was a little gem that reminded me that not all Early Access developers are looking to take the money and run.			"

It's by no means a bad game, but it does have it's problems and is definitely not complete by any means.Here are (IMO) the problems:- Lack of end-gameOnce you have things up and running, there just isn't that much to do. This was a problem I ran into in all of my playthroughs - I'd have a blast fending off the initial goblin raids and getting my basic setup, but after that it was just wave after wave of goblins, and the only real threat that they pose to you is lagging your game to death.- CombatCombat is pretty terrible, mostly due to enemies being able to stack endlessly on a single hex. What this means is that you'll have a hundred-goblin doomstack running around, one-shotting your soldiers because they're getting hit hundreds of times before they can do anything. Now there are ways to devise traps so that enemies will trickle more slowly into your forces or eliminate the need for a military entirely, but that doesn't detract from the fact that the core mechanic - combat, is lacking. - Crashes/game breaking bugsI've lost a few of my kingdoms due to this. Most of the time it seems like something specific is causing it because I'll get crashes at the exact same point when I reload the game.- PerformanceThe game is pretty badly optimized, especially once you get to about the mid-game. Goblin raids are also pretty bad once they pick up in size.- CommunicationWhile this doesn't relate directly to the game, I thought it'd be worth mentioning. The developer, Robob0b, has disappeared off of the face of the earth, deleting his social media accounts. There was also a developer roadmap on his website listing promised features, but it's since been removed. Not a very professional attitude.			"

												I played a little over 70 hours in early access. Bought four copies for my kids. My two youngest sons still play the game and get continuely frustrated with AI issues outside of the player's control or combat issues that cause your wonderful gnomes to die. My boys solution is to play a few hours to get their community started then start a new game or play on easy mode. I would agree with other reviewers that game should really be early access until some basic things like AI and combat issues are addressed. The AI and combat issues aside. Caring for and managing your gnomes, even with the outdated UI, is entertaining to our entire family. We don't play as much as we would like due to issues stated above. The game is 90% finished and enjoyable. I just can't give the game a thumbs up when some very frustrating issues can ruin my 10+ hour gnome adventure and I lose my precious gnomes.Dev should add ability for player to manually take over a single gnome with full control. At least that would give the player the ability to mitigate problems when AI bugs tend to clog a workshop or even worse, kill your gnome.			"

								I've owned this game for 3 days and I already have 22 hours on it, truly addictive and absolutely worth £6. Only found 2 bugs, neither stopped my gameplay in any way. I managed to learn most of the game within a few hours, although there is a wiki if you want to get right into it. Music is catchy, visuals fit the setting perfectly but the UI can be a little fiddly if you're using the right click menu. Massive amounts of detail, furniture will be a different tint based on the materials used to build it, items have different quality levels which means that you want a gnome with high jewel smithing to make good jewelry to sell for a higher price.

								Gnomoria is a phenomenal game, It has its ups and downs like most good games however the positives cancel out the negatives by an extreme degree. When I first purchased Gnomoria and tried it, it made no sense to me at all, so I just quit time and time again I would try, to no avail. Something kept drawing me back though, was it the games gameplay? its mechanics? its charm? I dont know. I stuck at it, as a firm believer in persistence is key. After eventually learning how to play the game, I did, for hours on end. I was so addicted. I tried and failed multiple times to prosper in the game, But i continued to fail, to be defeated. So I can successfully tell anyone who purchases this game, CONGRADULATIONS money well spent!			"

Early Access Review
								I'm going to start off by saying this: Gnomoria has been one of maybe my top 5 purchases I've made that have been added to my library. Within the first couple hours I enjoyed myself much more than I'd expected.That being said, I HIGHLY recommend Gnomoria for any fan of civilization/kingdom management games and other simulation-type games that similarly inspire creativity, planning, and fun.The Pros:The devs are very active, which is a pleasant surprise considering my track record of getting suckered into early access traps where devs just plain quit or worse.Gameplay is very enjoyable, and will definitely put your micromanaging to the test if you aren’t one for using pause buttons frequently.Difficulty is easy to scale to your desire. Whether you want the hardest experience possible, or if you want to just cruise in a peaceful kingdom is up to you.Large variety of items, tasks, and things in general to learn about maximizing your kingdom’s productivity and prosperity. I would even call the game immersive, to some degree.The Cons:A little buggy, but it’s early access. What’d you expect? The game is mostly pretty clean and well-functioning. The only real problems I seemed to have ran into are outfit/equipment management bugs. Nothing an exit-reload of the game and some fiddling with settings won’t fix.Some of the terrain-reconstructing options have poorly managed AI, but if it didn’t it would just mean you’d spend more time sitting and waiting than doing anything. So that isn’t really that bad either.All in all, I absolutely recommend this game. Great aesthetics for the type of game it is, great music, great development history 10/10. One of my favorite games!Also, I never played Dwarf Fortress. So I went into playing Gnomoria with zero similar experiences, it's not too hard to learn and if you experiment enough you will get the hang of things pretty easily. Some mistakes in the game aren't easily remedied, so you may want to expect to restart your playthrough in some cases.			"

												This game can be correctly called ""Dwarf Fortress lite,"" but it has several rules and mechanics that prevent it from perfectly capturing a lighter version of that experience.The big one, I feel, is that there's no real way to avoid the overworld. Dwarves can stock up on an absurd amount of wood, then bid the sun goodbye forever. Gnomes are not so lucky; They can grow mushrooms underground for tea, but underground pastures are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to make and there's no other way to grow crops purely underground. Also, most furniture can only be made from wood, meaning you will have to leave eventually. This is okay; it gives the game its own sense of identity, but it's important to know that strategies that serve in Dwarf Fortress are often not replicable here.Also of note is that, while the interface is substantially easier to use than Dwarf Fortresses', it's still awkward as hell. Most commands are selected mainly from a right-click drop-down menu that has a habit of closing menus if your cursor drifts off for even a second. The placement of a lot of tools is also questionable at best, making large projects of mountain-levelling and fortress-building take much longer than necessary as you need to remember the logic the game uses for its tools. I suggest Tacyn's Base Mod, located in the Steam Workshop, to fix this. It adds a lot of content, but much of that is cosmetic choices (such as new tree types which result in different coloured wood) but it mostly feels well-implemented and the alterations to tool logic are, in my opinion, hard to live without.Finally, this is sadly a game you can't really help but play with the wiki open; workbenches are used to craft every type of good in the game, but they follow a tech tree which the game itself does not really offer for viewing: Crude workbenches can be made without processed materials, and are used to craft your first few real benches. You need to make a stone cutter to process stone into the form used by the stone mason. You need to make the stone mason so you can craft the cutting blade required to craft the sawmill. You need the sawmill because crafting a single plank with a crude workbench takes ages, and only after you have one is it worth building your carpenter bench.The more infamous example is the creation of beds: You need a loom to process cotton, a carpenter to make bed frames, and a tailor to make matresses. To craft the tailor, you need a bone needle. To make a bone needle, you need a bonecarver. Bonecarvers have -very few- uses beyond crafting a bone needle; just creating trade goods and low-grade armour. To make the stone needle at the bonecarver you need a butcher to extract the bones from a corpse. To get a corpse for the butcher you either need to have had your yak pastures up and running for a full 12 days or you need to luck out and win a fight against goblins or honey badgers, which is far from guaranteed when you have so little armour and no experience. That means that, before you can make your first bed, you need to have eight different workbenches and either a ranching industry or a large amount of luck.That said, if you can accept the minor niggles of the tech tree being what it is and the interface being sort of screwy, Gnomoria is definitely a game worth your time. Whether it's worth your money is another story; I would probably not buy  it for over $10 USD.			"

												Gnomoria does little to hide its inspiration. It's an attempt at a more accessible version of the legendarily complex Dwarf Fortress. If you've been following my reviews, you probably know that I place a fair amount of value on accessibility. Adding cute graphics and a, if not modern, at least mouse controlled interface are things I'm very much in favor of.Unfortunately, the similarly stripped-down complexity ends up losing the unique charm of its inspiration, without actually making the game friendly to those not initiated in the Dorfish ways. Like Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria is a game about systems and trying to keep them in equilibrium. Unlike Dwarf Fortress, it has systems simple enough to solve.That wouldn't necessarily be a problem if Gnomoria's design moved further afield. But it retains the one save per world and glacial pace. As something to set running in the background and check in on intermittently, it can bring you some entertainment. But it's too slow and too punitive, for too few interesting decisions, to pour the kind of time into that it expects.			"

												This game seems awesome at first. Starting with 6 gnomes you collect wood and stone and, from nothing, build a bustling empire complete with blunderbusses and automatons. What can go wrong?Turns out, a lot. Once your kingdom gets big enough, crashes WILL happen. There's really nothing that can be done since every kingdom uses a single save slot with new saves overwriting the old ones. There is no way to go back to an old save.Also, market stalls are currently bugged. 95% of the items you craft will have 0 worth in the market so buying from a merchant is almost impossible. With a developer that effectively vanished, its safe to say this bug will probably never get fixed.			"

Early Access Review
								Steep learning curve.Brain melting addictivness.Memory leaks and late game crashes. [These bugs will go away eventually, the game is still in development at the time of writing]Gnomoria is a game in which you manipulate, rather than order directly, your colony of gnomes as they reshape the landscape into their kingdom. Farms, groves and pastures, workshops built underground or in buildings, forts and castles, crossbows and rifles, swords and hammers, armors and ... well other types of armors. Mines. Lots of mines. Dangerous mines full of skeletons, zombies, spiders, beetles and the occasional golem. Also gems, valuable metal ores but mostly less valuable dirt and rock. That you can bake/chisel into more valuable ceramic blocks, bricks or crafts for trade or showing off.The essence of the game is manipulation. Each gnome can be assigned a profession which can be entirely customised by the player. Dedicated chefs, carpenters that double up as farmers, jewelers who also help tend the wounded or build things when there's no jewels to make or wounded to tend. Both the specefic jobs for a profession and their priorities can be customised and here is where the learning curve comes from.Even though the game is still incomplete, there is much to discover and learn about how to best organise and grow your workforce. Giving orders is relatively easy, but seeing them carried out sensibly and efficiently is an entirely diffrent matter.The game is difficult yet mostly peacefull at the same time. Expect lots of restarts but also expect your next kingdom to fare better than the last.There is maybe little point past survival, or survival in the prettiest and most efficient kingdom you can build, but in that regard Gnomoria is similar to Lego bricks. You don't play much with what you create, you reach a point of satisfaction (or more likely late game instability) and start thinking about how to build another world.Have loved ones on standby ready to hit you over the head with something sturdy but loving, preferably a hammer. The game is far more addictive than it seems.			"

												The game has changed very little since Feb 2015, still feels incomplete and only half finished. Since then it has mostly been bugfixes and and mod support for a game that is basically dead in the water for development. (Its still buggy and sometimes quite annoying to play.)Positives:A lot of the basic features are complete, you can build a decent enough base for your gnomes.Gnomes that have fought in battles can lose limbs that impair thier abilities which helps give some of your gnomes some character which they otherwise lack completely.So long as you only build unerground, building can be quite fun and easy to do, planning storerooms and workshops seperate to your living quarters and dining halls.The visual style and overall presentation including the UI is nice to look at and faily easily interpreted.Negatives:Being that no preferances exist for food and drink, there is no incentive to vary production and create a variety of food and drink and instead produce the same stuff for the entire playthrough.Controlling your gnome squads is difficult too, only being able to give vague suggestions of what you want them to do which can be frustrating when combat often leads to serious injury a single gnome can run into a fight before everyone else and die immidiately leading to an entire colont collapsing because you no longer have enough gnomes to fight back and the few remaining goblins take down your civilians with little resistance.Gnomes get stuck a lot unless you remove tiles in a very specific order to prevent them removing thier only escape because they can't walk on solid blocks if they have no tiles on top. Sometimes you dig down and get them stuck or they construct something in the wrong order and get stuck on top of a wall. You have to micromanage them as best you can despite only being able to designate jobs to be done, this leads to a lot of watching them do a job then designating the next tile(s) for construction or deconstruction, the larger the project you intend to build, the more tedious the process gets.The games hospital area just does not do its job, gnomes do a better job of patching themselves up after a battle. I have had gnomes who would otherwise have lived die in hospital of thirst despite having plenty of drink available. Plus they stay in hospital untill they are fully recovered and since there is no medicine in game this takes a very very long time, time which would be better spent doing work so we don't all starve.Currently missing or lacking features:No animal taming.No personalities, life goals or religions.No magic or enchanting.Diplomacy overly simplistic, either friend or hostile monster kingdom with no way to change thier disposition. Friendly kindoms exists purely for trade and hostile kingdoms will only attack you. No communication and barely any interaction outside of trade or fighting.Items, plants and animal variety feels lacking, very few rare plants and animals exist.I've never seen a random event besides being relentlessly attacked by goblins and the Mants have never attacked because I don't make too much food.Medical treatments besides bed rest and bandages, without any other forms of treatment the hospital is pointless. (Artificial limbs exist but they are quite late in the game and are not produced at the hospital.)The game is fun enough to pick up on sale but not worth a full price purchase.			"

												Gnomoria was an addictive early-access 'Dwarf Fortress Lite' game centered around an isometric view, actual graphics, and the titular gnomes. The game is charming in its own way, the varety of gnome sprites brought a modicum of life to what would otherwise be smiling icons. But aside from Gnome looks there isn't much else varied in the game. You have your standard farms and produce, your varieties of stones, a smattering of metals, a few AI 'kingdoms' to trade with and that's about it.No, really. Unless you count the monster varietes, all of which but three can be countered by simply lighting your mines with torches. Skeletons, Zombies, Beetles, and Spiders simply aren't a threat to any player (read: most) capable of planting torches on the floor. The rest are periodic goblin & ogre invasions that scale in size and armament with the 'wealth' value of your realm. Not that the scale of these will kill anything other than your framerate when you reach a point where you can trap them in corridors and let them starve to death. The last enemy is the mant, chitinous men-ants who spawn in numbers based off your food storage and can be completely circumvented by killing a scout spawned a day or so before a raid.These threats do not become more challenging over time as much as they become higher in number. Attack frequencies never increase, there are no bigger threats, and they're routine enough to be completely predictable. The difficulty curve in this game stems from the lack of a tutorial and the creeping FPS death and bugs (both beetle cascades and crashes).If you're wondering if the game has any mystical or otherwise big events/features/content, I can say there's none. Once you learn the mechanics (and the gnomish mechanisms), the game becomes trivial in the extreme. So yeah, 'Dwarf Fortress Lite' in the negative sense of the phrase.The game lacks in significant and essential content it sorely needs to justify itself as a finished game, such as a deathcare system, expanded economics and management(No royalty/nobility! Though you might consider that a good thing) , and a meaningful way to interact with the game world outside your kingdom.To top it all off Gnomoria does not support resolutions higher than 1080 and the developer has not and will never make any attempts to ever support them. Enjoy playing in windowed mode if you've a higher resolution monitor.Gnomoria was good for an early access game. It is not a finished game worthy of release. Sacrificing the last 2 years of development to focus on mod support at the expense of sorely needed content made this game another warning against Early Access.			"

Just try stuff out.The game is very like dwarf Fortress. Not as good, but also not as complicated. Since DF is free, you can either try to go directyl to DF or stick some hours in this game, before advancing to DF. This gane is an early access game, much more stuff is getting into the game day after day.I expierenced zero bugs and one or two crashes! I recomment it fully to fans of DF for an ""easier"" game.

								With enough time on this game to write a review i decided to finally get to writing one.Lets start with the good points: The developer listens to feedback and works on bugs extremely fast, You can sell pet rocks for yaks, Dress up your gnomes in the skulls of your dead enemies, For some reason goblins shank your yaks instead of you, Extremely fun and good to play in spare time and keep your kingdom looked after, Willing gnome sacrifices come at the start of every season to ""work"" for you, Combat system that shows where your gnome is hurt and how it will affect its battle, Skill called ""way of the gnome"" assign this to a group of 5 gnomes and watch them kill everything you see until you run out of your early supply of bandagesThe bad points: It only has a single developer so progress for updates is slow but still frequent, Can't stop yaks for bleeding so if one of them grazes its hoof you get to watch it slowly bleed out over your kingdom until you finally eat it, High difficulty curve to the point that most new players won't realise that placing torches will save your life and digging deep will be the end for a new player.Overall this game is amazing and something i keep coming back to and finding new updates each time. 10/10 m8			"

								Gnomoria is a exceptional idea that needs to be finished. The game has a lot of content so far and bulding a gnome empire is fun but as other people have stated updates are slow to come and the game feels dead. Bug fixes take forever and the game is indeed using old tech that makes the game hard on the cpu when it doesnt need to be. The guy who started this needs to get a group together to help him finish it and release a finalized copy of the game.Definitely follow and if a release comes along look into getting it.

								What do you get when you cross a giant honey badger with a gnome?We can try to find that out as Irreverend Opinions looks at Gnomoria.---The BlurbSimple and sweet, a town-management game where you can't directly control your subjects.  Lead a small band of adventurous gnomes into the founding of a new colony, and defend them not only against starvation, but also hostile goblin raiders and hungry beasts!The GoodSimple and fun once you get the hang of it, with a basic 'dig and build' approach to the world controls.  Randomized terrain and gnome stats make this a slight blend into roguelike, which has both ups and downs.  The in-game orchestra sound track is quite nice, and the game sounds are decent quality for a beta.The combat is not difficult to understand; you can give instructions to your gnomes on how to conduct themselves in battle (I favor a kamikaze rush), and the enemies present a bit of variety in tactics as well; animals will run if hurt, and goblins will happily test your defenses.The BadPoor graphics* and terrible default sound track.  There's not very much to do (still early access at time of writing), and so the game can be very slow after a while.  Strong learning curve with no starting instructions, and at time of writing resources can be difficult to get together for items needed for the game.  Few explanations and warnings for events makes some facets of the game a bit challenging.  The pathing AI can be a bit funny.* 8-bit, might be your thing.The UglyThere isn't any.  Nice game, still in beta.SuggestionsAn in-game recipe book would be nice (even if such was populated only by things you had discovered and 'theorized').  A gnomish flavour to menus would be good, perhaps naming the weaponsmith a swordificationator or something.  More in-game notices that a gnome has just dug himself onto a cliff that he can't get down from and is at risk of starvation would be something I'd like to see.The Summary7/10, 8/10 if 8-bit graphics are your thing.

												SHORT VERSION: ***Game is buggy, seems to be no fix - Game abandoned with no fix - Do Not Buy***LONGER VERSION:I put many more hours into Gnomoria than what is shown; possibly over double.And I enjoyed the game - never played anything like this before. No DF experience, ect.However the last update for Gnomoria - in my opinion - left the game upstable. I have worlds that are corrupted due to my Gnomes climbing scaffolding. I sometimes am hoping that opening a workbench doesn't crash my game, I hope any bug doesn't crash the game, and then hope that the crash doesn't corrupt my world. It is a shame RoboBob left this project, as it was one of my early purchases being new to Steam - and I had a good amount of casual fun. The game is riddled with bugs, that forums, and those on the workshop community, even the Reddit sub, know not how to fix the problems. And it is a shame. I hope the community find a fix, but I'm not going to keep checking up on that.			"

												Wow, so much hate since the 1.0 release.Yes, the game is probably done with development.  There is no promise of future updates.  However, the game is playable and many major features were added to the game.  Most of the bugs have been fixed, so I'm not sure what the others are talking about.There are annoying quirks with pathing, gnome behavior, and interface issues.  My biggest hope is that we get a 1.1 that actually fixes many of the issues.  Better yet, open source it!  The features that were ""promised"" on the road map were pie in the sky brainstorming by the developer.  He should never have posted it. I just don't understand how someone can give a negative review, but have over 100 hours in a game they most likely bought on sale for $5 or less.			"

												Meh. I have the game since a ♥♥♥♥ing long time, and the developpement is verryyy slow, and it's still an early access imo even if they claim it's released. Not worth 15$/e, if it's on sale on like less than 5$/e and you like this kind of game, go for it though. It's for me the closest successor of Dwarf Fortress (which is sad to say since it's a pretty meh game)			"

Early Access Review
								At first there was Dwarf Fortress. And then there was my complete and utter lack of patience for the tedious micro-management and brutal difficulty of that particular game. (Read: I love it, but sometimes lack the attention to detail it requires.) This began my search to find a similar, but somewhat less dense version of Dwarf Fortress. I came across them in droves. Rimworld, Timber and Stone, Prison Architect, and of course Gnomoria being foremost among them. Gnomoria is a game, that while being more limited in its options and features than Dwarf Fortress, still manages to capture its charm and fun. To say that Gnomoria is a blatant clone of Dwarf Fortress, does it little justice, though there is no denying a certain amount of inspiration must have certainly come from that title. This much is evident as you first embark to your new settlement. After naming your map (or fortress, or whatever you may want to call it), and choosing some options for difficulty, Gnomoria plants you into a procedurally generated map. You're able to determine if the map is mountainous, flat, or perhaps even a bit hilly via a few sliders if you choose to customize the advanced settings. This all ensures you'll never have the same map twice. You'll only have a handful of gnomes at first as well as a very limited number of supplies. Now from here, it's up to you to determine the fate of your gnomish minions. While you can't directly control your gnomes, there are a number of ways to determine how they will behave. You're able to designate professions which will determine what sort of generated tasks your gnomes will be able to complete. Gnomoria even allows for you to create and name custom professions which will then carry out specific tasks. This gives you pretty solid control over how your colony prioritizes work. I've found this feature to be particularly useful in the beginning as gnomes are not apt to doing things efficiently using only the default professions. If you wish, you can create professions that will only carry out military tasks. Assign them to squads, train them, arm them. If you master these menus, which is not difficult by any stretch thanks to Gnomoria's simple but effective UI, you will be much better off for it.Gnomoria really shines in its ability to let you sculpt the land. For anyone who has played any of a number of voxel-cube based games (Minecraft, Space Engineers, etc.,), this part will be quite familiar. However, in this instance, you will be viewing the world through an isometric perspective rather than first person. You can tunnel and dig anywhere and everwhere, but be warned, unlit tunnels sometimes spawn deadly enemies such as skeletons and even zombies. Use raw stone to craft blocks and then you can begin building a fortress. One of my favorite features here is the 'replace' tool. Using this you can easily replace any block with any other type of block. I'll often find myself following the natural geometry of the landscape to determine the layout of my settlements and simply replacing the dirt walls and floors with more permanent stone or wood. It's been quite a lot of fun being the architect of some pretty grand fortresses. Players should be careful to not get carried away with doing too much at once though as it will keep your gnomes from completing other tasks of higher priority to you. Gnomoria has a lot of great features. You can craft arms and armor for your gnomes, or craft trinkets and statues for trade. You can farm food and brew drinks to keep your gnomes alive through the winter. Fend off goblin invasions, endure monster and animal attacks, and brave the deepest caves. There is, undeniably, a lot to do in Gnomoria. If any of that sounds fun to you, I think that you'll find this game to be worth the modest price. I've enjoyed Gnomoria, that much is true, but what's more is that I will definitely continue to enjoy it for some time.			"

								This is the best game you can buy for this price. I had it for months before it even came out on Steam and I think it is a must buy. Beware however, it has a steep learning curve and you will lose your village a couple of times until you get the hang of it.The game is constantly updated with new features and more stable and bugfree than most full price games you can buy today.Edit: I should mention that I had a savegame that caused reproducable crashes, that was before the game was on steam. So I reported the savegame to bugzilla, and the bug was fixed in a couple of weeks. This was the first time ever that any bug I reported got fixed in any game.			"

								I love this game, but what inevitably breaks the experience for me every time I really get into it is the inexplicable crashes.It is an absolute blast to craft sprawling cities adorned however I want, mine deep into the earth for precious resources, develop my gnomes into skilled warriors and craftsman, BUT when you lose hours of work to random crashes attributed to things like ""too many items/enemies"" or ""That gnome is building a chair"" or ""I don't even know because there are too many variables that could be causing the crash,""  the fun factor is instantly replaced with frustration.  I've spent a lot of time on some games simply trying to figure out what factor is causing the crashes.  Is it the market?  Is it a specific building?  Again, there are too many factors, and its painful to figure out.   It's Early access at the submission of this review, so I get it: crashes are to be expected.  Regardless, crashes are never fun, so take care if you decide to purchaseThis is a fun game and will be better when/if they ever finish the game.  If the severe stability issues are eventually addressed, you can bet your bum that I'll switch my recommendation to ""yes!""			"

								After playing this game on different stage of this Early access, I can safetly say that this game feel rather complete.Not too many bugs and almost no breaking game bug (CTD, BSOD...). For anyone looking at this game, it is a ''more'' friendly dwarf fortress style game.Pros :- good graphic- very good  menu, a mix of the right click menu and a set of Hotkeys- provide a good challenge without being unfair- each game can be customize from peaceful to Impossible Hardcore Hellsish mode.- A lot, and i mean A lot, of support from the developper, many patches and many more feature to be add- a complex priority system for all the task in your kingdomCons : - No tutorial, you have to rely on some steam guide and let's play on youtube- Sometime even if everything is set correctly your Gnome just idle for a couple of in-game hours  (maybe their personality)- underground game with not a lot of visibilityIn conclusion, a solid kingdom builder with survival at its core, can be very challenging in the beginning, but overall all these type of game have a big learning curve.It is still a solid one to start with.Bonus content : in game combat log ''HIT: John swings with her copper hand axe at the goblin, hitting the neck, slicing through the skin and slicing through the throatSTATUS: The goblin lost his head, his neck is bleeding, an artery has been struck, is suffocating and is blindDEATH: The goblin has died.''

Early Access Review
								This game, as I'm sure is well advertised, is a more approachable take on the Dwarf Fortress formula.  Think Minecraft meets the Sims, but instead of a house, you build a small settlement (or a huge sprawling, multi-level fortress that goes 40 stories below the earth).+Begin with a small group of workers with various skills.+Assign them tasks, giving priority or preference to those you deem more vital.+Watch them execute the tasks and make logical adjustments, altering terrain and tasks to meet needs.+Harvest resources, build structures, and defend your settlement until new immigrants arrive.+Defend against enemies, both natural and fantastical, preparing your workers through acquisition of resources, trading, and training their skills.+Workers get better at tasks the more often they do them, with each having their own hunger, thirst, and stats. Can change occupations or create your own custom classes using a system of priorities for each task (Agriculture, Smithing, Mining, etc).It's one of those games you begin at 1800 and take a break, check the clock, and curse the fact that somehow it's now 0600 the next day and you only get 2 hours to prep for work.  Strongly recommended for weekend play only!Developer is regularly updating this game, putting it beyond the immediate competition in that regard.  Given time, it could rival the Hallowed DF in terms of content, but for now it merely noses past by a slight margin due to graphical and interface simplicity that make it a joy instead of a chore (sorry, DF, but you are a bit on the exclusive side).Strongly recommended to fans of simulations, creative world-builders, and hoarders.

								Gnomoria obviously takes much of its inspiration from Dwarf Fortress, but with a user-friendly interface and colorful graphics, it is much more approachable.  While this may not have the complexity that Dwarf Fortress does, it offers an extremely enjoyable experience and has been well worth the small price currently being charged for the game.  Fans of Dwarf Fortress or any other village management games should definitely take a look.			"

								Most long time players/fans of this game will claim it is good and we should judge it in its own right. I am however, going to judge it compared the most obviously similar game to it, Dwarf Fortress. Ignoring the fact that DF been in developement for many years, it does still have much more content. Depth of features such as animals, and lore, as well as late game appeal(plus it's free), put DF in the lead. If you don't mind a ""learning wall"", Dwarf Fortress offers unmatched gameplay in the genre. However, if you want to get into a game without having to read wikis, and you want an easily approachable and understandable interface, Gnomoria gives you what DF doesn't. I couldn't recommend this game to anyone who has played DF for any length, but if you have ever wanted to, or just want to have a boatload of fun in a city builder, I heartily recommend this game.

								Gnomoria is a Beast. a Beast that can Beat on your Soul for being reckless and too greedy, or it can be a fun ride by mining and building to your heart's content. some may call this Dwarf Fortress or Gnome Fortress but i think this Game has something going on and it is unique. the Difficulty can be Ramped up for  unforgiving relentless play all the way down to an easy enough mode where no one will attack you other than the creatures underground. with a good UI for building and managing your Dwarves, it is no wonder that Gnomoria gets you hooked in, and this is no small feat for a game with so many rules and micro management.The amount of time you will spend naming, training, building, sculpting Land mass, Thinking of Bad ♥♥♥ kingdoms to build and Enemies to Fend will leave you in awe.  It is Also really Role play if you wish to do so, since most of the materials in the game you get to make buildings with and furniture are of different colors and Elements, you could have colorful or rugged cities.All in all if you have Played Dwarf Fortress, you will feel at home minus Dwarves. the game may feel a bit more game-y because of the simplified UI, but it still plays great. If Minecraft, try it! worth every dollar, just be ready to learn a bit of UI mechanics and 2D/3D Controls. Gnomoria Forums are also great!			"

												+ less micro management than dwarf fortress+ much easier learning curve than dwarf fortress+ moddable items and data.- Walls are impenetrable, and so are one-way traps.  AI pathfinding can't deal with this very well.- If the AI can't find a path into your base it brings a teleporter the next time it comes.  The game calls this thing a 'tunnel' but it's a teleporter.- You can absolutely use traps to prevent surface attacks from ever reaching inside your base (despite above), but your gnomes will probably wander into those traps unless you disable your butcher / corpse pile / scavengers- enemies with ranged attacks ? haven't seen em.- wooden rail fences are just as indestructible as Steel walls. more indestructible than steel doors.- not using path blocking traps is not a viable late game option, but using them properly means enemies have no chance to survive.If you wanted a very simple version of dwarf fortress - here it is.A few of the DF annoyances are very hard to solve here - want your gnomes to avoid an area?

												Great game.  Clearly comparable to Dwarf Fortress, but much simpler to use and play.  Much lighter on detail and immersion than DF, which could be seen as either pro/con.  I could get lost down some various menu for 45 minutes in DF just due to the breadth of detail.  The Gnomes here are blank slates.  They dont have life stories.  They dont have absurd passions or phobias.  They will not go insane and butcher everyone because they are missing a left wool sock.It is by no means a simple game, and the learning curve can be steep.  There are many ways to customize your map/difficulty.  However, once you get your military up to speed and kitted out in steel armor you are pretty tough to kill outside of absurd difficulty curves.   Endgame is growing, new additions each update.Added as of release day:Still a great game, mod support has arrived and the potential is endless at this point.			"

								An excellent game that at this point in time (the writing of this review) is still being improved on frequently.  If you're a Dwarf Fortress fan, this game is basically a stream-lined version with significantly better graphics.  It is simpler, with less actual content, though still a very well done and entertaining game in its own right.For those who are not familiar with Dwarf Fortress, this game is basically a combination of a city-builder, roguelike, and strategy, though that may be oversimplifying it a bit.  You start with a small band of gnomes and with them you construct homes, workshops, pastures, and more while making sure that they have the neccessities to stay alive and happy.  As they work their skills pertaining to that job will improve, whether they are farming or killing invading goblins.I highly recommend this game and consider it a must for any who enjoy this genre.

								This game was so good, it got me into Dwarf Fortress.  I had no idea what I was getting into when I bought this, and it is very rare that a game is so well done that it actually causes me to reconsider my paradigm on life.  It is a wonderful game and you should play it.Only one negative thing about it: dev on it is kinda slow.  I came back after almost a year of not playing to find only a handful of new features.  Fortunately the game is already quite complete and perfectly playable despite what many ""early access"" releases might lead you to believe.			"

												This game is way to hard to learn.  It's difficult after you learn but it's fun.  I played a lot of this game.  Prolly not as much as the games says because I tend to leave games on overnight idling.  There's a lot of fun while you're learning how to play.  It's lots of fun to build a great fort and hone you game.  All that said, the dev did for whatever reason give up on the game.  The hopes for this game were prolly always out of reach but there's not really enough different types of baddies to fight.  Apples and oranges are the same thing in this game!  Yes, the iconic comparison to show how different things are are actually the same thing in this game.  The spawning of some of them is nonsensical.I can look passed all that and recommend you get this game on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								Highly addictive and highly playable, even in the unfinished state.  This game has been described as ""Dwarf Fortress Light with a twist"", which is... honestly really accurate.  If you've ever wanted to try DF, but couldn't get past the ASCII, then this is a good way to start.  That said, it still doesn't hold your hand by any measure.  In fact, since it tries to be more ""gamey"" than DF's bent towards ""realism"", it can actually be somewhat harder to start, since there's a real penalty to just walling yourself off, and you can't just go with pure traps and crossbows behind fortifications from day 1.  For those of you that don't play Dwarf Fortress, the nature of this game is that it just plunks you down smack in the middle of some randomly-generated grassy field with no particular instruction but to try not to starve.  Dash for the tutorials/guides/Let's Play now.  If you want to live, you better be planting some wheat, pronto, and it's not a bad idea to do a little foraging and deforestation, while your miners dig a ditch around your encampment and burrow into some hills to set up a little cave to huddle in.  If you find some stone, congrats, you can make a ""crude workshop"", which bootstraps your economy from pounding rocks together to having a couple basic workshops like the sawmill and carpenter to finally getting basically one of every workshop in the list as you can find the materials it takes to make them, and have the space to squirrel them away.  After that, goblins come to kill you, so hopefully, you created a military and trained it, or you die.  You didn't? Oh, well, it's your fault for not taking time out to train your troops, rather than using their labor to farm to survive the coming Winter.That said, it's not THAT hard, and there are difficulty sliders, but it's not a walk in the park, and there's basically nothing there to tell you when things are about to go seriously wrong.  (Kingdom Wealth, determined by what goods you produce, brings stronger enemies, and at 30k wealth, which is VERY easy to hit, you get very strong enemies starting to spawn in seiges... fanatically keeping wealth down is critical to survive.)  At least you have options to tone down the enemy...The crafting system is also somewhat detailed to a somewhat pointless degree.  There are intermediate steps for many crafting projects that seem redundant.  You can't simply make a torch out of some log you chopped down, you have to first saw the log into a plank, then split the plank into a stick, then turn one stick and one coal into a torch.  Making a shield takes two intermediate products, a shield boss and a shield backing, the shield backing only being used in that one specific recipe, so there's no reason to stockpile them.  Hypothetically, it can make certain projects take longer, but why not just make specific workshops slower to compensate?  It can wind up with clutter, both on the map, and in the menus.  There is a significantly drop in variety from Dwarf Fortress, but they do at least make the individual monsters, creatures, and plantlife mostly unique.  Goblins attack based upon kingdom worth.  Mants (giant ants) attack for food. Golems are created inside your mines when you don't clean up your mine debris. Skeletons, zombies, and beetles are found in unlit deep mines.  That said, there's definite room to grow here.  The game seems mostly focused upon the survival aspects, so the game is more based upon offering harder and harder fights at this moment than DF does.  However, it is not (yet) as sophisticated when it comes to engineering/physics exploits, or the capacity to create a compelling story.  Dwarf Fortress is such a great game because it allows for drastically different playstyles, from the challenge of modded super-invaders to crazy terraforming to creating a narrative from randomly generated characters.  The challenge is here, but the story is missing.  Gnomes differ only in what skills they have power-pumped so far, and there's no sense of a world beyond the boundaries on your play map.  In total, it's more akin to what Dwarf Fortress was back in the 2D era, where it had more obviously ""gamey"" elements, and a clear sense of progression when you cleared obstacles like chasms that spit out tougher monsters as you progressed, but rewarded you with better ores to build weapons.  DF has gone on to be more a ""Performance Art Project"" about being a simulation, while Gnomoria tries more to be a game with a difficulty curve.  If you want to have challenging fights and a sense of progression, Gnomoria has what you're looking for.  It's yet to even start on the epic world-building that DF has, so if you're more into playing a game to grow attached to some of the characters or see a story play out or play dollhouse or pretty princess dress-up, it's not there yet.  It has yet to even offer any terrain but grassy hills...			"

												Ever heard of a little game called Dwarf Fortress? It cast a long shadow for a one-man ASCII project, but if you could get past the atrocious interface it was a bewilderingly deep fantasy sim. Unique projects like that tend to attract imitators, and that's where we get Gnomoria from. But don't write that off as a bad thing just yet, because there's plenty of room to fiddle with the original formula.Gnomoria plops you in the middle of the wilderness with a band of eight stubby settlers and a few supplies. From this humble beginning it's up to you to help your little friends find food, shelter, and purpose in life. There are extensive commands to have them effect change in the world around them, including numerous digging options, room designations, workshop placements, and foraging orders. You might notice there are no direct movement or action commands, and that's because everything in this style of sim is treated like an open order. When you mark walls to be tunneled through, one of your gnomes that can mine and has nothing better to do will scoot over and start tunneling for you.You have further control over the order system by assigning jobs to your petite populace. There are several roles like Woodsman and Miner that can be further customized with granular tasks like ""hauling wood"" or ""stonecarving"", giving you full control over the workday. Of course, your gnomes will wander off to find food or drink or catch a nap if their needs persist, but they tend to be diligent enough in their tasks to not cause any headaches.What WILL cause you headaches is the steep learning curve in Gnomoria. I know all of this sounds simple thus far, but the amount of production systems to come to grips with is staggering. The number of workshops alone is utterly gobsmacking, including professions like bone carving and weaving. Production chains can be frustratingly complex, and the best example of this is making a single bed. A bed is made from a frame and a mattress at a carpentry workshop. The frame is made from planks cut at the sawmill from logs felled outside. The mattress is made from cloth woven by your tailor, using cotton grown on a farm and a bone needle from your bone carver obtained by slaughtering animals. Thus to make a single bed, you need four different workshops processing goods from forests, farms, and livestock.There are helpful tooltips that will explain where to get component materials, at least, and if you have all the workshops set up then materials will be auto-queued when ordering a finished product. Little quality of life features like this help make Gnomoria easier to come to grips with, but it's still very much a game that requires a wiki. A tutorial walking you through the foundations of production would be a godsend, and it's a shame that will likely never happen.You'll run into other difficulties like trying to dig stairs and ramps in the chunky isometric interface, or rooms not functioning and not really getting any feedback why. However, I maintain that there's enough charm and variety to keep you pushing through the rough spots. You are given impressive reign to tunnel and build as you see fit, and sprawling underground kingdoms are not out of the question. It never quite reaches the bar set by Dwarf Fortress, as you don't have a wider world to explore past your immediate map and your gnomes don't have the psychotically detailed personalities of DF inhabitants, but the accessibility goes a long way towards balancing that out. Gnomoria makes a great entry point for this particular brand of ultra-detailed sim, with enough features and polish to keep you digging for hours.			"

												Understand, first and foremost, Gnomoria is something unheard of to the crowd that likes these kinds of games; Fully released. As of this writing the version on Steam is the released product and the game is not abandoned as some have claimed. Many of the negative reviews currently on Steam have nothing to do with the game itself and are about the developer stating he has finished development and this has led some people to decry the game as an unfinished product. This is not the case, and many of them do not state or list relevant detractions from the game aside from their feeling it is unfinished. The developer did not finish all the features he intended to, but he left the game in a well-beyond playable state that is beyond a fair few other Greenlight games that never make it out of alpha or beta states.I first heard of Gnomoria a few years back and at the time it had a small bit of hype for it's aspirations to be an in-depth but still penetrable city and resource management game. The premise is simple enough; You start as a group of gnomes, you have a small amount of starting resources and your goal is to build and maintain a prosperous settlement. To do this you need to mine for ores, clear forests, farm food and materials such as cotton, build structures and outfit your people. You manage what each individual Gnome can do via a Profession system that ties certain tasks to each profession (A miner mines, a woodcutter cuts wood, and a rancher fruitlessly tries to corral your animals) and understanding it, as well as the game itself, will be your key to victory.Let me state, I love this game. It's one of my favorite games to just turn on and let run when I need to kill time and it's perfectly easy to pick up and put down, yet like most city and civ management titles it's hard to actually stop playing. I spend a lot of time doing projects to reach some goal and find myself needing to do other projects to shore that up and it turns into this interconnected maze of projects that each feel fulfilling when you complete them.Each Gnome has it's own skills and each profession uses certain skills which makes managing your gnomes a key and fun part of the experience. The game has wild animals and monster invasions which provide most of the incentive to militarize your settlement and add an extra ticking clock to the survival of your settlement.It is not an easy game to dive into. Your first few settlements, without the benefit of Steam guides or other resources, will crash and burn. You have to keep food stocks up, drink stocks up and your kingdom has a Value which is the combined total of all the resources and structures on the map. This value attracts more Gnomes to your settlement, but also factors into the strength and rate of enemy attacks which means you have to be able to adapt your defenses as your population and value increase. This makes each settlement lost a learning experience and very rarely will you not take something away from the experience.It is not perfect by any means. Despite it's light feeling, the calculations and processing required can make bigger maps or older computers chug a little and sometimes the AI feels a little clunky in how it determines pathing, often leaving gnomes taking the longer routes or unsafe one when shorter/safer ones are available, but this rarely impacts the experience for me. There is a lack of variety in some things such as metals and farm-able resources but what is there is easy enough to understand and the combinations/products you can produce can easily be enough to overwhelm yourself with. There are some small complaints like the music being a bit chippy and the sprite work being basic, but they both work fine and they do not detract from the experience.Overall, I highly recommend this game and urge you to give it a chance in spite of the negative reviews currently in place. I do not deny the game has problems, but the game is absoltuely playable and a good, easy to slide into game for this genre. In terms of cost versus enjoyment, it is well worth the money and you could easily have less fun and less time spent in much more expensive games. You can benefit highly from the guides and resources in place and mods will add some depth for those seeking a deeper, more varied experience, but this does not take away from a great game.			"

												I must say, many people complain about it not being finished and all, but really, it is. Game is more than playable. It is true that the developer, after releasing the game in its final form, completelly disapeared from the forums and left his main website unsuported (also the game wiki, which was great but now is in shambles). This left everybody who was following the development of the game (such as myself) with a ""i want more!"" feeling, since it appeared that he was going to do more for the game.  That was indeed halved, and many promissing  future features never did take off. But it is not fair to say it is not a finished game. Not only it is, it is also pretty bug-free, and its funcionalities work just fine. Also, it must be stated that with only a few mods (available via steam workshop) the game gets even better. I specially like the ones by ""Tacyn"", which expand the game's enjoyability manyfold. So saying it is dead is just plain wrong.That being said, this game does cater for a specific kind of player. It's a very open build and survive game, with blocks and resources,  recipies and craftables etc. So if your aim is to have a storyline, an ""end game"" crisis, characters, etc., this is not for you. If your architect itch is ... well, itching, than this is for you, as you can build pretty much anything you can imagine. A 10 stories castle with wind-powered steel doors and moats? Do it. Have your gnomes upgrade from eating raw ingredients, to having variead meals? Done. With some mods you can even raise spiders and harvest their silk, and tailor hats with it! Wanna build a 'hall of heroes' with gold-statues, to raise your town worth and attract merchants that offer more specialized goods? You got it. Done it all and got tired? Delete the game then. In a month or two, reinstall it and play it all over again. In that sense the game's replayability is huge.I admit, it is hard. In several maps I can't get those gnomes to survive enogh time to get a basic industry going. Or before I had time to build the simplest of defenses, a goblin attack wiped everybody out. In that sense the game can be indeed arid. Like ""banished"", with worse graphics but ten-fold the possibilities. But that is not the same as saying, as many people did, that the game presents you with nothing to do, or that it is boring. That is simply untrue.A gem of a game. 5 stars.			"

												At some point in the past I binge played Dwarf Fortress, enjoying the experience as far as the interface and graphics would allow. Seeing Gnomoria I had high hopes that this would be more or less the same game but with a more tolerable interface and graphics.Starting out, the game seemed solid. The interface is better, if still far from perfect, the graphics are tolerable and everything seemed fine at first.Similar to Dwarf Fortress you will fail a couple of times before you get the balance and learn what to build in which order. Pretty soon you realize that the game is a lot shallower than Dwarf Fortress however (for better and worse). Less to build, less to manage, less “to do”.This would be an okay game with a potential for many hours’ enjoyment, if it was not for the HORRIBLE PERFORMANCE BUGS. The developers have failed at the implementation of the AI/pathfinding to the point where a game with as few as 20 dwarfs/gnomes can become unplayable even on high end hardware. Prepare to lose your colony to the “performance death” (e.g. if you happen to block the path of attackers or your dwarfs) long before you reach the “end game”. The UI becomes less responsive and over a few minutes the game slows to a freeze. No error message or crash, just a freeze that cannot be avoided or recovered.  Do not get me wrong, there are plenty of crashes too, but those are recoverable. But once your colony has started to freeze, you can only start over. Until it happens again.Do not waste your time on this game. It will only bring you frustration and disappointment. What a shame./DeAurion			"

												Can't believe I didn't recommend it yet. The game was finally released and I should have wrote something a long time ago.15€ might seem like a high price since it was quite cheaper before, mostly on the early part of development, but there's just so much to do in this game, it lets you get very creative. All the added content, mod support, all the hard work made it even better.Personally I enjoyed it a lot since Dwarf Fortress had a steep learning curve, too steep for me to enjoy (lack of a nice gui didn't help either) but the idea really appealed to me. I tried Towns but as most people know it was abandoned a long time ago, left unfinished.This is the only game so far that combined what I like in this genre and I feel both satisfied with the hours I sinked in it already and the ones I will now that it's released. The development process was great, frequent updates, listening to the community, perfect.Once again, I highly recommend, not only to people who enjoyed dwarf fortress and it's clones but to everyone who likes village management games!

												I last reviewed this game back in 2013 (review now deleted for a release review).  The game had been in Early Access for quite a while.  Even in Early Access, the game was pretty solid.  If you had ever played Dwarf Fortress or any other games along those lines, this game feels a lot like that kind of game.  I had watched new features be added over the years, many new items to craft, new enemies to fight, and watched as those enemies got smarter and gained new tactics as the versions passed.  Now that it is in Version 1.0 and no longer in Early Access, it feels like a solid release.  Don't let the simple graphical style turn you away from this game.  It is fun, and it is worth the purchase if you are into any sort of fan of building, crafting, and keeping your little citizens alive type of game.			"

												My king and half of the army decided to take a nice, long, nap in their shiny armor while goblin raiders killed the other half of the army. Why? Because you can't wake a gnome up by... shaking him or tapping him. You need a bell.Edit: Got a bell. Tried sounding the alarm with out enemies. Took some one three hours to do it, but after no one would leave the great hall to sound all clear after that, so they permanently stayed in the great hall.Full game my ♥♥♥.Edit 2: Most jobs don't require tools, so I decided to make almost everybody a permanent soldier and keep weapons and armor on them on all times. Why not? After all, my kingdom was themed after Rome, with all its marble and long noble titles. But apparantly, if everyone is a soldier, then the moment someone sees a bear or lizard minding its own business they'll drop everything and bum♥♥♥♥ charge the thing. Simply because they never bothered to put in a system where you can just avoid certain enemies. Also, I've had seven gnomes die in one battle because half the army left to get a drink.			"

								A lot of people consider this to be 'Dwarf Fortress Lite' - and the description is at least relatively accurate. While it doesn't have anywhere near the depth or personality of DF, it does have plenty to keep you entertained, and more on the way. If you've always wanted to get into something like DF, but couldn't because of the complexities of it, Gnomoria is definitely worth a look. Even if you've never heard of DF, if you like simulation games, you should check this one out. Worth every penny and more.			"

								First, I would like to confess that I used to pirate games, lots and lots of games. Until one day I came upon Gnomoria, and I pirated it.This was the game that make me feel guilty about myself, about the fact that I had pirated games. This was the game that help me realize how much efforts and love the devs had put into their games, especially the indie devs, and that having their game pirated is not what they deserve.I then uninstall the game and swore to never pirate another game again. Unfortunately although I can afford the game, it was difficult to make direct purchase where I live, so I had a friend gift it to me.With the confession out of the way, now I would like to state the love I have for this game. This is a management game where you ""program"" the gnomes to build an empire of your own. That alone in this game is challenging enough and offers huge replay value, the enemies are just icing on the cake IMO.When I said ""program"", I really mean it. You don't control the gnomes. You can't even if you want to. The game has a special programming language of its own, which unfortunately still has no official tutorial yet, that you have to learn. Learning takes time, and during that time, your gnomes will die, and die, and die, and die... As soon as you figure out how to use the language, everything becomes much more easier and you will see your gnomes ""operate"" as you however you wish. There might be flaws in your programming, which you could only see the results of it, and when you do, you have to dig through all of your codings to find that little tiny error. It is frustrating, yet very satisfying when you found it.The results of the errors might be manageable, however that is usually not the case. The thing is that the game is really unforgiving. The time you realize that there are flaws in your programming usually is when your gnomes are starving with crops not growing in the winter, or when your gnomes are dying of thirst and you are playing on a map with no water, or when your gnomes are being bitten and clubbed to death by angrily goblins, ogres and mants while your are busy decorating your great hall... and there goes your empire.And that is only the very basis of the game, which IMO already worth the price you paid for it. There are many more advanced mechanics in this game such as diplomacy, biting, trading, biting, gnome stats, biting, perks, biting, power and traps, biting, professions, biting... did I mention biting? Yes, there will be a lot of biting. And the fact that you can CUSTOMIZE ALMOST EVERYTHING SINGLE THING, which is my favorite aspect, brings the game onto a whole new level once you have mastered it.I've spent more than 100 hrs on Steam and many more in offline mode, which is almost all of my free time ever since I discover this gem.tl;dr. This is Minecraft in a much larger scale, with the same level or even more detailed micro management.Plus you can craft pet rocks.			"

								Yes, welcome to another sandbox. I had this title for a long time and only graced it with my attention recently. Honestly I did not think much of the game but somehow I ended up sinking into it a few days straight and still play it.

The reason for that is... eluding me. So prepare for more of a rant than a well laid-out impression.Gnomoria seems to be done well enough for an Early Access title - what's there is good enough. What's not there, well, is a huge pile of features that hopefully will be added one day. Seems fairly lackluster, right? But somehow Gnomoria plays good enough to drag me in. Building structures and designing layouts in the isometric view is enjoyable if a little limited for now due to the small variety of blocks. The camera can be a little awkward at times but the basic 4-way rotation saves the day in most cases.

The economy is reasonable in terms of the supply chains - there are only a few basic resources to keep track of - making it easy to grasp the basics. But the dozens of ways to process and utilize those resources make for a deeply-interconnected web of processing pathways and making the most of available time and resources can be a challenge, as it should be! Nevertheless, it can also be a god-forsaken nightmare to manage the economy, mostly because of the Gnomes. There is no direct control over the peons and their activities, and even though a task priority system is in place it lacks fine-tuning and control within each task group (e.g. prioritising construction of one building over another). That's made even more difficult by the fact that there are way too few Gnomes to fill all the roles much less do it efficiently. Gnomes only join the settlement at the beginning of each season, their numbers and skills random, and the total population is capped with regards to the total worth of the settlement.

Now it'd be alright if time was not your enemy and Gnomes never died - sadly, neither is true. Unless playing in the Peaceful mode which disables enemies your Gnomes WILL BE KILLED by the dozen each season. Enemies are merciless, spawn with no regards to your wishes or objections, and even on Easy combat difficulty the game is god.damn HARD. What this means is that on top of managing the basic economy with way too few Gnomes at your disposal you still need to keep up the military production (weapons, armors, bandages) and training (which takes Gnomes off other tasks, naturally). Did I mention the game was difficult? No? Well it is!For a brief summary I'll say Gnomoria is a decent sandbox title that has a lot of potential. It is also god.damn hard. If you like sandboxes and/or difficult management sims Gnomoria is a good choice.			"

												Gnomoria was a “best effort” at making a more easily accessible clone of Dwarf Fortress that unfortunately falls flat on its face due to lack of developer support and the clunky isometric view that makes doing things like building vertical stair columns really awkward. It’s hard to argue in favor of this game when alternatively, you could go download Dwarf Fortress with a tile set for free and just watch a few tutorial videos to learn the ropes.			"

												I haven't really played since mods were allowed but I will say if you liked Dwarf Fortress but hated the excessive granularity of it, then this is the perfect streamlined experience of that. Of course, streamlining something like Dwarf fortress is a little bit of a complicated proposal, but Gnomoria does an excellent job of being infinitely more approachable, at the very least.			"

												This is a great game that I very much enjoy.  Unfortunately it has been released as 1.0 with far too many extant bugs and missing content (i.e. 'Armor' skill does nothing, at all)  for it to be a 1.0 release.  As such I cannot reccommend this game despite my enjoyment.  I expect that the minimum of content will be modded into the game with the workshop however the number and frequency of bugs make this game frustrating to play for any length of time.  Me review is a dissapointed ""No"" for this game due to playability, and nothing else.			"

												Gnomoria suffers from two major problems. 1) There are better free games (albeit more complex and less ""pretty"") that it fails to live up to, and 2) It suffers from a very common problem that games that have very long, paid ""early access"" phases. By the tiem they leave early access (and some never do) they often have LESS features than if they would have had a shorter, free closed beta process.  This game looks decent, and feels like it has potential, but that potential is not lived up to.  There are so many things I feel should have been in here - actually FEEL like they are the logical next micro-step - but are not there. Mechanisms are a great example of them.And finally I believe price always have to play into decisions to buy a game regardless of how good or bad it is.  Bottom line is that I feel like I wasted too much money on this purchase.			"

												HUGE downside: NO TUTORIALI haven't played very long yet, to be honest, but the reason for this is that there is no tutorial. I enjoy playing games like this, but something I find that completely ruins a game like this for me is the complete lack of tutorial. I can get into a game but I am not the type who can just figure things out on my own. Even just a basic ""Here's how you build things, these keys do this, here's the more in depth guide"" would be nice. There is no explanation for what each function does, not even just a short blip when you hover over it. I am aware that there are player made guides, and them seem nice, but it is rather absurd to me that there isn't some form of tutorial on this. And from the sound of things, the dev is never touching the game again, which I find disappointing,			"

								Gnomoria is an isometric civilization builder. It is clear that Gnomoria is heavily influenced by (because saying 'steals from' is frowned upon) the incredibly popular but also incredibly difficult and intimidating game Dwarf Fortress (which I also love) but makes it more user-friendly and forgiving.The game can be both brutally punishing and immensely rewarding. Playing your first game will end in inevitable death, probably during the first enemy invasion or your first winter. It is to be expected. As you gradually push further and further with each new civilization you found, you become more attuned to the importance of certain resources and the nuance of city design. Finding ways to optimize building and planning are not taught to you by the game, but learned through bloody trial-and-error. Six or seven games, you'll find your stockpiles bursting before the start of your first winter and the initial goblin invasion cute at best.Gnomoria is a game where you need to be willing to fail (and fail hard), but also be ready—perhaps even eager—to try again. You'll reach a point where all of your gnomes have tasted delicious goblin sausage and are waiting, steel armor and swords gleaming in the summer sun, sweating with anticipation at the next attack, ready for their next meal to charge into battle with them like the little monsters they are.I should point out that your gnomes are the monsters in the scenario, not the goblins, and you will be proud of them for it.

								Horrendously addictive. The early access status shows, but it's not so prolifically pre-alpha as some games that dare to charge you money. While somewhat difficult to start with as you figure out what's going on, it’s not overly complicated. This has what Anno2070 lacks. Soul. Every gnome counts and you’ll find yourself grimacing as the limp body of yet another fallen gnome civilian, viciously slain by goblins, is carried away by his comrades. Your rag tag band of little survivors soldier on with missing eyes, and legs. Scarred and worn, often collapsing of exhaustion, they build on; improving defences and economy so that no further comrades fall victim to the bleak winter where nothing grows, or the vicious mountain bears waiting to pounce on unsuspecting apple pickers.

								I'm on the fence whether I should recommend this game or not. On one hand, i've gotten a decent 20 hours or so of actual play time out of it. On the other hand, I've completely discarded it and returned to Dwarf Fortress, which is free.I suppose I will recommend it based on the fact that it is decently enjoyable. For me the game was painfully easy to learn and master, which is the only real issue I have with it. There is no real end game. Once you have a sizeable fortress and a decent number of gnomes, all manner of goblins, ogres, beetles, and skeletons will become trivial.I suppose for 8$, 20 hours is acceptable. Keep in mind that I love this type of game, and have sunk hundreds of hours into games such as Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, Majesty, The Guild 2, etc. However, I loathe Minecraft which has a similar draw of ""make structures that look pretty."" So if you enjoy games like that, you may find more appeal in this one after you've conquered the challenges it presents.			"

								THIS GAME IS EVERYTHING I WANTED FROM DWARF FORTRESS WITH THE ADDITION OF A GOOD INTERFACE. It's a city builder with minecraft-like freedom, and a superb emphasis on managing your ""citizens"" (gnomes) as they each have diverse sets of skills, making each one of them incredibly valuable in their own way. It's tragic when even one dies during a goblin siege, or bear attack, as their absence will cripple your smooth running operation, and force you to shift responsibilities until the next migrant wave.I name the gnomes after my friends, as if to depict the fictional setting where we survived the apocalypse and are starting a settlement together. It makes it funny, and even more tragic when someone dies.I cannot stop playing it.			"

								Gnomoria is a surprisingly fun and addictive game. If you've ever been curious about Dwarf Fortress, but were intimidated by the lack of UI and graphics, Gnomoria is a fantastic game to jump into. Orders you give to your gnomes will be followed according to the guidelines you set. You do not directly control them, but you affect how they behave by determining the gnome's professions, priorities,  and other parameters you impose. It becomes an extremely fun balancing act of figuring out exactly how to acheive true efficiency while also struggling to plan ahead. The more expansive and 'worthy' your empire becomes, the greater dangers arrive to destroy it. It takes hours to finally feel like you've gotten a foothold in the world you've generated, but when you do, you feel a great sense of pride in what your tiny gnome society has accomplished. The only gripes I would have would be the lack of variety in environments as well as the flora and fauna. New biomes as well as new animals and trees would make this game way more replayable. Also, this game has no form of tutorial so the learning curve is quite steep. It took me 3 different restarts before I fully understood the importance of key aspects of the game like action priorities, training a strong military, and proper item storage to name a few. The wiki and video tutorials should definitely be used when first starting off. Beyond that, the game is definitely worth the eight dollar inevestment and is worth your time. If you've ever been inquisitive about these types of strategy games, Gnomoria is a charming and enjoyable place to start.			"

								Casual version of Dwarf Fortress that seems to lack some of the finer mechanics. I feel like there needs to be a triple speed function instead of just normal and 2x. Your gnomes won't really think of using other workshops if you build them after starting an order and they usually try to make everything out of wood. The mason shop will sit empty as they furiously use one carpenter bench to fill out an order for 8 chairs and tables. The UI is pretty good, only thing that bothered me was you can't right click for orders when you're highlighting a stockpile. Combat is alright but you have to manually access the event logs to read the fight details in a tiny window. Overall a pretty solid game if you can't get into DF because of its interface.			"

The controls are good (the U.I. is a little clunky, but very workable). It's an all-around fun, challenging, frustrating experience that I'm already hooked on.The only issue is a few minor problems with actions being performed in the order you want them or some of your commands being ignored, but most of these can easily be resolved.I would highly recommend that people that enjoy games like minecraft or terraria and are interested in a top-down god-game with a similar feel try this game out.

								UPDATE: With Dwarf fortress newest release 42.05, it really blows Gnomoria out of the water in terms of depth. Still recommended, just less so. I've probably spent 2-3 times the hours played in Dwarf fortress than Gnomoria since I last wrote the Gnomoria review, so I definitely prefer DF.If you loved Dwarf Fortress, but wish it was just a little easier on the interface and the eyes, look no further than Gnomoria. Gnomoria vs. Dwarf Fortress Comparison: Interface: Average versus Horrible. Graphics: Average versus Horrible. Overall Depth: Good versus Amazing. Combat Depth: Average versus Great (Upgraded DF's combat depth due to recent release that have mercenaries and more usable war animals). Mechanism/Trap Customization: Average versus Amazing Simulation/Realism: Average versus Amazing.Learning Curve: High versus Colossal. (2 hrs versus 12 hrs)Pacing: Superb versus Good. -----Further comment on pacing: Gnomoria imho has amazing pacing, it takes forever to achieve things in Gnomoria, but it doesn't feel that way until you stare at the clock and realize you just lost 5 hours setting up 5 rooms because of the four intervening goblin raids with Ogre support and food shortage. Yet, you were having a blast and didn't notice how much time went by. This sort of time loss never happens to me these days; it says a lot that this game is able to recreate it.			"

								So, starting with the obvious: you might heard or know of another game called Dwarf Fortress. This is indeed very similar, yet it's very worth your time in its own. Think of this as DF a hundred times more relaxed and less complex, but a thousand times prettier. I would call it a friendlier Dwarf Fortress.Now, if you really don't know anything about either game, this is a management / sandbox game. You start with a crew of settler gnomes, and that's pretty much it; you're thrown into the wild and after that it depends on you; these gnomes can and will use materials around them at your command, build structures as complex as you can imagine, fight your battles and of course, deplete your alcohol and foods. Doing these simple things plus all the intrincate delicacies will take most of your time, and as you expect from any good game... you won't know how much time you have sunk in here.10/10 "

												Good concept, everything works well, except that the combat system is garbage. Gnomes run to their deaths at the first sign of ennemies regardless of personal safety. There should be an override action to tell gnomes what to do on an individual basis other than the generic profession checkboxes. SInce Combat is a big part of the game, it should be possible to gather whatever gnomes you wish in groups through a selection box, like say all strategy games out there, and click on an ennemy to attack, or move away to safety, as opposed to the system that is in place now, which is, to say the least, garbage. I'm sure it's possible to code this in such a way that you can put the current automation programming on hold with an override option, and then revert back to automation once satisifed with whatever you wanted to do in the first place. Sadly this is not so. Buy this game if you have nohing better to do, in my opinion it's unfinished and unpolished. I don't think there was a proper update on this in a long while, its a shame because this game has a lot of potential. Is it playable? Yes. Is it fun? For a while, if you dont mind saving a lot and alt tab quitting to exit the game because there's no better way to exit this without saving. For a micromanagement game this fails miserably to satisfy my ocd. It's a shame because the building aspect is actually fun.			"

												I first bought this game in June of 2012 on Desura. I played about 150 hours before I activated my Steam key. Since activating I've played almost 180 hours more. The developer has been diligently churning out regular updates and solid communication for the four years I've owned it. He has listened to the community and truly shows how early access can work well.Gnomoria is one of the greatest base-building games ever. The random start conditions (and extensive options for customized starts) result in a new challenge each time. It's frequently punishing, occassionally frustrating, and consistently fun. Players can enjoy a complex village sim with emergent gameplay that rewards patience and perseverance. There have been many who have described Gnomoria as ""Dwarf Fortress Lite,"" which is not entirely inaccurate, but it's (mostly) modern UI and colorful sprites make it far easier to overcome it's learning curve. It's easily one of the friendliest dwarves building fortresses games out there.I highly recommend Gnomoria.			"

It's deeply rewarding in the same way Civilisation is, you'll be playing and saying, ""Just one more day."" and before you know it it's 9 AM and you're late for work.

												Just as my two cents, but if you come to this game not loving Dwarf Fortress already this game is most definately a effort in futility. Sure, its buggy. Its not quite complete. Its not as feature rich as dwarf fortress. Its more casual. But its still got that same old Dwarf Fortress heart, and thats honestly what makes it tick.If you just want to walk into this game to see what Dwarf Fortress is about, your going to leave hating this game. Its simply too dense, and the initial curve is a direct brick wall with not a lot of reward. Those of us who've done this before though, this is the casual romp to scratch that itch - with upgraded graphics! "

								I really enoy this game but find myself getting frustrated a lot with it too!  I find that my gnomes frequently suddenly refuse to do any work and wander around aimlessly and my squads never seem to respond to the command to attack.  They only do battle if they can see the enemy.Yaks and Emus never get moved into new pastures so they just wander around the map.I think it would be useful if new gnomes should be automatically set professions according to their skills.  Or there should be a way to easily determine which gnomes have nothing set.I love the challenges of this game but when your two most reliable miners, who seem to be the only ones who ever DO any mining, get attacked by a golem and no military back up turns up to help - it is SO INFURIATING.The gameplay itself is great and I enjoy it.  I sometimes feel that a quicker spped setting would be helpful and perhaps a way to directly tell a gnome to stop what it's doing and do what you need it to would be a blessing.Keep up the great work, I've only been playing a week or two, so haven't picked up on any changes but I am sure I will!  It is an awesome game, the bugs just make it difficult at times!			"

								Gnomoria is a great Game It is one of the Games that you can turn on and play a bit but u can also play it over a long period of time and see how ure kingdom grows and how you establish trade routes with other realms.The pros of the Game are that it is a replayable game and that you can play it actually over a longer period of time on the same map and it isnt like in lets say minecraft that you can achive easily the highest level of tool and whatsoever and the enemys in the Game are Quite ""annoying"" but i have to say in a good way.The cons are that you can easily get addicted to it and play a few hours straight (i played 12h without rly noticing it (i thought i only played a hour or so)). I guess the Game is grate I would give it something like a 9/10I recomend the Game for everyone how wants to see his kingdom rise and who wants to get in an everlasting war against the Goblins ;).

								I've been playing Gnomoria for a while now and it's the game I keep coming back to.  Regular updates and very fun content give good replay value and once you learn the mechanics, starting over after a wild honey badger dismembers your colony, or when that first goblin turns out to be a kung fu master, is a lot easier.I've been burned ALOT by early access games that have gotten abandoned, are too buggy to play, or that promise a lot of great things that you find are not in the game yet when you buy it.  Gnomoria has delivered in spades on what was promised and remains one of the best early access titles that I have purchased.  Well worth the price of admission!  8 bucks, are you kidding me,  SOLD!If you liked Dwarf Fortress style games, but are looking for something that is more approchable without the vertical learning curve of DF, then this would be a good experience for you.  If you already are familiar with Dwarf Fortress, then most of the mechanics will be immediatly familiar.  And if you've never tried either this is definately a good starting point, though read some guides.Great job RoboBob!			"

								Its like Minecraft meets the Sims meets Dwarf Fortress.Resource gathering and crafting like Minecraft.  Dig holes, carve stairs, collect and smelt ores, harvest trees, collect food, create tools, weapons, armor, traps, furniture, and more.You don't do things, you tell your gnomes to do it, kinda like the Sims.  And the best part is, you can set the task or an area of tasks and the best qualified gnome or gnomes will do it.  Clear cut that forest!  Mine that 10 x 24 area!  Make 20 chestplates!  And the more robust your kingdom, the more likely you are to attract more suckers!  Ahem.  Gnomes, more gnomes.Invasions, enemies, death and dismemberment.  The combat logs show quite a bit of data and some rather unexpected things can happen, unexpected and permanent things.  So and so slashes the goblin's left arm.  Goblin drops its shield.Goblin stabs past the cuirass, through the chest, through the ribs, and into the heart.  So and so is bleeding.  So and so is dead.Honey Badger bites so and so's leg and tears it off.  So and so lost their left leg. (permanently for now)But dismemberment doesn't mean death, but it does mean limited functionality for your gnome.  Do you let the one legged wonder hobble around and craft in the workshop, leave their job as is and wonder how good a one armed woodsman is, or do you tell them to strip and go attack that bear's stomach from the inside?It might look limiting at first because the surface world doesn't go on seemingly forever like Minecraft, or all that far at all.  However, it does go down quite far (-100 and still digging).  I haven't seen how far myself, but think the Mines of Moria from LoTR.  Yes, treasures can be found deep, but so can other dangers...  Bring lots of torches!Anyway, I've logged roughly 40 or so hours, and even in its rough and unfinished stage, it is a blast that I can't get enough of.

								I recommend this game for those searching for a game similar to DF (and a lot of patience). Among indie games, I find this more polished and fun than others. Recently, I've seen many early access games on managing a town/castle like this but Gnomoria is the one that has basic features implented for now. Gnomoria is also quite challenging, 45 hours of playtime is merely at the stage of grasping the basics of this game. For me, it took 5 hours to understand digging and building, 10 more hours to understand creating items and extra 25 to know I was doing it all wrong. On the other hand, this game is rather unfriendly; no tutorials, no explanation except a little bit of text that can be found in Help menu. Around 30-40 different buttons to utilize, yet without any description on what it does. Some are straight forward, setting up a farm area is one. But other buttons such as Dig Stairs Up and Mine Stairs Down may be a little bit confusing combined with 3D textile map in which tiles overlap each other. For those who likes to rage quit or play very casually (playing most games on normal or easy difficulty), Gnomoria is not recommended.			"

								So far, The Kingdom of Tiera has thrived through at least three years of Development with only six people lost and 20 Alive, My Kingdom is built within an Mountain which is surrounded by thick walls (2 blocks thick). Of late, the goblins have took the arm of one of my most prized builder (Who made gifts for the goblins) , she died shortly after losing it, but in the fall was a greater lost. In the fall of the second year, my strongest warrior sacrificed herself to fend off an first-sighted Mant, after the battle she sustained her wound for at least 2 hours, slowly bleeding out without the care of the nurse, which I later blamed for her death, since she refused to treat her (R.I.P Pixel, the greatest warrior there ever was).On the sides of our mountains, there are fields which possess strawberries, cotton, and wheat, which provides my people their needs all year long, fill the storehouse to the brim with food and cloth, also fill everyone's room with a bed. A nearby mountain has been turned into a mine, where we mine for copper and metal to suit our soldiers at arms with good equipment such as armor and weapons, which allows to them to face off against the Goblins and Wildlife. Our Soldiers are our pride and strength, making Tiera an strong nation, They train daily at the Training grounds in hope of being as great as Pixel, who killed 10 goblins, 2 honey badgers, and a Dirt golem but was sadly killed by a mant and a careless nurse.This Kingdom still lives on in these lands to this day, which may someday conquer over all foes who challenges it as well as the land of the Severed land merchant kingdom and the Goblin kingdom.

								Close to 300 hours logged...wish this game was procedurally generated to be infinite like minecraft and i wish this game was multiplayer.  i'd be willing to give up the ability to pause.  the gui needs work, even just a hud that shows more info about gnomes and stockpiles.  other than that, this game is solid and a lot of fun if you like town management games.  the ai is very tight and when something doesn't happen like you expect it, experience has shown me that it has been my fault *EVERY time.  8/10 for lacking multiplayer.

								I really love this game because it's a a challenging sandbox strategy mash-up. Some times it can be frustrating when bad things happen, but other than that it's a really enjoyable experience. I love seeing the little dudes run around doing my bidding, and it's especially hilarious if you save the combat logs and read those.Be warned: this game does not hold your hand, so you'll have to either figure things out through trial and error, or look up a guide online to get the basics down. That being said, it's still worth it. Don't be afraid of the 'Early Access'; it's still a robust game that can keep you entertained for hours.  As of writing this I'm at just under 90 hours, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface (which may or may not be from restarting more than a couple times....)Be wary of digging too deeply and too gredily...

								Gnomoria is a game were you controll (as in there jobs) a group of gnoms can do anything from farming to crafting or to building amazing castles or dangerous dungeons. You need to have them build a kingdom ( or queendom dempending on what you want) to thrive and prosper through the peralis world while defending yourself through theifs and monsters that want to plunder your materials and crafts or just murder everyone. You can also have them build stalls to attrack merchants as your kingdoms wealth increases and buy and sell things like animals food and materials. Although its a pretty neat game the gnomes AI on how to complete tasks like replacing floor tiles is a bit wonky. Your gnomes will comonly get stuck and die if left to there own devices so you do have to mannage them frequently. Plus they dont like to build things like workshops if theres other jobs that need to be done. All in all it is a decent game with a few major bugs that will be worked out eventually and so on.			"

								There's a lot of work still to be done, but it's turning out to be a very nice Dwarf Fortress clone.  I'm glad to see that it handles the biggest shortcoming that DF had.  GUI and Graphics.  Of course it still lacks the insane amount of depth that DF has.  This is expected, and the dev is on the right track.  If you enjoyed DF and want better graphics for it, then this is the game for you.  I feel that this game could eventually be much more than DF not only because the dev seems to have a better head on his shoulders but the game will probably have really awsome mods.BTW, the game seems really stable, the Dev is just adding features.

								One can only hope that it will inherit every single ounce of madness and complexity as it's genre father Dwarf Fortress. So far, it does well. It is still compareably... simple if you look at the planetary measurements of Dwarf Fortress, where the biology of creatures is equaly random generated as the whole world and the political conflicts between nations are computed and felt in real time. But, I must say it is very nice to actually have graphics in a game, a feature that Dwarf Fortress only realy gets with mods. Grow, Gnomoria!			"

								Highly enjoyable, very developed internal economy with the various shops and resources, excellent backwards-compatibility as each update rolls out, too. I haven't had to restart my savegame in a while. Widely adjustable difficulty from zero enemies up to punishing yourself. Excellent interface with fully customizable keybinds. Well-polished visual elements, excellent notification system and a great customizable ""tracked items"" list in the display.In short, the massive leap forward Towns was over Dwarf Fortress was a small step compared to the leap Gnomoria takes forward from Towns.

And some of the mechanics are not completely working as expected. But there are frequent updates (every 2-3 weeks at least).The visual style is what it sets apart from the original Dwarfen Fortress.

								The game can be hard to get used to for people new to this type of thing, and it took me at least three games to figure out how to keep everyone alive and fed, but once you get the hang of it this is a really great and entertaining game. You have full control over what happens in your kingdom, and aside from a few bugs, the gnomes do what you tell them to do. It will take a little bit of work to figure out what workshops you need for what materials, and until they put in a true tutorial it's mostly trial and error, but once you get the hang of it it's awesome.

								So far, The Kingdom of Tiera has thrived through at least three years of Development with only six people lost and 20 Alive, My Kingdom is built within an Mountain which is surrounded by thick walls (2 blocks thick). Of late, the goblins have took the arm of one of my most prized builder (Who made gifts for the goblins) , she died shortly after losing it, but in the fall was a greater lost. In the fall of the second year, my strongest warrior sacrificed herself to fend off an first-sighted Mant, after the battle she sustained her wound for at least 2 hours, slowly bleeding out without the care of the nurse, which I later blamed for her death, since she refused to treat her (R.I.P Pixel, the greatest warrior there ever was).On the sides of our mountains, there are fields which possess strawberries, cotton, and wheat, which provides my people their needs all year long, fill the storehouse to the brim with food and cloth, also fill everyone's room with a bed. A nearby mountain has been turned into a mine, where we mine for copper and metal to suit our soldiers at arms with good equipment such as armor and weapons, which allows to them to face off against the Goblins and Wildlife. Our Soldiers are our pride and strength, making Tiera an strong nation, They train daily at the Training grounds in hope of being as great as Pixel, who killed 10 goblins, 2 honey badgers, and a Dirt golem but was sadly killed by a mant and a careless nurse.This Kingdom still lives on in these lands to this day, which may someday conquer over all foes who challenges it as well as the land of the Severed land merchant kingdom and the Goblin kingdom.

								Gnomoria is literally perfect. I have played ~80 hours of Dwarf Fortress and loved it, but Gnomovia is a perfect mix of DF and GUI. I think I have dumped more hours into Gnomoria than any other single game in the last year or so (other than perhaps Minecraft).The price is honestly too low - and updates are still rolling in. This is an instant classic. I should also mention that the music is 10/10 super good.			"

								This is a thinking game.You play the 'overseer' of a band of gnomes. You cannot control the actions of the gnomes directly, you have to assign tasks and the gnomes will complete them in order, based on the priority of their occupation and the priority of the workspace, both of which can be customized. You can trade with other nations, which show up on your Kingdom list, for things you need that you cannot produce yourself, or just choose not to produce. If your gnomes die, there is a good chance that some, if not all, will be replenished at the beginning of the next season by new immigrants from these other nations.The first year is fairly simple, as you won't encounter too many hostile challenges unless you dig too deeply. After that, the Goblins come. Their strength is based on the value of your kingdom, so the more powerful you become, the more powerful they become. They come to slaughter your livestock, kill your gnomes, and steal whatever they can carry away... and they will love every minute they are murdering your gnomes. Building walls is no absolute security either. If they cannot find a path to your gnomes, they will employ 'diggers' after a while to get through your walls.As if goblins were the only problem, underground you can encounter beetles which breed terrifyingly fast, zombies (which infect your gnomes!) and skeletons. Allow your food or drink stockpiles to grow too large, and the smell will attract mants, which are man-ants (gnome-sized) which will also come to steal your food, kill your livestock, and kill your gnomes if they get a chance.To defend yourself, you can have your gnomes craft armor, weapons, traps, and even design elaborate death-traps to kill off invaders, if they work, once you have had a gnome research the tech they need. They can build practically anything out of the materials they find around, even bone can be a building or armor material.A good game that requires almost no hand-eye coordination but a great deal of planning.

								Great little village/kingdom management game inspired by Dwarf Fortress and several other games.  If, like me, you loved DF but found it a bit too complicated, then Gnomoria's definitely worth a shot.  For an Early Access game, it's got a lot of stuff to play with.  There's plenty of content to keep you entertained for quite some time, and more is added on a regular basis.  There are plenty of options to customize the game to your liking, and mods are also available.If you're not too familiar with this type of game, I strongly recommend trying the demo first.  Gnomoria is definitely not for everyone, especially those who expect to be able to jump right in without doing some reading first.  The demo is available at gnomoria.com.			"

								This game is adorable! It's a great sandbox type game as long as you don't mind looking up a tutorial before you play. The game has no tutorial itself, and it was difficult to learn what to do on my own. After watching someone else play it on Youtube however, I really came to like it. You have to build a village and defend it from your goblin enemies. The worth of your Kingdom determines how many gnomads show up at the beginning of every season. The game can be quite challenging at the start when you only have a few gnomes, but once your first batch of gnomads come in things get much easier.			"

								 GNOMORIA is great. Is a DWARF FORTRESS with better graphics, less events, and easier to learn.That said, it´s EASIER TO LEARN THAN DWARF FORTRESS, not EASY... expect a challenge: you WILL have to figure out how things work, and until you do you will be beaten senseless by goblin hordes. After you fail misaribly a few times (because you will), you´ll start to work on better strategies that WILL defeat entire hordes of goblins without loosing even one Gnome: building and testing floor traps with a 10 level fall, building pistols and ammo, fully steel armored gnomes in front to hold enemies, statue building for trading, specializing a Gnome in Tinkering only to have access to inventions, duplicating farm groves... not for the weak willed!

								I could never get into Dwarf Fortress because of the interface & because I don't have as much time on my hands as I'd like. Gnomoria has enough content for a filthy casual like me to be able to pick up & tinker with, without squinting at a ton of ASCII screens or fiddling with mods to enhance the graphics.The Gnomoria art style could be considered basic, but I like the look of it and it does the job.Being time-light, I need a game I can pick up & play straight off, and you can do that to a certain extent in Gnomoria but your little kingdom won't last long. It really could do with a tutorial mode, but the game is Early Access, and as the devs are patching and adding content it would probably make a tutorial a bit of a pain to implement. Maybe some popup gameplay tips could be implemented instead?TL;DR - Simplified version of Dwarf Fortress. If you ike the idea of that, take a punt.I give it 4 out of 5 yak skulls. "

People have claimed this is ""Dwarf Fortress Light"", which is true in one sense, but I feel it's kind of gone off on its own path lately and you can't really compare the two that much anymore. This one is WAY easier to get into whereas DF (despite it's tremendous depth) is hard to start out because it's all in ascii characters and not graphics. I -want- the depth of DF but I'm quite content with an ever developing Gnomoria where it will one day get to that point.			"

								YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME>>>>>I have tried countless Dwarf Fortress style games and none of them come close to Gnomoria's level of detail and fair challenge. There is a learning curve if you dont read guides online, there are times you will completely work yourself into a corner, and there are times you will scratch your head and go ""why isn't this working the way I thought it would."" But everything in this game is built with a reliance on something else. Learning those relationships and how to maximize your productivity is exceptionally fun (in my opinion) especially when the game is so fair. Every time I've lost a gnome, starved out my colony, or dug too deep too quick (you'll see why) I would sit back, cry a little about the last 20 hours that I just burned into the ground, and say ""ok... that's fair... lets try again.""If you've ever sunk 200 turns into Civilization after swearing you'd go to bed this game is no different. ""Just another 10 minutes"" always turns into hours of doing things! Alot of these games have moments of busy work then a sit back and watch factor but I have ALWAYS found something to do with every minute in Gnomoria. I know this might just sound like a gush about the game but I absolutely love this title and the dev is still updating frequently. You owe it to yourself to buy Gnomoria. You owe it to yourself to sink a few months into it. As Shia says: JUST. DO. IT.			"

The AI is very smart and I've yet to see a glitch of a gnome not doing their job or not healing themselves after getting stabebd or anything like that. Lots of stats for each gnome and ways to make your kingdom grow and prosper the best it possibly can and defend it from the evil goblins and agressive animal life as best as you can. One day you can have a kingdom of 30 gnomes, the next you could have 2, walling them off and keeping them alive as best you can until next season where 20 more gnomes will arrive, completely unaware that they will be just another name in the ""Deceased"" tab by the end of the season.

This game, is worth the money, sure it has a limited tech tree, sure it has some bugs from time to time, sure it has some really cheap deaths and trheats that range from free meat to kindom crushing. But, I came back everytime, and one you figure out you're own style of doing this game, you'll come back too.Why you ask?Because, building your settlement up from spring of year one is always a fun time, especialy if you try and rush bone needles. beause sometimes gnomes are such ♥♥♥♥ing badasses, like one shotting bears with ♥♥♥♥ing beds, or striving though a lost limb to sway the tide in battle and save the colony for another mounth. You'll come back because of the awesome things you can do with the mecanics. You'll come back because the mods are alive and well and offer some sweet changes in game play. But most imporantly of all, you'll come back, because this game is ♥♥♥♥ing FUN!So don't just decide not to buy it because you think it's unfishined, buy it because what's done, is wroth it!			"

I especially miss blood mechanic... for... science purpose.... not to give my colony to drink, which reminds me, there are no seasonal effects other then that you cant grow crops in the winter, i would love to see some ice/snow so that you need a water reservoir and maybe clothes/fires to keep the gnomes warm.Otherwise I love the game, as I'm writing this review i have played 225 hours of gnomoria and will play this game for a long time to come.

It probably took me about 30hours of gameplay to come to grips with the mechanics.  THe developer has been regularly addiing, updating, fixing things with this game for quite some time.  These often mean I am starting a new game simply with the aim of trying one of the new features.			"

								FINALLY! A game that essentially is Dwarf Fortress without the awfulness of a keyboard-only interface. That's basically it. You'd be surprised how much easier the game is to play with just the simple addition of a GUI and mouse input. A tutuorial would be nice, but DF doesn't have one either. I've only played for a couple hours, but so far this feels like a very close port of DF, but with graphics and a mouse.			"

								Now, when a game is ""Abandoned"" by it's developers, many people start to post negative reviews, and I've decied to update mine to adress this point. This game, is worth the money, sure it has a limited tech tree, sure it has some bugs from time to time, sure it has some really cheap deaths and trheats that range from free meat to kindom crushing. But, I came back everytime, and one you figure out you're own style of doing this game, you'll come back too.Why you ask?Because, building your settlement up from spring of year one is always a fun time, especialy if you try and rush bone needles. beause sometimes gnomes are such ♥♥♥♥ing badasses, like one shotting bears with ♥♥♥♥ing beds, or striving though a lost limb to sway the tide in battle and save the colony for another mounth. You'll come back because of the awesome things you can do with the mecanics. You'll come back because the mods are alive and well and offer some sweet changes in game play. But most imporantly of all, you'll come back, because this game is ♥♥♥♥ing FUN!So don't just decide not to buy it because you think it's unfishined, buy it because what's done, is wroth it!			"

								To some people this might seem like a cheap, crappy knockoff of Dwarf Fortress, devoid of the detail that makes DF really amazing, and that's a fair point of view. If, on the other hand, you just like making elaborate underground warrens and not having to struggle with incomprehensible ASCII graphics and a terrible UI, Gnomoria is worth a shot.The only thing Gnomoria really needs is more content.

Im still always looking forward to the next update, see it developing even more deep strategic options.There are bugs but periodically fixex  with the updates, my only problem is the really loadingtime.

								Gnomoria is a game in which you start out with a small team of 9 Gnomes and are tasked with giving those Gnomes various jobs with the ultimate goal of turning the wilderness you start off in into a bustling kingdom. As the value of your kingdom increases, you will attract more ""Gnomads"", and gain the attention of other kingdoms, both friendly and hostile. If you don't want to deal with the latter, you can set the difficulty to ""Peaceful"", which eliminates enemy spawns. The game only ends if your kingdom is completely wiped out, or if you get bored and give up. This might sound a bit familiar to some people, as Dwarf Fortress (and Dungeon Keeper, The Settlers, and Anno) was a big inspiration for the game. The developer clearly states this in the FAQ on the game's official website. This game does not have the sheer, unbridled complexity of Dwarf Fortress. It makes up for this by being much more accessible while still having a good amount of depth, and having its own innovations and ways of doing things compared to DF.Now, the game currently lacks a tutorial, so you will need to either spend the first few hours experimenting to get a feel for things, or consult a guide/wiki while you are playing to speed things up. If that's a dealbreaker for you, I'd suggest waiting until the tutorial is actually implemented, whenever that is. That all being said, the game is still more immediately accessible than DF in my opinion due the graphics and simple mouse-based interface. The game also does not have any actual animation for character movement, somewhat true to its inspiration, but I have personally never found this to be an obstacle to my enjoyment. All it means is that the sprites ""jump around"" from one tile to the next rather than spending frames actually animating their arms and legs moving, which actually speeds everything up. There's also only one biome available right now, but there are plans to add some more eventually (the two specifically mentioned in the development roadmap are ""Desert"" and ""Jungle"").The game is under active development, with updates coming fairly regularly with a schedule of one update every 2 weeks (minus the occasional hotfix). New features are added often, and as is often the case with such things new bugs will pop up. That being said, the game is very stable and the vast majority of bugs are a mere annoyance. There's nothing truly gamebreaking to worry about.A common question that comes up on the Steam discussion forums is ""how does this game compare to Towns?"". I have not actually played Towns, but I know enough to at least say that the gimmick of ""attracting Heroes and having them clear out a huge dungeon for you so your citizens can bring up the loot"" is not present in Gnomoria. You have to dig your own mines, and you'll have to organize your own military to deal with the problem if you find yourself encountering monsters while you're doing it.Bottomline: If you're the type of person who is enamored by the idea of Dwarf Fortress, but really just don't want to deal with learning how to wrangle with DF's unintuitive keyboard interface, or if you find DF to be essentially unplayable without throwing a bunch of mods on top of it and just don't want to deal with that, I cannot recommend Gnomoria enough. If you have no idea what Dwarf Fortress even is, but like the concept of the game described at the top of this review, I'd also say it's worth checking out.			"

Early Access Review
								I'd like to start off by saying that I noticed a trend in the negative reviews for this game.  Mostly that nearly all of them have between 4 and 10 negative votes and I'm willing to bet it's the same 4 to 10 petty people who abhore critisism in any form of something they can see only as being unequivicably perfect.  That being said, this game still has some serious faults but considering that it is still in the development phase I think at least most of them are forgivable.VISUAL: Retro, pseudo-3D, 16bit.  I grew up on this kind of game art style so I particularly like it.  It's cheap but effective.  This game is often compared to Terraria but if I had to choose it would be this game.  I like having a small army at my disposal over a singluar character.  The graphics and sprites are probably still being tweaked and after looking at earlier screen shots the game is only getting better in that regard.AUDIO: I like the music, but I'm weird.  I don't like all of the tracks but it's more than one singular song that plays repeatedly so I have to give it that.  I try to keep away from where my Gnomes are working because the sound effects are a bit grating but other than that it has a nice retro feel to it that keeps with the art style.GAMEPLAY:  And now for the meat of the review.  The part of the game that has the most issues but also the most potential.  Let's kick this part off with the elephant in the room.  There is no tutorial for this life sim strategy based game.  There is a good reason for that, the base game is not finished yet.  It's still in development and making a tutorial would take away from getting the game to a finished, balanced, and polished state.  The tutorial will--hopefully--come with the v1.0 update.  Beyond that, there are several guides on YouTube that are easy to find and easy to follow to learn how to play this game.  Even finding older tutorials is enough to give you a basic grasp of the game.The game starts paused.  You need to clear a large area of flat land for farming and pasture.  Start with foraging, then clipping trees, then fell some trees, then replace any clay spots with dirt, and mark off your farms, pastures, and groves.  You also want to dig into the hills and start building your fort.  Designate a small stockpile for soil and stone, and larger stock piles for everything else you need.  You need to start building up your workshops once you get inside.  Start with the crude work bench then find your way through the other workshops until you get to the tailor so you can make beds to sleep on.Here's what the game doesn't tell you and several older guides don't cover:  You need to go into the population menu, pick a Gnome, go to skills, go to Misc Craft, and turn on bone carving.  As far as I have found, this is so far the singular skill that is not immediately attached to any class and has to be manually turned on.  There is NOTHING in the game so far that indicates that this needs to be done or how to do it, but it is crucial to advancing the game.  Once it is turned on, that Gnome should eventually go to the station to make the bone needle.  You will have to wait until at least your first summer to slaughter a yak to get the bones to make the needle but this should give you time to do other things.Once you get into the game, the strategy is fairly straightforward.  Keep enough food and drink on hand for your gnomes, enough wheat straw for your yaks, keep your groves going and your tunnels deep.  Just like Terraria and other digging games, the deeper you go the better materials you find.  There's no story that I've tripped over and the Gnomes have no individuality and don't have relationships.  They work endlessly, new Gnomes finding you over time (apparently linked to your Great Hall in some way) and join your clan.I recommend this game if you can get it rather cheap.  I bought it for $2 and got a few copies for my friends.  I really want to see where this game goes.  The workshops seem to be overflowing and a couple seem over stretched at times but I think that it works.  The longer I played the more I noticed that the characters seem very obsessed with rearranging the dirt in my stock piles until I can find them all and turn them off.  The priorities don't seem to be as effective as they should be.  Even after turning off stock piles and fields there are a list of jobs marked as highest priority that just never get done.  Perhaps it will run more smoothly in a future update.  Until then, if you see this for cheap, add it to your inventory and let it stew.			"

								Well bloody done.i started this game when it was in early Beta and it was already more pollished than a fully released game. (For example the failures of Citadels and Stronghold 3).   It was perfectly stable, clean and best of all, fun.  This gnome management game has only improved since then.  Gnomoria is a top down, micro management game all about the balance between defence and your economy.  To help describe this game, it may be easier to think of it as a simplified dwarf fortress.  So far Gnomoria has recieved numerous and frequent updates throughout the entiety of its developement.  (As you may have noticed, this fact is quite rare.)Graphics:The graphics in this game are nothing special.  That being said, its simple, 2d and nice to look at for quite some time.  It fits the gameplay and overall feel of the game.  It doesn't become an eyesore after a few hours like a bad minecraft texture pack.  The only real complaint a perfectionist could have with the graphics is the animation of gnomes moving through tiles, But trust me when i say it irrelavent for this type of game.The Gameplay:This is why you play this game.  All the way from the growth rate of trees, to the construction pathways for needed tools and weapons.  The only item that needs work is the settable priority for starage zones and work benches (which the developer has been and continues to work on.)  The core gameplay is all about setting tasks and then the allocation of gnomes to that type of task.  More like running a business than a typical rts.I must advise all new players build a terrain wall around thier settlement and get the basics before managing combat.Strengths.As addictive as minecraft.Once you set up your economy and defences, its quite easy to play whilst watching a movie or anime.Weaknesses:For those who are not patient, do not bother. Completing a task can take days ingame and real time hours.Can be annoying to debug why a specific task is not being completed.Summary:One of the most unique games that i have played in the genre.  Once you get the hang of it, its an excellent game. (just do not expect your first try to do anything other than fail miserably.)I have easily put over 50 hours into this game.  Its amazing to see a game in beta that is already near the top of its genre. "

I enjoy both games in their own right, having sunk hours (days) into both, starting with Dwarf Fortress.Gnomoria started off fairly humbly on features and gameplay but with regular weekly updates is growing into a different game in its own right.If you hanker for the days of Bullfrog games, enjoy simulations or found the idea of Dwarf Fortress enticing but too much effort then you should try Gnomoria.

								TLDR: If you like sandbox village games heavy on micromanagement - get it!While it does not quite have the complexity of Dwarf Fortess, it is the closest thing I have been able to find so far.  The world mechanics themselves are quite marvellous, but there is no real ""personality"" to the gnomes beyond what you project onto them, you can't see what they are thinking, there are no fun personality conflicts ending in bloodshed.  There are no cats.It takes a little patience to pick up at first, you can count on your first few games ending within a year or two as orcs and/or viscious wild animals kill your sweet little gnomes.But if you push through you'll soon be able to build defenses to withstand these early problems long enough to run into entirely new and exciting ways to end your little gnomes lives.Word of advice - when experimenting with water, it is wise to save the game just in case one of your lovable but none too bright gnomes decides to jump in over their head in order to retrieve something only to find there's no way out and drowns.

								Having played Towns and a Game of Dwarves, I'd say Gnomoria is probably the best isomorphic town management, digging and building game around right now. It's also still in development (the version number as of right now is 0.9.9, and the next version is expected to be 0.9.10), so I expect it to get even better.There's a lot of charming pixel art to look at, including the gnomes themselves and different kinds of decorative blocks.It imitates Dwarf Fortress's brutal combat with strong armor, limb severing and bleeding, but unlike DF it's actually fine tuned to be fun and balanced.The economic and crafting system is one of the better ones I've seen. I like the additional detail needed various tools in order to build workshops brings, and find it doesn't really increase the complexity of playing the game.It's also relatively easy to setup entirely automated production chains that automatically keep production at maximum and keep going without any further player input. There's clearly been a lot of thought into how the GUI can help the player manage their settlement.My only complaints are the keybindings, I found them a bit counterintuitive. But you can change them, so it's no big deal.			"

								Steep learning curve for some, but well worth learning. I used to play ""Towns"" which in some senses is about the same... but ""Towns"" lacks a LOT of what this game has to offer.  Especially love the raids of goblins, mants, etc to keep you on your toes. (Giving you don't CAREBEAR a wall on the outside borders to prevent spawning lol) Plus each game has a lot of ability to customize various settings to go from easy, carefree living to tooth and nail blood bath scraping by to survive. Best of all, this game is still under active development and very playable during that time. Each patch normally comes with some pretty good updates to increase and enhance various aspects of the game. Some things I would like to see? # More Kingdoms, with ability to go to war with more than just the Goblins# Ability to send a war party to other kingdoms to raid for supplies, with settings to determine when to pull back so you dont lose all your Gnomes# Ability to incorporate player created modifications to the game to massively expand the creavity of the game#Ability to control gnomes to give direct commands (Toggled option, as some people probably wish to stay with the default roaming gnomes)#MMO Server with kingdoms that you can trade with and go to war against to raid (Far off dream I'm sure, but hey I can dream)There are other things I could think off, but I'll just sit back and enjoy the game while I watch what unfolds in due time. Recommended purchase? Certainly, as long as you are paitent and willing to learn a game that may have a somewhat steep learning curve.			"

								This is another one of those games that is not for everyone.   It is a game you'd benefit from watching some youtube videos on how to play it before attempting to play it.   If you don't do this then unless you've played other Dwarf Fortress like games you likely won't GET it.   If you do get it, it can be a very enjoyable game.			"

								  This is one of those games you either love or hate.  It has a pretty steep learning curve and getting good enough to survive will take practice and reading a few guides. But it's very satisfying to watch your little village / castle / underground fortress flourish.  In my opinion this game is a little easier then Towns, but much more polished and playable.  I would for sure recommend that you watch a few videos first and check out how it plays because like I said, you either love it or hate it.  I hope you end up loving it like I do, and help these indie devs out!!			"

												(my rating applies only to vanilla game, I do not review mods here)This is a very unfrogiving game. The early game requires a very specific order of tasks that if done perfectly right may grant you the chance of survival. Unfortunately many things in the base game are simply poorly designed and at least for me it is nearly unplayable without mods. It really is the simple things like hauling one piece of coal at a time or fully armor clad warrior losing to a monitor lizard that kill the joy I wish I had from Gnomoria. If you're thinking about picking it up, I highly recommend browsing through mods first and going through a solid online tutorial.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. Everytime I play this game i fall in love....then the game tears my heart out and leaves me bleeding on the ground. For the first year everytime I would get a few years in the game would corupt and i would have to start all over. I ended up having to copy my saved file every time i stoped playing. I cant build like want because the gnomes sometimes get stuck for no reasion and will die if job is no changed quick enough. All this should have been fixed asap not waiting months or even years. All in all It's just not worth $14 for the heartbreak. As soon as the dev fixs the bugs and AI I would happly change my recommendation. Just play lazie nuwb pack mod for dwarf fortress its all free.			"

												One of my friends gave me this game as a Christmas present around 2 years ago. Felt kinda like a joke gift since it was cheap and it was obviously based off of Dwarf Fortress.But I ended up liking it quite a lot. I sunk a good amount of time into this small title. It's a bit confusing to grasp at first, control wise and what you're supposed to do.

												Ive played more to the game before i decided to use the steam key and play more to it,  first,  the game is in abandonware state,  even the main website already been decaying since its launch out of alpha or beta...  probably the dev got tired about it as it happens when games drag for years before it is released and lost interest,  probably but thats how it feels when ive seen the same pattern but who knows.   But to talk about the game,  inspired from dwarf fortress but a less or light learning curve,  you build your city over and under the ground,  farm,  craft,  manage and defend from attacks if you set it up,  the game itself is good even so the lack of more features that isnt dependant on mods but depending on the person it might be good and bad,  why?  To what point you will play and then feel ""this is enough""  get tired playing because it wil reach to a point that you get tired of playing the same thing once you explored everything and when i play,  usually is play few months and then theres a large gap were i play again to get my interest renewed.  Is it worth 15 dollars? Depends... maybee not anymore,  get the game when theres a good discount.  The game engine for modding it is very old style probably due to the coding,  the type of modding i used to do back in 1997 when space games used large templates for many objects but here it never evolved to the point that it is very limited instead of evolving to set of vasious separated assets and a script source where you just had to point to the id of the picture and that could have opened the game to better modding			"

												To start, I love this game.  I thoroughly enjoyed the living hell out if it.  There's no tutorial, and things are really confusing at first, but once you figure out how to get things going it really is a blast.  Sure there's a few bugs, but in a game like this you should be saving your game every few minutes anyway.Bugs?  Yes.Will you still get $15 worth of enjoyment out if it?  Yes.People gladly pay that much to go watch a movie in a theater for an hour and a half and get unreasonably ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off when they don't get 60+ hours of gameplay for something that costs four times as much.That said, the game is unfinished, like many of the other reviews say.  I'm not sure if the original developer got burned out or what, but there are many things that just got dropped on the floor.  After modding was introduced, the website for the game changed, mainly the fact that their original development plan was removed.  This is what they didn't want everyone to see: Development plan[web.archive.org]I'm only recommending this game because I hope people start playing it and the developer realizes he has a gem just waiting to be polished.  It's hard to find enthusiasm about something that everyone just craps on.			"

												I will first start out by saying that yes this game is abandonware, but its still a great game. Sure the developer quit on us or died or whatever happened, but I have still logged many hours into this game and I am quite happy with it. Yeah sure it has a few bugs, but nothing I have noticed yet has seemed to be game breaking. A lot of people seem to be comparing it to Rim World saying Rim World is better and not to waste your money on this game. I think that is not true! Yes both are great games and I highly reccomend getting both. It really just depends on your playstile. Gnomoria is more focused on base building and being complex while Rim World doesnt really focus on base building but instead focuses on combat and the social life of your colony, it is also is a much more simple game than Gnomoria. I hope this helped you and thanks for reading! "

												I'm happy with my purchase. It's a lot like DF, a lot more accessible, and somewhat less deep, so I will compare this game to DF. It does improve on DF here and there, like with automatons and mechanic limbs. I also found combat to be more game-y, since you regularly get varied opponents with specific strengths and weaknesses, depending on their race and equipment, so you need to balance your single/double handed swords, hammers, shields and crossbows, the materials and qualities they are made of, and how much training your gnomes have at them. All of this is also simulated in DF, but in Gnomoria it affects the strategic choices you have to make a lot more.Core crafting is more interesting as well: for example, beds require a wooden sub-part to be made, and a cloth/wool mattress, each with their respective quality depending on the material used and the skill of the carpenter and tailor that made them. Metallic armor requires cloth padding and metallic weapons require wooden handles.If what you want is gnomes that learn skills over time, crafting quality, material modifiers, digging for metals, training and equipping a varied army; getting it good at different weapons to beat the very distinct kinds of enemies you'll get; starting with wood and stone and then going through bronze and steel; traps, invasions, butchering orcs, smelting their drops, and then laughing at the combat log; trading and amassing wealth, legendary sandwiches and majestic dining rooms, then this game is for you.Regarding the other reviews: There are (in my opinion) very few bugs and nothing game breaking. At least I never encountered a bug that broke my game or put me off from playing it. I paid about 9 bucks for the game a pretty long time ago, and I've personally considered my purchase worthy since version 0.8 or so. I'm not sure what some of the other players were expecting, but during development, the dev was always open about what might or might not make it into the game, what were the priorities and what (few) things might get dropped; and as far as I'm concerned, everything I realistically expected made it into the game, and more. Sure, he could have gone on working on it forever, but the same can be said about every other game.			"

												While out of Early Access, you can still crash the heck out of this thing.  Find an underground chasm?  Is it near a lake?  What would happen if you tried to use that chasm as a deep reservouir?  CRASH.  There's a serious learning curve on this thing, too.  There isn't a startup tutorial of any kind, so expect to have the wiki up in another window for a while.However, if you're spending a bunch of time in the ""peaceful"" mode to get the hang of things (as I am), you can always change the difficulty after you're confident in your work.I have a mostly positive love/hate relationship with this game, so far.

								Gnomoria is, by and large, a surprisingly deep game. Often remarked as Dwarf Fortress Lite, it is a game that puts you in charge of a community of gnomes, and gives you the task of making sure they survive and thrive. Sound easy? It's not. There are many things that need to be managed, and your first few communities are almost guaranteed to die off. The control scheme and menus are at first daunting, but once you figure out the HOW of things, it's surprisingly intuitive (Hint: Right click controls almost everything). But no matter how skilled at controlling the game you become, there will always be new things to learn. From base defense against goblins biting your hearts, to properly lighting your mines so golems don't come out of the deep, there will always be new challenges, and new ways to solve those challenges. As you attempt better structures and more elaborate designs, the enemies will react to your increased worth and start bringing armor, and bigger friends, though you will also attract more gnome migrants (Known as gnomads). So if the controls seem oppressive, don't lose hope. Look up a let's play of the game, watch for a bit, then mimic. You'll quickly figure it out, and have the time of your life.			"

												Gnomoria has a few bugs here and there, but it is still the best graphical version of Dwarf Fortress I have found. Many people refer to it as a very simplified version of DF, but I personally find it to contain more than enough to keep me busy without overloading my brain. The game is all about helping your small group of gnomes carve out a new home in the wilderness. Dig into the side of a mountain and carve out your perfect kingdom, or start above ground and construct a mighty fortress. The choice is yours to make. Cut down trees, forage for food, gather resources, cultivate your own farms and groves of fruit trees, build a brewery and brew up some of the finest fruit wines and beers, raise livestock for wool, milk, eggs and meat, dig into the ground and gather ore and gems, craft your own weapons and armor to protect your gnomes from the invading hordes of Goblins, Ogres, and MANTS! ... evil evil Mants. >:EAgain the game can crash, but you can save at any time by hitting F4 and it reloads after a crash without issue. I am creeping up on 100 hours of gameplay, and see it going well beyond that. What more could you ask for from a game that costs about the same as a movie ticket?""Foodo punches the goblin, hitting the upper body, smashing the skin, crushing the ribs and piercing through the heart.Goblin's upper body is bleeding.Goblin has died.""Gnomes proceed to take dead goblin to butcher shop, create goblin sausage, take sausage to kitchen and combine with bread and yak cheese to make Goblin Sausage Sammiches!10/10 Would Eat My Enemy Between Two Slices of Bread Again!

								This game has really opened my eyes back to citybuilder/management games.  Once you learn the systems and how things work (which you will always be learning, every game is different and everygame you learn something new) everything is fun.  If you like the addictive ocd type games where you HAVE TO get every achievement known to man, this is the game for you.I highly recommend giving this game a try.Pros:    Devs are always updating/tweeking/changing the game based on community feedback.  Complex game that can be made as complex or as simple as you want it.  A full and complete game  No Microtransactions/adds/buy this content.Cons:  When you start a new game it takes a good 2-3 minutes to start up.			"

								Even though this game is early acces it feels rather complete. Gnomoria is a sandbox, strategy, building game. But of corse you can probaly tell that from the description and pictures on the store page. You start out with a few gnomes each with different skills. You eventuly start to develope a gnome community weather in an underground fortress, a sprawling castle, or even a village where everyone has their own home. From developing and training an army to defend your people from Animals, Goblins, and many other mythical creatures, to playing peaceful mining rescorces to build the bigest collest thing you can think of. In Gnomoria the possibilities are endless.On top of all that, it is under $10! It is pretty much what Towns could have been and it isnt even finished yet! So if you like games like Minecraft or Terraria, and love strategy style sandbox games, then this game is for you!			"

The game on itself isn't that hard, but you have to learn how to play the game due to its special, but efficient, layout. There are frequent updates, which constantly add new (and cool) stuff. :DIt's really satisfying to see your miner who I've had for 3 years with very good skills die of starvation when you forget to build a bridge and he's stuck on a ridge. You really have to be concentrated for this game, and this game can be really rewarding when you've sorted things out.

								Gnomoria is, by and large, a surprisingly deep game. Often remarked as Dwarf Fortress Lite, it is a game that puts you in charge of a community of gnomes, and gives you the task of making sure they survive and thrive. Sound easy? It's not. There are many things that need to be managed, and your first few communities are almost guaranteed to die off. The control scheme and menus are at first daunting, but once you figure out the HOW of things, it's surprisingly intuitive (Hint: Right click controls almost everything). But no matter how skilled at controlling the game you become, there will always be new things to learn. From base defense against goblins biting your hearts, to properly lighting your mines so golems don't come out of the deep, there will always be new challenges, and new ways to solve those challenges. As you attempt better structures and more elaborate designs, the enemies will react to your increased worth and start bringing armor, and bigger friends, though you will also attract more gnome migrants (Known as gnomads). So if the controls seem oppressive, don't lose hope. Look up a let's play of the game, watch for a bit, then mimic. You'll quickly figure it out, and have the time of your life.			"

								Technically, somewhat akin to Dwarf Fortress. However if you haven't played Dwarf Fortress before, it's somewhat a Fortress building game where you collect resources to build workshops/weapons/armor as well as Fortress mechanics like walls/moats/gates. The depth of the game is pretty good and it focuses on survival aspects as well like food and water.			"

								Gnomoria is a simplified dwarf fortress. For those of you who are avid fans of dwarf fortress, don't mind the ascii graphics and the keyboard hotkey menu shortcut controls, you'll probably dislike this game as simplistic. For those of you who wanted to get into dwarf fortress but didn't want to have to learn to read live matrix code and like the invention of the mouse, this game is for you.Gnomoria puts you in charge of a small group of gnomes as you have to build them into a thriving settlement. The game difficulty can be manually set at anything from ""I'm never attacked and all my resources are easily accessible"" to ""I hate my life, and want to discover what life would have been like in the stoneage with zombies and invading ogres.""Its system also now supports some decent modding capabilities. While it does not support an api for adding new game mechanics, large swaths of content are available for your complete control. To give an example, I recently started on a mod to redesign the entire game as a moon base simulator with either no enemies or possibly competing companies (I haven't decided which yet), and the hardest part is simply the graphics since I suck at pixelart.However, what I have enjoyed most about this game is that I can totally play it while doing other things. As a recent college grad, I was doing a lot of note taking, and classwork. During boring parts of lectures where we reviewed things I already knew, I would set up the instructions for my gnomes and then let it run without me when something came up to work on. It would run without me just fine, and had been set up to pause whenever anything came up that really needed my immediate attention. This isn't to say that, when playing the game there's nothing to do. But the fact that I was able to get hours and hours in during class and homework made it even more fun for me because I could actually play it during busy weeks.Some people are complaining now that the maker has declared he will be finishing it soon without completing all he said he wanted to. But pretty much everything he said he'd like to do, he has made totally available to people to mod. While this may sound like a cop out, I frankly would love to see what else the community can do with it, since the entire development team consists of one man.I've been part of enough early access games thought to declare (in my opinion of course), that this is among the greats. While I will admit some of the features of the game are definitely not particularly strong (eg: the diplomacy system consists of inviting an ambassador and making sure he has a nice room to stay in), the base game is actually very solid and very fun. The game has felt complete to me since I bought it, everything else that's been added since then has been icing on the cake. And the addition of a decent content modding system promises lots of new content (especially when the current indev branch is released since a lot of mods-in-work are waiting on it).The game is totally worth its current price tag of $8. I would personally buy it again for $15 myself. And while I'm normally very against people ""finishing"" development on a game just so they can start charging for expansion packs, I would totally be up for purchasing some dlc or expansion packs for this if he ever did that. Gnomoria is the bar by which all other village sims have been measured by me, and none have come close.			"

								A rare gem among many others like itself. Gnomoria is still under development but that doesn't stop it from being fun. Updates are frequent and the developer is ingratiated with the community, often seen discussing game mechanics on the forums with other users. As for the game itself, it's virtually Dwarf Fortress with a mouse GUI. Features an 8-bit or midi-orchestral custom soundtrack which will graft itself into your grey matter. For all the building you will be doing, the meat of the game lies within the combat, and squads. Uniforms are made(you designate the material and quality of each piece of armor and weapon that uniform will use), soldiers use these uniforms and perks, formations use soldiers and their own perks as well, and finally squads are made designating formation, and what gnomes will be in what position. Now to clear up my earlier statement, this game doesn't try to become Dwarf Fortress with mouse support, but it is obviously heavily inspired. Do not come looking for the complexity that DF contains, though for finished releases and beyond, I can't say. Enemies are unique in their own way. Golems spawn underground in the dark, with their strength determined by the depth. Goblins and the like will spawn ground level at the edge of the map. Animals as well, but you typically see goblins during night or morning whereas animals are more popular during the day. Mants will raid you with strength and numbers based on your food stockpile.I've followed the development of this game for over half a year and I can honestly say it's been one of the few early access games(had it before it was on steam) that I've never had one regret purchasing.

												An amazing game for those who always wanted to play dwarf fortress but didn't have the time or patientce to learn how to make a block of text run smoothly. Currently I have had alot of crashing problems (unsure if this is due to low specs or early access) but the game provides plenty to do even in Early AccessEDIT: Now that the game is ""complete"" I'll finish my review. The games content for a supposed finished game is still extremely lacking, I love the concept of the game, and the gameplay, but it hads so much more potential on what it could be. On a regular playthrough it still feels like the game is missing huge gaps on the edges, and some of the menu systems (definitely anything to do with setting up your military) feels clunky. Still concedering how much game time I got out of the game and the low pricetag I'd have to reccomend it, hopefully the dev or the modders will fill in the gaps			"

								Gnomoria is not Dwarf Fortress.The gnomes do not decorate their walls (I think, but what do I know, I've played all of 1 hour) and there is no awsome wonderful history generation.... or other forts... or armies... or unspeaking things that dwell in the outer darkness and has 27 heads and claws that drip acid... and there's no adventure mode. So in Gnomoria, no gnome is going to craft a goblet and then encrust it with a certain jewel that's associated with an anchient dwarf hero who's story is depicted in engravings on that cup. So you can't make a sprawling dwarf fortress, play for centuries, then make 1 single mistake involving lava, and the fort falls into ruins. Wars happen, and then you pop into Adventure mode and go dungeon seeking to find that legendary quality cup that your favorite dwarf crafted (but died in some hysterical accident.But, I suck at DF. I play DF like this, I create a world with wierd parameters, then embark my 7 dwarves. I start by building a tomb and coffins and I'm usually able to finish before all my dwarves are dead and buried. So for me Gnomoria, is going to be training wheels for DF. I'm not comfortable with planning out z-layers, but Gnomorias visuals make it easy. I love how I can see what's in the ground on my z-level and all the terrain in z-levels below me. I'm going to practice making my forts (and tombs) in Gnomoria, and then I'll learn to be more proficient in DF. But, I can't stay in Gnomoria forever, I think. Brcasue I love the depth and richness and Dwarftalks.mp3s with their awsome music and commentary about the game.So... If you are like me and love DF but can't quite get a handle on its complexity, then join me and the gnomes for a bit... but dont delete your fort!			"

								Что можно сказать о Gnomoria? Gnomoria - это потрясающая инди песочница, в которой вам нужно управлять поселением гномов, помогать им улучшать свою жизнь и выживать. Приятная 8-битная музыка (которую можно поменять на оркестровую, на ваш вкус), приятная графика, интересная механика и свобода действий делают эту игру - незабываемой.Подведем итог. Если вам нравятся: 8-битная музыка, песочницы, исследование пещер и подземелий, стратегии, приятная графика, то игра определенно для вас.			"

								This is a game, lovingly updated with bugfixes and really super cool features.  The care the develope is taking with this game is a beautiful feature worth reviewing. As for the game itself, it has truly become a diamond, worth mining for.  The integration of a smart crafting AI I think has really set the game apart.  Most games that have ""crafting"" development, require a player to micro-manage each step of a raw material extraction - refinement - multi-stage construction.  In this game however, if the player has provided the necessary tools and labor allocation, the workers actually can work, automatically all the way through the proccess on their own, with blacksmiths, stone carvers, and carpenters each doing their part to make your ""ordered"" final pieces constructed.  Great game, great attention to detail - perhaps a bit overwhelming at first - to which I suggest watching a couple of youtube videos.			"

								Hello,I really reccomend this beautiful game. You can be 'lost' in in for hours and for this price (6.99 euro) it's really worth it. The game on itself isn't that hard, but you have to learn how to play the game due to its special, but efficient, layout. There are frequent updates, which constantly add new (and cool) stuff. :DIt's really satisfying to see your miner who I've had for 3 years with very good skills die of starvation when you forget to build a bridge and he's stuck on a ridge. You really have to be concentrated for this game, and this game can be really rewarding when you've sorted things out. I must say, I 'cheated' a lot by closing the game without saving so my miner wouldn't die. And that's wy Ichabod Sugarbottom is still alive. :DI remain,Lordaverap			"

								This game has really opened my eyes back to citybuilder/management games.  Once you learn the systems and how things work (which you will always be learning, every game is different and everygame you learn something new) everything is fun.  If you like the addictive ocd type games where you HAVE TO get every achievement known to man, this is the game for you.I highly recommend giving this game a try.Pros:    Devs are always updating/tweeking/changing the game based on community feedback.  Complex game that can be made as complex or as simple as you want it.  A full and complete game  No Microtransactions/adds/buy this content.Cons:  When you start a new game it takes a good 2-3 minutes to start up.			"

								woooooooooooo takes you back to the good days of gaming. Love hits like orginal tycoon games but then they ruin it with to much 3d. Gnomoria goes back to the old days and has a great sandboxing world, very challenging at first till you learn how to guide everyone. Even though game is on beta is updated all the time which is certainly better than half the early access games that never go anywhere. in 20 years time this game will have a cult following just like the civ, tycoon games			"

								Gnomoria is pretty addictive and quite challenging. I suppose it compares to Dwarf Fortress, but with better graphics. If you like city building type strategy games, then you should like Gnomoria. One of the things I like about it is being able to free-form design my own cities/castles.			"

Early Access Review
								Synopsis: Inspired primarily by Dwarf Fortress (http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/), this is an isometric 2D building game where you start with a small group of Gnomes and issue them orders to build, mine, craft, harvest and defend themselves. As you improve their new home, more Gnomes will arrive that you must feed, provide shelter for and issue orders to.I'm really enjoying this game when I play it. I can pause at any time and issue orders, which is a real plus for me because I can use all the time I wish to plan several moves ahead. The pause feature also allows me to play this game as I do other tasks around the house or while at work.Be advised, there are no animations as of the last time I played it. Also, the control interface still needs polish. Once you get used to it it's not too bad, but it's takes some time to achieve that comfort zone.I also have some issue with the 2D terrain where I'm not always sure how terrain on one level will interact with the terrain above and below it, particularly with trying to place/remove dirt and stairs. Might just be me though.Developers are making progress and have not put this one on the back-burner as is happening with too many pre-releases on Steam lately.Usual advice is that you should peruse youtube for as much footage of the game, filtering for the most recent videos for the latest release versions, before you buy. Also try to get it on sale. When it's on sale, it's a no brainer.			"

								Gnomoria, how I hate thee.  I come back to you again and again and can't get enough.  You suck up my time.  Time that I meant to use to get to know other games.  Yet, I always return to you...I love the idea of Dwarf Fortress, it's fantastic and quirky.  But ASCII graphics?  I put up with ASCII graphics back in the early 80s.  Gnomoria removes that problem.Pros:  if you like sandbox village management games.  Yes.  You should buy this game now.  Why are you still reading this?Other Pros:  I realize Gnomoria is defined by Dwarf Fortress (they are the same game) right down to the quirky names for legendary items.  For instance, my cook creates a legendary sandwich.  The sandwich gets a name.  That name is the Hateful Spite.  You build your underground (or above ground) village.  You start up production of tables and chairs and various and sundry things that you will place in your Gnomish Colony (it's had to call it a city because I've only ever got up to 45 gnomes) to raise the value of your little colony to attract more gnomes...and badies who come to steal, kill, and destroy what you worked so hard to make.  (you can turn that off by the way)Cons:  Don't expect amazing, splendiforious graphics of amazing splendiforousness.  Minecraft graphics and Gnomoria graphics...it's kind've a toss up as to which is better.  I think Minecraft has an edge in my humble opinion.The balancing of attackers to defenders and the rate at which they appear is...not good.  If you approach the game knowing that the badies will eventually beat your gnomes to a bloody pulp you're golden.  I dislike putting myself into that mindset.  It would be nice if the developers put in an in-game adjustable scale for those times you just want the badies to leave you alone, but still allow for those times when you're ready to let Gnomeggedon begin--and see if you're preparations can handle it.The interface does take some getting used to.  I suggest using the menu at the bottom instead of the right mouse menu.At the moment 3 December 2013, the game has some serious lag issues once all your items approach 8-12k.  I do hope that gets fixed.Summary:It's amazing!  This game, in my opinion, is better than Drawf Fortress, mostly because the graphical user interface allows for easier access while still keeping most of the concepts, quirkiness, and spirit of the original.

								Baby's first Dwarf Fortress. It's fun, it's interesting but it's ultimately just a dumbed down version of an extremely difficult game.

								This game sucked the free time from my life for a month straight. Why? You may ask? Simply put this game is fun. I have to admit, i bought this game and tried it for 5 minutes long before i tried it out further. It was kind of one of those scenarios where you say to yourself 'Yeah this looks too complicated, ♥♥♥♥ this, i dont want to take the time to learn it'. Eventually when I came back to it and put the 5 or so minutes into actually learnign the controls i found a game that has enticed me and has been a marvelous example of what a successful early access title can acheive.Pros:You can build thingsYou can build whatever the hell you want pretty muchYou can build trapsYou can customize the game to your perfered difficultyYou can exact your god complex on little peopleLarge amount of depth and complexity involved with creating a succesful economy for your gnomesOverall fun gameCons:The 5 minutes it took to learn the interface.Sincerely, get this game, support the small guys out there that had a really fantastic dream and stood up to be it.

								Similar to Dwarf Fortress, but with an easier user interface.  Though the interface makes playing this easier than Dwarf Fortress, you have reduced building, engineering and social options.  Both are great games, but Gnomoria might be better suited to a fortress builder begginer where as Dwarf Fortress suits the hardcore veteran.  With constant new uodates the game might have as many options as Dwarf Fortress one day.			"

								For posterity, I am leaving my original review text here, intact. I have managed to play the game for a couple of hours and - it succeeds very well in itching that Dwarf Fortress scratch.  The font issue is STILL an issue for me, but your mileage may vary. I still have hope for a better font, because I simply can't play this game as much as I'd like (or as much as I think I need to, to really dig into its meat).------------------------------------I wanted to love this game. I waited until it had been out (even in Early Access) for almost a year (or more) before trying it. What's the deal breaker?The font.I cannot look at the text menus for more than a couple of minutes without it hurting my eyes.The only reason my review is a ""No"" at this moment is because there are threads a year old asking for some kind of font options and I didn't find any sort of dev response to this. Lots of people offered helpful hints like ""play at a lower res"" or ""get over it"" (even putting it at 800x600 doesn't help) - but a font seems like it should be a simple fix. And it seems like something that should be an option for people who may have visual troubles.Should the font get a fix, maybe I'll be able to play this game properly, and I'm sure at that time I can edit this review. But for now? No.			"

								NEW REVIEWI see a lot of rewiews stating that this is abandonware, that the dev jumped ship, etc.Some say the UI is clunky. For a game this complex, it's hard to not make it clunky. I disagree with the claim that the dev abandoned the game. If you pay someone to build your kitchen, you don't expect them to work on it after it's done. The game was done and he added some extra things like golems and better mod support.It should also be noted that there's only one person developing this. Stardew valley also had only one person and that game is much simpler than this, being only in one plane while this one, while 2d, also goes up and down, has to calculate all the pathing, do all the databse stuff, have all these modifiers for things, etc.The negative rewiews post release are, in my opinion, asking superhuman feats from a single dev.Knowing all that I know now, were I to lose my steam account... I'd buy gnomoria again.------------------------------------OLD REVIEW FROM EARLY ACCESS95% of early access games are ealy alpha trash. This game is in the remaining 5%.Regular updates, feedback, etc.Install it, play it, fail a bunch of times due to the steep learning curve, survive a year. Next thing you know it's light outside and you go ""Oh poop I forgot to go sleep!""What you'll be doing in Gnomoria:- Being an architect. Where do farms go, where do beds go, where the crafting stations, what about storage. - Being a boss. Look at who's slacking off. If they are, fix it. Put the right dude on the right job.- Being a judge/god/person who controls life. You may have to do ""mercy"" killings. Or can you afford to care for the disabled while that person could make room for a youngling of strong physique and ability?- Being a commander. Leading troops into battle. Well, not directly. You kinda tell em ""you're a soldier dude"" and they go be soldier dude.- Being an economist. You need to handle scarcity from the second you start your empire.- Being a merchant. Trade is important and often the only way to get certain items.- Being stuff I forgot.Protips: - Change the music setting or turn it off. The 8bit style music gets old fast.- Your gnomes are like pets. You probably get attached to them. Then they die. Then you're sad. Game comes with onions pre-installed. - Legendary beer is legendary.			"

								Very replayable sand box game for those of us that like to restart maps or for those that like to stick to one method and drive.  This game is being updated with new and great features like new graphics and sound effects, new game play items like weapons and crops, or new strategies like diplomacy.Forward thinking development, but they still pay attention to the little details (like how those of us obsessed with design wanted wall lamps to make our base look cute...I mean...gnomier...).I feel like I can come back to this game for a few hours every few weeks and find something new.Just please - make a surgeon class so we can sew legs and arms back onto those poor little gnomes :(UPDATE!  They added a research option on your tinker bench so you can make prosthetic legs and arms! <3  TY developers!Also, I discovered how best to play it by watching others on the ""Lets Play"" videos on YouTube.  It's tricky - yes, but grab a tea and sit through it.  You'll catch on in no time :)			"

								Really good survival style game. I can't believe it is still in early access though. Does not have a tutorial, so you may have to watch videos on it or read some guidebooks to get the hang of it.  You start off with a handful of gnomes, 2 animals (back when it first came out), and some food and first aid items. You can play in peaceful mode, normal,  or hard mode(which includes attacks from creatures and other invaders.  Build a small village to maintain your gnomes or build large villages to expand your population. The music is  annoying.			"

								As a huge fan of Dwarf Fortress, I picked this game up about a year ago and I haven't regretted it for a moment. If you're not familiar with Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria is a game about building a place for your gnomes to work, eat, drink, sleep, and live their lives. Some improvements on Dwarf Fortress are that the UI is very intuitive, and I can craft goods out of a specific material and automatically set workshops to craft missing components of an object I'm building. I've also been happy with the regular update pace, although unfortunately this game is not moddable (at least at the moment). All in all, if you're interested in this sort of game, I'd recommend buying it. At the moment I'm writing this, it's on sale for 50% off or $3.99, and at that price it's a steal.			"

												I think the best way to describe Gnomoria is to call it Dwarf Fortress Light with a superior Interface.  So, if you ever wanted to play Dwarf Fortress, but thought Dwarf Fortress, even with Stonesense wasn't appealing due to its interface, give this one a try. I promise, you won't be disappointed.But the most appealing thing about Gnomoria is probably the fact that it is DRM free. It can be played without Steam, which is how I mostly played the game, which is why there are so few hours listed. Still I have played this game probably the most of all the games i've played in the last couple years. Its one of those “go to” games that is not only a time vampire but also never gets old, much like Minecraft. Yeah, sometimes you have had a bit to much of it and play something else, but I always return to this game, and with 240MB you can put the little thing onto an USB drive and take it where ever you want to go.I highly recommend the game. As for those wondering what the similarities to Dwarf Fortress are, well, this game is a bit more technologically minded and focused on stereotypes Pop culture associates with Gnomes instead of Dwarven. So its similar, but simpler. It also lacks the social system from Dwarf Fortress, so no suicide spiral when a Gnome does.Gnomoria is definitely one of my top 5 video games, and i should have written a review a long, long time ago.

I hear what people are saying about the devs giving up and how it could have been so much more, and all that is true. However the reason they dropped it was because the game was not getting enough attention. They were tanking on money so they had to move on. Maybe if enough new people started showing interest then they would pick it back up? I dont really know though. Even still what they have left is a great game and I think people are being a little narrow minded in saying it couldve been more. I mean look at it. Enjoy what you got guys this game is fantastic.

								I have played this game a lot. It is, overall, a simple graphic update to dwarf fortress that is a tad dumbed down. That said it is one of the most complex town/ colonization sim I have played that keeps you entertained for a long time. I played it before it was on steam and was excited to see it come out finally, but since it got on steam there hasn't been a whole lot of development. I'm really waiting for the end product to show up. As it stands once you have built everything you run out of things to do because you can literally walk away from the computer and your town will do fine most of the time. Its worth buying as is, and I can really see the potential in the end product. But its like getting halfway through a book and finding out the author of the series you are halfway through died without writing the last books, and unlike Robert Jordan, the author didn't leave notes that someone else could follow to write the ending to a monumental series.Pros-Manage a settlement of gnomes-You can micromanage as much as you want-Simple graphics, but not a text game-Addictive, way too much of my life-Challenging-Customizable difficulties-Diplomacy looks promising if it ever gets improved, like maybe I want to conduct a raid on a neighboring goblin kingdom instead of just insulting themCons-Stupid zombies and beetles-Steep learning curve-Not much developement on the game, snails pace-Produces a lot of activity that I never get from other games on my CPU-No tiered crafting system- the Gnomes can make everything as soon as there are materials and the skills involved don't change the end product enough that it matters- only skills that improve anything are fighting skills, and farming.-Trade doesn't really change over time- you get wealthier but your neighbors stay the sameI realize I have a lot of cons but some of them I enjoy like the steep learning curve, and just the way the game works.

								Gnomoria is very similar to Dwarf Fortress, except that it is extremely simplified. This is both good and bad as it is much more enjoyable to the casual gamer, but it lacks the depth and detail of its predecessor.In Gnomoria, you manage a group of gnomes while building a new settlement. You mine rocks, gems, and ore as well as harvest trees and plant farms. Raise a herd of yaks, emus, or alpacas and use the various products to feed your gnomes, craft new items, and trade with nearby villages.Overall, I have thoroughly enjoyed the game, and I look forward to further releases.

								Very fun if you enjoy resource managment games like the early Settlers games. Not the easiest game to get into as it doesnt explain all of its systems very well, but i will give it a pass as it is sill in early access. I don't know where the devolopment will stop but in some ways that doesn't matter as the game is already ver fun. I do wish it had an end game but can't think of a good way to include one.			"

												This game is broken for me. When I launch it I can hear the game music and my monitor stays black and flashes on and off. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it, upgraded my video drivers and triple checked the game cache and nothing helps. On top of that going to the developers website  they haven't had any news, updates or word from them in almost a year so it looks like its an abandoned game that isn't going to be fixed anytime soon if ever.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a strategy sandbox city game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is windows mode, fullscreen borderless and fullscreen mode.Has plenty of resolution sizes.Custom screen resolution size available.There is a music volume slidebar available with %.There is a sound volume slidebar available with %.Able to change your controls on the keyboard.Has a kingdom size (Small to huge).Has a difficulty level settings.There is advanced level settings, To toggle enemies/resources/layout and more.About the game.You start off with a couple of gnomes and some resources. You can build and dig into mountains. Making rooms or workshops. Defending yourself against enemies, finding resources and many more. Fighting on the other hand is pretty ""unfair"" against a player as you could get attacked rather quickly or overwhelmed if things are going really bad. Let's say its random number generator if it is coming to fights. You could lose limbs which could really handicap your gnome. Especially if this happends early on.Takes time to learn the game.World is randomly generated.Gnomes and enemies are able to lose limbs.Game could be really unfair towards players.Music is calm but could be annoying after awhile.Okay Graphics.Other things.Has steam workshop.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												Gnomoria is overwhelming at first — enough so that It took me a few attempts and a few wiki lookups to actually get into it.  Once I did though, it was worth the effort.  It’s a great mix of exploration, building, and managing your population of gnomes.  The menus are sometimes difficult to use (especially trading with merchants which requires scrolling through long lists) and I’ve seen an update cause my gnomes to ignore their thirst until it kills them, but it’s also under active development so things are changing and new stuff keeps getting added.  Despite it being an early access game, I think there's enough there already to make it worth its full price.Sadly, Gnomoria has been abandoned.  It’s still fun, but the developer decided that since he wasn’t going to work on it anymore he may as well call what he had the full release, even though it still has a lot of the sort of problems I was expecting to see addressed late in development.  The UI is still difficult (the bug I see the most often is gnome skill tooltips that get stuck open) and performance is a lot worse than you’d expect for 2D sprite graphics.  It still feels unfinished, but it’s no longer early access so doesn’t say it’s unfinished.  How disappointing this is as far as it got — I was really enjoying watching the updates roll in.			"

												Another Early Access game that was left unfinished, look at the update history on Steam: 	


Announcement: Gnomoria v1.0 released! 
Gnomoria, Feb 23, 2016

			This release marks Gnomoria's transition out of Early Access! This update adds a ton of quality of life changes, additional support for mod developers, a debug mode for testing and spawning items and...		


 last update was the 24th of February. Was looking forward to a Dwarf Fortress with graphics and a mouse compatible interface, I imagine it would have been a good game if development had continued. Instead if looking for a game like Dwarf Fortress with a simpler UI and although basic but functional graphics try RimWorld although it is also in Early Access if development stopped today you would get your moneys worth.

I understand the frustration that there are some remaining bugs, but I haven't found anything game breaking and clearly people are getting some value if they have 20+ hours and spent 15 bucks on it. If you love Dwarf Fortress, keep playing Dwarf Fortress because this is a simplified version and you will probably find Gnomoria lacking. If you WANT to play Dwarf Fortress but bounced off it, give this a try. I think it's pretty great.			"

												Dwarf fortress inspired, but Gnomoria has definitely come into its own. This game has been a great ride, one of the first early access games I supported. Every update brought more fun and more experimentation to do, different ways for my gnomes to thrive or get brutally murdered.I have watched my gnomes toil away so many different ways. From slaving away building a giant gnome out of a mountain range to building an upside down pyramid. I have watched golbins tear apart my guards and skeletons eviscerate my miners. I have built a magnificent palace for them and trading posts. Barracks and factories! Farmlands and military states! There's so many ways to play this game it's crazy. Robotronic has put heart and soul into this game over the years and it shows! I am grateful that I got to experience the journey!If you like building games, or army games, or economic games, or just like watching things die, this game is for you! Gnomoria will frustrate you and entertain you, but always leave you with a fulfilled feeling no matter the outcomes.			"

												Now that is the game is released I'd really like to write a review in support of the developer. m This game is in the vein of Dwarf Fortress or Towns.  It isn't as complex as DF but has a vastly superior interface.  It is a hands down better game than Towns.If you have played either of those games this is like those but in a pretty wrapper.  Take your gnomes, cut trees, plant food, make beds, mine ore, smelt ore, form an army, etc.  It is a well designed game and a blast to play.  Monster spawning could be done better.  Caverns underground would be nice. But we can't have everything, I suppose.Overall a big thumbs up on ths game though.  Well worth the money.			"

												I created a job to mine a fairly small plot, probably 6x6. The gnomes dug the hole out in such a way that a portion of the targeted dirt was now inaccessible. That level of micro-managing just to get started put me off almost immediately. There is no fun in having to constantly manage a gnome performing very simple tasks. If it messes up that quickly on such a simple task I shudder to think what It'd be like to perform something more complex. This game has a lot of potential and I'm sure the content is great but having to constantly fight the gnomes' AI is not something I'll deal with to get to it.			"

												I just want to show you just some of the top google search suggestions when I enter ""gnomoria how"":Gnomoria how to get stonesGnomoria how to remove stairsGnomoria how to build wallsGnomoria how to get drinkGnomoria how to PlayThis shows pretty well that essetial parts of the game are quite complicated.The main reason for that is a poor UI and a missing tutorial.If you want to buy this game, you should consider that it takes some time to get into the game.The first 15 min of this game are simply horrible. Besides food and drink you don't know how much resources you have and besides that, you have no idea, how to get the resources for most of the buidables.The ones who like to figure out the game mecancis by themselfs may give this game a try.After about an hour you know the basic game mechanics. Build stuff, cancel jobs, modify the terrain according to your needs (which is not that easy) and how to get the resouces you want.At this point, this game can be quite fun. You will start to plan your empire and you'll start a new game with the largest map this games offers.At this point my motivation was at the highest level. After that, the game became more and more frustrating to me.The main reason again are the UI, the game mechanics and the bugs.Gnomes get stuck so often, because of a task which they can't handle. You to figure out whats their problem and fix it. Sometimes it is enough to cancel a job,sometimes you have to build a whole new tunnel to rescue them.Also the order/categorization of the action annoys me.For example everything about removing terrain is under the terrain tab.Besides that there is a fill hole action, which construcs a wall and a ceiling.But there is no way to fill up a tunnel in the terrain tab. It's under the build tab.cause you build a soil wall. Also the fact that gnomes can walk on a ceiling out of soil is pretty strange.In my opinion, the ceilings are useless and destroy the build flow.Minecraft has shown, that building with blocks works flawless and super easy. This is not the case in this game. Everything simply takes to long in this game.Besides that, you notice after a while that this game has a very limited content for a game which was in development for such a long time. An I don't see hope that more content will be added, cause this game was offically released.For example you have got 3 tamed animals, 4 trees, 5 cops and a pretty limited amount of furniture.In my opinion not enough for a game, which just focuses on sandbox settlement building with super simple graphics.

												Gnomoria is a complex kingdom management game in the same vein as Dwarf Fortress.The starting point sound simple enough: You've got a handful of gnomes, a few livestock, and enough food and water for a few days. You must direct your gnomes to build a kingdom in which they will live. Simple, right? Wrong. It turns out that building a kingdom from scratch is no simple feat. You only have a limited amount of time before hordes of monsters will show up and attempt to slaughter your settlers. You'll need a sword (or many, many swords). But to make a sword, you need bronze bars to make it. Bronze bars must be made of tin and copper. Tin and copper need to be mined. Mining is dangerous and may force your gnomes to come face to face with monsters deep within the earth. All of this just for a sword, which is most definitely not the most complex thing you can make.As you progress, you'll need to get a feel for the supply chain required to make things. You choose which gnomes do which jobs, you choose the priority of their tasks, and you hope that you don't make a mistake somewhere because production will halt if you do, and there's nobody to hold your hand and tell you that you forgot to assign a gnome to burn wood into charcoal for your torches, and that's why none are being made. You'll make mistakes. You'll lose dwarves. You'll see your kingdoms be completely obliterated from one small band of goblins or a rogue golem or a horde of subterranean insects. It's all part of the game.But that's the fun of it. It's not an easy game (though not as tough as Dwarf Fortress), but it's quite rewarding to see your kingdom grow and take on new challenges. It's great to build a giant, walled marble city with trained archers wielding steel crossbows at every entrance. It's satisfying to build systems of gearboxes and axles which power mechanisms which keep enemies out or deploy traps against invading giants.Overall, Gnomoria is a really great game for those interested in the kingdom management genre, but be aware that it's not a game that's simple to pick up. You'll fail a lot. It's part of the game.			"

												As I love the mechanics of Dwarf Fortress, but hate its complicated and frustrating ASCII menues, I wanted to give Gnomoria a try a few years ago. While still in Early Access, it sounded promissing with its isometric view and less complicated than DF. It also played more smoothly than DF, with customizable job classes that you can assign to an individual gnome.The reason why I'm not recommending this game is that its not very deep. While you can have thousands of crops, resources and blueprints in DF, Gnomoria is just to narrow. You explore very fast everything Gnomoria has to offer. Another reason for my negative review is the abandonment by Gnomoria's developers through leaving Early Access: ""Here, have a half-finished, bugged game and have fun making mods for it to make it half-decent!""

								Gnomoria is a bit like Dwarf Fortress-Lite with cute isometric graphics. Don't get me wrong, it's not just a DF clone. It's got a flavor all its own and the learning curve is significanly easier than DF. The developer communicates with the community regularly via the official forums and updates to the indev beta branch are pretty regular. Right now the dev is working on getting the modding platform all worked out so there haven't been content updates in awhile, but the game has a lot of depth already. Really, this game is incredibly fun and you should pick it up.			"

												The game may have been greater than it is but it seems like development has been stoped for this game...However I would say for the current price (£10) the game is worth it and you can still get 10s or even 100s of hours fun if this is your type of game.I do have to say there are still a few bugs that can crash the game or force you to reload last save, they suck, but ther game is still enjoyable if you dont mind a bug once in a while.The game also has a great soundtrack!(and we never know, the dev might come back :x)			"

												I usually don't take the time to write reviews, but this one deserves it. Gnomoria is a fantastic game that I have been playing on-and-off for quite a while now, since it was in early access. I haven't played a lot of similar games, like the one most compare it to: Dwarf Fortress, but I was hooked on this one pretty fast.The main reason I want to write this review though is to counter the recent reviews the game has received for being 'abandoned by the developers'. First of all, if you're going to say something like that, do your research. This game was made by one guy. A single person. Not a development TEAM. One person, who had a dream. He put in massive amounts of work on this game, even worked with the modding community to help them integrate everything before he was even finished. I think that, taking that into consideration, this is a pretty amazing piece of work. Then he had a kid, so his life got a little hectic, but he still did what he needed to do, because this game was a big deal to him.All that being said, is the game perfect? No. Very rarely do I ever see a 'perfect' game. If that's what you're looking for, go to sleep and have some dreams. Maybe you'll find one there. But for what it is, this game is fantastic, and I love it dearly. Even in early access when it was super buggy, it was worth the cost. I'll keep coming back to this one every so often, simply because it's fun and addicting.			"

												I purchased this game around March 11th, It just came out of Early Access.Update: Today is Jully 22nd, the last time the Developer logged into his ""opt-in"" update forum was  --> Last Active: April 11, 2016, 03:23:55 PMI want to start off by saying that this game is a lot of fun. This is your Population/Kingdom management game, where you build brick by brick, The only templates you're looking at are the workshops where you craft the materials you need to make better gear, weapons, and asthetics. You can shape the very land you live on.The Learning curve, is pretty steep at first. When you start the game, you have nothing really guiding you on how to begin. There is help menu that provides some information, and a context menu that allows you to generate jobs for your gnomes. Here is where the game struggles a bit. As far as I can tell, Everything is great while you're above ground, dealing with your farms and animals. But once you start digging, the AI tends to hang and you have to figure out where the hang up is before your gnome decides to stop drinking and die. Then there are the mobs... I feel that the mobs are a bit over powered in the beginning. Even at the easiest, lowest setting, a Honey Badger for example, does so much damage that while you might survive this fight, you'll have slim chances of surving the next as a beginner. Later on, there are these beetles that multiply like tribbles (StarTrek reference), and can cause your game to lag/crash. So there are still some issues that need to be worked out as far as mobs go.Once you've gotten passed the learning curve and you've tempered your patience with the faults in the AI, you'll be able to build bigger better kingdoms.

												I really wanted to like Gnomoria, but the learning curve is huge, and it just doesn't look like there is going to be any payoff. Basically once you manage to wrap your head around how to make the gnomes do the stuff you want done, and you can look at the map and say ""we need to do that,"" and then you send them out to make it? That will be pretty cool. But ""pretty cool"" is like all it will ever be. I don't see any particular promise that the game will ever be FUN. Meanwhile, I don't understand what like eighty percent of this stuff does. It's like I have to jump through eighty hoops to make a little minor thing like a sawmill and then I jump up and yell ""YATTA!"" because I can make planks. Which means now I have to set up a brand new little production line of cutting down trees and bringing them to a stockpile close to the sawmill where they can be picked up and brought to the sawmill and made into planks which now must be moved to a NEW stockpile which... should... be somewhere close to whatever I am doing with the planks. What was I doing with the planks again? Oh yeah, nothing. I have no idea what I need planks to do. I have some vague notion that I can do something with them, but I don't really know what and I'm not even sure I need to do it in the first place. But, hey, there are planks. There's got to be a reason, right? So I should have some. Just in case. I appreciate the idea here, which is kind of like someone said ""what would happen if we combined Minecraft with Dwarf Fortress and the Sims?"" but it looks to me like the answer is ""we would do it wrong and it would suck, so we would lose interest and abandon the project."" Gnomoria basically fails to be a good building and crafting game because it doesn't give you any real agency and control. Then it fails to be a good tower defense game because getting to the tower defense parts requires ploughing through the tedious and difficult crafting game. And then it isn't a good sandbox game because it makes you build very specific things in and around the sandbox before you get to play in it. So essentially, it's three tolerable alpha releases - there are way too many bugs, although nothing I ran into was really game-breaking - wrapped up into a package where none of them make the others any better and have arguably made them worse. It's a decent case study of where good intentions lead, though. It's clear that throughout this project, the developer WANTED it to be a good game, and tried really hard to make it one. It isn't really even his fault that it's not. But it's, you know. Not.			"

												As many others have noted, Gnomoria is in no ways complete, and seems to have been abandoned by Rob.  However, I still absolutely adore this game.  It's often my go to game to just mess around, make a new world and give myself some random goal.  There's still some modders working on the game to add new features, and I've never personally experienced any of the major bugs.  It's a pain to learn the interface, but if anyone really loves survival/building games with a lot of micromanaging, I would encourage you to learn by watching a let's play.  It's sad the dev never got to add all the features that were in his vision, but I've sunk more than enough hours into the game that I'd definitely buy it again despite it's unfinished state.			"

								This is an absolutely awesome implementation of the most basic core Dwarf Fortress  ""fortress mode"" mechanics with a UI that makes a Dwarf Fortresslike game very accessible to those who are too put off by the ASCII graphics and UI of DF. I don't mean to make it sound like a ""DF clone"" because really Dwarf Fortress is way too elaborate of a simulation to simply be ""cloned"", and even as elaborate as it is now, Gnomoria still doesn't implement 95% of the insane level of detail in DF. But Gnormoria successfully makes the DF style of game very accessible and is successfully heading off in its own direction in game mechanical terms. Even in the early access state, it's very playable and worth buying especially given the low price.			"

								I'm writing this review for gnomoria after reading a negative review about it still being in early access after all this time. I find that very misleading, yes its in early access but should it be there? EA games could learn a lot from this game. Even in early access gnomoria is more finished than most if not all EA games.In fact should EA games stand for electronic arts or Early Access games!As far as I am concerned this game is Finished and shouldn't be early access, he just doesn't seem to want to stop working on it! does that deserve a negative review?I keep falling for the same thing, thinking how good an early access game looks. I buy it and then what progress seems to slow to a crawl or just stop.I dont play gnomoria that much now, mostly because its a serious time sink. With that in mind look at how long most reviewers have played it for!I am not comparing game play, but I have played GTA V for 71 hours and I'm bored, GTA price £40. Gnomoria 276 hours and I cant play it anymore because it takes way too much of my time, price £5.99.OK the graphics suck, it isn't simple to learn and it can be frustrating. But this is a damn good little game and worth every penny.Sorry rant over.			"

								Despite the fact that the game isn't done yet, it offers great fun. Starting from small group of Gnomes, you create big society. Gnomes do everything by themselves, and player's duty is to show them what to do. You just order them to create farm, but it will be done by gnome whose job is agriculture, not the one you choose (well unless you change his/hers proffesion). Wide amount of materials, workshops and God-knows-what-else causes you always have something to do: change equipment from old, stone swords to new ones, securing your grounds from golbins and ect. building crazy structures...

												Gnomoria is a fantastic managment and sandboxy game that lets you decide exactly what you want and how you will get there. Called dwarf fortress-lite by some I can see it but that is a good thing to me. The UI is SO much better than Dwarf fortress in every single way. I also feel not having things like exactly modeling of every detail of your gnomes pysche is not a negative. I like dwarf fortress but the excessive detail it to much very often. You can make it as easy or hard as you like with monsters and how much ore the map contains and how far down it is beneath the earth. Decide if you want no monsters or have a army every time they show up. For the money you can easily lose yourself for hundreds of hours in this game. I wish I had the time to play it more, nothing like starting a awesome little kingdom and watching it grow to 20-30 gnomes strong or more. Some Quality of Life things that coud be fixed but sadly the Dev now has to do other things to make a living. Summary, an excellent game well worth the money asked for it but it is as it is and unlikey to get more patches.			"

								I was bored waiting for Banished, so my fiance kindly gifted this game to me without me knowing. I am usually a stickler for graphics in today's age of technology in games. Even with the graphics it is a very indepth game of managing and stragery. I love how you have a choice to play peacefully or have the option to defend from mobs both inside and outside of the area you are building. Of course I chose peacefully, because the biggest downfall I've seen so far is no tutorial. It just throws you out there with a not so helpful help tab once you click Esc. Knowing this I would suggest a good beginner's guide, Youtube Let's play, or Wiki. Wiki helped me more than the others. Pros for me:The choice to play just building or have combat.You can micro manage like heck in this game.They have Yaks (Dang you Guild Wars 1)!A wide variety of things to buildfrom chairs, floors, walls, decor...and on and onWhere you can take your imagination and create some interesting Castles, underground city, and the only limitation is your imagination, water, and floor allowance (which I've not run into yet), Um and if you have resources to do such.The price. Great price for the game style and the amount of choice you have (seen more costly games that way less choice).Cons:Well to be honest, only few so far.The graphics (that's me and my fickle self)How slow things are doneAnd it's addictive and I lost time playing it (You play it and you say just a few more things and the next thing you know it has been literally hours since you took a break).And the rough way they slap you in the game with no tutorial, the help tab is pretty much useless in my opinion.And there is not enough hours in the day to play it....oh wait..not the game's bad..my bad!I would honestly rate this game an 8.5 out 10. And so you know I rarely rate any game that high.			"

												A mangagement game where you lead a bunch och gnomes and help them start a new life.-Build your home, on ground  or below it, or both!-plan your resources.-Fight off attacks from various enemies, like goblins and ogres. There is even the undead and creepy crawlers if you dig yourself down abit. Even earth itself will fight you in the form of golems.-Conduct trade to get acces to new exotic goods.Build a fortress,..... or a small farming community, Its up to you!.I wish you could play it multiplayer coop or vsmode.

												Great game even after release.  Not sure about the bugs people are talking about.  I feel like its a good finished game and has opened up for the modder to add more to it.  If you have been wanting to play Dwarf Fortress (DF) but its way to complex for you?  Then I would recomend this game.   I feel like i have gotten my moneys worth out of this game and then some.    Yes there is no tutorial really in the game but it is not hard to learn at all.  And there are many tutorials on Youtube on how to play.   So if you are looking for a fun DF stile game, this is one of the best out there.  Besides play DF its self.			"

												Gnomoria is a fantastic managment and sandboxy game that lets you decide exactly what you want and how you will get there. Called dwarf fortress-lite by some I can see it but that is a good thing to me. The UI is SO much better than Dwarf fortress in every single way. I also feel not having things like exactly modeling of every detail of your gnomes pysche is not a negative. I like dwarf fortress but the excessive detail it to much very often. You can make it as easy or hard as you like with monsters and how much ore the map contains and how far down it is beneath the earth. Decide if you want no monsters or have a army every time they show up. For the money you can easily lose yourself for hundreds of hours in this game. I wish I had the time to play it more, nothing like starting a awesome little kingdom and watching it grow to 20-30 gnomes strong or more. Some Quality of Life things that coud be fixed but sadly the Dev now has to do other things to make a living. Summary, an excellent game well worth the money asked for it but it is as it is and unlikey to get more patches.			"

								As someone who really enjoys the depth of Dwarf Fortress as far as a city builder and management game goes, this game really captures the style of game that Dwarf Fortress is, but in a much more simplified and pretty way. Now that's not going as far as to say it's a better game, but if you prefer graphics over game depth, then this is the game for you.It's soundtrack is just incredible and very cute, happy sounding generally. The tiles and sprites are really adorable, in my opinion, and it's very easy to manage, especially with the mouse controls.It still doesn't beat Dwarf Fortress, but if I'm not up for insane levels of management, this is the game I go to!

								This game is great. If you love city building, resource management, character building and the fact that it is a sandbox, you will enjoy this.The only problem is that it has been an Early Access Game for who knows how long! It is kind of disappointing to see that updates only happen ever so sporadically and take quite a while (Last three updates were in June 2014, October 2014, Feb 2015).I have long stopped playing since I have lost interest and will probably take a look at it when it is finished.

												Gnomoria is the successful attempt to simplify the overly complex Dwarf Fortress, mix in some elements from other games and combine it with some basic isometric graphics and a very well-designed user interface. Basically you get to build a more or less working little gnome village, containing living quarters, industry, farming, mining and so on. In addition to placing buildings and tools, the management of the gnomes and setting their priorities makes up the bulk of the gameplay - and it works really well! Especially at x2 speed, which feels good, there is always something to tweak and improve. Keeping your gnomes alive for a prolonged period of time is a real challenge and min-maxing all aspects of your colony is a really motivating task. That being said, there are unfortunately still some issues and I feel like the game was declared to be finished a bit too early. My main bug bear is the combat system: For one, the way combat is shown is too basic - usually all your gnomes merge on one tile and sit next to the enemy's pile until gnomes retreat to bandage themselves. More importantly, the difficulty seems pretty off-balance to me. Often there are huge spikes in the amount and strength of enemies that arrive. Also, since you cannot micromanage your warriors and only order whole groups, I've often died because I happened to fight on multiple fronts at the same time or because some of my soldiers were sleeping during an attack. Alas, most of the time dying did feel cheap rather than fun. (The fact that most tips/forums recommend cheesing out enemies does not really help.)That being said, I think that Gnomoria is an awesome game. While the game has its flaws, I've literally played it for hundreds of hours and highly recommend it to anyone interested in the genre. I've had a lot of fun with the game and would love to see the dev continue working on it or start working on a sequel.Edit: Originally this was a positive review. However, I noticed that the support email address given on the game's homepage is no longer invalid. Since I cannot wholeheartedly recommend a game that is no longer supported, I have to amend my review accordingly. If the situation changes, I'll update this review accordingly.			"

								It was a long load to get a new game fair with a big world and no servers but the game is like rimworld and not as good (specific). The stocks were not specific to each item just their type unlike rimworld where they list each item for each different stockpile you want. It's more unorganized in other ways like I cant specifically control the characters just their jobs and even then the tasks arent prioritized very well as they are generalized as well. So when a character's sleeping or idle for no reason I can't change that and have to wait for whatever reasont they decide to do their job. The worst part was no tutorial to help along a little. I usually learn on my own but having that as an option would have helped.Lastly ♥♥♥♥ these spider trading cards scared the crap out of me!!			"

Early Access Review
								I had a very positive review of this game up for over a year.  I loved Gnomoria for a long time.  Colony management simulators had really moved up a notch when this game came along.  Since then, it's been a rocky road for this developer, and I've finally changed my review from very positive to negative.This is an okay game.  It used to be a great game.  It seems though that as the code grew (especially the AI code), the developers began to lose control of their project.  Now there are some game crashing bugs in the game, some AI pathing that is very poor, and some serious slow down in the late game.  Seems like a memory leak that can't be tracked down to me, but whatever.On other fronts, other developers have been making some awesome progress in this genre.  Rimworld in particular set the bar much higher than anything before, using the Prison Architect engine, and as it sets now in Early Access is a much better project than Gnomoria is now or ever has been.  Granted, you can't dig down as you can in Gnomoria, but that entire process in Gnomora was always a little more trouble than it was probably worth.  It created some serious bugs in the code as well, it seemed. In addition, it seems the developer has taken a long break or completely abandon Gnomoria for now, so it's probably best to steer clear of it until this is sorted out.			"

Early Access Review
								Updated 10/21/15 - The dev has deleted his list of features from the website and decided the game is more or less done. Gnomoria is still missing a lot of necessary content, and simply relying on the modding community to finish his job for him is extremely unprofessional even if it is an increasingly common story in early access. This game will not be worth the $15 full list price, don't buy.I wish there were a third option between recommending and not recommending. I don't recommend Gnomoria yet.The pros: This is a stable game with great core mechanics. It's Dwarf Fortress with a reasonable interface, solid graphics and many of the unnecessary complications smoothed out. That's a great start.Unfortunately, there are also a lot of cons.As others have pointed out, there just isn't enough content. Gnomoria gets boring... fast. Most of your game is spent underground in the mines, but aside from some topography and the occasional monster there's just nothing down there. It's level after level of emptiness that you excavate because you need minerals, not because there's anything particularly interesting or dangerous that's worth finding.The monsters represent a real threat in the early game, but once you've built up your base and gotten some good equipment they're kind of pushovers. And they're very repetitive. There are 9 types of monsters in the whole game, and even among them the only interesting one are zombies (which can turn your gnomes into zombies on death). The rest only differ in toughness.Developer support has slowed to a crawl. The last update was back in February and the one before that in November.  More worryingly, though, is that the developer doesn't seem aware of what the game really needs. In the past year he's added the following: prosthetic limbs for gnomes, ceramic tiles, craftable automatons and UI/stockpile updates.That's it.For a game that badly needs mid- and late-game content, the developer has been more or less nibbling around the edges.Gnomoria is a game that could be great. I keep coming back hoping I'll have more fun the nth time around. Back when it looked like it was on track this was a solid purchase. Today... follow it and look again once it's out of early access.(I also just noticed how many hours Steam says I've played this game. That's for two reasons: the amount of time it's spent paused and forgotten, and the two weeks I once just let it run in the background to see if anything would actually happen to my gnomes. No.)			"

When i try to mine some stone, the miner ignores me, and after the trees were finally cut, the gnomes would not pick them up, but all in all this game has potential and i cant wait for the final product.

												Gnomoria has brought thousands of hours of enjoyment to my family over the years. So much so, that I have purchased this game multiple times for friends and family. It's basically a colony sim with heavy management elements, city building and some soft strategy. 2D Isometric pixel art and quaint musical themes really hits the sweet spot. It's a shame for sure that development has stopped. Though the game as it stands is so very playable and re-playable, so my full gratitude to the developer.Bottom line, Gnomoria is just lovely, even with some rough edges.			"

Everything in the game can be broken down and rebuilt. It would really benefit from having more types of enemies and more animations though.			"

								It's an easier version of Dwarf Fortress. Sure, you don't have the deep of DF (yet!) but it's a fun game and by no means a casual one, even if it's easier. As the game still is on 'Early access', the game don't have the deep of the DF (nor the years and years of development) but keeps improving with every patch (expect a patch every 2-3 weeks period). For 6€, or even cheaper on sales, this game gives you lots and lots of fun.			"

								Ok, so far to date, one of the best Town builder type of games I have played. I love the music and the options you have. The interface if easy to use and you don't have to set up complex series of commands and hope someone will do the job. There are a few snag areas you can run into, but if you take your time and think things out, you will do fine. It also allows you to choose some of the aspects of the map you want to set up. This gives you the ability to make a large or small, flat or mountainous, bumpy or smooth map. It also lets you choose the resource abundance, and enemy aspects. I like that they add trading and diplomacy into the game as well. Over all, I would say there isn't much more that they could add to this game to make it better. I have a lot of time in this game, but that is because I could leave a ton of commands set up, go to bed, wake up for work and check to see if they were done. Then go to work, come home and see where they were at. At times, it was like have an amazing ant farm, and other times, I would return to find out, a bear had gotten into my town and killed all my little gnomes. The game is definately worth it though if you like city building and time management. You also can't beat the price.			"

								This game is great, I have had many hours of enjoyment on this game. I started off hating it because I thought it was way to complicated to be able to enjoy it; but after some time and effort I was able to get the gist of the game and still find it a pleasure to play.The only con I have to this game is after you get your kingdom super well off and your doing really well, it seems to reach a point where the game just can't handle all that is going on anymore, there's to much for it. Maybe it's a hardware issue but I have seen it happen in many different situations.			"

								If you're interested in Dwarf Fortress but intimidated with its learning curve, Gnomoria is a fantastic DF-lite game with its own style. The creator is amazingly responsive and puts out updates on a very frequent basis, so even for an Early Access game it is very full-featured! I encourage anyone who has any sort of interest in a ""city building"" game or anyone who wants to eventually get into Dwarf Fortress to give this game a try -- it's well worth its low price!			"

								Gnomoria is decent town simulator game for those who either played Dwarf Fortress or are looking for something more than banished. The community is very active and the devs are very good and quite approachable. The forums are very helpful for new players and are constantly reviewed by more experienced players.Pro's - Easy to use UI- Gameplay the entices you to try again after you fail- Moderate native content but a fairly active modding community that adds alot of depth- Retro style 8-bit graphics- Regular Updates (Cancelled)Con's - No in game tutorial meaning you have to trawl youtube and the forums to learn how to play- Limited range of enemies, sometimes destroying goblins and mants just isnt enough- Very AddicitiveOverall a great game headed for a greater future. :DEdit*Unfortunately the developer of this game is no longer working on it, bascially since the game left early access there have been no official updates. However the modding community has kept the game alive to some extent. It is sad for me, as in the foreseeable the future of my favourite game is dark.			"

												Updating my review: Full release is great. Love the music -- the orchestral version -- the job queuing is 1000x better than it was in EA. I'll leave it on in the background while I'm working at night so my gnomes can work through their queues while I do something else. It is definitely a slower-paced for someone with patience, but it is very rewarding.			"

								Really enjoyed this game. It's got some great balancing and challenge mechanics that allow you to take your time and progress at a pace you can handle. Get too greedy with your digging or grow your city without proper protection and deal with the consequences. Some features I really love is having individual gnomes with names that you can assign jobs, track their lives and achievements through the seasons. See how many goblins they can slay and keep them alive when they get injured. I had a gnome called Jazz that had an arm and both legs cut off. He had served my kingdom well since its inception so I built him his own bedroom and workshop right next to each other. He then became my kingdoms master jeweler until my entire kingdom was wiped out by ogres and goblins. I was getting worse and worse attacks because master Jazz was making the best jewlery in the lands, which raised my kingdom value enough to see hordes rushing me.You can farm crops, tend to livestock, craft all kinds of furniture and weapons and armour all which take into account minute details about what its components are and the quality of construction.You can also terraform the lands to suit your purposes, make a base inside a mountain or build a castle whatever tickles your fancy.You do not control your gnomes directly, rather control is done in 2 stages. First you give gnomes tasks they are allowed to perform like chopping trees. Then when you assign a tree to be felled the most available gnome runs over and does it. This cuts the micromanagement to a level you can decide which is great. You can micromanage every task to happen straight away or just set a task and forget about it, someone will fix it later. This is the opposite to facebook/browser style village games where you have to do every little thing yourself.			"

								Beautiful game and highly addictive.Gnomoria is the work of one man, RoboBob, and is inspired by games like Dwarf Fortress. RoboBob updates the game twice or thrice per month and is in direct contact with the community. While it takes some time to get used to the game mechanics and UI, once you are there it plays very good.Games like this are the reason why Early Access and Indie games are good for the PC gaming industry.

								First off: be aware that this game has a select target audience.  It is essentially Dwarf Fortress Lite, and therefore a micromanagement game.  This means you will spend a lot of time in menus, messing with lots of stuff to get your dudes doing what you wnat them to.  However, where Dwarf Fortress has a learning curve about like a brick wall, This game's curve, while still steep, is not near as bad.  The UI is fairly intuitive, and once you have an idea of what you want to do, getting it done is usually fairly straightforward.  A starter quest system or some other form of tutorial for the game would be extremely useful in indicating your priorities and helping fortresses to actually survive their first year (my first didn't), but unfortunately all that is availabe at the moment are youtube videos.All in all, I would reccomend Gnomoria to anyone willing to take the time to learn how to play, as it is quite enjoyable at that point.

								From the screenshots, I thought this might be a cool game, so I waited for it to go on sale (in case it sucked) and purchased it.  I fell in love with the gameplay quickly, and now I wish I had bought it when it first came to early access!  This style game isn't for everyone, but for those who do like city management games should love Gnomoria as well.  My friends hate me for playing too much Gnomoria instead of multiplayer games with them, but this game is just ridiculously addictive!  There is a learning curve, but it's not very steep.  I'm hoping that future updates (it's still in development as I am writing this) will provide a starting point for beginners, and perhaps a few UI improvements that will make it easier for those players to grasp the gameplay conventions in use.

								A good dwarf fortress/resource management game. I bought it way back when it first appeared on Steam in Alpha, and I have not been dissappointed. The developer updates regularly and has been both fixing bugs and adding huge amounts of content in a relatively short amount of time. The first couple hours of each game can be ridiculously hard on any other setting than Peaceful, but I'm hoping that gets balanced out in the future (perhaps starting out with a bone needle, and more straw would do it).

								I really like strategy games, and I have tried a lot of games in this particular sub-genre. This is by far the best. You are able to control each gnome by menas of a complex set of custimizable macros. The enemies come frequently and long term investments are worth while. The only problem with the game is that this sub-genre is awful.			"

								Like Dwarf fortress but want a easier to learn game? Want more graphics? Like a active modding community?  Then get this. You can play completely with assignable hotkeys and/or GUI mouse controls.You start off with area to start your gnome colony in.From there you have to assign jobs for your gnomes,set up farms,plant seeds,gather resources,etc. Build your homes/kingdom both above ground and/or below.Mine materials,craft them into various things,keep food and water stockpiles etc. Its pretty much like what any new colony would have to do in order to survive.Lots of fun,(remember its still in alpha/beta) a good amount of growing content,responsive Dev that tweaks the game based on community feedback,weekly -biweekly updates. Lots of fun for hours on end. Your choice of playing pure survival with no hostiles (peacemode) or switching to or started normal mode which has everything in peacemode but with hostiles.if you like what you read then do yourself a favor and get it.

								A very fun little game. Awesome how you can have almost total control over your map settings, like how big it is and how strong your enemies are, etc. This makes it so you can play the game exactly how YOU want to play it. Love how many different possibilities to build there are. You can build all kinds of rooms and furniture.One thing I strongly dislike about it, though, is that it is very hard to learn the controls and how to play the game in general. I had to watch a 30 minute tutorial video on YouTube to even start playing. But once I did get the hang of it, it is pretty straight forward. (I recommend changing your hotkeys in the settings!) Also, music gets annoying.I think many things can be improved. This game is, however, still under development! Considering, this game is awesome and has so much stuff! It's hard to tell how long certain tasks will take. Your crops have no timer, so you can't tell how long until fully grown, not even a graphic to show growth level. One day, they just pop up fully grown. Mine took like....8 or 9 game days to fully grow...I thought this was a bug at first, preventing my crops to grow! Same with your gnomes sleeping, I thought they were glitched and wouldn't wake up....turns out they just needed to sleep longer.All things considered....the game is worth the money to me so far. I have just purchased it today, though. I'm looking forward to future game updates, and hoping the developers make a lot of needed changes!			"

								Gnomoria is a bit brutal to new players. You'll almost definitely have to follow a guide to survive your first year, but there's a lot of depth and enjoyment to be had building your fortress/empire once you've figured out the basics.How many gnomes you get and how difficult the monsters are depends on your ""kingdom value"", so you can manage the difficulty by simply limiting the valuables you create until you're ready. Also, the amount of gnomes you get is based on how many you're supposed to have for your kingdom value. If you lose gnomes during a season you'll get more gnomes on the next migration to make up for it, so as long you don't get wiped you can always recover. Better food and drink make your gnomes work faster, better beds and rooms make them sleep less, and you can optimize storage and production chains by specializing gnomes and carefully placing your workshops. The early game is survival, the mid game is improving efficiency, and the late game is creative construction. This type of game is probably not for everyone, but if you're a stubborn strategic control freak creative mastermind you'll love it.			"

												[EDIT] Switching review to negative, unfortunately. Game has been abandoned by the developer with a lot of the fundamentals left unfinished. [/edit]Have you wanted to try Dwarf Fortress but got scared by the ASCII graphics, a crafting tree so complex your eyes glaze over just trying to figure out how to make soap, and game mechanics so complex that you actually need that soap to keep your post-surgery dwarves from dying to infection? Fear not, Gnomoria might be just what you're looking for. Gnomoria takes many of the mechanics of Dwarf Fortress, tones them back to a moderate complexity level, and gives you an improved GUI and charming graphics to work with.  In Gnomoria you'll command your gnomish settlers to dig out a fortress and work in 3 main job categories: agriculture, crafting, and defence. Like Dwarf Fortress, many of the jobs in these fields are interrelated, with one supply chain feeding into another. Combat is both one of the fun and weak points of the game. You'll enjoy kitting your gnomes out and watching them chop goblins limb from limb, but you'll need to work fast and train hard to prepare for your first Mantis invasion. Inevitably, your first (and second, and likely fifth) run-through will leave your fortress a slaughter house, if it doesn't end with your dwarves starving and dying of thirst.  That's ok, though. Gnomoria, like DF, is a rogue-like. And, like DF, ""losing is fun"".			"

As the game still is on 'Early access', the game don't have the deep of the DF (nor the years and years of development) but keeps improving with every patch (expect a patch every 2-3 weeks period). For 6€, or even cheaper on sales, this game gives you lots and lots of fun.			"

								Ok, so far to date, one of the best Town builder type of games I have played. I love the music and the options you have. The interface if easy to use and you don't have to set up complex series of commands and hope someone will do the job. There are a few snag areas you can run into, but if you take your time and think things out, you will do fine. It also allows you to choose some of the aspects of the map you want to set up. This gives you the ability to make a large or small, flat or mountainous, bumpy or smooth map. It also lets you choose the resource abundance, and enemy aspects. I like that they add trading and diplomacy into the game as well. Over all, I would say there isn't much more that they could add to this game to make it better. I have a lot of time in this game, but that is because I could leave a ton of commands set up, go to bed, wake up for work and check to see if they were done. Then go to work, come home and see where they were at. At times, it was like have an amazing ant farm, and other times, I would return to find out, a bear had gotten into my town and killed all my little gnomes. The game is definately worth it though if you like city building and time management. You also can't beat the price.			"

								Really enjoyed this game. It's got some great balancing and challenge mechanics that allow you to take your time and progress at a pace you can handle. Get too greedy with your digging or grow your city without proper protection and deal with the consequences. Some features I really love is having individual gnomes with names that you can assign jobs, track their lives and achievements through the seasons. See how many goblins they can slay and keep them alive when they get injured. I had a gnome called Jazz that had an arm and both legs cut off. He had served my kingdom well since its inception so I built him his own bedroom and workshop right next to each other. He then became my kingdoms master jeweler until my entire kingdom was wiped out by ogres and goblins. I was getting worse and worse attacks because master Jazz was making the best jewlery in the lands, which raised my kingdom value enough to see hordes rushing me.You can farm crops, tend to livestock, craft all kinds of furniture and weapons and armour all which take into account minute details about what its components are and the quality of construction.You can also terraform the lands to suit your purposes, make a base inside a mountain or build a castle whatever tickles your fancy.You do not control your gnomes directly, rather control is done in 2 stages. First you give gnomes tasks they are allowed to perform like chopping trees. Then when you assign a tree to be felled the most available gnome runs over and does it. This cuts the micromanagement to a level you can decide which is great. You can micromanage every task to happen straight away or just set a task and forget about it, someone will fix it later. This is the opposite to facebook/browser style village games where you have to do every little thing yourself.			"

								Beautiful game and highly addictive.Gnomoria is the work of one man, RoboBob, and is inspired by games like Dwarf Fortress. RoboBob updates the game twice or thrice per month and is in direct contact with the community. While it takes some time to get used to the game mechanics and UI, once you are there it plays very good.Games like this are the reason why Early Access and Indie games are good for the PC gaming industry. It feels to me almost a finished game and it has provided much more enjoyment than AAA games.			"

								First off: be aware that this game has a select target audience.  It is essentially Dwarf Fortress Lite, and therefore a micromanagement game.  This means you will spend a lot of time in menus, messing with lots of stuff to get your dudes doing what you wnat them to.  However, where Dwarf Fortress has a learning curve about like a brick wall, This game's curve, while still steep, is not near as bad.  The UI is fairly intuitive, and once you have an idea of what you want to do, getting it done is usually fairly straightforward.  A starter quest system or some other form of tutorial for the game would be extremely useful in indicating your priorities and helping fortresses to actually survive their first year (my first didn't), but unfortunately all that is availabe at the moment are youtube videos.All in all, I would reccomend Gnomoria to anyone willing to take the time to learn how to play, as it is quite enjoyable at that point.

The developer updates regularly and has been both fixing bugs and adding huge amounts of content in a relatively short amount of time. The first couple hours of each game can be ridiculously hard on any other setting than Peaceful, but I'm hoping that gets balanced out in the future (perhaps starting out with a bone needle, and more straw would do it).

								I originally didn't like this game because it was a little difficult to play but once I got the hang of it I loved it. I sometimes play for hours without knowing it. When i get home from work I always tell myself I will play just for a little bit and then its time to go to bed. You will go through a few games and just get destroyed if you aren't careful. So I recommend watching some of the videos out there for some Tips & Tricks. Start off on a Flat map then once you think you have got the hang of it try a more Mountainous map.			"

								I really like strategy games, and I have tried a lot of games in this particular sub-genre. This is by far the best. You are able to control each gnome by menas of a complex set of custimizable macros. The enemies come frequently and long term investments are worth while. The only problem with the game is that this sub-genre is awful.			"

								-- WHY NOT ? --Simple, not innovative, but complete! Gnomoria takes the principle of Dwarf Fortress with good graphics, basic commands and a ""different"" way to approach things! for me the only reason I don't like to play Dwarf Fortress is because of the graphics and the fact (I know I can change it but NO) Gnomoria is there to help you understand all the fun you can get with this strategy/sandbox game ! :) It's a 8/10 for me !

								Played only 5 minutes so far, I know I should to more research but honestly, this game is hard to understand, I don't like tutorials for most games but this is one of those times where a tutorial is NEEDED.There don't seem to be any animations leaving a dull feeling.It's obvious this game was most likey inspired by some overly hyped game that died after it was released but I can see this was going to take a Terraria route. Take what you have, change one thing, that trainslates into a completely different game.Terraria went into a 2D side scrolling game that is better than what it was based on (Or at least now it is) The thing is, even if you knew nothing about how to do things, it was still easy to learn through the gameplay.This game took the idea that Terraria had, mixed it with a bit of the Sims, and added a top down perspective.It worked out, but the problem is it needs a tutorial, it falls flat without one and not wanting to try and learn how to play it mostly due it being hard to understand (Like Towns is.) It's makes me feel lost, alone, confused, and a bit frustrated.It's not that I don't WANT to learn as I play, that's real fun to do, it's just that you leave me with nothing but my own thoughts, like trying to figure out how to lockpick a door, I need SOME form of a hint.Overall, it looks good so far, I can't give an opinion, I'll change my thoughts and the review when I learn and play this game more extensively, right now I'm not in the mood to spend an hour trying to learn how to get the people to do things.(Due to alot of backlash towards most of my reviews because little kids can't seem to understand what an ""opinion"" is and get angry and overreact at something sticking out of the pervervial line, I must leave a warning. Thanks kids!)This is my opinion, I make these reviews to get my opinion out there, if you disagree, I'm not saying my opinions are fact, in which case, no need to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at something as trivial as a ""review"" or ""opinion"" I have an opinion and a mind that proccesses things and I like to let them be known rather than sheltered, weather it be good or bad. I'm not trying to change anyone's opinion on anything, if you disagree, calmly, put my thoughts into perspective, and see if you agree or not. If you don't want to do that and would rather rage over my opinion, then don't look at reviews, you're not mature enough to handle them.			"

								This little game is relentlessly compared to Dwarf Fortress, and it is a just comparison.The likeness to dwarf fortress is obvious in many ways. The game is not as deep as dwarf fortress but has one MAJOR advantage; The game is designed to not fry your brain with ASCII and fey moods, tantrum spirals or catsplosions. It has some nifty automation features and an isometric GUI with mouse navigable menus . Not DF's arbitrary keyboard shotcuts and terrible ....... can we call them graphics?If u had any love for DF at all, but just didnt want to commit weeks to learning WTF you are looking at, then Gnomoria is worth a go. You could even get this to warm you up for DF :P. The game is perfectly playable in current state and updates are very regular and well documented. The developer is friendly and makes time to answer questions about updates or technical issues. With time i hope its depth will rival DF's!  All round, a nice little management game. 7/10 (P.S. my steam playtime is 0hours as i bought the game before steam early access but much time has been invested into this game)			"

								Well first, I give this game a good rating because it has a lot of options (Also because the gnomes can be horrible fighters and you have to train them.)I spent about 3 hours building a fortress and when my gnome went down in the mine to get some coal, he was attacked by a zombie. My gnomes defeated the zombie but one gnome went to the hospital. The gnome reanimated and ate my other gnomes. One gnome was left in the dormitory. he went outside and noticed about 13 FREAKING ZOMBIES.He ran for his life, stupidly he went in the hospital and, he was attacked by the other 3 zombie gnomes.I was very sad, but what cheered me up was when something came up saying ""congratulations, you kingdom has fallen""			"

								Tried Dwarf Fortress. Had to look up a wiki for controls and being able to tell what stuff is before even having to look up a wiki for gameplay stuff. Obviously you can get your head into it but thats an investment i wasnt ready to make. Ill spare you a lengthy rant about a free game :pWith this game you get some nice graphics and you can click on a pickaxe with a down arrow to dig instead of d+d (or was it d+h?). And it pretty much got anything DF has except Gnome personalities (could be coming, this is still early access) and beard hair physics or whatever.Highly recommended if you like any type of base/village building/managing/defending sim stuff. ( Pretty bad game picture tho, makes you think of Terraria 2d style but its actually isometric :d )			"

								this is a fun game depending on what you want. if you wanna fully customize your very own kingdom to the fullest then yes this will be your dream... but if you want to survive and overcome challenge to reach a higher purpose then no...simply put this game isn't rewarding ""per se""when you've set up all your workshops and entered mid game what more is there to do? you've done your sleeping quarters, you've optimized your crafts, the kingdom is stable. and you stop having a purpose... you can mine for more worth and increase your great hall and thats about it, and by now my colony looks like a cramped death star... heck I even created one! tho it was more like a borg ship from star trek... Quadrangular not Circular... I can take on anything the game throws at me and its not rewarding at all!now if I were to create a beautiful town with houses and a castle, and the smiths house and the farmers house and all... sure maybe I would enjoy myself accomplishing building a village! but why would I wanna do that? sorry but for me thats a waste of time... and if thats what this game is meant to do then no, this game is not for you.on the otherhand if you enjoy crafting and building and manage to create a sustainable town with fashion then yes! this game is for you... though chances are you will get invaded and killed because you were focusing on the beauty of your town rather than working on your defenses. but if you manage then yeah you could consider it very rewarding.as of now all there is to do is to build a kingdom and survive, make it pretty. the game promises many features such as diplomacy and catastrophic events maybe even adding magic. tho I think this game will still be the same with simply more added features.I've played this on and off. I know how its like when they add new features. I feel done with this game. I forgot to mention building and trying to make a kingdom stable can take from 6-100 hours depending on what you want. it could also be never ending if your kingdom never fallsthis game is probably worth your money... but is it worth your time?

								Great game, it's like Dwarf Fortress but without the hassle of the mods you would get for 3D view, although it doesn't have as many features as Dwarf Fortress, it can at least appeal to people who would be interested into Dwarf Fortress. Don't understand or want to learn DoS graphics, then this game is for you. If you do want to learn and understand DoS graphics and learn how to play Dwarf Fortress then you would LOVE to play Dwarf Fortress rather than this.Dwarf Fortress makes you use your imagination on which games now lack now-a-day's lack the ability too.Basically, Dwarf Fortress ""blunt"", get this, if you want the Dwarf Fortress ""cocaine"", go for Dwarf Fortress itself.

								I am having such a good time with this! You might find the game overwhelming at first! There should be and probably will be a standardized tutorial, it should show you the basics of survival. Also start with an easier game, no enemies, and just learn how to build and play it first, THEN make a world with some monsters if you'd like.   After a solid hour of reading up how to play online I really got to enjoy Gnomoria. For $7.99 I really got a good deal on this. I prefer setting the music to it's more orchestrated less ""8-bit"" version but that's just me.   I would enjoy being able to change how your gnomes look like off the start. Maybe get to create one leader gnome that you get to distribute their starting stats from, using a set pool of points or something but that's such a minor thing that I would never care if I didn't see it.

								For those that want to play Dwarf Fortress, but can't quite deal with the lack of interface, this should be their go-to replacement. Gnomoria plays much like Dwarf Fortress, but lacks the staggering amount of content, that DF is known for. Instead, it has a UI that makes the game much more accessible, and actual non-ascii graphics, that also happen to be rather charming. I'd recommend this game for anyone that wants to play a city / village / fort / hollowed-out-mountain builder.			"

												Downvoting a game because it is no longer in development is a scumbag move. As a fellow game developer, it is easy to see that Gnomoria is a fantastic game that has been built to serve a purpose and does exactly that.Downvoting a game because the author will not provide source code is a doubly scumbag move. Again, as someone who develops games I can say that there is no way in hell I would let players dip their fingers in a game that I worked extremely hard to produce.Unfortunately we can see here that Gnomoria has been poisoned by spoiled players. People who feel they are special snowflakes and that developers live and breathe to serve their interests. Again, Gnomoria was built to serve a purpose and does so nicely. I am loving this game so far and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in a challenge!			"

												Ok, let's begin with the simple: the game is not abandoned. It is FINISHED.The GoodThose 206h (As of the time of this review) I have, are from 4 to 9 updates ago. Know what this means? That the game was very ♥♥♥♥ing playable when it had much less content than it does now. And even then, I hadn't done everything the game had to offer.I can't remommend this game enough. I bought it once on sale (When I first discovered), and again on normal price just to support the dev.People are just ♥♥♥♥ing spoiled. They expected this to be like Minecraft or Dwarf Fortress, and get updates forever. This game could have 10 times the content it has now, and when the dev said it was finished and stop updating, people would consider it abandoned all the same.Do not expect Dwarf Fortress levels of depth and content to the game. DF is a multi-dev decade and half spanning game. This is a solo-dev 4 year game.The game also has mod support, but I haven't played since it got it, so I can't say much about that. But you can see that how that will help.Also, as a final note, the dev was very active on the gnomoria subreddit during development, so you know that what he did was very community guided, not like most games, where the dev team does what it wants, and you have to deal with it. Especially many Quality of Life updates.The BadOk, now to be honest, the game isn't perfect. (Although it is perfect enoughSince I last played, and as far as I know, some tasks might have inconstant effects (Like Hauling, where the gnomes pick up very far items on the floor, instead of the closest) and using wheelbarrows (Where they should pickup many itens, but sometimes pick just 1, like it was done without the wheelbarrow). But than again, this doesn't happen all the time.And if you are very good and your kingdom grows a lot, depending on your PC, the game might start to lag, since it has so many gnomes (And maybe enemies too!) to process. Now, this isn't exactly the game's fault, it's a computing limitation. Physics will only let your computer run so many CPU cycles per second.			"

												[Overall Opinion]Great replacement for your Dwarf Fortress needs. However, it has been abandoned by Devs and is broken on MacOS.[Cons]-No saved game support for mac. -No Devs left on the project to fix their broken realease.-Not enough content, Mods required.-No open source files, so, small modding community-Nothing more than a cleaned up Dwarf Fortress Clone[Pros]-Clean 32bit graphics-Simplifed UI-Great base building-Great Stockpile/Workshop Managament[Personal Problems]-Does not save on MacOS. Stay away fellow apple users...-Not Optimized well enough for smooth play on lesser machines-No Co-op play (why game without friends?)			"

												This game could be awsome and it is quiet good! But it has many flaws and sadly some which make it sometimes unplayable :(Positiv: Easy but still kinda complex I love the art style Small mod support (this is very nice as it add lots of different items) You can insult goblins Your Yaks can kill bad things(With rating 1 - 10 | 10 = worst)Negativ: 10/10 it's programmed as single core game you notice this heavily when you get attacked by a large horde of Goblins.    This case is not nice but it's okay to deal with.The real problem appears when it starts to stutter and you have        absolutely no clue why. This can ruin a whole kingdom and several hours of gametime. 8/10 Altough this game has a lot of fun (for me) and I could play this for thousends of hours it has one big flaw... Bugs...    As everybody else i just can say this game is probably abandon by the Dev,    although he said that he still want's to fix bugs after the release and I would love this as it has a lot of little flaws like:   You can check ""Avoid fighting"" for a squad but if you want to train your gnomes after this they keep running away                which is a little bit annoying if you want to train new gnomes  The AI for building or mining jobs is bad! When you have multiple build jobs (Walls) it could happen that they shut in                  themselfs  Various small things which don't occur that often 1/10 You cannot ride your pastured animalsWhen he would fix the stutter problem I would give it a thumb up... but like this... it sometimes just gets unplayable!Sorry for grammer and other mistakes as english is not my main language!
