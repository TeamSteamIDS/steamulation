												Before I start, even though I may have a small amount of hours, I have experienced enough of the game mechanics, as I already own SR:CW and SR:2020, and I know how these games work.I have always had fun with this series in the past. And even now, I can enjoy myself playing Supreme Ruler Ultimate... for a while that is. I would love to support the developers at battlegoat. I really would. However this game has so many large issues that NEED fixing, yet since I discovered this game 2 months ago. Nothing has changed.First off, the AI is much better than the previous titles. So I will praise Battlegoat for that. However the negatives outweigh the positives in this game.The economy has always been a massive factor in Supreme Ruler games. And that is why it must be done right. But in this game, the economy is done poorly. Instead of fresh water (which is a necessity for any poputation) they replaced it with rubber. RUBBER! The only natural rubber resources are in 3rd world countries. Perhaps this is supposed to be balance. But it is the worst balancing attempt I have ever seen. Also, the bond system people requested to return from SR:2020, was not brought back despite the communtiy requesting it. (The bond system allowed you to manually take out new bonds or pay off debt) Now, this new debt system works in Supreme Ruler Cold War (not sure about 1936). But not this game. It is SO broken, that when a minister takes out a loan, it translates into free money! NO debt is added! Also, in the start dates, nobody has any debt (but I will not continue this complaint as the debt system does not work)At times, you can suddenly start losing hundreds of millions a day for no reason. One day you just made 28 mil, and the next you start losing 100+ mil day after day until you take out a ""free-money"" loan.I, personally think the research system in this game is better than any SR game, with the tech trees, and the 4 different tech races all in one (Race for the Bomb --> Space Race --> Internet Race (race to develop the internet) --> Race to Mars). And this also combines with the military system, by researching units models. However, the WW2 stuff was rushed during the development of SR1936, and it seems the devs made no effort trying to add to this. (Seriously?! ""Tank Designs '39?"") The world war 2 tech is extremely shallow in comparison to the time periods of the Cold War and 2020.And WW2, what a disaster. The Chinese are an unstoppable, filthy rich, military superpower by the time the Japanese invade. (SERIOUSLY?! China wasnt even a country back then!) USSR is weak as hell, and gets annexed by Germany very fast. The USA never joins or trades with the allies, even after they declare war on the axis. Oh, and there is a global shortage of Industry goods. And Consumer Goods get random unexplained shortages as well.However I can have fun with this game, the many errors ruin the experience and immersion. Also, this game is FAR from finished. Most of the errors I have listed have been reported as I have seen. And the developers have said time and time again they will look into and fix these issues. However instead of fixing these issues, they took the game out of early access! This is obviously a BETA product and is not at all ready to be released. Yet they did release the game. And what a massive pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥it has turned out to be....Here is a summaryPros: -Diverse selection of start dates and scenarios-Much improved military AI-Very detailed world (2020 and cold war, not 1936)-Speeds are very good-Diverse technology-Diverse selection of unitsCons:-Same music, tends to get annoying with the same song over and over-The AI likes to turn the world into a massive love fest during the 2020 scenario. Allying random nations across the world, and barely starting wars-Economy is too broken to even be considered functional-Weather system does not actually do anything-World war 2 is terribly thrown together-USA and China are mega-superpowers during WW2?-Replacing Fresh Water with Rubber makes no sense-A nation with full friendly relations with you will often refuse to make any diplomatic deals with you (other than trading items for items/money)-The sphere of influence makes sense during Cold War, and kinda during 1936. But the whole sphere thing during 2020 makes NO sense, and will end up in ruining relations with other nations.-AI does not seem to react to you conquering neighbours, unlike in Cold War and 2020-Random shortages of resources that make no sense-Soundtrack recycled from other Supreme ruler gamesAll in all, i give this game a 6/10. Do not buy this game. It is not worth it, as the developers have released a beta product, and neglected to fix the game.To shut people up: SOME of these things have been fixed, however I still do not reccomend the game to anyone "

												This is the last time I will purchase from this developer.  I want to support games like this ...because it plays so close to what I like in games.My preference is sandbox mode and this game is such a non event when you play this setting.  How can I interact with a virtual world that does little if anything to connect me to it.PRO: This will satisfy your desire to conquer the world.  CONS: Same thing lacking here as in other Supreme Ruler games, there is nothing that invests you into this virtual world. If you are waiting for your virtual world to make sense, not going to happen.  You are just going to wait until China or Russia attack (ie. If you are a NATO country) and then decide how long before you counter attack.  The AI will make you walk to Moscow or Bejing because it won't know to accept a peace deal at its borders once you have removed them from occupying a foriegn territory. Esentially the same game you have already in your Steam account .. just some different paint.Save your money, wait for a sale. Message to developer - Please work on how the AI (other countries) work against or with you.  Never does a player feel connected to this world.  Perhaps more in game messages, maybe International news or something that highlights what is occuring in the virtual world.  Human players are way too disconnected from the rest of the AI to feel connected to the experience that we are ALL hoping for.  How are the players suppose to get a sense of the international community?  Everything a player does is reactive to the virtual environement with no real chance to be proactive.  It would be nice to know that China is focusing on certain countries or regions ... maybe I send over an aircraft carrier to send a message that may influence China ... one way or another.If you develop any other games (and I hope you do) I will be waiting for reviews before supporting it.I have bought them all ... but no more.T.PS. I am a big fan, I just want more of an experience.			"

Early Access Review
								Supreme Ruler... ah, where do I even begin? Have you ever wanted to conquer the world? Build an empire to rival the British? Watch your nation prosper (or fail) under your command?This is as good as it gets folks. SR is a geopolitical grand strategy game set in the modern era, best described as a unique mix of Civilization and Risk. Play as any nation in six different sandbox campaign maps, or try your luck playing as one of the world superpowers through World War 2 or the Cold War (and beyond!). You control your nation's military, logistics, finances, resources, infrastructure, diplomacy, and espionage while competing to spread your influence around the globe. If that sounds overwhelming, and trust me it probably is at first, your AI cabinet ministers can help manage some of those aspects for you (or with you).There are hundreds of real-life units to research and build, and a whole range of futuristic-inspired units and technologies to expand games well beyond the year 2070.A few minor issues here and there, though nothing game-breaking (and if there is, they're pretty good about patching)... I've found hundreds of hours of enjoyment from this series, and I feel like I've just scratched the surface. That being said, the diplomacy is a bit simplistic, the economy is frustrating (well, that's probably not BG's fault), the AI has momentary fatal lapses of judgment, naval combat and pathing need a bit more work, and some things just generally feel unimportant and neglected (like aircraft carriers, but probably because the AI doesn't know what to do with them)... All in all, this is an incredible sandbox game. It's extremely moddable (though tedious unless we get some proper mod tools), and there's a ton of settings to play around with and victory conditions to play on.The choice is up to you, do you want to follow history as closely as possible, or completely rewrite it?

												I actually like this game, but there are some serious problems and flaws that need to be addressed. Not the greatest but definitely one of the best in it's genre.1. Performance issue. I have a high end pc with 16 gb ram and i7 processor but after several minutes of playing the game always gets slow and becomes UNPLAYABLE. I have Supreme Ruler Cold War (SRCW), SRCW does have performance issue as well but it's less severe compared to Supreme Ruler ultimate. This needs to be fixed asap.2. You cant choose to annex particular regions that you want. In March of The Eagles you have the ability to choose particular regions that you want to annex after defeating enemy nation which is absolutely a great feature.3. Auto annex territory after liberating or colonizing a country with certain regions that arent loyal to the country you conquered. This may confuses people who havent played the game, but for those who have played the game long enough will understand what i mean. Its pretty annoying that when i play as Soviet Union and liberated Turkey, region of kurdistan gets annexed automatically by USSR, my USSR does not need nor want kurdistan region and it messes up the map. It certainly looks ugly.4. Spreading your ideology (either Communism or Democracy) with nations other than Soviet Union (for communism) and USA (for democracy) is impossible. For example if you play as Cuba with communism ideology and spread your communism ideology to neighbouring countries will not make those countries join the warsaw pact sphere of influence. In every sandbox game i play, NATO will always dominate Soviet Union no matter what. I think they either need to add spreading ideology as another nation feature or add an option which alliance (NATO or Warsaw Pact) that will dominate in the game, neutral or balanced alliance option would also be a nice feature.

Early Access Review
								I haven't played any Supreme Ruler game before but even for a noob like me this is a good game and very polished for early access. If you enjoyed global strategy in the veins of Paradox grand strategy titles (Crusader Kings 2, Europa Universalis 4) you'll love this. You can play different campaigns starting with Nazi-Germany in 1936, US or Soviet Union in the Cold War era, up to the bleak post-nuclear future in 2020. In addiditon, you can take control of any country you like in Sandbox mode and try to shape the future. Just like with all the other grand strategy titles you love, your possibilities are amlost endless and the tutorials are barebones at least, so you will have to be willing to learn a lot by trial and error, but due to effective automization options your country will not disintegrate just because you don't know what you're doing. Simply delegate tasks you don't want to handle to your ministers and you can focus on the things you want. From what I've played so far I am really enjoying myself. The only issue I had was during the Germany campaign, when I attacked Poland, the allies did not declare war on me. This might be a bug - or alternative history in the making. Anyways, I enjoyed playing out what this alternative scenario means for Europe and the world.			"

												I once played board games like Third Reich, and Battle of the Bulge when I was a child, but now this game turned my childhood games into a virtual reality. Pros: + No end limit (WW2: 1936-Infinite) (Cold War: 1949-Infinite) (Trump Rising: 2017-Infinite) (World: 2020-Infinite)+ No max unit count+ Rich true history and events.+ The game is NOT a turn based game+ Hundreds if not a thounsand of unique units+ Very rich technology research tree+ Has cheats if your terrible at the single player games+ Every country in the game is playable, with the possiblity of taking over the world.+ Very interesting modding capabilities (Such as reviving all of Kurdistan, combining both Germanys durring the cold war, and even changing flags) Cons:- Minor game bugs that affect gameplay (Such as ships being stuck in the Caspian sea until you send them to a port nearby)- Multiplayer is very buggy (Usually a third party game networking system is required, such as Tunngle, Evolve, Hamachi, or Game Ranger)- Game saves have a slight chance of corruption (Backup your saves)- Hard to learn to play at first, but becomes clear after a while once you understand the controls  Overall, this game will blow you away if your a big History/Strategy fan who just happens to play computer games.

												This is one of those times I started playing a game and was mad I hadn't heard of it before. It really does deserve a much larger fanbase. Anyway, it is an awesome game with a very small, but dedicated team.Pros-Much larger unit base than any other comparable game. You know how Civ gives you a few units for each era? Well, this gives you hundreds, if not thousands.-Intensive combat system. Models many of the intricacies of war, inclusing missiles, a detailed supply system, and many more things missed in other grand strategy games.-Detailed economy. Models a decent variety of resources, all with profitabilities that fluctuate as supply and demand change, as well as your own country's internal economic factors such as inflation, unemployment, and infrastructure,-Large amount of researchable techs. This game offers a very large and detailed tech tree that has a wide variety of effects on your nation.-AI allocation. While this game has a steep learning curve, the game offers AI advisors that can pretty much run your nation for you. Their actions are hardly ever ideal, but it really helps when you are still learning.-AI military difficulty settings. This is really something I have to applaud them for, as it is the ideal for how such a system should work. When you change the difficulty up a level, you are not giving the AI units a stat boost, instead you unlock more tactics for the AI to use. On easy, they do little besides charge your positions. However, on the harder difficulty levels, the AI can pull off challenging strategic manuevers.-And many more awesome things!Cons:-With the huge variety of units, there is a noticable amount that use ill-fitting models. For instance, the US marines will use AKs and Strykers use the LAV model.-Some military aspects are imperfect. Aircraft squadrons receive aircraft to replace lost ones, and since destroying an entire squadron in one go is difficult, you will occasionally run into situations where the enemy army is destroyed, but you cannot move up due to the concentration of enemy aircraft. This also occurs with artillery, but to a lesser degree and for a different reason.-The biggest gripe I have is the diplomacy system. My biggest problem with the system is that when a coup happens in a country you previously liked, your populace continues to like it. While you might want to attack it and reinstate the old government, you cannot without taking huge amounts of grief from your populace. The problem extends to when you liberate a country. You can rarely seek treaties with them because all of the civilians in both countries still hate the other.Ultimately, while the game has quite a few bugs, I am willing to forgive it. The (sometimes serious) problems are simply a side effect of having a detailed and complex game.It is flipping awesome, and if you like EU4 like games, then you will most likely love this.Edit:This game has been getting bad reviews due to a recent update, which practically broke diplomacy. Hopefully it will be fixed soon, because this is a great game.			"

												This game is so deep and complex that it took me over 200 hours to figure out some huge flaws with it. It is a good game, but for the most part I do not recommend it, and here is why.Lack of a real manual. The in game tutorial is badly done, and the manual they give you doesnt explain much. This game is complex and needs to come with at least a 100 page manual. Remember the manual in civ 3? 220 pages? I think the manual with this game is about 50 pages. And this game is more ""complex"". So you are flying in the dark. Your biggest friends will be forums and google, which don't really address the issues because well... Nobody knows. There is a lot of ""Lets try this and see what works"". This is the biggest problem with the game. Too much is an unknown. Even after 200 hours. Don't get me wrong. I now know how to play this game to a large degree. But am still unsure about a lot of other things. I have played very hard games with steep learning curves. The learning curve of this game is not the issue. I mean the game doesnt even have a tech tree. WTF! Their are 800 techs and there is no tech tree? Not even on google. It doesnt exist as of 11-12-2014. Their are some little player done tech trees but they dont address most of the techs before age 2020.I give it a 6/10. This game would be a 8/10 if there was a REAL manual. So infuriating. Oh yea, I got a response from someone from Battlegoat Studios about why there is no tech tree. His answer is that it would be hard to make..... So there is that....			"

												Great game with a great concept. Recommended for Paradox players, especialy for HOI players. I have always wanted a modern warfare grand strategy game. With just one single action, you can drastically alter the course of history. For example create a world where the Axis won WW2, the US invaded Cuba during the missile crisis or the USSR put the first man on the moon. However it would be nice if you could choose from more start dates. Currently you can't choose a start date between 1947 or 2020. In EU4 you can manually enter a date and start from there. Pros: You can play as almost any nation that has existed in the last 80 years Offers interesting scenarios, such as one where all the nations have broken up into smaller provinces and regions Really deep diplomacy system. Most games only have a ""offer alliance"" button, but in this game you have the option to negotiate about mutual defense, transition and line of sight  Cons: As you progress the game becomes slower and slower, because nations start to build more unites and your computers has to calculate the movements and actions of thousands of units.  Graphics are sacrificed for the sake of performance, because of the large number of units displayed on the map. Lots of micromanaging. Even though your cabinet members can fully automate everything, there are still a lots of things to watch.Overall this is an amazing game and one of the best strategy games I have ever played. I'am excited to see what content will be add by further updates.			"

												Review for current version 10/13/14. ver: 8.2.18. Battlegoat Studios featuring a realtime Geo-Political strategy game with pause / play action in single player. With the inclusion of all previous titles sandbox games, campains, and scenerios. This game does have it all, you can acess it all from Missle Defense Sattelites to Strategic Warfare ( NUKES :). Plan your strategy, choose your allys, pick your enemys, Revive forgotten / exiled nations, Liberate europe, Research techs started from the years 1900 to 2070, Become allied allligned or axis, create your role in your play. All and all they've done it right. Timeless game here, countless hours of playtime, although you should keep track so you dont lose track of time!3/19/2015most hated past technical issues.. fixed.-Loans fixed - you can take out and payback loans now as of december-Previously randomly losing money? -  could've been the income report bug that was fixed.-Weather system does have an effect on battles, troop movement speed, moral, efficiency.-Battle Goats decision going to rubber from water influence you to much, the turnaround is very good, as everyone in earth needs rubber to fight war.-The world war 2 campaigns are great..their  alot of historically accurate events.-Another isssue people had, you had to play with spheres ( axis / allied ) you can now turn that option off/on.-You can change up your map settings before starting your game to randomize the volatility of the map.-With my hours playing this game, 36' economy becomes an issue in the game but only while playing 36 campaign. Later down the road in the 45-49's if you dont build up oil derreks then the world goes dry of oil.Now speaking for cold war about the economy, that is soo balanced you can play it for a long time without running into issues, but you might have to build up some rubber as way down the road in 80s you notice rubber becoming needed..now the 2020, nothing needed in the world, market is suppressed with all goods, ready for some fighting..All and all the game has improved from alpha, and i've been through all its hurdles and issues, its come a long way to becoming the Ultimate Supremre Ruler. Since the start of the game, every 6 weeks the developers updated the game they're working on, balacing, and fine tuning their game, it's only going to get better from here.- Common major issues right now Multiplayer De-sync after 20-30 minutes of play.

												So im in a bit of a mixed mind about Ultimate.Supreme Ruler Ultimate basically takes all the previous games and rolls them into one, but flaws up in doing that.Playing Sandbox in 2020 doesnt feel like the old SR2020 game which it should, the old conflicts arent there and its quite boring overall with nothing going on until I spark off wars and even then its just me blowing up some poor bugger that I happened to want to destroy.However it does look better then the older games, it uses the SR1936 engine and graphics which makes it much prettier then the old games like Cold War and SR2020 and 2010. The interface is complicated at first but easy to get used to and the Campaign and Scenario modes offer a lot of cool ideas and ""story"".All in all its competent and I would reccommend it but it just leaves me wanting a more exciting Sandbox mode where everyones trying to tear everyone elses head off.I do voice a bit more on my Youtube channel on the game (as well as previous games in the series)https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB7oH0JlWiE7hAW_ugErlbQ "

												What can I say about supreme ruler ultimate.  It's such an awesome idea that combines some of the best mechanics from other games and crams it into a massive bundle of awesome customisable in depth detailed and destructive fun.  I have always like grand strategy within the modern eras of warfare.  Commanding soldiers has always been fun but with previous games I found them very restrictive.  Normally just giving you command of a squad or a putting you in one battle was just too restricting.  I want to command my nation send it off to wars I plan for.  Go against nations I want to fight and do it through the 30s to 2000s.  Well that game is this one. First off if your a fan of say total war but it now.  The map follows a very similar feel to total war with supply lines, economy maniging and building production.  There's even research that unlocks units although it's not a tree which would have been better to know what you should research when.  Unlike total war though the map is larger and it takes place within real time.  Politics in the game is fun when all nations hate you for building your empire.  Hell if you wanted you could play the game without any war but what fun is that.  Seeing hour defences on borders and battle lines is Aldo a lot of fun and there is a ton of opportunity for strategy.  Planning invasions is crucial, you need to know the land you plan to take and where best to fight, assault and land.  It's such an immersive game.But does it have its problems. Well yes.  For example the game can sometimes grind to a slow pace as you build up more troops for a new invasion or if you plan to go peacefully for a while it can get little dull. Even on fastest game speed (which I highly recommend you play on once you knows what your doing) the game can be a little slow I'll sometimes just let it play while I go off and make lunch waiting for my new marines to be ready.  Also some problems occur with amphibious units disembarking on island and getting stuck there forever which is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  Also there is quite a learning curve and the tutorial is not as detailed as it should be.However for all the bad the game shines on.  I highly recommend getting this game it is such a fun experience being the command on high over a nation building it up to be the next superpower.  Oh and before I forget.  All nations from 1936 are playable.  Enjoy			"

												I've been playing this series since Supreme Ruler 2020. Since that time I have had 5 aggravating problems with these games.1. The difficulty of moving infantry to other continents or islands.2. An inability to decide how to generally tweak the AI behavior.3. An inability to change the name of my country.4. Performance issues affecting the late game (like queueing military builds or the whole map slowing down when there are more than 2-3k total units in the map).5. Engagement behavior (usually resulting on England being at war with everyone but being untouchable by everyone but the player).Now after all the series releases and now all of the patches applied here's what they did with each one.1. Move the troops to a port and give them the sea transport command and they will turn into merchant marine ships and go where you want them to go. If the troops are amphibious, they will land wherever you want. Problem Fixed!2. One of the most recent patches allows you to choose AI behaviors such as ""Unpredictable"", ""Aggressive"", and ""Defensive"". Aggressive mode exactly what I always wanted. Problem Fixed3. You can do this now. Problem Fixed4. While this problem isn't fixed, it may be unrealistic to expect anything but a faster CPU to solve this. That being said, running a lean and mean military is usually the best way to go economically speaking.5. Engagement behavior is now improved enough that I generally trust the AI to run my military for me in most situations. It's also advanced enough that the AI countries fighting among themselves is interesting to watch. While the England issue is still somewhat the case, I do see that sometimes the right conditions are met for an aggressor to ""chase"" across the chunnel. I do think that AI sea invasions could be improved, but they work a considerable amount better than they used to. The only flaw I'm still seeing, is that in aggression a neighboring island is not considered a neighbor enough to trigger a war declaration. Problem mostly fixedAs for the game in general, the main selling feature of this title is its Dynamic Border/Supply System. Borders fluctuate in war based on who is providing the stronger supply to a specific hex in the game. Supply being fed by transportation routes and supply spouts (air fields, supply depots, industry, cities, ports). Troops may capture territory but it is lost if there is no supply to it. The troops themselves rely on supplies and will become immobile without it.It doesn't sound like much but this concept is what has attracted me to this series for years and its only real downside is that it sometimes results in border gore (whose only fix is to declare war on the country in the other side of the border gore).The Economic system is not simple, but also not particularly hard to get used to. Certain goods are for industrial demand, certain others are for domestic (some for both). The tax system and the societal spending system affect all of the economy in several different ways (this is the part of the economic system that can be difficult to grasp). Though the game, manual, and website try to explain how these factors affect things, some of the explanations are lacking. So some guess work is in order.The game has an Espionage system, though I honestly rarely use it. When I do use it, it is simple and straightforward. You give the spies a mission and priority and place them on the enemy hex you want them to do their stuff. They will either succeed or get captured.The military system is simple on the surface. You fill your production slots with whatever you want built, and it gets built when it's production run ends. However, there are a lot of specific details which are good to learn quickly. For example, which infantry are amphibious, what the fuel range is on a transport plane, and whether one tank type is likelier to survive anti-tank than another. The game can be forgiving in this respect. There's also a manpower mechanic in the way of ""reserve troops"" that puts both a foundation and a cap on the maximum war power you can field.There's also a weather system, but I never quite got what the deal is with that.Overall, I highly recommend this game to strategy/grand strategy fans with decently powerful CPUs (Sandy Bridge and later on Intel side and the new Ryzen chips on the AMD side).

												I really, really, really want to recommend this game. But I can't. It's such a shame. Supreme Rule 2020 is one of my all time favourite games. This version, even thought it is supposed to be superiour and updated, fells empty and abondoned. Updates and SLOW and commincation is bad. There are bugs that are still present from the 2020 version and issues that the players have been questioning for years but they still exists and get overlooked for some reason. It doesn't run so great either. A lot of slow down and very bad map scrolling.			"

												I have bought every one of the supreme ruler games since the original 2020. I have mentioned in a review for another SR game that I am unhappy with the way Battlegoat has handled new versions of the game (selling them as whole new games) because this game is basically just an updated version of SR 2020, SR CW, SR 1936, combined into one. That said, If you have played any of the older versions, then you will certainly find this one to be the better experience. Anyone new to the series would also want to pick this one up too as there is little point in buying any of the older games in the SR series.I have found this game to be a very good Geopolitical/Military (more focus on military) simulator. It does have a steep learning curve, but when you figure it out, it is an amazing game for its scope and scale. You can simulate yourself into the leadership position of any country in the world. You manage military, economics, research, and diplomacy. The version of the game has many new and very much needed features from prior versions added. Being able to delete all the pop ups from one catagory in a single click rather then tediously one by one, as well as being able to easily select which units you want from a stack by simply holding left ctrl and clicking. Renaming your county, units and even cities new or old is a nice touch as well.They Ai is seemingly much more intelligent in this version. They are actually reserving units they are not using and actively invading by sea, aggressivly and effectively this time.Politics is hit or miss. The Ai seems to be doing a much better job making wars and alliances regional and relevant, rather then across the globe and logistically infeasible. I have also seen them make a cease fire agreement. Which I cannot recall happing much if ever in prior games. Aliiances are still a odd ball in the series. The AI wants a ton of them for some reason, but they do not include mutual defense like you would think.The game does still have some issues, but it is a fun game either way. The worst issue I have noticed that hasnt been fixed yet is the merchant marines just willy nilly floating to their deaths. The Ai should recognize when its military is being sunk to the bottom of the ocean, but they dont seem to mind sending their entire army to its death. If planning invasions and military operations on land or sea or across oceans is your thing, as well as organizing and commanding the operations, then you will probably enjoy this game. It has ministers to help you out while you get started, but I find the true fun to be in doing it myself. I picked it up on sale cheap for less then 10 bucks. At that price it is a good deal. If you dont want to pay full price, keep an eye on it for a good sale downt he road.Have a question? Ask and I will try and help in the comments.			"

												Lets say it that way: its a nice game, but still with bugs, lots of inacurracy in how things should work, and at least questionable functionality of the AI. For example one of my main reasons for getting the game, was i could start all the way down in 1936.... But once u play the game, things like stupidly moving or even worse inactive units of allies are simply totally useless...eg. Ethiopia - Italy has tons of units but half of them not moving (and no they are not out of supplies) - so Italy is not getting anywhere down there for some years (I mean the history books show quite clearly with all Italian problems they had, it was a conquest of an uncivilized nation) - and Italy mainland would have all kinds of units for use but they r left motionless where they were deployedanother one: Japan - losing just a few months after they!!! declared war on China - they loose Manchuria and Korea - and same thing here again its like Japan has a underdevolped tiny army and the mighty and modern Chinese Army is finishing them off in ""days"".... (once more history books? or at least accurately balanced forces...) And of course japan mainland keeps heeps of units instead of maybe throwing some into battle... (once i gave them nearly half of the German army for free - and yet still they loose against China!!!)The diplomatic system is at least questionable, so even if u influence other goverments (or the opposition) not much is happening, and even some potential allies dont change to ur side... no matter what ever presents u throw at them...So all in all nice concept - bad implementation at least AI-wise....  Until they fix things - Go for Hearts of Iron 2 or 3, complexity is similar, much better AI and even though they keep the historical line quite good, u still can change things quite beliveable (when walking down different paths of history).

												This game has some obvious problems. It has been in full release for some time, but there are some campaign mechanics and events missing like the civil war in China which leads to Japan's rapid defeat before the second world war proper begins. That said, the devs are very responsive to these issues and release regular updates.So why is this a yes rather than no? Unfortunatley very few grand strategy games of this scope and nature are made. Other than Paradox (who published previous Supreme Rulers), Battle Goat are the only company active in this genre other than even smaller companies making smaller and more focused titles. In terms of mechanics, the military units are well researched and there are many hundreds of designs to develop. Research stetches from the 1930s and past hypothetical future technoligies. Politics and diplomacy have been fleshed out with the ability to diplomatically annex colonies as well as liberating dead regions (unfortunately you can't liberate them as a colony). A faction system has also been introduced to model the Axis and Allies as well as NATO and Warsaw Pact. Economics is largely the same as previous titles, except water has been replaced with rubber with adds another strategic consideration which will become apparent during large scale warfare. One final warning is that you need a decent rig to run it. I only have one computer to test it on but I believe you need a decent amount of RAM and pretty powerful CPU to handle the thousands of simultaneous calculations done by the AI. The devs have improved game speed since the last games but with my i7 2.7Ghz quad core (admittedly six odd years old now) the game slows down noticably after a decade. Still playable but requires patience. If your CPU is any less powerful I would do more research before buying.			"

Anyone who is a fan of strategy/simulation type of games should enjoy this.Also the connection between the devs and the community is unmatched (if you dont believe me, check the forums)! The majority of threads created in the forums have an official developer response within 12-24 hours.Thank you BattleGoat Studios for this game, it is much appreciated!!!			"

												Played 3 games with 3 different counties and the results are the same.  Germany crushing Europe and Russia without any resistance.  Diplomacy is rediculas.  As the USA I was trying to ally with the allies from the start.  Even the UK wouldn't sign a non-agression pact with me in 1940.  Really why on earth wouldn't the UK or France want a mutual defence treaty with the US in 1938?  This game engine has some interesting elements such as the economy but like 2020 it is limited; for example moving troops around and organising an army is painful.  The AI doesn't act in a logical way in terms of self interest and building alliances.  All in all, like the previous Supreme Ruler games, it is a good attempt but ultimately a frustrating game due to poor control/organisation mechanisms and terrible diplomacy.If you want a WW2/Cold War game Hearts of Iron is far better.

								I am a long time fan of the series and am very excited for this game. It combines the best of the previous releases, however it is not currently in a playable state just yet. I strongly recommend buying this game now to support this fantasic indie company, but hold off a bit to really enjoy the experience. Other long time players of the series can jump right in and find the game is everything you hoped it would be, other then a few noticable glitches and a general annoying slowness, the game appears to be in pretty decent shape. A few patches from now and some perofrmance improvments and we will be loving every second of game play! For those new to the series, go grab SR1936 to get just a taste of whats to come. :)*Updated Oct 1 2014* - After a couple more updates the game seems to be completely playable, not perfect, some decent updates and improvments are obviously still needed, but no reason you can't jump in and start playing this now.

												This is one of my favorite game series of all time. Unfortunately they keep recycling the same thing over and over again. I wouldn't be upset if they actually made performance impovments, but they simply don't. With a high end computer the game comes to a screetching hault after 10 to 15 years of game play.What they need to fix:- Move away from 32bit, and make this game 64bit. This game needs the extra ram and 4gb does't suit it.- Allow annexing specific hexes.- Problems that were in SCRW, two games ago, are still here. If you take over lets say czechoslovakia, it doesnt give you the option to colonize it. It simply just annexs it. You had two seperate games to fix this.- How about use more than one core for this game. I have an i7, and it should be shredding this game. But it simply doesn't.			"

												This should've been the best strategy game ever, but the execution is so terrible that it fails at even being mediocre.The idea of this game is excellent, the depth to which different units and technologies are modelled is great. The complexity of the economy is great. The map and how it models even small towns all over the world is great. If all you did was look at screenshots and poke around various menues and the map, you would be ecstatic.Unfortunately the actual gameplay falls on its face. Behind the complexity hides an economy that is completely irrational and spins out of control for all countries - AI and human - within years of game start. The complex economy formulas are so horribly unbalanced, that you can switch off all production in the country, cut all social spending, and still end up with a ""not enough workers"" problem, bringing inflation, and prices for everything you can build skyrocketing as a result.Behind the wealth of units is completely and utterly incompetent AI - both friendly and enemy; ships run out of fuel and get stuck in the middle of the ocean, planes fly out of range and crash, land units of all sorts behave like a plague of locust, brainlessly advancing at top speed with no regard for tactics or strategy, positioning or defensive terrain. You can micromanage your own units to not do that, but the AI never will, resulting in wars that feel idiotic and unsatisfying.Behind a reasonable diplomacy screen is an absurd diplo system where you have to pay 10 years worth of your country's GDP to EACH of the NATO countries if you want to be friends with them, where an alliance does not mean an actual alliance, where the rest of NATO stands by while USSR does an amphybious invasion of France for some odd reason, and where West Germany and France go to war with each other at the height of the Cold War.And if you are thinking of treating this deep and detailed world as a sandbox and using cheats and mod tools to work around the inherent absurdity of the game, you are out of luck. The cheats are few and limited, notably absent is the ability to force an AI to agree to a diplomatic offer. The modding support is somewhat reasonable, but requires a confusing and time-consuming cache regeneration process that looks like it hangs your game for a good five or ten minutes and finishes without any indication as to success or failure, following which you have to manually move and rename certain files and restart the game. It's very easy to mess up and will take some time to get the hang of.Overall, as much as I'd love a game of this type and depth, I cannot recommend this one.			"

												Ultimate has some good things going for it.  Better optimization of speed for one, and it allows you to play on past WW2.  Despite some nice features, particularly the economy, the game falls flat on its face with game play issues and some terrible design flaws:- China is extremely overpowered in 1936 and easily steamrolls Japan!  This is because China is united, not broken up into smaller controlling factions.  HOI3 did a good job, SRUltimate is a fail.- Incompetent economic AI.  Warfare is fought by consuming military goods yet the AI builds almost no military goods. - Russia is an economic mess and quickly folds.- The German navy often wipes out the UK navy- The military AI doesn't garrison Hongkong, India, or most of its Colonies.- The French AI does not garrison the Magnot Line of fortifications.  The Germans just walk in.The developers have done nothing to address these issues.  Until they do, it is a waste of money.			"

												A good game ruined by the Combat system.   Combat is nothing more than drag a box around a bunch of units and send them somewhere to attack.   Every video on youtube is exactly this, there is no army hierachy, there is no strategic combat.   It ruines what could otherwise be a good game.   BG continues to try to milk the cow using the same formula over and over slapping a different name and new price on each release.  It's a shame because this could attract so many more players if they would revamp the combat. If you don't care about combat the rest of the game is good, unfortunately combat is such a large part of the game it ruins everything else the game does well :(  Can't recommend - keep hoping BattleGoat studios will do something new as well as revamp this horrible combat system.   Go to unit cards with icons or nato symbols like HOI3, allowing for formation of elements, clean up the battles so you can actualy plan a coordinated attack and see what's going on and more importantly have some control over it.

												Supreme Ruler Ultimate can be incredibly frustrating at times and I really hope for improvement in future titles.  That being said, as far as a geopolitical simulator can go, the Supreme Ruler games give you more freedom to control your country, with a smaller focus on politics than other games, but a stronger focus on military and economic aspects.  Being able to play any country and turn it into a superpower within decades is rewarding and fun, so I recommend this game to anyone who is strongly interested in this subject area and is willing to sink hours into not only playing this game, but also learning it, which can be just as challenging, though that is not necessarily a bad thing.

												Very complex for players who want a real challenge in real time strategy games, especially in economics, production, and resource management. Its game mechanics are somewhat fixed. There are a few problems however. Atleast the game speed does not lag whenever 3 years pass. The AI need some fixing when it comes to combat. For example, South Korea will take over North Korea easily, and then invade China. China will have hundreds of units lying around in forts and cities while Manchuria is completely overrun by probably 30-40 inferior South Korean military units.However, complaints of people saying the AI are not historically accurate are irrelevant. A main component for this game, and something I personally enjoy, is its alternate history options that YOU can control. When you can turn Haiti, a now poor nation with 80% of its population under the poverty line, into a massive superpower that owns Florida, all of Central America, the Carribean, Northern South America, and parts of Europe, you know this game can be fun. This game has unlimited opportunities. These opportunities can range from you being literally any nation in a time period's existence and doing whatever you want with it, wheither it be an expansionist, fascist Uganda, economic superpower of North Korea, or the USSR Part two, this game can provide for that. Do not expect this game to be a pulse pounding, call of duty action game, because it isn't. This is a hyper-realistic game on steroids. All factors need to be taken into account for in your economy. Please remember that BattleGoats Studios is still working on this game to make it better for the players. This may have some annoying bugs, but they are expected to be fixed throughout the patches in the game.7/10 in my opinion.			"

												I've only played a little over 3 hours and I love it already! It was a bit frustrating in the start because you had to learn all the controls. But after that it's a amazing! It's so much fun taking over territories in the name of whatever country you are. Really the only bad thing I can say about this game (as of yet) is that the combat is a bit boring. Seeing 2 or more units fighting with no animations or anything just explosions to show that they are hitting each other (and a big explosion to show that a unit has died). But if you are like me and have fetish for taking over territories you should definitely buy this game!EDIT:So I've found some cons after playing this game a lot. - The amount of crashes is quite  high. I was in a game and I forgot to save, and then it just crashed. I can't explain how frustrated I was after that!- Your units doesn't prioritize your orders first. In the game you can let the AI command your forces when at war, and while this is very nice most of the time, I want to be the one in command without taking it off. Like if I order unit X to go somewhere it shouldn't stop even if the AI thinks it's a bad idea. I want to be in charge of my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minions. OBEY MEH!- Amphibious assaults is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to do. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. And most of the time it's only effective on weaker countries. And the A.I almost never figures out how to do them. I've only seen once that Germany was able to invade Great Britain. But if America declares war on a European country, it doesn't matter. While they are technically at war, they don't invade. They just destroy your ships here and there. - This is not very big or important, but still annoying. you can't delete save files in-game. You have to manually remove them from your folder. I think it's kinda BS. - A lot of nations are either way too weak or way too strong. I did a WWII 2 USSR game where I let Germany take most of Europe and then wait until they attacked me. I was stronger in numbers, technology and defenses. Still they beat me. I had to put everything on very easy and yank military spending to the max to beat them. Germany should not be this strong, it's not fun to fight against, and it's not fun to play as. Also, I had won a war with Japan so I already had their resources as well. - The economy is kinda of broken. I never really understood it. There are 2 major resources that you will not matter what, will be scarce later in the game, when you have annexed a lot of countries (assuming you are like everyone else and just want to make one big♥♥♥♥♥country). And that is Industrial goods and Oil. Not matter how many facilities you build you will always be behind.- I don't think there's any grand strategy game that has this, but as most others, this doesn't have the Swastika for Germany in the 1936 scenario.This annoys me very much, but nothing can be done about it. Overall I still recommend the game, just be prepared for these things.			"

SummaryThis game has a lot of potential but unfortunately I must count it as broken. AI is laughable, especially when it comes to naval warfare and diplomacy. There are MANY bugs, which won't cause CTD but will break your game if you want it to make any logical sense. Economy doesn't really resemble real one and GDP will rise and fall very unrealistically. I will say it clearly and in capital letters - DON'T BUY. Buy Hearts of Iron instead. 1936 Scenario1936 sandbox and campaign are particularly broken and quite frankly unplayable. There is no Spanish Civil War, technologies are not great by any standards, Japan will declare war against USSR no matter what, and get squashed like a bug, China is way OP - it smashes Japan in months, naval warfare is really bad (AI has no idea what to do) and generally it is really bad when compared to Hearts of Iron games or ones by Matrix Games. War in Ethiopia is a nice touch. AI will immediately move most of its forces to mainland Italy and attack Ethiopians with several thousand men only to be predictably slaughtered. Ethiopia was still alive and well throughout the entire war. Diplomacy is great and both Bulgaria and Finland, German allies during the war, are hostile towards you since the beginning. Why? Your guesses are as good as mine.Maginot line is really easy to pass through so there is no need to go through Belgium. I really love pathfinding in this one. Panama army ends up in Austria, Ethopian in Denmark, French and Turkish in Poland, and more. Good job.Cold WarCold War sandbox is much better, but even then, barely good. AI is rather poor, there are many historical units missing, and again, a lot of bugs. Pathfinding is terrible too. Thousands of French and British ships carrying troops going to Vietnam will try to move through Leningrad and Ladoga Lake and get slaughtered. Problem will end if you will win the Vietnam War and they won't need to transport them anymore.Alignment mechanics are broken too. Switzerland will immediately become Warsaw Pact aligned despite being allied with me, and generally alliances seemingly don't count when the game calculates alignment, only diplomatic deals related to trade do so the only way to sway it during the Cold War is to give them money and very favorable deals. Modern ScenariosPerhaps the least broken, but all of the above applies. Economy is still broken, AI is laughable, and setting is blah when compared to previously mentioned ones.			"

												Want to take over the world in WWI? How about (not to far away) futuristic 2020? and then anything in between! I got this game at first for nostalgia because i played SP2020G (Supreme Ruler 2020 Gold) when i was younger and though it'd be fun to go try to relive that. Now this game is so much more. With a full fledged campaign, sandbox mode, and objective play, this game has all you'd ever want from a world takeover game, want to be the US and destroy England? Go for it, how about have Germany win WWII? you can do that. The fate of the world rests in your hands, the rest is for you to decide.        89/100			"

								Hi, in future updates many people (myself included) would love the Blitzkrieg scenario added back but just with a little more options. I was really upset when i saw the limit of countries to play as on the scenario. it really limits players to only 5 playable factions. i would love to see more playable factions that would fit perfectly into tht scenario. (Turkey, Netherlands, Isreal, Iran, Russia, and Greece. So far i LOVE the game!!!! it is still a work in progress a many people know, but as i read the new features it said something about realistic and historical armies. i expect real units not fake units like the Kentaurus 99.mm . and more units for certain countries, (Greece, Turkey, Germany, and Italy. Thank you!!			"

												I could go on and on about how much fun this game is for the right kind of people but, there are lots of those. Instead, I have to say that the BattleGoat team is the best and most communicative development team I have ever seen. Take 1 trip to their forums and you will see that these guys frequently interact with their player base. Not just that, but they also take advice and genuinely care about what the players feel.Frequently, if I havea question or complaint about a missing feature - one of the developers will respond quickly and tell me ""we will look into that."" Within a month, the feature is there! Buy this game. It is amazing but even more amazing are the men who create it.			"

												This game goes very in depth. Any nation that you could think about playing as is, for the most part, playable. You could play as the U.S., Russia, India, France, Germany. However, I say ♥♥♥♥ that. It's all about Bhutan. Bhutan may be nothing today, or tomorrow, or the next day. But eventually, and by this I mean centuries, Bhutan will be glorious. Soon™ Bhutan will lead the invasion force into Tibet. Take all the oil, coal, and people. Push into China and reach the ocean. And through this endeavor, will begin an army that is like no other. Soon™ the U.S. will see the true power of Bhutan. All will bow down to the Great Nation of Bhutan!TL;DR: ♥♥♥♥ the U.S. - Bhutan is great.			"

												This is the ultimate game for Grand Strategy game lovers. A lot of micromanagment, a lot of indicators and things to consider, but still game-like enough to let you follow your dreams. There are a lot of people that critisize the AI. Some people like to be constantly frustrated and have a sadist opponent that whips them continously. I dont. The game is difficult enough as it is because it has a long learning curve. It introduces you to indicators like inflation or taxation to the pensioners and you have to learn to connect the dots. You can get any nation you want, at any period you want and try to make something out of it. Would you do the same choices as France in WW2? Is it possible to do anything else?The only thing i dont like about this title is that although you can mode a lot of things, you cannot do population distribution corrections across the map or assign different royalties (or multiple) in hexes. Or at least have an in game way to affect royalty. Which renders conquest a bit useless, unless you want certain resources. Other than that it is a pretty fascinating game which will guarantee you hundreds of hours of entertainment.			"

												Absolutly love this game, one of my favorite grand strategy, its deffinetly got a learning curve. The posibilities are endless you can play from multiple campaigns at different time periods, or play sandbox start from differet scenarios like WW2, Cold War and modern/ near future. If your a history buff you'll deffinetly love this game, even the sanbox mode is historicaly accurate untill the point you decide to break from the time line and make history yourself. Do not be mistaken the game is not simply military conquest, you can try this but unless you're a world power its gona be tough. This game has a great sphere of influence system, that can be manipulated from diplomacy, economic activity and military actions. One point that I with I knew before starting to play this game is that a good army is a supplied army, do not take supplies for granted always make sure every military operation is well supplied, if not you will see your modern millitary that you spent millions on shred like paper. Also some good tips is don't over build resource production, you will run your economy into the ground and create labor shortages. Take your time and be patient.			"

												Not for the casual, this is one of, if not the most detailed geopolitical simulator on the market. The level of detail given can be intimidating, but overall commands to your cabinet take alot of the deep and complex sliders and controls out of your hand unless you wish to do those yourself.Gameplay: for the most part you will be staring at a map for long periods of time, occassionally broken up by the slider or statsheet and trade negotiation. This is not a pretty game by any aspect of the word, but the level of detail and day by day operations make your building of an empire all the more personal. because it is a geopolitical game, you will encounter historical figures leading nations, and having to decide if allying with them would be best for your politica gains. Is Hitler the guy you want to be buddy buddy with, or Stalin, or maybe the U.S., China even. The choices are overwhelming,  but offers large replayabilityReplayability: high, you can play as any and all nations. Jamaica? yep. Lithuania? sure. tajiristan? you betcha. USA? newb.			"

												You want to be the best and coolest dictator ever, so:- Raise investment for social care, health, education, infrastructure and police. You want people happy, healthy, educated and able to travel in good conditions.- You build plenty of industries, no product shortage here!- Down with taxes! everyone hates taxes.- Let's keep our military very minimal, neighbours are chill.Money starts to run low.- Let's raise taxes a bit...- Ok, now actually this social care is costing waaay too much, there is no unemployment so people shouldn't need so much help. Keeping education and health highest to give everyone a chance.- So, highly educated people with no unemployed to even be a threat, the wages actually go to the roofs... gotta increase domestic prices and taxes.- Still costly, gotta decrease general spending a bit so I don't break the damn country.- Exporting is helping so much the budget, I gotta increase domestic prices more to decrease a bit consumption. Sorry guys!- Well, I actually need some unemployed or this is gonna run out of control, gonna burn some factories down, sorry everyone.- People are kinda hating me now.Damn being a good dictator is harder than I thought.

												Simplfying this review! I would give it a 7.5/10. I would recommmend buying it.Pretty fun game! I usually spend a week or 2 at a time on this game and stop and then start playing it again. It has multiplayer which gives you a challenge during any time period (WW2, COLD WAR, ETC.) Overall it is a fun game and truly lets you control your country on how you want. Want to declare war on cuba as USA, go ahead! Want to take over mexico as USA, GO AHEAD! Want to nuke the bahamas because you want a testing ground for your nukes, GO AHHHHHHEEEEADDDDD!You have the capability to build your army and your economy. It has a really cool infrastructure and resource gathering system. It is a very up to date game and follows a good timeline when it comes to resources. For instance, you dont see a huge amount of oil in the middle east during ww2 while during modern day 2020 you see tons of oil. This game also has a good trading (importing and exporting) system which can really make a difference on how your economy grows.Army and millitary research and building are very accurate when it comes the time line of ww2 to modern day. British have challengers, US have abrams, and russians still have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tanks! :) (No Hate)I like the research system of this game because it lets you trade technology which can also be a huge factor to helping jumpstart or even saving your economy. Millitary has a huge influence on war justification on other countries and a huge influence on your world % on millitary approval, domestic approval, etc.Overall this game is a very fun game and is updated somewhat frequently. It can be confusing at first but if you are not willing to actually sit down and learn how to play the game, go find a simple game that does not require thinking. I love and hate this game at times but overall I would give it a 7.5/10. I would recommmend buying it.			"

												I like the game.  Though I cannot recommend it to friends.  I am a Supreme Ruler junky.  I have clocked hundreds of hours on the old 2020 DvD rom copy, and I have bought the game from multiple online vendors and even hard copies.  None of my friends have ever taken a liking to this title, but I am a strategy junky, and I love geo-politic sims.  Though, this game is more world domination, as politics doesn't really get you anywhere unless you want to tech trade.  I bought Coldwar and 1936, and bought ultimate because I really wanted to see the battle goats shine by optimizing this game and allowing me to play in all eras of SR in one neat package.So in a nutshell, it's a real time strategy game that has moveable units like command & conquer, but nation and diplomatic elements like...well, watered down Civ.  It's base on real earth and real nations, and you can pick any nation you want, from any supported era of your choice, WW2, Coldwar, future.  You can build unit construction buildings, and resource collection buildings on resource tiles.  Create battle groups, and give orders via very clunky and unintuitive UI.  There is a resource economy, and money is time.  Your debt, or ability to acrue debt, inflation, or even positive treasury effects how fast you can build things and muster units.  Moving large amounts of units is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and planning invasions is a chore.  It's easier to just take a beach head and turn on AI manager and let him zerg the enemy for you.  Though I still enjoy the game from time to time, because it is a neat world domination game and not a lot of games like it.  It is very niche.So why can't I recommend it?  Well, it runs slow for one.  The AI isn't very good, and once you learn how to play, you can pick just about any country and take over the world, in time.  The economy is confusing for new comers, though is so simple once you get it down.  In fact, once you learn it, it is essentially cookie cutter, but dependent on what resources are available to you.  Basically, if you are a good player, conquering the earth is just a time factor depending on the nation you are starting as.  If you suck at the game, you will get ganged up on by unforgiving AI.Biggest gripe on the whole series is the game slowing down because of AI bloat.  The game is still unfinished in that regard. How is the game unfinished?  Well, 2020 came out in 2008, and I bought the original CD-ROM from in the base exchange.  I had a new computer for 2008 standards, and after a while, the game would slow down because the AI keeps building units and the game slows down to a crawl.  Flash forward to 2011, SR Coldwar, I bought that in digital copy from stardock or something.  Same thing, AI unit spam, slow game.  Then SR 1936 came out on Steam...same thing...  Before 1936 was even officially declared ""finished"", Ultimate was put up in the steam store.  Because I am an SR junky, I bought it.  SAME THING, slows down...  To this day, SR Ultimate, regardless of game era, will slow to a crawl after a couple of decades.  Again, I have a brand new PC 64GB RAM DDR4 Intel core I7 nVidia GTX970 and SSD.  Slow game.  Almost 10 years have gone by and the devs cannot prevent AI bloat.  The engine is largely unchanged between each version, so I have a feeling that the programmer wrote the core game in 2007 and gave everyone the finger after that.  There are also problems with the tech tree.  Ultimate never fixed the path from Future -> Coldwar -> WW2.  They did however, add all techs and designs into the entirety of SR, so if you start in WW2, you can go properly all the way up to future.  However, if you start in the future, you have to spend years researching WW2 stuff because the devs forgot to include old techs and era techs from WW2 and CW in the future era version....this means even if you are Japan or Germany with maglev trains, GPS satellites, and internet, you have to research bi-planes and refrigerators to unlock some cold war era infrastructure techs to get the new 1990's era techs.  You have to download mods to fix the base game because it was never completed.If you are a diplo-game / world domination junky feeling risky, then try this game out.  Otherwise, you will probably hate it.			"

Theres nothing better to me in this game then starting of as a terrible countrey that today is still a third world country and bring it up and make it grow into such a power that its competing in the space race not with U.S.A or the USSR but by its self and its winning. That to me is enough to make me want to play this game over and over agin because you can change a whole history of events like what if Germany and there allies actually won world war 2, or what if the cubin missle crysis went hot would anyone survive. This game provides so many diffrent options that i find it hard not to like. So if you want a good Country simulator that your choices good or bad can change how the world is later then i would suggest this game.			"

												Really really good game takes a while to get the hang of everything. Would advise to start a few games just messing about figuring out all the little options in game you dont know about from Transporting units via Plane, Ship or Crossing rivers with mobile Bridge/Pontoon Units, using landing ships to land troops and vehicles where there is no Sea Pier/Port or using Planes to parachute units in to locations with no Airfield/Airport. It gets very interesting when u find out all the small things like giving Units certain missiles and not just having them autodeployed all the small options you did not know to learning how much weight a Plane/Ship can carry and checking a units weight to see if and how many can be transported.There is so many small options there you do not now about till u read about it in the Warfare guide and other places. Game is slow to start as all games are but once you get going and learning all the different options it gets to the piont were u are actually planning an Invasion on a country is a complex task as something as simple as not checking there Allies, Capture a Sea port/pier can cause a hole different out come as I have many a times invaded a country and did not capture  or see a Port/Pier and be winning the battle next min I know that countrys allies start poring units into the Port/Pier I did not see or capture and my forces get out numbered and I need to fall back and seat down at the table hoping I can get a Cease Fire in place and rethink the invasion plan again. You can start creating armys and building battle groups from a starting army of 1000+ units One units does not mean just one unit that one unit could have 50-500 troops in it Warfare Guide will explain it better. So 1000 units is alot would be well over 1 Million men in that army but ive had up to 4300+ game. 150-200 units in each battle group is normally more than enough but you need to keep troops in reserve and keep troops deployed around different parts of ur country so the Enemy does not invade a Port and start moving inland capturing Land, Citys/Towns, Ports/Piers, Factorys/Fortifications. There is alot to take into account but not so much u have to micromanaging everything u have Defence/Finance Minister etc.. to help out with alot of tasks giving them the power to sort out stuff as u do the important things. When you attack, attack from different postions with at least 6 or more battle groups break down the 150-200 unit BGs into three smaller BGs all having different places to capture from Airfields to stop enemy planes attacking you or calling in ur own units via Air-Transport planes taking over Sea Ports/Piers to stop allies of the country from reinforceing them beware of allies naval vessels blockade of sea ports/piers or u will not be able to stop them reinforcing. I could go on for days and talk about the invasions I Succended/Failed hahaha			"

It did initially feel a bit of a cheeky move releasing it so soon after 1936 (and to be honest before 1936 had been properly finished) but I appreciated the discounted price as compensation. To be fair I never really got into 1936 as I prefered the future setting of 2020. This version lets you play the 1936, cold war and 2020 games with the added benefit that the tech tree in a 1936 start will go all the way through to the end of the 2020 tech tree. To be honest in a normal game stretching the gameplay out that far would be pretty difficult, I have never managed it.As it is my faveourite game mode the review is mainly based on a 2020 starting date. I found the 1936 game pretty tough due to supply shortages which I know are realistic but still it makes for a tough game for a lot of countries. I do on the whole enjoy this version however I find that at this stage of its development I honestly prefer how a game played out in the original 2020 version. My major complaint with this version so far is that the computer is far too free with alliances. After a couple of years the world becomes such a tangled mess of alliances that wars do not seem to break out that much between AI countries.  Unless you play as say China or Russia you will probably find most countries are friendly to you and probably have pretty similar allies making conquest a bit of a headache. It makes rampant warmongoring with the UK for example a lot more difficult than in the original 2020. As a lesser note some of the AI combat provides odd outcomes, in one go I played through South Korea conquered the whole of China and Pakistan conquered India. After that there were hardly any hostile enemies for me to target. You can fiddle around with the game settings to provide a different gameplay experience, at the moment I prefer Shattered World with very high volitility (no units can help to prevent some counter intuitive outcomes from wars) as a sanbox go.On the plus side there has been a lot of incremental improvements to the game with a lot of issues I had on release being ironed out through patches so I am hopeful the game is only going to get better going forward.  Undoutedly the graphics are better and the tech tree has been improved so it is not simply just a nicer looking version of 2020.I do recommend giving the game a try, particularly if you do not have all of the versions included in Ultimate but I can't help thinking that in its current state I did used to have a lot more fun playing the original 2020.

												I don't know why people write negative reviews under 'i recommend' label. The game is neither great nor involving. The UI is ugly, economy is simple despite lots of resources and production - the world always has money to buy and is willingly buying. All in all the game is too simple where it would rather be more complex and too complex where it should have been simple - you just build facilities for what has good added value and be careful not to build too much and at the same time you'll ♥♥♥♥ up trying to move your armies. You might have 100s of unit types or you might have one type - it really doesn't matter.Also I annexed the USSR by capturing Moscow. Maybe scenarios are more interesting than campaigns, but now I'm not really interested in that. Glad not to have wasted too much money on this.			"

												I'm going to begin this review by saying what a lot of people are saying, if you are getting this for multiplayer don't buy it. Sometimes it can work well and be fun, but it will take you hours to get a game going...However, this game is like no other game out there. There are hundreds if not thousands of different unit designs to choose from, from 1936 - 2020 and beyond. Its a great war simulator if you choose to use it that way, you can drag and click with mobs of troops or you can play tactically. The AI in SRU is better than in the rest of the Supreme Ruler series, but it still leaves some to be desired. While the AI can be challenging to the player, generally unless they are a huge country with hundreds or thousands of units to send at you, you don't have much to worry about. The naval invasions are easily stopped by placing ships at your port because they don't send naval escorts. There isn't much of a naval AI, but I believe I have seen improvments in this.The economy is fairly detailed, the world market reacts to how much resources there are in the world and the demand. So they generally represent the world economy, but i'm not sure what else to really say about it. The world doesn't really seem to interact with the player in any real way, I often find myself just siting there not knowing really what to do but let time go by and then end up just going to war for the heck of it. If you are new to the game I recommend large countries to start but to really feel like you're in the game and to be actually doing something I recommend smaller countries as they actually need more attention.Overall the game is great and I recommend it, I have had a lot of fun playing multiplayer (And a lot of stress and wasted time) and I have a lot of time in Singleplayer. If you are looking for a good political simnulator, look somewhere else, if you're looking for decent economics and great warfare than you found the right game.			"

												My favorite aspect is the economy.  Lots of people toss this game because they act like Democrats.  They spend tons of money on infrastructure.  They don't have industry goods to produce any of the facilities.  Therefore they import them driving the world market price through the roof.  They go broke.  Taxes eventually reach 99% as you run a full on socialist state.  Inflation goes through the roof as your government spends and borrows wildly at the whims of the rulers.  And because you.... the user.... has total control (ie big government) your complete mismanagement wrecks the entire nation for a generation.  Instead..... focus the economy on GDP.  It's everything IMO.  Higher GDP equals more tax revenue.  You want the people to be prosperous.  I've tried many economic models and found most to be somewhat realistic.  I've use the common flat tax.  It's fairly effective.  The ""fair tax"" ie sales tax is an excellent model.  The citizens only pay taxes on goods consumed.  In a perfect world you produce most of what you consume..... and consume a lot.  Domestic profits are much higher than exports.  If you keep a healthy balance of supply and demand with a national sales tax of roughly 30%..... you're good.  GDP will go up.  You'll gain tax revenue everytime goods are sold to the populace.  And you get general revenue from the sale.  In the real world..... this is essentially a free market with a national sales tax (as the only source of income.)  People scoff at the idea because they think THEY would end up paying everything at the counter while the rich walk away unscathed.  Anyone with a brain knows that's what happens anyway.  Raise taxes on corporations and they simply raise prices to match.  A healthy business will always maintain a steady profit line.  Taxes are nothing more than a business expese.  Either way it goes taxes are always paid by the little guy.  Even now..... your employer is responsible for a large portion of your taxes.  People think....  ""Great... the company pays that.""  Except for the reality that it's simply a business expense considered under ""labor.""  Which means you.  Therefore you are more expensive to the company and get paid less.  Therefore you actually pay ALL taxes.  Because if they did not exist.... then a healthy competitive market would drive wages up to the current line anyway.  It doesn't matter who gets the money from the companies perspective.  Either the government.... or you.... cost X amount of dollars for one employee per year.  Anyway if you choose to run a socialist economic model.... your goal is to export.  You want to drive GDP down.  In lamens terms.... you want the people poor.  Poor people work for nothing.  The end result of all socialist nations is poverty.  Poverty keeps you in business.  Look at China.  When their people become to prosperous they print a ton of money and devalue their currency by half...... essentially making the people 50% poorer.  The easiest way to make everyone poor.... is to jack taxes through the roof.  You can simultaneously raise services to maintain public order.  But the people will still be poor.  The lower their GDP.... the cheaper you can produce goods (ie China).... the less people of your own country can afford goods like electricity and water..... and you'll have a ton of cheap goods available on the market.  If they pile up.... simply do bulk sales with a minimal profit.  Technologies can also reduce the cost of production.  But GDP is a huge factor and you can crash it quickly.  As a socialist nation you will make tons of money off consumer goods.  They are always in demand.  They fetch a nice profit.  And the poorer your people are.... the richer you get.  ....  Gee.... isn't socialism great.  Overall don't be afraid to raise and lower taxes.  The economy should be flexible.  Don't build it around one strategy.  Grow it in all directions.  Don't be afraid to shut factories down if you can import goods cheaper than you can make them.  Why pay your own people more money when another country can produce it cheaper?  Unemployment isn't that difficult to control.  (Higher unemployement also means less competition for workers.... which means lower wages... whicih means you can produce goods cheaper and drop GDP.)  You want a healthy balance of everything.  I typically start the game by building a few industrial goods complexes.  I want enough to sustain a war.  Then I identify the particular countries trade imbalance.  Try to produce goods rather than import them (unless producing them is more expensive.)  And eventually create a small surplus of various commodities for export.  I try to run about a 20% overall tax rate usually focussing on the sales tax.  You want the people rich and prosperous.  Make sure you maintain a healthy budget surplus.  And you'll be fine.  The game is not about massively overhauling countries.  It's about managing them over time with minor tweaks.			"

												BEFORE ANYTHING I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR MY BAD ENGLISH AND GRAMMAR MISTAKES!I like this game. Its fun to play! But would i recommend it? No, not yet! After fixing some bugsThis game feels like its still in its deveploement state. AI is pretty broken. When youre allied with someone i suddenly see how the casus belli is rising alot. No matter how neutral i stay tensions rise and i get attacked. If we look at the WW2 scenarios in late 1936 Germany attacks everyone.And the AI only annexes them, not making them puppets! If we look at 1940 & 41 you can see how the European borders are redrawn not anschlussed by the Germans! I once had incident where i suddenly conquered myself??? (theres a screenshot of it how i colonized myself) I dont see vichy France, Croatia, Bohemia, etc etc. It bothers me alot. Hell! I dont even see the U.S. entering the war even tho it has declared war on Axis! Not even supporting the British & French, same with Canada. No troops, no support, no trade. Lets talk about diplomacy & economicsThe game doesent give you much challenge in economy, you can be the most financial with everything you need! Meanwhile the AI focuses on building its army and not even peeking at the economy so you really cant have a competition. In some scenarios theres no Consumer goods (and some other random shortages of resources) production. It stays at 0 even i have everything i need it to be at least 1,000! I build a hell loada consumer good facilities and the production is still at 0!! Same is usually with industrial goods and even oil. Hell not even USA have more than 4,000 consumer goods and they wont trade any of it! Speaking about trade & relations whats with the damn high tension risings??? They go all sky high even tho ive barely done anything not even put my mouse on military tab, just focusing on my economy and doing what i have to do and suddenly (for example) Germany is ready to attack me with full force. Asking for peace with a waring nation is impossible too. You have to wait for them to ask for peace. Now if i really want to have peace with Germany i would have to send them TRILLION TONS OF MONEY so the relations go up and they finally accept the peace treaty. That makes no sense! Asking for ceasefire should be more improved. Hell even if im winning and asking to stop the war ( with giving them 1,000B€/$/£) they flip me a finger and the war rages on. If Germany sends me offer with peace for 200 or 200 for peace and i press counter-offer and re-send the same trade deal THEN GERMANY REFUSES IT??? I BARELY CHANGED ANYTHING ON IT AND THEY DECLINE THE DEAL?? LIKE WHAT?? Treaties... Mutual defence doesent work! I go war with Germany and have Mutual defence (or alliance) treaty with France. French ignore it and let me get ♥♥♥♥ed up! What the hell is that?? Okay they send reinforcements but cant they just declare war on Germany?? Were still allies! Trading is little... meh class like the wise man/woman said: ''A nation with full friendly relations with you will often refuse to make any diplomatic deals with you (other than trading items for items/money)'' Lets talk about war! The combat system is alright! I like how you have to conquer everything by yourself and not only the province. It gives me free hands to move the units where i want. But then again the movement of the units is broken. If i need to retreat my units or send them to repair after capturing  base or something like that i want them to retreat from the field and not advancing into the captured base.Okay. Honestly it doesent bother me that much cuz i understand AI wants to get to the nearest base as possible but i just wanted to get that off my heart. Thenit annoys me how close the units move at the frontline incase of retreats so i literally have to move them step-by-step like assisting an old lady off the streets to avoid them getting hitby enemies. AI focuses mostly on military. Not economics & importnat stuff like improving infanstructure & industry! The games supply system works! Just build enough supply depots and youre good to go and your units will have no problem getting to your destination.Speaking of the game time. Its slow. The time gets slower all the time! When you have hell loada units the game time slows! No matter how good your CPU is even tho im at the fastest speed the time feels like its between normal & fast! Thats why AI should control its military buildup!So... what my final rating is 7.5/10. The game is enjoyable! You can play it with mates and conquer all the AI and after that have a huge war between your mates. But few bugs just sometimes ruin the mood. in summary:PROS:-Nice combat system!-Detailed world!-Large selections of units!-NUCLEAR WAR!!!-You can play as ISIS :D-Interesting fictional scenarios and real ones too!-You can play as any nation you want!-No end limit!-Mechs!! & other futuristic battle designs!-Very good tech tree-Kind developers!CONS:-Optimiziation is bad!-When game progresses the game slows down!-Random merchant ships sailing by themselves!-Multiplayer requires 3rd party stuff (hamachi, gameranger, etc)-Rising tensions with friendlies & allies-Cant colonize or liberate nations in multiplayer!-Bugs!-Sometimes you feel the developers didnt know how to program! (no offence)			"

												""I'm going to be Ethiopia!""This one joke led to the rise of the Ethopian Empire. The year is 1936 and Italy has invaded the Kingdom of Ethopia. As the enemy army advances the army entrenches itself inside towns around the capital. The enemy attacks with tanks against the Ethopian concripts and calvary. The Ethopians charge against the enemy tanks. Rifles are firing and swords are clashing against the enemy tanks. One by one the enemy tanks explode and the out numbered Ethopian soldiers gain the upper hand. We launch our counter attack with infantry and calvary we push the enemy tanks, boats, planes, and infantry off the continent of Africa. This is not enough to sate our revenge against the Italians. We invade. We walk unhindered to their capital even as waves of tanks come to fight us and the Germans  join them as we declare war. Three months later Germany and Italy are states of the Ethopian Empire. Fear the Ethopians....10/10 would be Ethopia again			"

												Bought game after trying tons of similar games.Immediately realised this♥♥♥♥♥♥is ♥♥♥♥ing complex.First game I tried I spent sooo long ""paused"" trying to figure♥♥♥♥♥♥out the game literally crashed.Second time around I unpaused at the slowest (very slow) speed and felt my way around... No crash this time bros.I chose the resource rich dictatorship in the south east of Asia known as Myanmar (or Burma) - mostly because of Lethwei, the combat sport they have other there - and because resource rich.Well it turns out being a dictatorship, you can sell all your resources for billions and billions and then some more billions and do whatever you like with it, like buy tons of heavy military hardware and look to Invade Bangladesh.Haven't gotten there yet, mooting whether I should turn into a liberalised laissez faire dictatorship and be the centre of commerce in the SE.If geopolitical sandbox with masssssssssive scope for war/economy/political game play - then you will make a mistake in not getting SRU.

												This game is number 1. Not fake like other fake games. There is still many problems with this game, such as:-1) Bugs.2) Laj. Mother of all Laj when too much units.3) AI is sometimes WWWWW and other times okay. Please advance the AI atleast, dont just make it harder and say it is fixed lol 7abub.4) Make it more realistic, certain countries dont have what they should have. Egypt should have uranium for example.5) In General, needs alot of care.The developers 6af (dont care) about this game and therefore dont develop it nicely. So I will say this:If you develop this game properly and put real time into this game, it will be better than all your products combined. I think you cannot make it better using the current game engine, and I think you need to invest more flash into development to build such a massive real-time game. But boss, I am telling you that if you do that, you will have more flash than Blizzard and all those companies who make next-level games where you go INSIDE the game. So please, Advance this game. I want to declare war on Israel realistically. So let me Declare War and rehearse tactics please. Invest flash, and we guarantee you insane flash. Thanks bosses.			"

												Supreme Ruler is a strange game. In a way it's seriously ambitious, with an in-depth tech tree spanning from 1936 into the 21st century, but unfortunately the game suffers from so many flaws overall that it's just never going to live up to any ambition it has.The biggest issues are optimization (Big battles, wars between continents, etc will cause insane slowdown even on the best CPUs), then a lot of overall game mechanics, such as there being a massive lack of diplomacy options (You can't ask for parts of a country, no peacedeals, AI is currently so hyperaggressive that Germany often declares on Poland, France, UK and Czechoslovakia all by Late 1936).The in-game economy upscales horrendously too, with oil demands upscaling in such absurd volumes that it's genuinely quite impossible to play a 20-year game, never mind getting through the century, simply because there isn't going to be enough oil in the world to cope with Europe, nevermind anyone else.It's a shame because had this been more polished and properly balanced out, this game could be great. Unfortunately the closest you can get is alternative grand-strategy games like EUIV or HoI4.			"

												An incredible grand strategy game which basically makes the previous ones obselete. It takes the improved UI from 1936 and compiles all of the previous games (except for 2010) together to make one truely ultimate experience. A game I haven't really got into (mainly due to the poor optimization and severe complexity), but when I have the time, I look forward to delving into the world of SRU. I have loved the time I put into this game, and even if you are just interested in the game, I think the $30 is definitely justified. If you have any previous SR games (especially the relatively new SR 1936), I would recommend waiting for a sale unless if you REALLY want more SR. The game is great, and I look forward to wasting time in it when I should actually be doing something productive.			"

If this game could run well and run great  Iwould most definitely recommend but if you dont have a 5.0 GHz quad core then dont try at all cuz LAG and FPS drop also this game doesnt use all cores or only use 4 cores which is upsetting.

												This is a very difficult game. Conquesting is difficult, since it usually leads to a lowered public aproval, which lowers production of all materials, At 60 hours, I've done my best, and still have troubles getting past 1945 (the game beginning at 1936). This is a great game for choice, for alternate universes, and many many hours of hard work. If you're willing to give the game this, then you'll have a lot of fun.			"

												After so many complaints the game company still haven't fixed the large issue concerning the multiplayer. -  Will abandon the series.I have followed Supreme Ruler since 2020 after my friend tipped me, got the Gold expansion and couldnt wait for Ultimate to get out. The problem we had was not being able to play together, which most likely is the only fun when it comes to this game, sitting alone is like playing the cardboard game Risk all by yourself for several hours.- Singleplayer works flawless- LAN multiplayer works, but insanely boring- Online does not work.There's tips of using Gameranger, Hamachi etc. to build up a ""fake LAN"". works 1/10 times after disconnecting and connecting and it always ends with the game desynchronizing. I Believe 10 players together playing this game would be more or less the ultimate feeling of ultimate. But as of now, just a let down.Singleplayer has better options than LAN?Playing the Campaing or just random Sandbox on singleplayer, I was able to make every country my colony if I wished, as long as I had the troops to do so. I could free other countries by Liberating them and making them my allies or just simply claim the land. Playing 2+ removes the option of Annexing, Liberating and Colonizing.When it comes to the haste of the game, we could understand that using ""Fastest"" as speed was only for singleplayer,as it makes your PC work at it's strongest will to make the game go at über speed.But not even Very Fast was working as the game got Desynchronized, leaving us to send the savefiles over and restart.We were stuck playing at Fast which... for a game likes this, feels very slow. Especially for the buildings taking up to 700 days to complete. (Research facility).Do I recommend this game?Yeah sure, if you dont have any internet.Otherwise, no.			"

												Its a fun game, but it is virtually unplayable after a certain date because the game crashes. The AI does nothing except build military unites. You control the world economy becuase you are the only country that produces any other resources. The devs are not good. Some of the campains are broken where you cant even complete objectives. I wish I could recommend this game. If the devs fix the campaign I will change this review.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand it's clear that a lot of effort went into making the game a believable simulation, it plays and feels a lot like Hearts of Iron 3. You can play many nations during various points in history and there are a variety of scenarios and challenges.On the other hand, the interface could use a lot of work, information is not efficiently communicated to the player and it's not filtered well so players can become overwhelmed with useless and trivial spam. The interface is also overwhelming, and lacks adequate tool tips. The game also has an extremely steep learning curve, and the tutorial isn't user friendly.So this really awesome game that gets so much right has a prohibitive user interface system, and because of that most (like me) will likely only just scratch the surface.

												There are so many variables in the game to take into account. I wish the gameplay was a little faster. On the fastest speed it'll take 1 hour for ~ 1 year. Never been able to get multiplayer to work. Sometimes I think the stats are just all chosen random at the start of the game. How much resources your people use. I started the same sandbox game, same everything options. Three games started with 3 different starting conditions under the same starting options. Oi for the love of achievements, make them time sinks. Many of the numbers don't ever really seem to addup. Production and actual use will be doing crazy dances. With no justification as to why. So many options and stats to watch but they hardly ever seem like they are accurate. So many games ended restarted ended restarted. I am restarting no more and changing my mostly positive review after so many hours.Plays more like a random number generator.			"

												Let me start this off by saying I have plenty of experience with grand strategy games, and am pretty good with bad interfaces. I have played almost an hour of this game, and have unsuccessfully spent the hour trying to figure out how to use the interface. Superpower 2's interface? Clunky, but logical. Star Ruler? Pretty much the same. The issue with this interface is that it just doesn't make any sense. There are fewer buttons and areas to manage than the above two, at least on the surface, but the ways in which the buttons are organized make no sense. Things that look clickable aren't, features aren't where you'd think they would be, and there is no pattern for organization. While the game looks feature-rich and has plenty of interesting mechanics, the UI is too confusing to make it worth most people's time. It sure doesn't seem to be worth mine.			"

												I really like the idea behind this game. There are some frustrating flaws with this game. One being the nuke system is broken nukes are so underpowered they are not even worth building. Second the political system is buggy and broken. I am waiting for a good Geo-Political Grand Strategy style game to be released. This game had a lot of potential but fell short in almost every way. Tech Tree 5/5Political Options 3/5Politicial System 1/5 (politics are very buggy and broken)Intelligence System 2/5 (Fell short in almost every way, spies are almost usless)Military 3/5 (nukes were usless and battles felt broken, still playable)Political System 2/5 (almost non-existant ability to declare martial law, change government, etc... would be a nice addition as well as side efects to government ie Democracy means you can be elected out of office.) On top of the things mentioned features to be added better satellite options, better intelligence options, better political options. WMDs that actually work, and have real effects on population and in the global opinion. Smoother battles, and a military heirachy that adds to command and organization. All in all the game has very fun aspects its worth playing just fell short of what I was looking for.			"

												I have been playing this game since its early beta release and have been holding out on this review for quite some time. The reason for that is because I felt this game had a lot of potential, and offered something unique to the RTS gamer. However, after release, and a second release (Supreme Ruler Ultimate) the game still lacks logical or sensable content. AI constantly remain idol, or stuck in one time period, and lack any sort of diplomatic logic. The game uses a UN system, who's rating can never be changed or influenced but the rating effects all diplomacy and your economy. The Research system is full of dead ends and techs with absolutely no description/purpose. The challenge isn't even here. Starting at China in 1936 I have the military and economic might of 1990s China by the 1950s while other countries like the USA remain in a downward spin of debt, or research 1 new tech every decade. This game is a great trick, it looks very promising, but lacks the right content to allow the game to function. The game is still loaded with bugs, glitches, and crashes regardless of your system. Updates come once every month 1/2 or 2 and the content is to fix what you'd expect would have been done before release. To conclude this rant, don't buy this game for another 4 years, it will take them that long to add content and fix the bugs at their rate.			"

												this game is great, first off this game is brillant for those type of people that love to own there own country and just destroy others in there path but of course it can just be a relaxing game aswell as you build your countrys economy to be one of the best until another country around you declares war on others. supreme ruler ultimate supplys all games SR2020 SRColdwar SR1936 in this you can play in every era of war that has hit the modern age. My personal best is the 1936 and changeing the tide of wars that happened in ww2 Also you can just play as a side nation and chose your alliance or just be an independent nation until war begins. On other turns the AI in supreme ruler ultimate are abit on the turning side but they are greatly improving the mechanices that this game brings to running your country is near identical this game is definetly a game to keep and will be a game to be worth playing for a long period of time.

*** Warning: Addictive Diseases ***Somebody love to play grand strategy games, now they are in a mess...This game is one of the most underhyped dangerous addictive thing in the strategy gaming biosphere.Warning point Very much, much gameplay improvement from the last BG work, the Coldwar (the 1936 is not counted). Timeline is going furter from the World War era to the after 21st century (and beyond the 22nd century...). Over thousand state-of-the-art units and global units. (I can't remember them all, damn.) Micro management is still be here, no runaway. But you have a slim more chance for catching up the  addicting learning curve with the (easier?) tutorials. Less AI dull, less buggy; but they still be the main weak point of this game. The second weak point, less accurated historical, is polished. But this BG's work is nearly no ending, really. Ah, INB4 the finally. It seem I couldn't find any my hardware (and software) issues yet, both Geforce (GT5xx up) and Quadro (1xxx up).Hint: Its bugs and poor AI management might cure this diseases. But the time is going on, It is keeping fixed by each update evolve and be more stable. Please be considered carefully.			"

												its really fun and theres a few games like this and havnt played them yet but they all have the same thing... there is A LOT TO LEARN i have been reading alot on how to run countries successfully. definitly build only a few things at a time... i learned building 100 + factories at once doesnt work out so well and is just a little expensive :psomething i found funny but also a great flaw...-play as poland in 2020-try to bring poland out of a hard time (high unemployment)- spend countless hours lowering unemployment and stabilizing the economy with only 4.5% unemployment down from 8% (roughly)-after a year (in game) passes you decide to sell a large amount of consumer goods that was sold to you from other countries below the market price- sell it to the USA 1 billion dollars worth of goods and they bought it for 3.3 billion-decides to buy 3.3 billion dolloars worth of consumer goods on the market and turns around and sells that to america for 6 billion-keeps doing this for maybe a month in game turns 1 billion worth of consumer goods into 300 billion dollars-USA keeps taking out loans and has a life time supply of consumer goods and debt rises to keep buying consumer goods-economy in poland recovers due to lots of money being thrown around-prepares plans for world domination and is starting to buy troops from other countries from around the worldFuture plans....-build reserves up to 3 trillion -teach russia a lesson ;)but overall this game is challenging to catch onto but as you start to understand it it is pretty fun i still am missing out on a lot but so far i can run a successful country :p			"

												This game would be really good if the AI had the same goal as you: world domination. But they don't. Their only goal is to survive, which means everything that happens will be based on what you do. Look, I pumped over 100 hours into SR2020. Same problem. I'm betting they're never gonna fix it. So if you want AI opponents that actually fight you, instead of waiting for you to attack, go elsewhere. Also, multiplayer desync is atrocious. You will find, after an hour, that your buddy is doing idiotic things with his army, only to realize that he's no longer controlling it and you two are playing different games. Yes, that's right, it doesn't even tell you you've desynced, it just lets the AI control your buddy and puts you two in different games.			"

												I wasted $30. This game has niether the diplomatic interaction of Victoria II, nor the military features that made the Total War series so enjoyable. Instead, you're left with a hybrid that is complicated: the graphics are clunky, the lag is palpable, and the unit controls so obtuse and diffucult that the game - for me, at least - was more annoying than enjoyable to play. If you want geopolitical strategy, go for Victoria II (especially HoD), if you want mililtary strategy, go for Total War. In the end, like me probably, after struggling through hours of slight unit moves in an arcane system, you'll end up writing off the money you lost. C'est la vie. But be warned.			"

												I have played this series since 2020. I missed 2010 so I have no idea on it. This last version of the series had many improvements and the good thing it is still under development. For just this version that I began to support it prerelease the modern maps needs some fixes but WW2 maps are OK. I still miss a 1914 WW I map but am happy with the cureent WW II scenarios. In my opinion it is the best geopolitical simulator if you like this genre and it is very addictive. Many newcomers may complain about things that they do not know how to do. For experienced players modern maps and economy needs fixes. Other than this the developers added many things that was absent in previous titles like unit trading with allies a must have future also caused me to stop playing earlier titles. On the other hand I must confess that this game is not for everyone. This game has its own economical model that is quite different from modern theories although basics are same namely supply and demand is still major part of the economical side of the game but classical economical approaches may not help you a lot. This game has a very long learning curve that may discourage many but if you try you can have your own style. For example my strategy is same for any country I play with 1st Product self suffieciency, 2nd enough researching to get some good army technology and other useful civil ones, 3rd modernized small but elite army and finally after I have enough stockpiled war materials that in game they are petroleum and military goods used by your army in war. After that it is finally the world is yours. Many may say other but I prefer colonizing the world not annexing because if you keep annexing you cannot handle if your goverment is democracy no matter how experienced you are.I advice not to hurry on conquest but develop earlier then fight and if you are new avoid modern maps try WW II maps.

												This game is epic. awesome. I LOVE IT. I loved, 2020. I lvoe this series.but do not buy it if you EVER want to play with anyone. This game has HORRIBLE. HORRRRRRRIIIBBBLLLLEEEEEE multiplayer. not only is it 100% a pain to even get two people to connect via the in game lobby system (which is terrible) and if you use gameranger, tunggle, hamachi, it's fine to connect. but oh. wait. you can't play the game. unless you play it like email chess. it takes litteraly 2 hours for one year to go by in multiplayer with just three people. not only that, but as soon as someone declares war, the game locks up every 5 seconds for 20 seconds. it is litteraly unplayable. I want to love this game so much but I bought it to play wiht friends in a realistic amount of time. don't waste your moeny on buying it for friends. it's a single player only game. "

												Overall, Great Game.Some flaws, like the difficulty of trying to start an online game ,  but maybe thats just my problem.Another flaw is the AI , especially the Naval AI . I was the UK and navies such as the Guatemalan Navy were wandering around my waters , which made no sense to me, but it doesn't affect the in-game experience too much.There are plenty of different game modes , all of which are enjoyable.Plenty of playable regions,which makes for a varied playing experience. It is easy to immerse yourself in the game, it is highly addictive and you can expect to rank up the hours in the game.The Campaign is a pretty time consuming aspect of the game. The scenarios are good , unfortunately,there is only 2 custom scenarios. The Sandbox is best for beginners, i am not a beginner and thats the mode i use most.This game is multiple times better than the previous edition (1936). Overwhelmingly Recommended.			"

												This game is pretty good. Although I would want it to be like War Game.  The game does have it flaws but I don't hate it. It could use some new features like new Campaigns for 2020 and Shattered World and the 70s, 80s, and 90s and also 2000. That's what I would like to see. I wonder if Supreme Ruler 2 will come out. Only what remains is to be seen.			"

												I find the AIs too sensitive. All i did was try to complete the unification of China by declaring war on Taiwan two game weeks into the game. Annexing North Korean when it decleared war on South Korea (just because I know what it'll turn into later, I am doing them a ♥♥♥♥ing FAVOR!). And sent spies over to the U.S so i can get in with the space race. Now 50hs later my world market rating is still 0.0%. Take a chill pill god damn it, I need my BONDS!			"

												There are a few missing features in the game that don't make it the best RTS out there. Like maybe you could start your own world war just by making a pact with a bunch of countries. Then declaring war on a NATO country. But no, it does not work that way.But still, if you want a game that makes you feel like a god because you just won WW2 after invading the US and everyone becomes an axis country because of that.

(They don't matter anyway :P)Watched Germany and Merkel pull a WW2 style invasion of Europe with modern equipment, lol'd as France got its butt wooped (again).Declared war on Iraq, Kuwait, and ISIL at the same time, roflstomped them all.Will play again. 7/10 (seriously devs, leave the political bias to the PLAYERS and make an unbiased game)Without Trump Rising, is 8/10 since there isn't much political bias.

												Let me preface this review by saying that I have been a huge fan of the SR games and have played all of them with the exception of 2010. I really want to be able to recommend this game but, sadly, I cannot. Not in it's current shape at least. It is just way too buggy at this point for anyone to spend $30 on it. I did so in early access because I really enjoy the series and wanted to support the development of this game. However, I now feel somewhat betrayed by the lack of progress that has been made between then and now. The economic simulator in the game, which has always been the shining feature of the previous titles, is still utterly broken. In my last play though, I spent $98 million on a bulk purchase of electricity, only to have zero of it show up in my inventory.On top of the general game play issues, and despite comments to the contrary I've seen from others, I find this to be the most poorly optimized offering in the series. My games often ground to a halt a couple of game months in, making the game completely unplayable.I am holding out hope that the developers are still intent on making this game into a workable, finished product. They have demonstrated great fidelity to their fans in the past by frequently updating and improving the other iterations in the series. If they do so here, I will gladly change this review. Until then, I can only advise you to go buy SR 2020 Gold. It's a heck of a lot cheaper and still one of the best (and most under appreciated) grand strategy games of all time.			"

As Italy, having little idea of what i was doing, and expecting to get thrashed, as any noob should with a grand strategy game worth its salt. instead waltzed into southern france, then malta and gibralter (NEITHER GARRISONED!!!), trashed through Greece, Egypt and Palestine. Germany WAY over powered and just steamrolls everyone else. Its all over by Jan 1942. Japan trashed China. USA just looks on.

												I played it for a considerable time and some time before writing this review.  The game has tremedous POTENTIAL.Tech;  The game has a tremendously extensive tech tree.  Unfortunately too many of the techs only lead to other techs and yielded nothing in an of themselves.Command and control of units;  While you're able to build battalions of ground units which is fine, there is no good command and control system.  For a world wide game battalions need to be in divisions with some command control structure.  HOI3 has a good system.  At least ships can be put into battlegroups which can represent fleets fairly well.  There are issues with the handling of air units as well.Economy;  The game has an extensive economic system.  You have many tools to tweak your economy. Many cities are in the game with populations listed.  Here the game misses a golden opportunity.  Rather than use popuation to limit facilities built in a city, the game uses an arbitrary limit of 6 facilities per hex.  I'm sorry, but my home town which is in the game has no business having potentially as many facilities as the core hex of a major metropolis like NYC.The game also has a very simple minded low unemployment rate equals high inflation rate. The economic system has many questionable aspects, but I don't consider those a game stopper.Diplomacy; There are many different things you can do, but there are a couple things that bothered me.  One is there is only 5 levels of relationships.  It needs more than that.  Trading goods is limited to 90 day maximum trades which to me makes no sense for a game that can theoretically go for over 100 years. HOI3 system of being able to establish the trade and keep it going until someone cancels it is far superior.The developers seem to be responsive, but they may be biting off more than they can chew.

All i see is Poland  colors all the way to Berlin, then they capture and germany capitulates, Massive Pink Blob EUiv style. Oh and France tookover italy, Then JAPAN as its FIRST action invades the USSR. Luckily for them POLAND also decides to ♥♥♥♥ The ruskies, and they invade alll the way almos to moscow.

												It's a good idea, yes. But the game mechanics are not quite as developed or advanced as they should be for this price. If you want a game like this, but better, try Hearts of Iron III. Though if you must try this game, wait until a sale.Rating: 7.5/10			"

												Tough one. Can't quite recommend it.The trouble is that you have to spend so damn long educating yourself in how to play the game, and when you've finally got a handle on it you find it's not as fun as you were hoping.At first you go broke when you build a new research base and several factories, because you don't understand how much money you have. Then you master that but things get ugly as you realise you have high unemployment and a horrible inabiity to power your stuff. Then when you finally balance resources and the economy and things are going well you realise that inflation is running out of control. Then you have to learn how to manipulate taxes, production and social spending to control it. About 10 hours in you finally feel that starting a war might be on.Oh dear. The game is so damn realistic that you can't just 'start a war'. I mean you *can*, but the international community will totally shun you unless you have 'justification'. I found some expensive ways of generating 'justification' but in some cases you pretty much cannot create it at all. (It's not like EU or CK where there are fun and satisfying ways of generating CB). So you have to align with Axis who do this kind of evil stuff all the time. That's great during the second world war but the rest of the time you get screwed. And then war itself is ridiculously complex and requires another 30 hours to learn properly.It's a marginal not recommend - it doesn't give enough back for the incredibly steep learning curve.			"

AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and there is a huge disproportinality between forces, especially in the cold war era when soviet troops are made invincibile, it´s just a waste of time. I n comparison, supreme ruler cold war is much better, cause it´s much more balanced and the AI seems to do more.			"

												If you've been looking to put your PhD. in Economics to work building a functional economy in a specific region of the world this is your game.Every decision you make on your budget and country's production ability can expand your economy and will build your country's wealth and prosperity, or send it rocketing down an inflationary spiral.On the off chance you figure out the economic aspects of the game, it ends up being for naught as the other nations in the game are run by four year-olds, who only do what they want because they want to.  Since economics is hard, and macro level economics is like trying to pin the tail on the donkey with the donkey being in another other room, the other nations will inevitably run the individual economies in the ground with a massive inflationary spiral.It is a pretty game however.

												I cannot explain how bad this game is. If you are looking for a short review here it is:DO NOT BUY THIS.If you want a real review here is mine: If you enjoy games that do not tell you how (or even allow in many cases) you to do anything then you will enjoy this game. I am a huge fan of grand strategy. I have something like 900 hours logged in CK2. I am perfectly fine with a substantial learning curve. I am equally ok with having to put in a large number of hours to learn how to fully enjoy a game. This game simply provides no useful information at any time. The tutorial is clumsily thrown together scenario set in pre-WWII China that provides only the most basic of information, e.g. how to build units and how to queue up research projects. Anything from a strategic level such as managing your economy, forming useful diplomatic bonds and controlling your incomprehensibly complex military is not provided. Unfortunatly this is not where the game's problems stop. On top of the fact that even figuring out what to do is near impossible, the game is riddled with glitches/bugs. On several occasions (once during a Japan 1939 campaign and another time during an Italy 1939 campaign) while ""invading"" -- I use sarcastic double quotes because this game practically demands that you not directly control your military -- the south Pacific, I gained control of Indonesia. When prompted to annex, colonize, or liberate the nation I was asked if I wanted to annex colonize or liberate myself. As a result I ended up playing the rest of the campaign as ""Japanese Japan"" (or Italian Italy in the Italy campaign). Similarly the minister controls used to influence your nations policies seem to do essentially nothing. Once when playing as the Soviet Union in the 1949 I found myself in a fair amount of debt. How this happened in the first place I don't know. That said, I gave my minister the ""reduce regional debt"" command. This policy remained in place for several years with absolutely no effect. This was not for a lack of money, I was actually running a rather large surplus. My minister simply would not pay off my regions debt. Being the astute gamer I was I decided to attempt to just manually pay off my debt with money from my treasury. Guess what? You literally cannot do that.Now a few bugs is understandable. All software is a work in progress. The community for this game, both players and the developers, is the antithesis of helpful. Most posts related to not understanding this game are met with answers that essentially boil down to 1) Did you play the tutorial? 2) You can't do that. 3) Why would you even want to do that?If I could get back the 100 some hours I put into this game I could easily have played all the way through a game that isn't really unfun. Do you self a favor and take a pass on this one. Yes even you grand strategy enthusiast.			"

												    This game is a very realistic game on how the world worked through many periods of time. At first, it's very, very difficult to understand and grasp. There is a lack of an instruction guide and is daunting to master. However, with practice, one could conquer countries and negotiate with others with relative ease. I do recommend this game, but start your first game testing everything out and learning how to play the game.			"

												This game is confusing - I had to google lots and lots of things. And some features are stupidly not available because they're not, 'realistic'. A game I spent 25 hours playing got destroyed because I couldn't cancel the roads I'd built. I'm at war, I can't take out any loans for some reason, and 80% of my income is going towards roads I don't want. I suppose I could tough it out... but why? I really wanted to like this game - I loved EU4, and hoped this would also let me conquer the world. I'm sure it would, but this game is not polished.			"

												I love the very detailed map of this game, the amount of units it offers and the ability to play from 1936 into the future. there are however some gamebreaking bugs, most notably the game becomes a crawl after about 10 years ingame, which makes further progression extremely slow at upwards of 20 seconds per ingame day.Also, the game does not offer a realistic diplomatic AI in my opinion, in the cold war scenario you can declare war on a NATO member without the rest of NATO declaring war on you in turn. Alliances in general dont mean much.A third problem I have with the game is the very inactive industrial AI, that makes it possible for the player to economically outgrow AI nations easily without much effort.Due to these major problems, I originally gave the game a thumbs down, but as the dev hints in his response here, that might have been slightly unfair considering I spent well over 300 hours ingame at the time, and have spent over 400 by now. I do see how it is unfair of me to give the game a thumbs down after 400 hours of enjoying it, so I change it to a thumbs up at this point. If you want to support a passionate small Developer team, consider buying this game, but be aware that it is by no means flawless.Since Battlegoat has a new game in the making (Supreme Ruler Great War), I hope that these major issues will be adressed, so we can have an even greater Supreme Ruler game, and I am looking forward to spending hundreds of hours in it again.

												I played all the Supreme Ruler games and this is one is by no means ""ultimate""! The AI is totally messed up, it just doesn't work. I tried many times but there's always some power that is completely OP and wipes out all of Europe and Asia. It's no fun to choose a smaller nation and play the long game anymore. I thought the ultimate in this game was supposed to be about playing through the 20th century, but within ten years there are no countries left. I never felt I needed to warn my fellow steam users for a game. But this one is a turd, don't buy it! It brings absolutely nothing new and it doesn't really work. The UI is just as crappy as before so you might as well buy another Supreme Ruler game. I reccomend Supreme Ruler 2020.			"

												Best Grand Strategy game ever. Hands down and no contest.None of that softcore, mainstream bulls***  for little impatient children - this is a game with a rather steep learning curce and can be incredible complex if you want it to. The operative word being IF you want to.The learning curve have been made much less steep with the introduction of numerous trailers, hints and help in general. This is the only game in its class, and with the choice to dumb down Hearts of Iron 4 to the level of drooling gluesniffing 6 year olds, it seems that it will be the only game of its kind in the foreseeable future. If not ever.This game has a good gameplay, the best AI of any grand strategy game, good enough graphics as in that it has everything it needs AND it loads faster than any game I know.Also it has an excellent Sandbox feature, which makes this a game that can be played again and again.

												I still prefer Supreme Ruler 2020. Cold War 1936 and this one (which effectively combines all of them into one game) do not seem to be as well balanced.Nonethless a 3.9 / 5			"

												Best Grand Strategy game ever. Hands down and no contest.None of that softcore, mainstream bulls***  for little impatient children - this is a game with a rather steep learning curce and can be incredible complex if you want it to. The operative word being IF you want to.The learning curve have been made much less steep with the introduction of numerous trailers, hints and help in general. This is the only game in its class, and with the choice to dumb down Hearts of Iron 4 to the level of drooling gluesniffing 6 year olds, it seems that it will be the only game of its kind in the foreseeable future. If not ever.This game has a good gameplay, the best AI of any grand strategy game, good enough graphics as in that it has everything it needs AND it loads faster than any game I know.Also it has an excellent Sandbox feature, which makes this a game that can be played again and again.

												It's a fun game when it works. Build an economy, research techs (though arguably quite a few techs don't do anything other than stand in the way of getting future techs), build defences, build an army, conduct war on a global scale.  At it's best you'll have armies fighting across multiple fronts with multiple participants all for the most part acting as you'd expect.  Though for most of the time you'll encounter pretty horendous AI that hasn't a clue how supply works in the game marching troops all the way across a desert just to be stranded without fuel. Aircraft carriers that the AI cannot use which negates modern war doctrines.  Diplomacy that are sometimes just batshit crazy declaring war with no logical reasoning.  Though if you can still manage to look past all of that most importantly this game was not made for modern systems (which'll be all too evident the moment you boot it up), Early game is fine, but once you unlock sattelites or gain allies and gain their field of view, the game crawls to an unplayable stop.Yes, the game can be fun, but it's really bug riddled and quite a few features aren't fully worked out.  Though mainly it's just utterly unplayble mid-late game as the game crawls to a slideshow.			"
