												I wish the game would let me know that I should have some food prepared between biomes, before telling me I starved to death on my way to said biome and then deleting my save file of 3 hours. I also got really focused on finding foxes and forgot to eat. I had plenty of food, but then I ""starved to death"" and another save file of 5 hours was deleted. I understand it's trying to be realistic, you should think of this intuitively,  you should figure it out, etc. but forcing a complete restart after hours of tedious gathering and crafting just feels like a slap in the face.Also, the UI is clunky and annoying. So many times I frantically tried to forage an item, only to shoot an arrow or chop a tree or lay a trap. And I'm not sure if this was intended or not bug if you put obsidian on the ground, it disappears. You'd have a tool tip telling you what an item was, but you'd end up grabbing another item nearby. It's annoying to use the last of your energy harvesting something only to be teleported back to your cabin without having had a chance to grab the item. I have some other complaints, but I just don't remember them all.Edit: And now the game froze and deleted (unpurposefully, I believe this time) my latest attempt of 3 hours. I usually attempt to complete everything in a game no matter how mediocre, but I think that's all for me today...			"

								Awesome game, it's a classic point and click game meets open world survival.I earned every achievement, from fishing to bow hunting to simply chopping down trees like a true lumberjack and guess what? I did it all On My Own.Seriously though, this game has a beautiful soundtrack, hope it gets released seperately as a DLC. Simple gameplay mechanics, plenty of updates due, very minimal bugs in my entire playthrough, I only encountered one which restarting the game fixed, friendly developers that listen to the community and of course an interesting game to begin with.If you're a fan of open world games, pixel graphics, point and click mechanics, great music, killing animals and eating them, then jump right in. Looking forward to playing the level located in the mountains once it's released and buying the soundtrack once/if released too. Awesome work, Chad & Kyle!			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game. It's exactly the kind of game I like to play, and I did enjoy my first few minutes of wandering around. However, after about five minutes, I grew increasingly frustrated with the crafting/inventory UI, which appears above and below the player. I consequently found it difficult to move items from my inventory into the world – quite often, the UI was in the way. There was a clunkiness to the user controls in general – I felt like I had to focus entirely on figuring out how to actually play the game, and couldn't focus on the world itself. I played for about 20 minutes, ragequit, and requested a refund.Maybe one day I'll check it out again, because, aside from the terrible UI, the game itself seems really solid. There's definitely a lot of merit to this game, but in the end I didn't find the frustration worth it.			"

								The only point of this game is to be constantly foraging for food.You have 6 health and energy bars, most energy you'll ever get back after sleeping is 1 or 2 bars.You lose energy too fast to really be able to do anything. On the plus side you teleport to your house when you run totally out of energy.You have to remember all crafting recipes all the time.Sometimes the crafting menu works, other times it doesn't. For example:The game wouldn't let me combine sticks + rock to make a trap. Kept tryng until it worked.I put a log on top of a rock in my crafting window thinking it would replace them item, instead I couldn't move or do anything and had to restart the game again.Your inventory is too small to really be useful.Inventory screen is frustrating, often opens and blocks your view.For instance When i was trying to set a trap, the inventory screen kept opening, took many tries to actually set it.If you actually manage to set a trap, you don't catch anything anyway, I had 6 traps (many tries just to set one) that were all empty all the time. In my total game time, I caught one rabbit.Items on top of items, you often do something besides what you wanted to do. Like foraging, but instead you chop down a tree, because the two are too close together and trees have a large hit box.On my 5th game (1st few games were too bugged to keep playing), I couldn't set a trap for the life of me, after trying for 5 minutes I gave and I also gave up on this game as well.This game is more of a lesson in frustration then anything else.

								It's a pretty fun game! I really loved it, on both computer and mobile version. The thing I hate about it is the BLOODY FOX! It's hard to find one, and VERY hard to catch one. I'm not complaining or anything, I'm just saying this game is HARD! But within 3 real life hours, I've thrived there, and gotten every single items in the list. I hope the owner of this game add more stuff to this game.Here are the list I wish the creator of ""On My Own"" have added.1. More animals -Hostile; Bears, wolves, badgers, skunks, snakes, bees (with beehives), Mountain Lions, etc. -Unhostile; Birds, Tuna, Forest Goats, Mountain Goats, etc. -Rare; Yeti (Extremely Rare, not hostile unless provoked), Sheep, Yak, Travellers (So you could trade with them, or even kill them for goods), etc.2. More Equipments -Craftable; Makeshift Rifle, Makeshift Netbag, Slingshot, Spear, etc. -Natural; Iron, Clay (can be used for cosmetics of camp), Rotting Leaves (so if you have berries, you can plant them instead of looking around for them.), etc. 3. Rebuildable camp -Reason; It'll be very very VERY troublesome if your hunger is very low, and you're far away from your camp. So why not, make your own camp so you don't have to go back and forth to cook/get stuff from your camp.4. Enter your own base -Reason; It'll be boring when you only have a base just to save, and look at a map. So why not, make your camp so that you could enter it to look see what's inside. Also, like I said for Idea no. 2, ""Clay (can be used for cosmetic of camp)"", you could enter your house, and add in some cosmetics like flowerpots, or probably a workbench for you to craft even advanced items like the Makeshift rifle.5. WORKSHOP!! -Reason; It'll be great for people with big ideas to make new maps, new animals, new equipments, and new cosmetics of the game. Who knows, probably someone made your game a lot better than you might have.That's all. I hope the creator of ""On My Own"" reads this. I will soon make video gameplay of this game in YouTube so it'll get more views on what is this game about. Other than that, really good game, and I wouldn't complain about the bugs and all in this game, because it's still a work-in-progress game. Bugs I've encountered are like duplicated item when you walk and look into your inventory, and when you try to cook while walking, your food vanishes. I hope the creator would do SOME of my suggestion to make this game better. If my suggestions seem to not fit with the game, please inform me.That's all for today, thank you for reading! I 100% recommend this game to every survival game lovers. Overall, 98/100! Hope the creator reads this, and have a nice day!Your cute lil' creeper,            SargeJr			"

								This game shows real promise IMHO.Five dollars gives you a retro feel, simplistic game with a neat interface. You spend more time playing and foraging than you do trying to figure out how to play the game - which is good.The soundtrack (which appears to be 2 tracks only), is EXCELLENT - and goes well with the flow and feel of the game. There a few small annoyances, but it IS and EA game and that is to be expected.I look forward to whats coming, well done DEV's.8/10			"

								For the price ($5) this game is really nice. The survival aspect of it isn't hard, and it's a very relaxing game. The controls are done well, and the graphics are very retro and simplistic. You can't get lost in the game because of markers on the edges of the gameplay. Overall the surroundings you're in are very simple, there are only a few elements (such as flowers, squirrels, rocks, sticks and trees) so there aren't too many combinations you can make. So far I have made two types of traps and caught animals in them (but not the fox yet), and I've enjoyed the game fairly well. It is worth the price and worth your time if you enjoy relaxing, casual, survival games. Graphics/HUD: 9/10Gameplay: 6/10I'd give it a solid 7/10 if you're willing to fork over $5, and I look forward to updates in the future.			"

just a garbage game.  Graphics 4/10 -  kind of cute and retro.Interface 1/10 - Feels like a bad phone port. it's very clunky.Music 2/10 - it gets unbelievably repeative hearing the same loop.Guidance 3/10  - It doesn't hold your hand.  It pushes you from behind and laughs. then ignores you forever.Saves 0/10 - Manual saves are overwritten by autosaves making M. Saves pointless.Overall 2/10 - I'd return it if I bought it specifically. but it came in a bundle.  I'll check back in a month and edit this review if things improve.  Right now? DO NOT BUY.My struggles with this game:Impossbly hard learning curve with no tutorial.  The GUI is not intuitive.  It took 2 hours and 5 new games before I could figure out the basics.  This game is about wilderness survival and I couldn't even figure out how to eat cooked meat! I kept dying of starvation.   ""Drag the cooked meat into an area that is 10 pixels by 10pixels over your characters face while in inventory? Great thanks for not telling me that Ever! You can't even pickup items nearby your person because if you click near your person it opens up your inventory.  Just make inventory triggered by the E key like any other game!  If this game was 100% mouse based I'd understand but you move using WASD only.  My hand is already on the keyboard but I can't pickup items off the ground at my feet. I have to walk 5 feet away then click on them.  even then, sometimes it tries to get me to drag it into my inventory manually... I can't just click on everything on the ground?  The game deletes your saves!  Not only that but you cannot name your save files, you cannot choose a save slot. It doesn't tell you what day you are on. you only have a TINY screenshot to work with.  Because this game is pixel art based it's Easy to not be able to tell which save is the right one.  Ontop of all that.  You can manually save but the game AUTOSAVES randomly.  So I saved at the beginning of the day. Spent all day looking for a fox, exited, loaded my save, and it put me back exactly where I was at the end of the day.  It autosaves over your manual saves!  Just have one or the other. don't give me an illusion of choice!the RNG nature of this game is insane.  You must get lucky random number generations or you are screwed. there is no skill.  No skill points even.  No character classes. No multiplayer.  No fun.This game FEELS PRE-ALPHA Early Access but claims to be released. Bugs everywhere!			"

												On My Own is an outdoor survival game featuring exceptional production values, pixel art, and calming music. With little fanfare, you’re thrust into the wildness, tasked with surviving on your own. The ultimate goal is to survive long enough to climb the mountain.On My Own is dubbed a woodland survival adventure game by Beach Interactive and Close Studios. Released on Steam last month, the game is now making its way to iOS, Android, and soon consoles. Before I start this review, I’ll just mention that I personally know the designer and artist Kyle Weik. I hail from Fargo, North Dakota, where Beach Interactive resides. I’d talked to Kyle about the game for months before it released, so naturally I was a bit disposed toward liking this game.That said, the subject matter itself was a natural draw. Ever since I was a kid I’ve gone camping with my family. As I got older, we did more extreme camping; I’ve been on about a dozen canoe and backpacking adventures over the years.At an early age I fell in love with books like My Side of the Mountain and The Hatchet. I was also a Boy Scout, and trained in wilderness survival. Part of me has always longed to strike out on my own, to be alone in the wilderness with nothing but my wits and wisdom. While being marooned in the wilderness would obviously be a terrifying experience—especially for loved ones left behind—I’ve always wondered, Could I survive in the wilderness if I had to?I’ll likely never know the answer to that. While I’ll always have a love of camping, the modern world is such that it’s nigh-impossible, without immense sacrifice that I’m unwilling to endure, to just drop everything and go into the wilderness. I’d leave too many loved ones behind, for one.On My Own (OMO), though, afforded me a few hours to think through that possibility. You choose the sex of your character, read a brief letter about why you’re going into the wilderness, and then you’re there. You have a cabin, a hatchet, and a backpack. With little guidance, the game forces you to trap and hunt your own food, sew clothing from hides, construct weapons and tools, and start and maintain fires.There’s a fair amount of variety to the activities, but time moves quickly through the seasons, which adds a welcome challenge. Berries only grow in the summer. Plants, needed for making bows, are only available in the summer and fall. The winters are cold, limiting how far you can venture from camp before your energy is depleted.The first couple winters were brutal for me. I didn’t construct a bow that first winter, and berries barely provide any energy. My hunger meter gradually decreased as the winter wore on: I wasn’t prepared, and I thought I might starve at one point.The second summer I worked hard to gather the materials for a bow so that I could shoot a deer. But the bow broke as I hunted a deer. Then my second bow broke. The rabbits closest to my home were already harvested. I entered another winter unprepared.As the game progressed through the years (playing a year takes about 40 minutes), I got better at surviving. Soon I had a surplus of food and rabbit skins. The game is a bit unbalanced at times, where you might gather a ton of certain resources and then lack other resources. And time can move a bit fast—both the length of day, and the number of days in a season (ranging from 2-4 days for each season) could be extended.But for your money, the game is still a great adventure. There isn’t a lot of variety to the music, but the twangy banjo music is uplifting and never gets old.Conflict is minimal. The need to eat is an ever-present drive, and occasionally you might get mauled by a bear (I learned right away how close I could safely get to the grizzly bear, and where that line was!). The game does not present nature as an enemy, or as something to fear. Nature simply exists, I alongside the myriad animals.Human contact is minimal, but I never felt alone or lonely. I felt content, satisfied. Often while I played my breath with hitch and I would deeply sigh, relaxed, fulfilled.The loading screens are peppered with quotes about the natural world. For example,    Seeking means to have a goal; but finding means: to be free, to be receptive, to have no goal.    ~Herman HesseThe game doesn’t hold your hand, and provides very few hints on how to craft new items. I resisted looking up a wiki how to progress. When I finally discovered how to make a longbow, one that wouldn’t break like my bundle bow, I felt so accomplished!If you are looking for an end-goal, the game provides one in the form of different environments. You can camp in four landscapes, the last being the bleak and lonely mountain. Make it to the mountain and you “beat the game.” This is a game, though, where the destination isn’t as important as the journey. Any woodsman will tell you that being in nature, in and of itself, is enough.For all the challenges those first two years posed to me, eventually I fell into a rut. Harvesting deer and rabbits became easy. I stocked up on berries, fish, hides, feathers, and wood. I accumulated so much that surviving was no longer difficult. As I played the game, I became complacent. I dared walk closer to the grizzly bears, knowing that even if they attacked me, it wouldn’t seriously set back my efforts.To me, survival games are always most enjoyable in the beginning, when the danger is real. The first time I played Minecraft, back when it was in beta, I had no idea what to do. The first couple nights were actually frightening to me. I had no shelter, and I died over and over again by the slings of arrows from skeletons that I could not see.But then I learned to build a shelter, mine iron, and craft weapons and armor. I started over many times in Minecraft, and the first few hours are always the most enjoyable. I eventually reach the point where I know how to craft everything, and the challenge is gone.By the time I got to the third camp of OMO, I had so much stuff that I had nowhere to store it. I just left it on the ground, scattered around my lean-to. I had become rich.The same thing happened to Sam Gribley in the My Side of the Mountain series, and Brian in The Hatchet series. The first books of those series are the best, when the boys are just learning how to survive. By the later books, they, too, become rich.And I suppose that’s the natural way of the wilderness. Even alone, you are truly on your own for only a very short time. Then you have your stuff as company.			"

												On My Own:~~~~~~~~~~   Nature can be so beautiful, majestic and peaceful. However, when you are by yourself and need to survive in it, nature can be tough on anyone. And you will be on your own!On My Own is an adventure / survival game in a pixel world type of graphics. At the start of the game you will be able to choose if you would like to be a female or a male survivor stuck in the middle of nowhere. Upon choosing your gender, you will start the game in the beautiful and hot season of summer. Plenty of fruits and flowers are available for the picking in this season and you should take advantage of it. Starting in the summer is great but you will need to get through the next summer without dying, which could be a slight challenge shall we say. The game is set in seasons and each season has turns:  summer has four turns, fall has two, winter has four and spring has two.  This game is all about your resources via hunting animals and picking picking fruits. No Zombies or other baddies to kill in this game.You will find boxes here and there; make sure you actually look in them as they have valuable information on how to craft new items. You will use W,A,S,D to move your character and the mouse to pick up or use items. Good Pixel artwork.Positives:~~~~~~~~ -	Good pixel artwork-	Interesting survival game without Zombies-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~  -	Not much actionOn My Own is a nice survival type of game based on accumulating resources.7/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

								This is a fun and slightly addictive game that has a really promising concept. It reminds me a lot of early RPG-style games, except with a really interesting open-world concept. I'm looking forward to seeing this game expand into different types of environments.The mechanics are a bit confusing at first, but very easy to learn. For instance, to start a fire you need to cut down a tree with your ax, then place the log in the firepit near the cabin and add a match. You can use this fire to cook things you shoot with your bow and arrow (in winter) or trap (3 small sticks and a rock).Definitely worth checking out if you are looking for a bit of nostalgia, but a lot more than depth than old-school 8-bit games.

I really hope they keep adding functions- this game is really addictive and cute (pixel graphics but with an own  touch; relaxing music-> please more of it !) - yet at this stage it's stable but way to simple.If they continue on this game the way it is- this could be one cool real life survival game!

												Alrigth, On My Own is an awesome survival game. The fact that there is no zombies, nothing that want to kill you and the one and the only enemy is yourself, your body needs. Resources are rare which makes the game hard and true realistic survival experience, and even the smallest decisions can makes a real big different. Decisions like chopping down trees to get enough wood to keep yourself warm during the night or looking for food resources or other crafthing needs like a jacket that keeps your body warm during the day in the winter season, those decisions are the hardest to make, which makes the game more challenging. However no matter how much you go foward into the game the basic challanges will be always there like food and energy. In my opinion, it was an epic experience and an awesome 16 hours, it's not about the 2D graphics, it's about the great gameplay which some think it's buggy but i played the game and it's working very well for me.But the real question, do think you can make it on your own ?

												This is one of those games with very minimal EVERYTHING. First off, the graphics are 8-bit style and that isn't bad. Second, the crafting system has little things to make and they all are found out by putting random items together trying to make a new item. Third, the amount you can explore is quite small too.. only 4 places and they take energy to get to which is hard to keep since you get tired by cutting down 3 trees which is realistic but not fun for gameplay.Would recommend but not to someone who doesn't like survival/crafting/open world games.

Since I'm on the topic of bows and rifles, if you wanna shoot say a deer, you have to be close. Or else, you'll be wasting ammo. Ammo in this game is no walk in the park. For some people this game is great because it's challenging and I agree. This is a really good game. But, please fix the traps.7/10			"

Controller support is broken, the interface is counter intuitive and gets in the way of itself all the time. This plays like a really intresting but very unfinished alpha game. If they can get the controls + interface sorted out it has a lot of potential. Until then, give it a pass because it will just make you frustrated.			"

												Fun game. Nice soundtrack and nature sounds while playing. However, I would like to see more storage space. It seems that some items can be placed on the ground and don't disappear such as logs, sticks, feathers, rope, and the pelts, but more storage would still be nice. I could not eat a medium sized food while down 3-4 hunger, but I could eat the large sized meal. That didn't seem intuitive. I couldn't eat the food that I had with me when I was down to half hunger, and then died the next day immediately after waking up. I had lots of food stored, food in my inventory, but was not given a chance to eat. The message was that I died because I didn't have enough supplies, but I did have supplies. I didn't get the warning that I was too far away from my cabin until I had woken up and immediately died. I don't like how the saves disappear. I would have liked to be able to pick up where I last saved before dying, after a combined 5-6 hours of playing. It's fun but frustrating in many aspects.			"

But, besides the crafting It's a pretty good game. I recomend buying it if you like survival games. The game's soundtrack is really good too.			"

								As the developers said there is almost nothing in the game yet. What is there seems to work good and has no problems whatsoever. I would only recommend this game if you like the genre and don't mind waiting a few years for it to actually be playable.			"

								Like Don't Starve? Or feel it is a little too stressful then this is for you. The quick blast I have had shows a good deal of promise and for the price I will not be grumbling.Old school graphics are functional and the tune suits the game well.Another Early Access game worth an early punt, I will follow development with interest.

												Nah, i didn't like it, i thought that it would be a simple, but detailed game.It's not, it's very simple ( i'm not talking about graphics )Sounds are simple and few.Ambients are very repetitive.Crafts are poorly varied.Hunting are very simple, almost like a math.Bottom line, it's not worth of playing, unfortunately. It can still be a good game, but it needs improvements.			"

												This game is fun and super easy to play if you have ever used a keyboard and mouse before. I love the classic feel, very reminiscent of the original Legend of Zelda on NES. Its not as big a game (content wise) as I was hoping, but there are a few fun surprises if you explore the seemingly limitless open world in each of the four different biome campsites.The challenge is to scavenge, hunt, craft and plan out your journey, with some quotes, music, and a few little easter eggs along the way. If you learn to acquire food quickly, you can explore and focus on filling your journal. Travel wisely so that you dont starve, freeze, or get eaten by a bear.			"

												Out of all survival games I played, this one is probably my most favorite. So this game has great graphics done with pixel art has a really good atomosphere, enviorment, and sounds. This game is very relaxing (except when theres a  bear attack these are easy to survive just when u see the bear run the opposite direction or shoot it with rifle IF you have one.)  great fishing system (little buggy though) and my most favorite part the hunting. Hunting can be done with a rifle or bow (yes there is a gun .-. calm down now but its extremely hard to obtain so good luck :P) theres traps also! If you want a nice relaxing game I highly recommend this game even though its still buggy (not that buggy really just few bugs that can easily be fixed) so I hope you get this game and enjoy it! "

I personally have played this game since day one mostly on my old steam acount, and to this day it is an enjoyable, delightful, and great little indie/survival game. No the developers havent abandaned it, (despite what others might say). Great soundtrack, (better than undertale's). In the End, it is your choice rather or not to pay 7 dollers for it.

								Got this in a bundle and tried it. 100% of the difficulty comes from trying to figure out what to do using the terrible interface combined with a total lack of direction. I mean yeah I figured out how to make a trap. But it doesn't tell me I need several sticks. The 2 or 3 I had wasn't enough so by luck I figured out I needed I think 4 sticks. So I made a trap. Then I couldn't figure out how to bait the trap so my energy and hunger meters just kept rapidly falling lol. Good stuff. I like a game where basic functions are a complete mystery. It wouldn't matter anyway because the game was just horribly boring.Like an Atari game minus the fun. I have for real had more fun playing the worst games there are: point and click games.Works better than Ambien/10			"

												Gather around children, for I will tell you a story. You kids these days are always on your gizmos and gajigmas and your toyotas but listen well for this is an epic for the ages. It was 1945 and I had just landed on the beaches of Normandy in Toronto Armenia, the days were cold and the only friend I had that survived D Day was my trusty friend Rob Ford and then he died. After that I was left to wander the frozen wastes of South Africa until I fell through the core of the world and ended up in Montana of the U.S. where I battled bears for their hide which I would later find out from a friend named ""The Wiki"" (it's Native American) that I could make it into a coat. I later slaughtered Wiki and his family in the great ""Triangle Waist Fire of 1772"" and took their sheep named Wooly as my prize, after flaying Wooly alive I discovered that I could make a rough bag from his liver and intestinal tract, I was no longer just surviving, I was Living. My name is ♥♥♥♥ You You Self Righteous Prick (It's Scottish) and this is Teddy Roosevelts story about Muhammad Ali that was told to him by Ghandi who was using mdma.			"

												You move around at 1 mph, meaning traveling anywhere sucks. You run out of resources like energy and need to sleep after chopping 2-3 trees, which is course true to real life because most people need to sleep for the night after 1 hour of work......Was supposed to trap a rabbit, made the trap, set it down, and nothing happened. Very few animals came by it, but even the rabbits that did just walked around by it but never came up. That's a metaphor for how this is as a game.

												The minor story is good enough. The current selection of quotes don't add to the experience, imo. The intro music reminded me of ""Senya"" from Naruto Shippuden.Good harvesting, crafting, and trapping.Forage bushes for berries to eat or to bait traps with (raw meat can also work). Cook meat near a fire. Use stones and obsidian to make heads. Fell trees with axe for logs to fuel fire and sticks and feathers for traps, arrows, bows, fire starter, and axe handle. Gather grass fibers for threads to combine with pelts for clothing and blankets or make rope for bows or fishing.Other mechanics make it realistically challenging.The character needs to eat meat, as berries alone will not sustain him, and they can not be harvested in the cold seasons.My first winter was spent without a coat or hat, so I had to return to the fire often, and that limited what I could accomplish.Things I don't like:I encountered a bug where after the character loaded into the first day of Autumn he was left of the center of the screen - under the inventory menu overlay, and that made it impossible to eat.Tips:The bundle bow should only be made as a last resort. It's ineffective, short lived, and heavily resource draining.			"

												This is like Don't Starve or Minecraft but the one that is closest to it is Don't Starve. You're basically a camper starting out near a log cabin, trying to live with nature. However, you build everything in a similar manner to Don't Starve. You have an axe, you cut trees to get wood and sticks. You use rocks and sticks to make traps. The formula is very similar.I would consider this a slower-paced Don't Starve without the stressful need to avoid dying. I don't really enjoy it that much due to the similarity.PROS1. Easy to UnderstandIt's the same concept as Don't Starve.CONS 1. It Feels Like Another Minecraft Clone with Pixel ArtIt's just too similar and I've played quite a few of them.2. Slow PaceReally slow pacingSUGGESTIONS1. Differentiate YourselfIt has to be more interesting than Minecraft or Don't Starve "

The sounds seams cheap as the game. i only heard 1 (?) soundtrack and that was aweseome anoying!the world itself suxx realy. positiv is random generated, negativ that there seams only 10 random modells availiable...(and there are only trees and rocks with 2 kind of plants)About the survival - i must say what survival? you don't need anything realy important for survival. you have 2 bars. health and hunger. hunger is the only realy important bar in this game. you only hunt stupid as f*** animals, if the KI is any lower you nearly can step on them to kill them. energy is only sleeping.This game looks better, than it tastes - DONT BUY IT!My review is longer then the game content (lol) and it spoilered everthing. *thumbs up team* steal money real wellTo the devs:- with mod support, rework of controls, very big expension on survival elements, a real balacing about the food and a VERY big expension of models. this maybe realy can be a good game. graphic is ok			"

								Забавная небольшая игра, взял её в бандле, пока ещё мало что можно сделать, но она развивается и надеюсь предоставит больше возможностей. Удачи разработчикам!			"

								Do not waste your time playing this unless you have about a year to spare, i enjoy games i can pick up and play with out having to read 30 different notes on the wiki ive spent more time on the wiki thn playing this game. so if you enjoy wasting your money that could have been saved or spent on something else go right ahead if your not a retard that wants to enjoy the video games they play pickup a different game instead of a game as fun as my dogs♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								I voted yes for this game on steam greenlight, but I regret it.There are no crafting recipe tutorials, and the wiki you linked us to in the most recent update announcement doesn't have any recipes like you said it would. If I knew how to craft, this game might be fun, but the whole game revolves around being able to hunt, and thats hard to do with just traps. If you would kindly tell me how to craft stuff, I will edit this review.			"
