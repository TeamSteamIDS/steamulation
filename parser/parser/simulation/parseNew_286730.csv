												Okay,First things first. Gunship! is NOT a new game. As a matter of fact, it's so old that most young gamers probably never heard of it. But, that's not as bad as it sounds, because Gunship! is a good game.It's not perfect on all fronts, but the fact that you can play this in Co-Op is awesome. (Pilot/Gunner)Yes, I know, the store page doesn't mention it, but it has multiplayer Co-Op support.If you experience any problems with the multiplayer part you might want to start a single player game first. (You had to do that all the time, prior to hosting a session) That's what worked back then.			"

												This game was a wonderful surprise!!!!!! For a game that came out around 2000 (or so) it still has a lot of WOW to it.  Thre graphics are a bit dated but the immersion factor is definitely there!!!!........being of the old school (the early years of PC flight simulator games) this is a big plus for me.  I have windows 7 (64 bit) with an average computer system and the game runs perfect....no problems what so ever.			"

												I had a bad start after installing and couldnt get the game to run until I set the exe file to ""run as administrator"" But after that it was ok, I also had to increase the graphic settings as the default settings seem to be on super low, the game runs well and the gameplay is great.I hope an instruction manual is going to be introduced as the tutorial only covers the bare minimum, ( Im still trying to work out how to use Chaff and flares), I suggest tapping keys in game to access some nifty features, I used the F4 view and tapped ""e"" and ""r"" to change the camera views. Great game but not enough info provided :)Update regarding the manual, I basically google for one and found one, there are a few ""gunship"" games out there so be sure to get the right one :)			"

												If you like the old Gunship franchise, this may be for you. If you do not own a joystick, get one. Or get stuck in the gunners seat giving directions to the pilot where to go. Store page really should get the key reference card from ""Replacementdocs"" (see forum) since there are plenty of them and keys are not bound to normal ones, i.e. i expected Map to be on M (Mike) not on N (november). I do not get the ""Gunship feeling"" from this game, its more a feeling of ""Havoc"" or ""A10 tank buster"", even if it says that Microprose published it. Unlike what IGN said, you can get realism in flight by changing flightmode to - realistic (Duuh).So - should you buy it? Why not, chopper sims are not that common - and this is one of the better ones.			"

												I honestly do not understand the point of this negative reviews, i played this game when i was 9 yearold it is probably 13 years ago or even more i was so young when i bought this game and i still had the CD and i even had it installed on my windows 7 64bit but when i saw it on steam i just wanted to buy it again cause i just loved this game, well not only it works A LOT better than the original version i had from CD, it also supports 1920x1080 and graphic options are even more than the original one. my joystick worked fine with this game and there was no fps or frame drops at all from my side.this game is a helicopter flight simulator it has fully destructive enviromant it is really detailed for example when you fire the missiles they are gone from your missile pods unlike battlefield 3-4 which still shows you the same load out whenever you fire something and that game has modern graphics.if you are doubt to buy it or not i just give you a tip listen to the main menu music theme and decide for yourself even for the music you should grab it:


YouTube™ Video: Gunship! Menu Theme

			Another gem for you folks. This is the menu theme of Microprose's masterpiece ""Gunship!"". It's rather short, but it does the trick.

												Awesome and very realistic helicopter fligh simulator that came out in the year 2000. I'd say it's pretty good if you are up to a challenge. This is seriously the hardest flight sim I ever played. I played with all settings on realistic, and then jumped into a quick randomly generated mission. I flew a bit, and before I could even lock onto an enemy, I got one shotted. I then tried again and again, but everytime a single hit kills you. The game aparently does have a very advanced damage model with all sorts of components that can be damaged, but I don't see a reason for that, since a single shot pretty much kills you. I then changed the damage model from realistic to resistant, but it only makes the heli withstand a few more hits than 1, and then bam, the heli is rekt. At least on resistant damage settings you get a chance to get notified on what got damaged without being immediately thrown into the death animation, but once you take a little more damage, you're going down. This game is the hardest game ever made. It is 50 times harder than both dark souls games and demon's souls games combined, plus the impossible game and geometry dash and why so evil 1 and 2 combined. If you like games that are almost literally impossible, you will love this game! 11/10 It's still not hard enough! Hey, that's what she said!Ok, now to be serious: This really is a great simulator, and it really is as hard as I said it is, so yeah, I really recommend it.			"

												Ahh, Gunship!, so many childhood memories are locked in this game.So many failed attempts to fly and subsequently crash into the ground too...Man I wish I still had my old Joystick so I could experience being 6 again...The controls are not explained at all, but after about 10 minutes of pressing buttons everything came back to me. And as far as graphics go, I must say this game has aged well, it's not up to par with modern games at all but damn it still looks cool.Also, as a side note I still have the disc for this game, it doesn't work with newer systems but hey! Still have it!Now I just need Comanche 4 again and I can die a happy man.Probably not worth it if you're only interested in the latest and greatest, but a definite must-play if you like this kind of game. Also a definite must-re-buy if you played it in the past. GIVE IN TO YOUR NOSTALGIA, YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.			"

Product received for free
												This game was part of a bundle from a long time ago.  I just decided to finally play it since it was wasting space on my HDD.  It ended up being a game from the year 2000 (actually, it's originally from 1986, but this version is from 2000) that barely runs past the main menu.I got into the flight sim part of the game when I first loaded the game, but I knew nothing of the controls, so I tried to shift+tab for the Steam overlay and could not see it due to the extremely low resolution of the game, which is at 320x240 or something like that by default. I decided to try exiting the battle scene (press Esc, then Y) and then going to the configuration part of the menu to improve the visuals and maybe find the controls. First, there was no controls menu screen, and second, the visual changes made the game unplayable.  I simply can't play this game at anything other than its default resolution of 640x480 with 16-bit color.  If I try hardware mode, it crashes as soon as I load the battle scene (the ""FLY NOW"" menu option).  After about 20 minutes of research, I still cannot find a list of controls for this game and cannot figure them out on my own.  I'm piecing together what I learned about the controls for anyone interested.  Maybe someday I'll know enough about this game to play it?			"

												I can't recommend this game. Simply because I'm not able to play this game. Unlike others it does start for me. The problem i have is that i can't change the controls anywhere. I googled it but more games are being called gunship and it doesn't register the ! in the search.Maybe the game is great, i don't know. It won't work with my joystick a Thrustmaster Hotas. It only registers the throttle but the stick itself won't work. I wanted to change this, see if i could calibrate it or see if i could find the other controls on how to fly my helicopter. Appearantly you can't do this in the configuration and from what i understand that is some copy protection bullcrap. I can't find any pdf either in my steam folder with the keycontrols and even read that the publisher republished this game in a jewelcase without the keyboard layout in the PDF making it pretty much a guessing game how things work. This is very bad and there for i cannot recommend the game. You should at all times be able to adjust the controls, no matter what, period!			"

												My childhood game! Spent years with it on my father's laptop in 2000s.As far the negative votes, stop being a♥♥♥♥♥♥and go back to your preciouscall of duty game or whatever you playing nowadays.This is a valuable PC game for PC veterans, you cannot understand its valueif you below 20 age. And game works perfectly on my Windows 7 64bit. If you using a unfinished OSlike Windows 10, then its YOUR fault. Don't blame to game.Cheers.			"

												I guess that Nostalgia shouldn't be the motivating factor when buying PC games because when they don't work - like this game didn't - you're sure to be disappointed and feel cheated.This game did not run (read: crashes endlessly) on my Windows 7 PC.Spend your $7 on a hooker instead of this game, it'll be money better spent.
