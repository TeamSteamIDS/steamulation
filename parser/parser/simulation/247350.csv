												Some friends and myself picked this game up for a small lan party we were going to do over New Year's. We were all a bit ambivalent about IF this game would be fun. Disparaging comments were made about the graphics. We even argued about the merits of buying from Steam or directly from the game creator. So some time in the morning of Jan 1, we booted up the game and muddled our way through getting a server up. We didn't bother with the manual (a few of us did while we tried to figure out how to get our main screen turn on) since things appeared fairly straighforward. We settled down to our command stations, and since I didn't scramble for a specific station I was pegged as the captain. We set the game on the lowest difficulty settings and said ""It's only 6 bucks. Not too much of a loss.""We finished that map in 15 minutes. We were clamouring for more, so we made the sector a bit busier, and the enemies tougher. What followed was over an hour of organized yelling, hasty planning and tense staring at our screens as we fought to save the space stations, guide errant freighters away from black holes and deal with angry space life. We all had our moments: Weapons lofted a pair of nukes and blotted out an entire fighter strike. Engineering somehow kept us intact and powered even though we barely managed to keep him ahead of our flailing. Comms got a trio of enemy ships to surrender in quick succession. Our helmsman suckered an invincible alien life form through a minefield to its death. Sensors ID'd targets and made damn certian we knew everything around us and made each beam shot count.So our opinion after 80 minutes of fast and furious play? We all agreed on one thing. AGAIN.Who got which seat, on the other hand...			"

												Note: Please disregard the play time. I'm running the game without Steam, so it does not reflect my actual play time.First of all, I would like to correct a common misunderstanding. You do not require 6 people to play. Each ship has 6 roles that can be filled with ""up to 6 people"". Having one person take care of one thing makes it really comfortable and this is the way, this game is meant to be played. But it is perfectly possible for 3 people to have the responsibility of 2 stations, and fly the ship with its full potential (in a single instance of game client). I have 4 friends that got comfortable with the game, and now we're running comparatively easier set games with 2 separate ships (3 and 2 people per ship). Sometimes I like playing the game solo, even though it's hard to do so and possible only under lower difficulty settings. I'd say having 5-6 people per ship is ideal, but with 3+ people the game is absolutely playable.Second false information all over the place. You do not need a separate pc with its own copy of the game to be the server. Go in the Steam/Steamapps/Common/Artemis and run artemis.exe. First window should be set to server mode. Now run it again, and make the second window the client. I personally connect my huge TV to my laptop and become the server, use the TV for the server screen (which is also the outside view of the ship), and use my laptop screen for the client screen (which is the screen of whatever role I'm filling). Entering 'localhost' will connect to the server running on the same machine.I realize that this is more like a troubleshoot, instead of being a review. But in the process of deciding to buy the game, I immediately recognized how awesome this game is. The questions I had were the ones I just described. You don't need this review to know that this game is awesome, it's already all over the place. What you need to know is that the most frightening part of the game (6 people minimum thing), is actually incorrect. Also; it is possible for up to 8 ships to play Co-Op or PvP modes. Talk about awesome.			"

												Artemis is a diamond in the rough. It's very much unlike any other space sim I've ever played. The game has you play a starship bridge officer, responsible for controlling one of the ship's systems. Pretty cool and all, but there's a twist. In most space sims, a player is responsible for running the whole ship. He controls the weapons, he directs the ship to its destination, and so on. Artemis is different in that each of the ship's systems are run by other players. The bridge crew is entirely composed of humans, not AI.There are five stations to man in Artemis: Helm, Engineering, Weapons, Science and Comms. Helm controls the ship's movement. Engineering deals with repairs and modifying the power levels of each system in the ship. Weapons handles, well, weapons and shields. Science has control over the sensors, scanning targets for information on its systems and crew. Comms handles communication with other vessels, both friend and foe.This 5-man setup provides a lot of depth to the game, but it is not difficult to learn by any means. The actual mechanics behind the workings of each system are surprisingly simple to learn. The genius of Artemis is how the mechanics of all these systems work together to form a complete, compelling experience for everyone involved. All crew members need to have good synergy if they want to complete the mission. As long as you keep up a friendly attitude, pay attention to your fellow crewmates and do your part to keep the ship running, you will have a high chance of success.Originally, the game could only be purchased through the developer's website. It could only be played through LAN, and it cost 40 bucks, because that version came with extra copies to be played on other computers for a full LAN party. LAN play is fun as hell, but that alone doesn't make for much mass appeal. Fortunately, the developers have realized this and have added online play. The Steam version of the game costs a mere 8 bucks, because it's only one copy. A dirt cheap price for what could be an endless amount of fun with friends? That's a steal.If you're going to play online, you'll need to get a program called Teamspeak to communicate with other players. There is a teamspeak server that is decently populated for most of the day. IPs for servers can be found there. Its address is artemis.teamspeak3.com and its password is Artemis1. The community is very friendly, supportive, and a whole lot of fun to play with.Give Artemis a shot. This game deserves a lot more attention. It really is unlike any other space sim on the market. It's about as close to being in Star Trek as you can get. I'll see you in Starfleet.			"

												Artemis is a fantastic game, best played with friends, in the same room.  I know that many people play it on a VPN, but there's nothing quite like all playing together.  Drinking encouraged, almost required, for maximum enjoyment.The game is low-to-medium hardware intensity;  whatever machine is running the Main Viewer should have a decent video card, and be comfortable with multiple outputs if a laptop.  One of our players successfully plays with nothing more than an iPad.  Support since 2.0 has improved dramatically.The biggest issue is players not knowing the nuances of their individual roles, and what buttons are where (since they've moved since 1.6).			"

												""It's Star Trek, Jim, but not as we know it"".Don't go in expecting the full Star Trek experience because you will be disappointed (unless you get a game master). However, if all you're looking for is joining a Starfleet ship, this game exceeds expectations and then some.What you see is what you get: you and a group of friends fly a spaceship, each member getting their own interface.While some interfaces may seem daunting due to the amount of information displayed (particularly engineering), each one of them is well designed and surprisingly intuitive; you'll get used to the controls rather quickly.The gameplay is rather standard as far as Star Trek flight sim games go (mostly combat), but it does deliver this sense of belonging to a rich universe (even if the map is the size of a single solar system)Speaking of solar systems, the world objects (or rather the lack of) are the only drawback of the game. Maybe I shouldn't expect much from game that takes up a quarter of a gig, but a couple of planets and moons wouldn't go amiss.Overall, it's a great party game for those who love sci-fi. Just don't be caught on dreams of grandeur.			"

												QUICK DISCLAIMER: Ignore my hours of playtime as reported by Steam. I have played a few times and most of the time I am running the EXE outside of Steam. I probably have several hours of game time now.This game is a little buggy, a little uneven, and does not feel like it's yet been fully realized. Having said that, I can still fully and wholeheartedly recommend it, but with  a few caveats that I will get to later. The bottom line is: this game is so much fun! Seriously, if you are into, or were ever into Star Trek then you owe it to yourself to get it. Artemis is a simulation of what it might be like to be part of the bridge crew on a starship like the Enterprise. Here's how it works: You run one instance of the game as a server and then each player (up to six for a full bridge crew) runs another instance and those clients connect to the server. Each player picks one or more stations to manage (captain, helm, tactical, engineering, science, and communications) and each station gets its own interface needed to perform its functions to run the ship. So the helm gets a control layout to be able to fly the ship, engineering gets controls to manage power to various systems and mitigate damage, and the tactical officer gets to fire the weapons. The captain ties it all together, making decisions and issuing orders to other crew members. The captain has his own view which is a map with some basic information, or s/he can simply use the main view screen which is provided by the server.The developer clearly intended originally that this game would be played by people all in the same room and the simulation lends itself well to LARPing and role-playing. An ideal setup would be all six players in the same room using their own machines and whichever machine is running the server (any one of the machines could run the server and one of the clients--you DO NOT need a separate machine and/or copy of the game to play) would be connected to a big screen tv to show the main screen. Thankfully, the latest version of the game allows for playing over the internet. My gaming group uses Skype for voice chat since the game provides no native voice chat. It works fine for us.The server is what runs the actual simulation and it allows for setting up various scenarios in the game and tweaking all sorts of parameters to increase or decrease difficulty. The are various sorts of ally and enemy ships to encounter and bases to dock with and defend. The game has modes for multiple ships with their own crews that can go head-to-head or do missions cooperatively. One server can support up to 36 players (six bridges with each having their own crews of up to 6 players).Each role has different things to do to keep the ship running smoothly. Admittedly, some stations are more fun to play than others. Also, some stations feel very heavy on the micro-managing and others feel like there's not much to do; many people complain about the communications station for being sort of thin in this area. I actually don't mind playing Communications Officer You can hail friendly or enemy ships, monitor distress calls from friendly bases or ships being attacked, demand that enemy ships surrender, taunt enemy ships into attacking, direct friendly ships away from deadly areas of space, order friendly ships to attack, prepare bases for docking to improve refuel and rearm performance. And most importantly, you have the button to set off the red alert klaxon. As Communications Officer, you may also get side quests from friendly forces which usually take the form of, ""Dock with this base to download this data, then take it to this friendly ship and then come back and dock with use to get more energy/coolant/weapons/etc.""So once again, I do recommend this game if you have at least two friends to play with. You DO NOT need six people to play this game. At the very least, you need helm, tactical, and engineering, but personally, I like playing with five or six people. Also, as I said before, the game has no native voice chat if you are going to playing over the internet. Something else to be aware of is that the game does nothing for you in terms of matchmaking or anything like that. You'll need to have each player connect to the server via IP address and you'll need to set up port forwarding on TCP 2010 to be able to have any of the clients be able to connect. One other gotcha to to be aware that when you play over the internet, you won't be able to use the IP address of the server that is reported in the game. That IP will only work when playing over a LAN. You'll need your internet-facing IP address to hand out to the players for connecting to the server. I bought the six pack and gave the five other copies to my gaming group. I've had fun playing this game over the internet as well as all in the same room. It's a lot of fun especially if you have a madcap gang to play with like I do.I just hope the developer continues to work on this game. It's good already but it feels like it could go a lot farther.			"

												TO PLAY THIS GAME YOU NEED:1 PC to act as the server. One player can also run the game client on this PC and man a station.Up to 6 crew member devices per ship. They each need their own device (PC, iOS or Android). They each mann a station - helm, weapons, engineering, comms, science etc.You can have 1 or more ships. Ships can be on the same team or competing.You need at least 2 players per ship. You always need 1 server running.CAN I PLAY ONLINE?The game is designed to be played on the same LAN (WiFi network) and it is super easy to do so. You can, however, play with folks online but this requires port forwarding or Hamachi to set up.Hope this cleared that up for you.IS THE GAME FUN?Yeah it's mint. Feels like Star Trek. Accessible too - I played with my parents and sister, who are not sci-fi fans, and they all loved it.			"

												Awesome idea, bad implementation.After you understand your job and have a good team, you will never ever have a hard time. Every round will be super easy and practically the same. The maps are tiny and enemies and allies have practically no AI, if they want to go somewhere and there's a mine field in the way, they will go right through it and die. Also the game only consists of the kill-all game mode. You do have quests but most of the time after 5 minutes into the game all enemies will start clumping together at your Stations and attack them, which is when you have to engage. Once all enemies are dead the round will end and you have to start over. There is literally no other objective.So for a few hours to learn stuff, this game is really great. After that however it becomes very boring. Needs much more content.			"

												I stood in the middle of the room, at a LAN-party. I was commanding 5 younger people, trying to fly a spaceship together, while 20 others watched the projector in silence. We took the attention of all the other people, without even noticing. I was screaming commands back and forth, walking nervously in circles, and regularly yell: ""YES!"", for about an hour. And when we won, they ran around high-fiving and hugging each other. Everyone watching was clapping and we had accomplished a goal, not because of someone being good.

												Great game if you enjoy space games and more importantly team work..Originally developed as a LAN Party game, it has been given some basic internet connectivity and works *somewhat well*..Artemis puts you and 3-5 (recommended min 4 players - max 6 players) of your friends in command of a star ship.Each person has specific roles assigned to them, the roles are:- Captain (The boss)- Helm (The driver)- Weapons (Pew Pew Officer)- Engineering (Must be short, scottish and unable to reach the control panels)- Science (Sensors, Scanning and Voyeur)- Communications (Intergalactic Receptionist)You can easily condense Science and Coms into one role as they are the least demanding.It is also possible to play the game with as little as 3 people but not as efficiently as with 4 or more.Those with multiple screens are able to run a role on each screen simply by running the executable from the game folder, dragging the resolution dialog that pops up at the start to the screen they want and pressing start.Multiple roles can also be handled by single screen users also via tabs that appear along the top of the screen.The game is simple and does not have a huge amount of content but is highly enjoyable as one of those now and then small event/group games.Grab a group of your friends you think might be into this type of game, fire it up, forward the needed ports (See guides) and have a blast or just sit back and wait for someone to make a silly decision, hit the wrong button or warp everyone into the middle of a mine field..Also, if you are into lighting systems, the game actually has DMX support  so you can hook it up to DMX enable lights and program cues.http://artemiswiki.pbworks.com/w/page/68387358/DMX%20InterfaceFinally if you are after a better video demonstrating the gameplay and fun to be had watch this one:

												Generally, most people who turn up here are likely to be aware what ASBS is. In short, as someone else already put it, it's the Star Trek game you've all been waiting for.Now, I'm just gonna get you riled up - I'm more of a Star Wars guy. I also friggin' loved this game to bits. Now, let's go over the important stuff. What is readily apparent is that the game is a social game. You essentially roleplay a Star Trek style crew, so it's gonna take people. With a bit of creativity you can run it remotely but the game really comes into its own over LAN. Each player gets a specific role on the bridge, and they damn well better do it well. This is pretty much the core of it.Now, it takes some effort to enjoy it properly. It takes setting up a bridge, and it's indeed ultimate nerdery if you can set up a whole faux spaceship bridge (which some people do). The game's more than just the software, and you always need to remember. The game is also your crew. A lot of it is when you raise a glass to the finest crew in Starfleet. A lot of it is when the engineer cuts power to the engines because the drunken helm officer is zipping around to blindside enemies. The visuals are not spectacular and the sound is a little tacky. Which is sort of part of its charm - this is not an AAA title where you're a one-man army. Oh, your ship does most of the heavy lifting, but it's the crew that counts. You need to communicate for maximum efficiency. The imperfections of presentation actually make sense, as they give a nice retro feel to everything. And it's not exactly an excuse. That feel does evoke Star Trek, which is precisely the point of the game. It's not taxing on the hardware but it's precisely the point, as it naturally requires you to use multiple devices. Unless you are tech savvy enough to cheat around that (and considering you're a huge nerd, not saying it's bad, as you're eyeing it, you actually might be), but that defeats the point, as it's a true multiplayer game.Make your stories, make your legend. You may not be Commander Shepard, you may not be Captain Kirk or Captain Jean-Luc Picard. But in this game you'll soon be boldly coming at them with your crew by your side and your pha... beams hot.			"

												Great game! Highly recommended. Best when played LAN in the same room, but still fun online. I purchased one copy and installed it on the other computers in my home and played with my wife and three kids! Requires cooperation and communication skills. You can play it single player if you want by launching one instance of the game as the a server and then connecting to it from the same computer (best to do this from the actual exe file, not from within Steam) as a client in another instance. The game gets somewhat repetative with the stock missions, but you can play custom-made missions, and they even have a game-master mode. I'm not that familiar with it, but my 7 year old was spawning ships like mad on one mission.			"

												Awesome game. Need some very nerdy friends to play with, but if everything is set, it really gives the feeling of commanding a spaceship. You cannot belive the dificulty of giving orders to everything instead of just doing all the things by yourself or letting an AI to do it for you. Awesome. Must have.			"

												I really wanted to like Artemis - but it wasn't always easy!I tried Artemis in a LAN setup with 5 friends. The setup was epic: 1 TV, 6 monitors, 5 guys and 1 spaceship we were all in charge of! There certainly were some high expectations going into the simulation.The problems started right at the beginning. We started the game and had absolutely no idea how everything worked. There were no tutorials and no hints. Everything seemed alien to us and even downloading the game manual didn't help, because it was made for an earlier version of  the game.Determined not to give up, we started googling for help. Luckily, some guy had made a 30 minutes long ""short tutorial"" to Artemis. Our captain watched the whole thing and each of crew members watched their own section. This was by far the easiest way to get to know the controls of the game. Once they were explained to you in youtube, it was not so complicated after all. Spirits were high when we finally launched a random scenario and were able to defeat it. It was fun playing as a team and there were even some very nerdy roleplaying going on with our captain walking around with a coffee mug in hand giving orders. However, the random scenarios were all kind of the same. You have to defend your bases and eliminate the enemies, that's pretty much it. We were hungry for some exploration and plot, so we tried to launch some of the custom scenarios.The custom scenarios are a very nice idea - they allow people to create scenarios with plots and twists and turns for your delight. However, much of the scenarios were made for game version 2.0 and we had the newest version from steam (2.1.1) and I guess this is why all the scenarios had severe problems - game simply stopped running etc. Even after much trying, we couldn't get the custom scenarios to work.Now I realize Artemis is a single-man project and it's awesome how awesome it is, even now. But you should be aware it is not really a finished game with good support. It's a single-man coding project with a small community that has made a handful of scenarios.Right now Artemis is more of a simulator and less of a game - though it could change in the future. It's unique, however, and if you are really into space and stuff and have a couple of friends living close by who feels the same way, I definitely say it's worth your money to try it together (just don't expect everything to be perfect)!

												This is a really amazing game if you know enough people who are willing to spend some time learning the controls and pretending to be on a spaceship for an hour.Artemis does multiplayer in a completely different way to most other games, each player has a completely unique perspective of a single situation  and has to feedback to all other teammates about what they are doing and figure out how they can maximize the team from the one set of controls that they have.I truly enjoyed the experience of going from a completely untrained crew that would fly screaming into black holes with the shields down, into a team of experts who were able to defend a sector against incredible odds down to the last torpedo.

												Artemis is a fun game to play with friends over a voice communication such as teamspeak. For people who enjoy playing cooperative games and working with thier team against the AI this is a fantastic game, however it can be quite difficult to find other people to play with as the game currently has no matchmaking system.There are community groups whom play this game at regular scheduled events, so I would strongly reccomend this to groups of friends or people who are willing to seek out the community groups and play as part of the scheduled events.

												Ignore my playtime. I spend a lot of time playing this at various cons.If you're looking for an accurate representation of what running a spaceship would be, this isn't exactly the game you're looking for. It's important to know that going in.What this game really is a bizarre game of telephone, with numerous (hopefully) intoxicated players that don't have a complete view of what's going on trying to achieve missions in space. The captain wants to attack the enemy vessels attacking DS3. That's great. But that helmsmen has to get you there, and he has no idea where it is. So the captain gives him coordinates and vaguely describes what to do. But you're going too slow, so the captain orders engineering  to cut the shields before you run out of power. You arrive, but the enemy vessel is shielded. The captain orders Science to scan the vessel, and reports their weakness is shield frequency D. The captain hears this and relays it to weapons, and... you're about to die because the captain forgot to remind engineering to raise shields. So you flee, leaving a path of missiles flying behind you while Comms tries desperately to find a DS that can replenish your nukes. You find one, but you have to n navigate a minefield and asteroid belt to get there while enemy homing missiles track you down. Rinse, repeat.And that's the game. People chaotically passing along information that's often jumbled or incorrect, trying to make a starship function in an uncaring universe. It's half Next Generation, half co-op Mario Party. And it's a thing of beauty.			"

												I really can't recommend this game enough. I've played with two different groups of friends as well as with my family. Very different play-styles between the groups but awesome nonetheless.Like everyone else tells you: This is not a single player game. However do not let that dissuade you from trying to fly a ship solo. During one of the senarios I played with my friends one of them hopped into a Scout ship all on his own taking just Helm and Weapons. I was the Science and Engineering officers on the other ship and helped co-ordnate his hit-and-run attacks.For the most part we've never had a dedicated Captain. Whoever is at the Science station tends to make the tactical decisions and the rest of the crew does what they can to achieve the end result. That or they voice a concern that then changes the plan completely.I also noticed that one of the flavour texts that pops up while you're waiting for the server to start the round explains how to cause some havok:If the Engineer removes power from all systems and then puts 300% power into the warp core, the ship will self-destruct the moment it overheats. ( I may have done this a couple of times to unsuspecting friends. :P )			"

												Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator is one of the funnest games you can find, especially when played with a bunch of friends on a LAN.  Even over the internet, it is a fantastic time.This game basically puts you into an episode of Star Trek, where each player acts as the officers controlling the various systems of the ship.  Captain, Navigator, Engineer, Scientist, Weapons Officer, Radioman...everyone has a role, and all roles need to work together to survive and accomplish the mission.  It gets even crazier when you network enough players for multiple ships.  Get together with a gaming community, a bunch of roommates, or just find others interested online...the more, the merrier.It is not a bug-free game, but the enjoyment of the game far exceeds any frustration from crashes/glitches.At the time this is written, Artemis is only $7.  For that price, you'd be a fool not to pick it up.  What are you waiting for?			"

												Have you ever wanted to be on a Star Trek vessel, commanding your officers to warp from one system to the next or fire on enemy vessels? This sim is the closest thing to actual captaincy aboard a Star Trek-esque ship. It's fun and immersive and challenging. You can outfit your ship for different purposes. A heavy warship that ports from one part of the map to another, raining lasers and torps as it goes. Or you can make a light scout ship that speeds across the map, dragging massive space creatures toward unsuspecting enemy fleets. Definitely a game I recommend.			"

												Edit: I had my 5 and 6 year old daughters run stations, at one point my 5 year old daughter asks ""what now Captain Daddy""  at which point I was laughing so hard we crashed into an asteroid - definately recommend this game!Fun game, although it only plays on a 2d plane, so although it is meant to simulate star trek, its not entirely there yet.If you have one licence, you can copy your steamapps/common/artemis folder to the 2nd/3rd/4th  computer to connect them as client only.  Game runs fully self contained in its folder - and system requirements are conservative enough it runs on intel express hardware using software directx emulation.  Good design, allowed me to use an old laptop to drive the view screen (plasma tv) then two other pcs in the lounge to drive stations, helm/coms/weapons/science/engineering etcHelm top right controls your viewscreen display too.Still lacks a bit of depth - playfield is small, 2d, not a lot going on even in siege etc modes - and enemies are quite easy to dispatch if even 2 players are half competant.  In one mission i just asked an escort to defend a base and it won me the scenario.    Have not been able to locate scanable anomalies - so not sure if that is a bug or not.It can work over the internet - but more fun in the same room. You can have multiple machines acting as viewscreen tho, so you could sorta video conference the other players I suppose with fast internet.Engineering in particular could easily play remotely.. scotty get those shields up..Guys what are you doing up there, stuff is blowing up all over the place!If you can spare 35 minutes and 2 or 3 computers its worth it just for a laugh.

												I bought this game because a school friend of mine had the brilliant idea to get our group together and play it. We're still working on everyone buying the game, but that doesn't exactly matter. Me and my one friend played it for a little while to test it, and it was the most fun I'd had since I was released from the hospital three days ago. He ran most of the stuff (Helm, Engineering, and whatever else we needed), while I stayed on Weapons. We were totally screwing around the entire time, but I nuked a friendly ship and simultaneously killed two enemy ships, and my friend suicided us on a mine. All-in-all, pretty fun considering there is room for six people to play.The point, I guess, is that you don't really need six people to play, because it can be fun with even two people playing. Just keep the difficulty down, maybe.10/10 would nuke friendlies again.			"

""Errr Captain, I may have killed us""Captain tells me everything is going to be fine as he starts going backwards. So I give 200% to impulse for our almighty Captain and 150% to torpedoes while trying to keep everything cool. When Torpedoes are ready Captain tells me to fire again, we are already taking some damage and coolant is not enough since I also had to increase front shields; this time I fire correctly and torpedoes hit, reload torpedoes put 200% to beams. Decrease some bars here increase some other over there, coolant here coolant there, pew pew pew we killed 1 of them.Captain told me I did a good job! We kill the other one too but I did a good job :)Anyway, new to the game and will be playing more for sure. Totally recommend this so far but not to play it alone honestly, not only because there is a lot to manage but because the game is a lot more immersive if you play it with people.

Set a Course w/ Friends for Fun!While it does take some effort to set up online w/ friends, I had a blast w/ 3 friends playing Solo Mission.  It definitely require co-ordination to do well as a team (make sure you agree who'll be making orders as captain), but flying through space & trying NOT to die by our own (inexperienced) hands.This game is geared for LAN play, but does work well online as long as you have a voice server (like Discord) to use (as you will need to communicate in real-time).  While in-game graphics are a bit limited (as you're functionally viewing a station terminal), the little I was able to catch from the Main Viewscreen was gorgeous.If you love Star Trek & want to play as officers on the bridge, this is pretty much the closest you'll get to doing so.  I recommend getting the ""Bridge Pack"" (6 copies) to minimize issues trying to get everybody a copy & only buy single copies to suppliment gaps.			"

												This is a great game. My friends and I found it by mistake, and so we looked into it. After a week of talking about playing Artemis, we bought it, and six of us stepped onto the bridge.It was incredible. After two runs, we figured out how to work everything, and settled into our preferred roles. I was sitting in the Captain's chair, and had nothing to work myself, but I was just as involved and necessary as weapons, or comms, engineering, or helm.Our crew had to dance together to stay alive. When someone disobeyed an order, the results were catastrophic. But if everyone worked together and listened, the gameplay quickly became engaging and addictive. The first night, we played for six hours. The game is wholly worth five dollars a person.			"

The graphics are kept a little more the basic side so it is able to be played with all of your friends. Communication between players is key, each role supports the other. Without a Science officer, your weapons and comms officers are far less effective. The list can go on. So go grab your buddies (up to 5 others) and take down some baddies!			"

												This is a fantastic game if you can get enough people together to play it. It takes a while to get used to it, and with no tutorials in game the start is kind of rough. It is optomized for use with touchscreens. Tablets work, however for the best eperience run it on a touchscreen laptop. The low graphics requirement makes it a breeze to run. This is a social game.

												I owned this game before I got it on steam. It might not be the best graphically, nor does it have a ton of content, but it amazing to play with a group (or two!) of friends. My personal setup includes a projector for the main screen and all my friends bring laptops to play each of the stations.			"

												A unique experience where a player is thrown in the seat of a bridge officer of a ship and has full responsibility for that position. Whether your at the helm or comms station, the captain relies on your feedback to take appropriate action.Every station is controlled by a player and although the use of voice-chat is not required, it is HIGHLY recommended. As the game currently doesn't feature anything in terms of match making or in-game server listings it might be a bit tricky to join a group and start your new career.Regardless it is a highly enjoyable experience not only on LAN parties but also online, once you do have someone to share it with.You can actually play the game in single player, but you'll have to constantly switch between stations. And even though this may be an educational experience and helps you to tweak your power management and tactics it isn't nearly as rewarding as forming a team with clockwork precision teamwork.			"

												THIS IS A GAME FOR MULTIPLE PEOPLE. THERE IS NO SINGLE PLAYER.There. For a multiplayer bridge simulator - it is fantastic, quite simply because nothing else really exists that does what it attempts to do. Could it be done better? Yes. Has it been done better? No.This game has fueled a lot of parties, has variable ships and difficulties. Though the content is a little light, the novelty of the way it is played adds a loooot, especially if your friends are into roleplaying and/or costumes. :)			"

												The ""Strak Trek universe"", even if it completely inspired the game, is really not omnipresent, and i think it's important to say that because it could be (and i'm sure it is) a barrier for gamers who don't know the show ! =/You can have a lot of fun, playing with your friends, not knowing Mr. Spock for example. Just learn how to do your job in the task you choose on the ship, and it will be good !Otherwise, i think that this game is unfortunatelly not as known as it deserves. I'm french, i write this comment as well as i can, maybe with some mistakes, but i'm sure of one thing : we don't know enough this game in France, and we are WRONG. Maybe it's because there is no localization of the game, no translation at all, no access for those who don't know english... Too bad! =/In french now :On a vraiment besoin d'une traduction pour ce jeu. Certes, on peut se débrouiller avec un anglais moyen, mais on aurait encore plus de fun à jouer si toutes les facettes ne nous étaient pas dissimulés sous des termes le plus souvent (trop) techniques ! Par ailleurs, comme dit dans le paragraphe en anglais, on ne connaît pas assez ce jeu en France, et il ne serait que bénéfique d'avoir (de créer si c'est pas déjà fait) une communauté Artemis-SBS France solide !À bon entendeur, salut ! ;)			"

												This game is a really fun party game, but you'll need to have Hamachi downloaded on all the computers. Also, me and my friends had to reinstall Hamachi each time we wanted to play. It might have been the stranger internet network we we're all using falt. Hamachi also is limited to 5 people, unless you get a subscription version of Hamachi. It's really fun, but it requires a lot of tech knowledge and patience to get it to work right. It will take hours to get your first game set up correctly			"

												This game is truly a diamond in the rough, the premis has much potential, being a bridge officer of a space ship. But the small game didn't made for much else exept lan and direct IP co-op. It feels cumbersome to start a game, since it doesn't really tell you how to set it up. All of the actions, as hosting or joining demands you to add an IP adress. Sometimes you just need a member of the comunity to walk you trough it.setting up controllers is impossible through the game, my guess that it is done through manipulating some game files. Again this forces you to look for the comunity members that know how to do that, so they'll walk you through.The game is limited in the amount scenarios to simply defending a sector with several space stations from randomly appearing enemy ships, which can be enough at first, but cannot really simulate the reality of war. It is possible that the community members will be able to create something different, but the systems limitations will be a constant bother.My guess is that both the game, and it's engine don't have provisions for much more than it is, so I think it will have hard time evolving. Still, with all these short comings, if you want too play a co-op bridge simulator, there's no tother game quite like it. And it's limists are also described through it's small price, that for a reall trekkie is a bargain, no less.Buy it, but know it for what it is.			"

												For people who always watched Star Trek and wondered, ""What would it be like to be on a starship bridge?""The best answer to that question comes in the form of Artemis. You network at least 3 computers together to form the bridge, and each console becomes  a different station, i.e weapons, comms, helsmen, etc.The more people you have per starship bridge, the better. If you have enough for two crews, you can do a pvp match or co-op.The Stations:Captain: Tells everyone what to do Helsman: Essentially the chauffeur of the ship.Weapons: need I say more?(The minimum you need for a bridge is captain, helms, and weapons.)Engineering: Diverts power and coolant to give systems a boost and also prevent the ship from explodingScience: Scanning enemy vessels for weaknesses and scanning space for potential threatsComms: The secretary of the ship. This is the station you give your girlfriend because you want her to help, but you don't want to give her anything important. Even though I say that, it does come in quite useful- it's really boring to play, however.That being said, I highly recommend this game for Star Trek fans and non-trekkies alike, but only if you have a group of friends that you can do it with.

												You know you're supposed to give something time to warm up to it, but sometimes you just know something isn't for you. I guess it's my own fault for not researching more about this game, but in the end it isn't what I wanted and I don't think most people will like it. It requires more than one player at a time just to function (someone is going to complain ""I DID IT BY MYSELF NYEHHH"" but screw that guy), you have to have it open in two windows just to play a single player game and the screenshots are NOT what you get.All in all, this is probably EXACTLY what someone is looking for, but for most people I'd just say move on.

												I was sold a potentially fun co-op spaceship party game by trailer that involved larping. What I got was actually an unfinished buggy, borderline unplayable piece of junk that makes the obamacare website look rock solid.What the hell guys?! The hellsman desyncs from whoever is hosting and his position will rubber band back and forth when at low speeds. The game master messaging system will crash everyone who has a window capable of receiving the message in game. There's no way to turn down the incredibly loud music but after a few minutes, it just disappears completely. The pace of all the missions were completely random, as in sometimes it'll be your ship kiting 30 enemies in a circle and sometimes, it will be the enemy battleship destroying your objective faster you can possibly have made it there. The comms officer position is utterly devoid of use and fun. Your top of the line dreadnought requires 10% of its entire power reserve to do a 180 degree turn. Targetting becomes broken when enemies go in and out of visibility in a purple cloud, which by the way destroy your engines if you even graze them even with shields on when your objectives clearly tell you to explore them. Those are all from just half an hour of wasting my time and that of 5 of my friends...If you could fix all these things and improve the pace of the game a little, this would be boatloads of fun but as of now, I don't see how this game can be sold on steam.

												been looking for a game for ages that give an authentic star trek feel simular to star trek bridge commander... tried star trek online it was totally waste of money... then i saw this gamethe videos and trailers were promising but there was a problem... since i bought the game in Jun 2014, i am yet to play it as there is no online lobby or no facility online for you to just logon with some random people (or people you know) and do star ship stuff...i read the forums everyday with hopes of someone somewhere would invite me to crew a ship with them... and nothing.... some people suggested i logon to the Artemis TeamSpeak Server and wait for people to join them, and nothing... as hours/days would go by and i would mostly see one person online (who is doing the same thing i am doing, waiting to join a crew)i feel cheated of my money obtaining this game....maybe in time to come the game would be fully ready but for now, only if you having a LAN party (which is impossible for me as i have no real life friends), the game would be worth it....i hope the developer includes a ""Refund button"" when they next update the game....---------------------------update: been 295 days since buying this facking worthless game and i am yet to play it.... only enjoying it via facking youtube....

												If you're a Star Trek fan and have friends to play with on a day where you just want to experience the life of a crew on a typical cruiser, dreadnaught, battleship even - then this is the game for you! You're given quests from stations, you can fight pirates, your ship class determines your energy points and ship speed, the direction of wherever your facing determines your fighting and defensive strategies.The one thing I don't like about this game is how simplified it is in terms of shield which only is featured front and back of the ship. There's only a X and Z axis, there is no Y axis (UP/DOWN flying). It's not hard to fly together with just two crewmembers if you know how to micromanage. It lags spikes every now and then even when my friends and I are doing it LAN party.  "

												This is one of the greatest video games I have ever played in my life. It seemlessly brings together a party atmosphere since crew members need to rely on each other to get the mission done and just by simply playing the game, you automatically find yourself role playing just like a member of the Enterprise or on the bridge of the Battlestar Galactica. In order to play and communicate efficiently, the game forces you to act out just like one of those ship's crew members, making sure everyone is aware of what's going on and letting you focus on your own task.The game barely requires much processing power so you can use cross-platform methods of starting up a game, either by PC, Tablet, Netbook, or even Smartphone.

												Artemis is a great game, arguably the best Star Trek game that never was.  It is a team-based game, requiring 6 people to play at maximum effectiveness, though you can do it with 2.  The 6 stations are: Captain, Helm, Weapons, Engineering, Comms, and Science.  Each of these stations must work together to defeat any enemies encountered.You and your friends are in command of a spaceship, usually dubbed ""Artemis,"" and are out to defeat the alien hordes.  There are several game modes, with version 2.1 adding 3 additional modes.  You can also create custom scenarios.The big thing I dislike about it (not nearly enough for a no-go) is the strategy is very simple.  EMP a group of targets, then nuke them.  When you're out of nukes, head back for more.  Rinse and repeat.  Other than that, this game is a blast, especially when you can get 2 or 3 ships working together to accomplish the goal.			"

												We had a lot of trouble configuring this to work over various firewalls, but once we did, it's quite a good game.We weren't all in the same room, and used TeamSpeak to communicate, and the game played pretty nicely with four people. It would likely suffer quite a lot if you didn't at least have three.  You can actually play it solo by running it twice on your own PC - a server and a client - but it's not really designed to work that way, so expect it to be awkward.It's graphically average, with weird glitches and stuttering popping up every now and again, but nothing game-breaking. It suffers a bit from effectively being on a 2D plane, rather than a full 3D environment with a Z axis, but it more than makes up for all of this with being a hell of a lot of fun if you've got the right group of people.That's the key, really. You need a good group of people you know and get along with. People have organised 'pick up games' of random players, sure, but without a lobby and built-in networking, that can be frustrating and annoying.We also had a few crashes, where one person would, for some reason, get kicked and not be able to get back in. That can be a game-breaker. It didn't happen often, but just enough to make us a bit nervy about it during longer games.I have to recommend it, because if you've ever wanted to play Star Trek with all your mates, this is as close as you're ever likely to get. Issues aside, it's priced relatively nicely, and while it's a nuisance to set up it's definitely worth the effort once you can poke a few holes in your firewalls.			"

												Most games that simulate playing a ship (water, sub, or spaceship) seem to me too complicated, too simple, or simply missing some sort of content or another to make it fun.

												Friends suggested this game as a birthday activity. It's pretty remarkable, really. At first it was kind of funny to be Captain and to be telling a friend like I was his commanding officer to scan something... but eventually we were operating like a real set of officers on the bridge of a ship! When another friend, in another turn where she was playing Captain, said in all seriousness ""Come around to bearing 372 and open fire on the other one"" I knew that something special was going on here.This is a game you want to play with other people. In my situation I played it with some friends locally on their own computers plus a friend who joined us both in the game and over Skype so we could hear them and they could hear us.			"

												Okay, I had a lot of fun with this game and it's highly recommended, but let's get the negative out of the way first. Definitely need at least three people to really play this effectively, preferably in the same room. Also, game is rather bad at explaining how to get stuff to work. Took me and my buddies at least one round of being clueless and a couple of internet guides before we were able to play effectively.That said, once we started up, we had a blast traveling across space fighting alien ships, defending space stations, discovering anamolies, managing our resources, and working together. The game has about 4 different play modes with the ability everything from overall difficulty to how frequently anamolies appear. If you have a group of friends who you see regularly, this is essentially the perfect game for those gatherings. If you simply can round up your friends for one night of fun, still worth the price of admission.(quick note, have not tried playing it online)			"

												The most fun LAN game you will ever find.  There's also a mobile version for three dollars, and cross-platform support.Fun story, during a LAN party we almost had enough people for 2 ships, but we were all in the same room. We had one person work weapons on both ships, and a couple people grab multiple jobs. I have never been so confused as to what's going on in my entire life. eventually one of the ships was destroyed by a mine that it layed down while backing up, and the other ship rammed through a friendly ship, crippling nearly all of the systems.10/10 would blow self up again			"

												So, we saw this game at our last LAN, but there wasn't much enthusiasm. So this time round, I'd prepared, acquired the six pack and dished out copies to invitees. It was the ultimate Ice-Breaker. We had a bunch of players who had never even met before, yelling obscenities at one another as we zoomed through space accidentally firing Nukes while to close to our targets. A Fantastic game, and a Must have for anyone looking for a good laugh. 10/10 will never be captain again.			"

												This is well worth checking out. I put on two PCs and two tablets, the tablets crash now and then, but I assume it was the device, as it tends to crash. But this did allow me and my brother to play seperate ships, which is hecktick and sloppy and not as fun as having at least one crew member.  But was do-able. You can set up a sever and client on a single PC, which helps to create a main screen and a seperate station on the same screen.  Easy to learn, fun to play, better with 4 or more playing. But two with two open stations can enjoy even at the harder settings. Cheers! "

												The only way to play this game is with several friends when none of you have ever played it before.

												This game is great and lots of fun, especially with friends. While the game does not boast the best graphics or such, the simulation is enjoyable and challenging. This game is a unique simulator of a Starship Bridge, and is a great workout for any team of friends. Teamwork is a key element to this game, as every station has to work with the other closely in order to survive and achieve the objective.As a Star Trek fan, even better with the Star Trek TNG mod :) Flying a Galaxy class starship, destroying the Borg or the Cardassians just makes it that much more fun.

												Artemis Bridge sim is a neat little game. It may not be the prettiest, it may have a somewhat cheesy feel to it, but overall it being played with friends is very satisfying. It can be played by 2 people somewhat effectively, just dont make the game too hard. It can be played using an ipad, iphone, android tablet or phone, connected to a pc. Using a touchscreen to control a starship? sounds fantastic. Buy this if you have friends that are willing to spend some time playing it with you. DONT buy it if you have no friends. 7/10 (novel idea, well executed)			"

												Great game huge potential. we ( a group of 6) have played 3 times now and its good fun. we have gotten better at it but we feel its a little easy. last time played on difficulty 8/11 and we never had issues. some of the roles dont have a lot going on so I would actually suggest playing with less people and doubling up roles like having weapons and comm together. hopefully a helpful suggestion, You can have more than one instance of the game running on your pc. set the server up for the captains main screen and have them run the game again and join with the role of captain's map it was helpful for our captain to have the map at all times. we are going to look into the store scripting to see how easy it is. I have last random thing. last time we played we had some anomalies turned on and found a very funny one. one of the anomalies was invincible and very powerful. so after 2 hours of what seemed to be a rogue starfleet ship (us) roaming in Cardassian space somehow tearing apart every ship we saw with the greatest of ease we decided to go investigate the anomaly. it hurt us a lot and we tried to warp away but it followed us at warp speeds. we accidently went through a group of 3 enemy ships and the anomaly (crystalline entity?) stopped and completely destroyed them. so we decided to try that again. overcharge the warp engines and the rear shield and grab the attention of the anomaly and run the the biggest group of bad guys so he can do our job. worked like a charm. so that is just a highlight of some of the random unscripted fun you can have with a group of people.

												  Star Trek fan like myself?  Your in the right place....  Artemis is a bridge simluator where friends can get together and become the crew of a starship.  Although the game was designed for all members to be in the same room, running this with something like Teamspeak will allow you the same feel over the internet.  One person starts the server.  Then others connect to that server and choose what stations they want to control on the ship.  You can choose multiple stations on one computer, but these are all active stations and can get too complicated if you choose the wrong combo to work.  You can control Helm, Weapons, Engineering, Science, Comms, or Captain the ship.  Each station has it's own screen and working in conjunction with the other players you make the ship function.  There are strange occurences, enemies, space monsters, etc out there to explore and find.  The world is also customizable, so you can set difficulty levels and overall content to suit your crew's abilities.    The person who starts the server CAN play at the same time.  All you need to do is copy the shortcut from your library to your desktop and launch the server off that.  Then launch the game through steam as a client and you can connect and play a role.  Note that as the server, the game will give you the IP addy of your PC for others to connect to.  If you work through a router you need to open port forwarding to 2010 and the IP the router gives you.  Then give your crew your actual IP that you should be able to get in your router properties.  There are some guides on this in the forums if you need help.  Overall, it's a blast to play with a crew.  We played with only 4, doubling up captain and science/comms, and the game was great fun.   If you ever wanted to get on the bridge of a starship, this game is worth it.  Just remember it's not designed for single player.   You need at least 3 to play smoothly, though you could probably do with just 2, but would be difficult to fight on higher skill levels. "

												First off, I am not a trekky, treki, trekkie....or however one spells it.   I played this last night with a bunch of friends and I have to admit it was more fun than I thought it would be.   The game isn't about the ship, nor about subpar graphics, or UI that looks like it can be run on the N64.   It's about you and your ship mates communicating, working together, solving problems, and being the most bad ♥♥♥ space pirate ever.  The price tag is a little steep for such a low budget game but is worth the money when 4-6 ppl jump in.  The learning curve isn't too steep and you'll be on your way destroying hostile ships in no time.   "

												I haven't played this game much through steam yet (hence why my play time is low - my friends haven't gotten together to play since I bought it), but I have played it in a copy supplied by my friends.  I would highly recommend this game for LAN parties.  Instead of battling each other, you are working together to win the game.  Also, it encourages you to talk and be social.  You have to communicate amongst yourselves if you want to do well.  It's a great game for parties, and it even runs on my netbook.  We enjoy because we get a chance to role play, and we are all physically in the same room (except for one of our friends who just moved and wanted to connect via internet).  With that being said, I'm not a fan of Star Trek, but this will appeal to anyone who is a fan.  Some of the roles are not as much fun as others, but you could play to everyone's strengths and interests.  It's very simple to learn and play.			"

The IdeaUnofficially the official ""totally-not-Star-Trek"" Star Trek bridge simulator. You get a crew together and take command of a starship to valiantly defend USFP resources and interests. Ideally, you'll end up with a captain and five officers for the helm, weapons, engineering, science and comms stations. If you're short a player or two, fret not: you're able to man multiple stations if need be.The Graphics & SoundSimply put, they're not top-notch; the game looks and sounds both aged and basic even in light of its release date. That being said, its UI is thematic and fairly consistent throughout. Furthermore, it's still able to provide that awe-inspiring scenery where you look out into the vast expanse of space and just let your mind float adrift among the stars... and enemy debris, but mostly stars! The sound sticks right to the classical ol' space beeps, boops and bweens. The music's actually fairly good, limited though it may be.The UIAs stated above, the UI is thematic and consistent. It's easy enough to navigate around it, though the controls themselves need plenty of explaining and/or pressing-stuff-to-see-what-it-does. I do highly recommend reading the manual and digging up the control configuration file.The GameplayLet's start with game modes: Solo (single ship, can still have multiple players), PVP (ship vs ship), Co-op (multiple player-controlled ships), and Scripted. To hone in on that last one, the premade scenarios can be lightly compared to challenges or quests. Players can make their own scenarios as well, in which a seventh player would typically take the position of GM and spawn in enemies and environmental hazards for the players to deal with. Whichever mode you choose, it's also worth noting that you can customize a lot of the settings from enemy and player ship stats to what kind of ships and environments will appear in what quantities. This customization, combined with the ability to setup your own encounters, allows you to effectively tighten down to the perfect mixture of difficulty and enjoyment. Speaking of enjoyment...The game's always more fun with friends. Always. There's the issue of role assignment that makes role-based teamwork difficult at times, but once you're past that each position can provide a challenge. Yes, a captain gives orders for the crew to follow, but a good captain listens to input here and there while always ensuring that the crew has direction so they don't lose focus, get bored or feel useless. The helm officer goes where the captain instructs, but a good one is already coming about to bear on the next objective. Each role has room for improvement... even Comms has hidden levels of skill to strive for.If you step back and think about the way the game plays, it doesn't seem like it should be so interesting: you fly around, kill some baddies, resupply then rinse and repeat until victory. Then... you consider the sense of tension and urgency created by that group environment. The captain spins their plan and tells the crew what they want, helm focuses intently on maintaining firing arcs while avoiding those of the enemy ships, weapons carefully targets the opposition's weapons systems with beams while loading and firing torpedo tubes, engineering constantly shifts power levels up and down to provide better performance without overloading systems, science keeps an eye on ship statuses and positions while providing beam frequencies for weapons to fire on, comms keeps an eye on station supply levels while directing allied ships and demanding the enemy's surrender. During this, each player is providing vital information to the other stations. Depending on your crew this can mean a loud mess, a constant stream of curt statements in a rotation, or the one thing feared most by all captains: total and utter silence from the stations. Autonomy's good, but silence rarely is.I'll leave gameplay on this final and important detail: there are no offical dedicated servers. The community hosts either with their computers or through servers they run maintain/pay for themselves. In most cases this means you'll need to know about port fowarding and/or setting up LAN environments in order to play with other people. It's a sharp disappointment since the game is geared so heavily towards group play.The Final ProductIt's a blast if you're up to the task of organizing and operating a match. I've converted eleven people IRL to the cause so far; we LAN party it up just about every weekend. Get some friends, get to a guide on how to setup an Artemis server, and get to defending the galaxy from Kralien scum.Note: I have many more hours played than on record; my group often launches it sans-Steam.

												After all the time I spent playing this game since purchase I just can't believe I forgot to write a review for it. It has a lot to do with the fact that my recorded Steam time is abysmal but do not let this fool you: I must have logged between 200 and 300 hours for sure on this game by now. The fact is that it is not a DRM protected game at all and act very oldschool in this aspect. So much oldschool in fact that you can just copy and paste the game from your Steam directory and play it without a care in the world. A feature which the best mods around use to its full potential and which explain why I don't have much time at all logged on Steam: I always start the game from my desktop to load said mods.This game is a dream come true for any Star Trek fan who ever wanted or dreamed to be on a starship bridge to participate in whatever task is required for the ship to function. Artemis divide this in 3 primary roles and 4 secondary roles of which the former are Helm, Weapons and Engineering and the later being Captain, Science, Communications and Fighter Pilot. All 7 stations serve a critical role on any given ship and while you could technically fly a ship without the secondary stations it would certainly greatly impact on the overall efficiency of all the primary ones.After all this have been said and done, the core of the game really resolve around communication between the crew to resolve problems. Only Science and the Captain actually have a full view of the ""outside world"" on a global scale and while the Helm and Weapon officers also have a short range view of surrounding space, the communication officer and especially engineering have absolutely no clue of what is going on. It is thus critically important that every station report their own info/problems to everybody else to be able to perform about any task in an efficient manner... Just like it would/should happen on a real starship bridge!My primary concern when I bought this game was that I would not be able to find anybody online to play along. It was a very valid concern at the time because you do need at a minimum 4 players to have an efficient ship and I had nobody else in my friend list interested in playing the game with me. With some digging around forums and such I discovered two groups which are not only present but extremely active and really friendly to newcomers as well. The one group which I strongly recommend for new players is the United Stellar Navy (USN) which can easily be reached and joined on their discord server and who also are responsible for maintaining the game countdown web page[cattail.nu] which display publicly when the next planned Artemis game is going to happen. A quick visit on that page will show you all you need to know about Artemis players activity: there is a game planned for every single day on the week and that won't stop anybody from creating an impromptu game on the fly if enough player bust in at the same time and make a request for it.In conclusion, I must say that this is clearly one of the best game I ever purchased in my life. Period. about 8$ for 200 to 300 hours of pure fun and no sign of me stopping any time soon? What more can you really ask for?See you in space. :)			"

												This is well worth checking out. I put on two PCs and two tablets, the tablets crash now and then, but I assume it was the device, as it tends to crash. But this did allow me and my brother to play seperate ships, which is hecktick and sloppy and not as fun as having at least one crew member.  But was do-able. You can set up a sever and client on a single PC, which helps to create a main screen and a seperate station on the same screen.  Easy to learn, fun to play, better with 4 or more playing. But two with two open stations can enjoy even at the harder settings. Cheers! "

												Surprisingly fun.  This game literally is as close to being on Star Trek as I have ever been.  There are five stations, but to play it right, you really should use 6 players, or possibly even 7, (Engineering, Comm, Helm, Science, Tactical, Captain, First Officer) to get the real experience.  So far, with the crews I've played with, mostly we have just done the random generated stuff which can get very crazy very fast.  There are suppose to be modes that support teams co-op, and competitive play, but I've never encountered enough players to try these modes.  The only thing I wish is the developers had the rights to Star Trek to use recognizable ships and aliens.  There is a modding community, but so far, each mod I've tried has resulted in disaster in one form or another.  That aside, if you even have a passing intrest in Star Trek, play this game!			"

												AWESOOOOOOOME!!!! It's a multiplayer game that you hook up computers/laptops to a local server.  Everyone can serve as part of the same crew, or different crews, of starships.  Think Star Trek: communications, navigation, weapons, engineering, captain, science...just so awesome.  I think you need at least three players to make it doable, four is better, five is probably really, really good and six is optimal (seven's even doable for one ship with a captain).  More than that and you're going to want to break it up into multiple crews, which is totally great because you can team up or split up to explore.			"

												If you can find the 3-6 other friends to play this with definitely get it.  My friends and I played for 3 hours just dicking around and it was the best $7 we spent on a video game.  Hopefully this game will be seen through a long and healthy life of developing.			"

												Artemis is probably one of the best ""party games"" ever made. Get a group of like minded friends together use a big screen TV for the server console and let the epic night begin. Any fans of Star Trek will find this game a welcome addition to their libary, and any Sci-fi fans are sure to come to love Artemis. The graphics are a little dated but that in no way takes from the enjoyment of the game, also the game play tends to be more 2d than I would like to see in a starship game. One point that needs to be noted, you only need 1 full version of this game, to run as the server. The Artemis homepage has free installs for the subsidiary stations needed to play. Artemis ports over to tablet play very well, and for some stations the touch screen works better than mouse control. Get this game, you and your friends will not be disapointed. Rated 9/10			"

												If this had a competent multiplayer structure, it would probably be one of the highest selling games on Steam.  But you need to find other players and set up/host your own servers.  Annoying, but the game is worth the trouble.  Fix the multiplayer and hundreds more will flock to this game.  Still recommended, despite the problems.			"

My wife has confirmed this is the nerdiest thing I have ever done in front of her.  It's also hellishly fun ajd challenging at higher settings.

												We had a lot of trouble configuring this to work over various firewalls, but once we did, it's quite a good game.We weren't all in the same room, and used TeamSpeak to communicate, and the game played pretty nicely with four people. It would likely suffer quite a lot if you didn't at least have three.  You can actually play it solo by running it twice on your own PC - a server and a client - but it's not really designed to work that way, so expect it to be awkward.It's graphically average, with weird glitches and stuttering popping up every now and again, but nothing game-breaking. It suffers a bit from effectively being on a 2D plane, rather than a full 3D environment with a Z axis, but it more than makes up for all of this with being a hell of a lot of fun if you've got the right group of people.That's the key, really. You need a good group of people you know and get along with. People have organised 'pick up games' of random players, sure, but without a lobby and built-in networking, that can be frustrating and annoying.We also had a few crashes, where one person would, for some reason, get kicked and not be able to get back in. That can be a game-breaker. It didn't happen often, but just enough to make us a bit nervy about it during longer games.I have to recommend it, because if you've ever wanted to play Star Trek with all your mates, this is as close as you're ever likely to get. Issues aside, it's priced relatively nicely, and while it's a nuisance to set up it's definitely worth the effort once you can poke a few holes in your firewalls.			"

												This game is amazing. You will never have more fun yelling at your friends. You will never become so attached to groups of redshirts represented only by sad blinking diamonds on your screen. You will never get a clearer picture of whose communication skills are probably ruining their relationships. This game is like defusing a bomb blindfolded with four other people telling you how to get to the right wire. Get this game and gift it/inflict it upon those you love.			"

												First off, I am not a trekky, treki, trekkie....or however one spells it.   I played this last night with a bunch of friends and I have to admit it was more fun than I thought it would be.   The game isn't about the ship, nor about subpar graphics, or UI that looks like it can be run on the N64.   It's about you and your ship mates communicating, working together, solving problems, and being the most bad ♥♥♥ space pirate ever.  The price tag is a little steep for such a low budget game but is worth the money when 4-6 ppl jump in.  The learning curve isn't too steep and you'll be on your way destroying hostile ships in no time.   "
