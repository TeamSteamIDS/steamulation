												Good things first: The game looks great and the soundtrack is amazing. It has a really polished UI. At the beginning the game seems interesting and even though the tutorials don't teach you everything but leave a bit to discover (like removing items when your inventory gets full) it's quite easy to get. Unfortunately that simplicity also is the root of the problem with the game. It's just too simple. There's no much strategy involved - you just need to build everything your visitors require. The game doesn't allow you to do much planning or optimization. Soon you also start to run out of resources, which can be helped with the away team and ""diplomacy"". Unfortunately there are also some weird requirements for materials you just don't have or will have in long time (like fibers). The campaign starts to feel one long linear path you're unlocking.Speaking of the away teams and exploration mode. It's interesting, challening and funny at first, but becomes mundane quite soon. All the missions are basically variations of three architypes: find items, kill pirates, destroy buildings. After dozen of levels, you feel you've seen it all.The difficulty levels in exploration is quite uneven. At first the missions are extremely easy (12 first planets or so), but the you hit a huge wall where completing a level becomes a true (much needed) challenge . Unfortunately the game still repeats the same pattern, and with no chance of strategy throw in, it becomes boring. The difficulty comes from the fact that enemies have more health and they do more damage. They always behave the same: go to the attack range and attack. No specific AI or anything. I was able to complete WTF difficulty boss just by running around in the room and sniping him in the head.The game feels like a casual mobile game. Judging from the trello todo list they also wanted to target mobile, so that might explain it.Unfortunately I cannot recommend the game in it's current form.Some people have said that this is the game DF-9 was supposed to be, and now after playing the Spatials that certainly isn't a compliment :P "

In a galaxy far-far away Spacebase DF-9 was forgiven by Gods and got another (much better) reincarnation...It's about:farming and grinding (a lot);micromanagement;building a spacebase of your dreams;saving galaxy from the invasion of Bagelhead.Why you should play this:various gameplay with light elements of strategy, management and RPG:conquer planets (through real-time battles) to get research points, gather resources and obtain better implants for your team members;use research points to gain access to the new production technlogies;use resources for producing goods;build different spasebase's premises (shops, food spots, medical and entertainment centers, etc.) to attract visitors and earn money;use money to hire new members for your team to keep sustainable growth of your production lines or/and for paying contractors which make your officers more expirienced for future assessments;use implants to make team members more powerfull;send your team to accomplish more difficult missions for increasing the amount of mined resources;assign some of them to a planet's embassy to decrease the period of resources mining.flexible difficulty: you can make a death of Spatials permanent, contract's costs higher, cut production in half or pay your officers a salary which is increases with their level (good luck!).Why you may not like it:there's a chance you will find the game monotonous and repetitive (devs promised to make gameplay more vivid in V3 *);useless tutorial - it's faster to understand game's mechanic through decent video tips guide;despite the fact that there're dozens of planets, all tasks is about just simple ""kill'em all"".Save the galaxy today otherwise tomorrow it will be saved by someone else.* EDIT:On May, 28 developer announced that promised V3 version morphed into a stand-alone game ""The Spatials: Galactology"" - free after release for all owners of original ""The Spatials"".

												Hi folks! Been playing The Spatials for many months prior to the Steam launch (stoked that my save games transferred seamlessly).As a DF9 refugee I have to say I'm loving The Spatials. It's not the same game DF9 was trying to be so don't think it's an exact replica. Main differences being the art style, you cannot explore directly outside your base (but you can perform away missions on planet) and most of all this game is actually complete!The Spatials has more depth than you might initially think from a cursory glance. It's never a hard game but there is a bit of thinking and a bit of managment required. Mostly when it comes to leveling up your crew members so they can a.) fight tougher enemies in the away missions and b.) man the higher level embassies to speed up your resource production.Equiping your mission team with a suprisingly large number of different abilities and special weapons is a fun and interesting dimension. I'm still finding new abilities (or new levels of power) that I didn't realise existed. Abilities are picked up as semi-random drops from completing missions.Initially you may think money is your big hurdle but once you get a good tourist trade running (with the requisite food, drinks, merchanidise, beds and showers production lines running) money will not be an issue. Leveling your crew and opening up the tech tree will be.Yes there is a (somewhat linear) tech tree which will gradually open up new rooms and items to start new production lines.Have to also mention the two man team at Weird & Wry. Carlos is amazingly responsive to queries and feedback on the official Spatials forums and I couldn't fault the open communication, frank feedback and friendly rapport he has built with the community there. A note that The Spatials is released as a complete game and not Early Access. As such there is no feature roadmap to build out that I'm aware of. I don't mind, as the game is pretty darn good right now.As I mentioned I've been playing for several months now (since Dec 2014) and haven't become bored (although some of the away missions do tend to repeat with increased difficulty). So for less money down than that other space base building, management game, The Spatials has more depth, missions, simple combat, a tech tree, deep chracter skills and abilities, a story line and fantastic devs.Highly recommend for the price.Finno "

												Honestly i did not expect that much - i was just looking for a small sim, not too expensive. But i was really surprised by this game. First of all you get 4 games in one.Simulation - Manage and build your base, train your crew and make your visitors happy.Strategy - Decide which missions to do to get the different resources of the different planets.Tactical realtime combat - You play with your 5 man landing crew on the planets to solve mission, fight bosses.RPG - Decide how to develop your crew, equip them with stuff you find or get in missions. Control what they should do, and what not.All these for parts of the game are more or less lite versions of each genre. The simulation part makes fun, but it is not so hard - crew members can leave if they are unhappy, but in my game they did not yet. You gain money permanently, but you decide what to spend it on and when - so you should never reach 0. But still their is enough micromanagment possible to make your base work better and better.They strategy part is nice to have, but easy to handle. If you level your crew up to fast, they demand goods you can only produce with later ressources. So you have to ensure to get this resources quick before your crewmembers leave. You have to decide, if you want to spend money on gather resource or put personal on the systems embassady, to maximize the output of the system.The tactial realtime combat part makes a lot of fun, i easy at the start but get very difficult later. Each planet can be played in 3 levels, normal, hard and wtf. And if one crew member ""dies"", he just goes to stasis and can join you later after the mission - so its not so frustating, as you dont lose long trained crew members.The RPG Part seems to be not so important, but later in the game the importance grows. You have 5 different types of crewclasses and each member has its own ""carreer"" to get better. Addionally each class hat 6 equipmentslots for equipment of a specific type. The carreer attributes can buff your abilites to work on the station or buff equipmentslots to get additional stats for the missions on the planet. This does not matter at the start. But in my game for example, i recognized with level 22 crew, that my doctor is always close to dying and has a lot less life then all the other crewmembers, even with the best equipment. When i checked his carreer i saw that this guy has 0 % bonus on life, where the other members had 50-90%. But therefor he was a perfect worker, so threw him out of the landing crew and picked up another doctor who was level 20, but had already 65% bonus life.And in this more then 25 gaming hours i did not find a single bug.... this is really impressive. Ok the pathfinding is not perfect and the crew does not always the most clever thing, but everything work. And each option they a thought of while playing, is already there - but sometimes not easy to find (Sort crew by class would be nice - Ahhh, there is the button on the bottom of the list / Some statistic would be nice - Ahh, below the notifications there statistics to show me almost everything).I bought this game just for some our between other really good games.... now i have more than 25 gaming hours in less then a week and dont play anything else. So i suggest to buy this game. For me it is PERFECT!Update 6.4.2015: Played 50 hours now and finished the campaign at normal difficulty. On the 2nd run i will make a lot different - so here some hints: - Visitors and crew always want to fulfill their highest demand. This means if food is on 40 and sleep on 39, they will run and get sleep, even if they are in the bistro and would be more clever to eat first. After sleeping the will run back to bistro, but wasted much time.- Each person has different demand and craves. Later it makes sense to reduce rooms which fulfill demand on lower levels. Nevertheless you still need all of them, because some persons want special stuff from low level rooms. Example: Later i build about 10 suites all around the base and deleted my 3 baracks, but kept one. So i force the people to use the better beds to gain more sleep at a time. But some still need the low level soap, so i kept one barrack, without beds, but 2 showers.- You can build large rooms (you really have enough space), but it makes no sense. You need to build more than one room of the same type at different locations, so people dont waste time to run around your whole base to fulfill 2 or more demands. So i built many small rooms of the same time everywhere.- Use corridors and security gates. With this you can ensure that vistors and worker dont get into the same areas. This way you can optimize the paths between the rooms for both of them. If you ways go through rooms, this get more difficult and you need to change gate settings many times to build.- Free your landing crew from production so they gain happiness faster, cause they fulfill demands faster and you can do mission after mission - but let them still be builder for rooms and so on. If they got stuck behind some security gates in the visitors area, they will be free after doing the next mission.- Free the workers from building, so they dont run long ways between building and production.- If you feel unpowered, use lemurian sniper rifle and rockets to kite your enemies - it take some time but you will be able too finish each fight successfully.

			The Spatials is a Base Building Simulation game with some RPG elements. Click here to watch the playlist: http://bit.ly/TheSpatialsLP Check out these playlists: ►Let's Play The Mims Beginning -...		

GeneralA very fun and very reasonably priced little game. I think that there are a fair few “Spacebase Refugees” that have come to look at The Spatials. This is a completed game, although the devs seem to have ideas for improvement in the future. Speaking of the devs, Carlos is very good about responding to questions and concerns and generally communicating with the community.The Spatials is a weird mix of activities, including base building, “dungeon” exploration, looting, production lines, economy simulation, and character simulation (meeting their needs/keeping them happy). Despite all of these different things sounding too disparate, the game does come together into a cohesive whole which is fun and different. I would say that there is room in the future to strengthen each segment of the game and expand upon them, but right now this is a completed game which (as all games should) stands to be improved upon.The humour is delightful and it’s great to have a game where you don’t feel too much pressure (yet if you want to challenge yourself with low level characters on a high level planet you can!).All in all, considering that I've played 30 hours of this game already, and I'm likely to play another 30 of it and get all the achievements now that it's on Steam - I'd say that it's a good game, a fun game, and a great buy. If this is your sort of thing, it will entertain you for ages too!GameplayMost of your gameplay does consist of away missions, exploring the planet and defeating all the enemies. This gets a little monotonous after a while. There could be a tad more variety in the fauna, flora, and layout of planets as well as in the mission objectives. Back at the asteroid though, you build up your base by choosing what to build and where to build it, albeit you probably want to eventually build at least one of everything. The idea is you need different sorts of rooms to provide goods to visitors (to earn money) and to your officers (to keep them happy). This includes things like sleep, hygiene, food variety, intellectual stimulation, and entertainment.One fun feature of the game that is right up my alley is the inclusion of collectables. You have a garden and a museum room which allow you to show off your collectables, and you find the collectables whilst exploring planets. (Tip: they are generally found somewhere around the centre of a planet so that you don’t have to search every square inch of every planet).ControlsI find mostly use the mouse, and it would be a little tricky to not use the mouse. On away missions there are hotkeys for using each character’s special ability.StorylineThere isn’t a story per se, however I’ve only got about halfway through the galaxy. There are hints at a storyline as you do major missions to unlock the next solar system, however this isn’t a story-driven sort of game.SoundNothing amazing, nothing bad. The music is quite fun, although some tracks get on my personal nerves due to some repetitive high pitch noises. Meanwhile the phaser fire during fights can get quite monotonous. However this is a case of not being able to think of much to say about the sound, I just didn’t find it particularly remarkable.GraphicsI really enjoy the artwork in this game. It’s got a clear style and it sticks with it. The interesting thing is how the art style supports the game’s attitude of being a little bit of a star trek farce - it doesn’t take itself too seriously and doesn’t want the player to take it too seriously either. I’ve had a lot of fun with the randomized portraits and my imagination to find characters that look vaguely like other characters. So far I’ve found a Locutus, Jean Luc Picard, Beverly Crusher, Geordi LaForge, Miles O’brien, The Doctor, Tom Paris, Katherine Janeway, Kes, Julian Bashir, B’elanna Torres, Wesley Crusher, and Lando Cairissian. I’ve also found a TARDIS collectable, which totally made my day.Pros+ complete and fun game to play+ great potential, great concept+ fun artwork+ interesting universe+ supportive devsCons- sounds could use some work- could use more depth- some UI organization could be improved uponHelp Me Help YouPlease• give me constructive criticism in the comments - tell me why the review wasn’t helpful• upvote my Steam review if you liked it so that others are more likely to find it too!Rothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website.

												My first impression of this game after 4 hours of play is pretty good. In spite of the kiddy graphics there's a surprising amount of depth to this game. Each game is randomly generated giving you a different experience each time. I haven't played too far into the game yet so I don't know how it develops later on, but I'm certainly enjoying the early game.


YouTube™ Video: The Spatials - First Impression Gameplay 

			Views: 434		

			Short introduction to The Spatials, showing the basics of the game. Sorry for the spelling mistake in the title!		

The Spatials is basically split into two parts: first you have a base-building tycoon style game, second you have a real time RPG game where characters go on missions, level up and so on.Base building is the core of the game, your goal is to build a large space station that will attract many visitors from different alien races, supply them with their needs and of course, make money out of them. To do this you'll not only need to build the station, but supply it with resources, and there are many different resources to be found on the hundred or so planets out there.Research is necessary to unlock new room and equipment types and there's a tech tree that you progress through, making your station more advanced over time. To unlock new techs you need to gain research points by going on missions. This is also how you discover and acquire the resources you need.Your station requires staff. There are five different types of characters, obviously modelled on Star Trek - the diplomat, the science officer, the doctor, the strategist and the engineer, each with colour coded uniforms making it easy to tell them apart. Not only do they work in the station but more importantly, they go on missions to various planets. This is where the real time RPG part of the game comes in.Each character possesses different skills and items. Going on missions gains them experience which causes them to level up and further develop their skills. They also develop increasingly sophisticated needs that must be fulfilled, like certain foods for example. Oddly, their only need at the beginning of the game is sleep, apparently they don't even need to eat at the start, which is just as well, because you don't have any food or the means to cook it.Missions consist of choosing five characters, landing on a planet and performing certain tasks, like destroying enemy bases and so on. The combat is pretty simple once you get the hang of it, with each character having a certain special skill that can be activated with a keypress (1-5). It's very important to keep pressing the 4 button to keep healing your characters. They can't actually die in combat, but if their health is reduced to zero they are put ""in stasis"", so they can no longer take part in the mission. If this happens to all your characters then you've failed the mission. You can easily try it again later though, perhaps with different characters and equipment.Once you've won a mission you get certain rewards, such as resources and items, as well as experience and research points. You also have access to the planet's resources, which you can start harvesting, to add to your station inventory. You can upgrade your characters with new skills and new weapons to make them stronger in future missions.You can also accept contracts which are like missions, but you don't actually play the mission, you just send up to three officers on the mission, pay a fee and get a result a few minutes later.New staff members can be recruited at embassies, and every system has one career mission which unlocks a new star system. Over time, enemies grow stronger and your characters level up, making them stronger. All the while you have to keep growing your base and providing more and more services for the visiting aliens.While the graphical style is a retro isometric view, it's detailed and colourful and serves its purpose. It won't win any prizes but that's not what the game is about. The gameplay is straightforward, easy to learn and enjoyable. It may become quite challenging to satisfy all of your visitor's needs once the station grows large enough, but I haven't got that far in the game yet.My first impression though, is very good. It's a fun game, an interesting challenge, and very relaxing to play. I recommend it.			"

												Once in a great while a game comes along where you just want to play, and play, and play. Well for me this is it. I just want to keep trying to do all missions on all the Planets, upgrade my team the best I can, build my base till I get it going good, and reasearch all there is to know. Twenty Seven hours in, and I still am at it. This game is fun, and challenging. It took me about Six-Eight Hours to really get a good feel at what to do. Although I still am finding things out. It is kind of like playing a couple games in one. Buiding a base, but also building a good team to go on Missions. I will be playing alot more hours, and it is a good price for the gameplay. It reminds me of why I got into games in the first place, to just have fun.			"

												Note: This Review/First Impressions was done with a key obtained from the developer. The majority of playtime (6-8 hours) was done via the key obtained via the Humble bundle, but an additional key was released for Steam. A mashup of Roller Coaster Tycoon, Star Trek, and some parts action RPG. It's not a game for people who need high energy and high actions, but more so for people who like micromanagement, with creating your perfect space station and the perfect crew who specialize in certain areas. +:Lots of Management options, in and out of missions.Lots of building options, with different items and materials.Crew management and upgrades adds a sense of improvement and experience that you don't see in a lot of simualtion games of this type.Lots of variety all over the place.Good bang for buck in terms of content. Slow, methodical gameplay for those who like control. -:Action RPG portions can get boring, not enough variety in missions.Lack of controls on away missions could be better.UI elements could be added to provide better information to the end user.For more first impressions and gameplay footage:

												(Note: I spent many more hours on this game in the Humble Bundle version before they got to Steam.)The Spatials is part tycoon game, part action game. The basic gameplay is that you build a space base to attract visitors, but to keep them happy you need to set up a production chain of food and items.And in order to get resources for this, you need to send your crew out on missions.The space building part functions much like any tycoon game: you lay out rooms and corridors, optimally in such a manner that nobody has to travel too far for it. You can also use decorative items to make the base prettier.The missions are point and click: you get an objective such as  ""track the items"" or ""kill the pirates"", and you click your crew through the world. You can kill enemies (and innocents) by clicking on them or by using your crew members' skills.After you cleared a planet you will have earned some resources, and you can now also set it to automatically deliver resources to your base on each turn.Back at the base you will be able to unlock more room types, increasing the types of things you can build, increasing the number of resources you need... you get the drill.The game has a cute visual style and Star Trek-like music. It is quite easy to get into, but at the same time remains challenging and fun as you try out new base layouts and new missions.			"

												***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***The Spatials is a space station building sim crossed with an isometric ARPG meets Tycoon game which recently released on Steam. In The Spatials not only do you build a space station on an asteroid to satisfy guests and earn their hard earned cash you also take a crew of brave men and women on hundreds of missions across an expansive randomly generated galaxy. Completing missions earns you valuable resources and money which can be used back at your space station or, in the case of money, can be invested into planets where you have completed missions in order to regularly receive supplies.+Simple and colourful graphics which suit the game well and look nice+Easy to follow tutorials which are very helpful in teaching you the basics of the game+Great UI which is very easy to navigate+Building is very easy thanks to the grid that appears when building and it's also very easy to correct mistakes if you accidentally build something in the wrong place+A reasonably sized Tech tree with a good variety of things to unlock over the course of your game+The galaxy is randomly generated each time you start a new game and contains over 100 planets with increasingly challenging away missions+Missions on planets have you go around completing objectives such as killing enemy pirates or destroying guard towers+When on missions I found the combat to be fun though it seems not everyone would agree with me on that+A good number of different room types and objects for your space station+You're provided with a simple breakdown of what your staff as well as visitors want while they are at your space station+After completing missions you are able to spend your money unlocking resource slots which then provide you with whatever resources that planet has every few minutes+A large number of weapons and upgrades to be found on missions for your crew to use making them stronger+Simple controls when on away missions-It's very hard to earn money early on and I often found myself just sitting idle while I waited for more money to be spent in my space station so I could buy something-It's not in the slightest bit challenging. Firstly, your crew can never die on an away mission, if they run out of HP they simple get beamed back to the ship and then they're perfectly fine for the next mission. Secondly, there's no environmental dangers or any enemies where your space station is nothing to slow your progress or make it harder like there are in similar games. Finally, even if your visitors are unhappy they still spend money while visiting your space station so it's impossible to ever run out of moneyVerdict:8A great building/ARPG/Tycoon game with nice, colourful graphics and a wide variety of things to do while playing that's easy to get in to for new players.El K.

The Spatials is a very good space management/strategy game that I am obsessed with right now. I usually don't like this kind of games, but this one is really well made and, after some struggling at the beginning, managed to keep me interested.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You have to build your own base on a planet. This planet is frequently visited by humans and aliens that you have to satisfy with your services. For those services, you need some products and materials that you can get by completing missions and cleaning other planets from pirates. You fly with your chosen crew across the universe, kill pirates, collect materials, help other people and upgrade your crew members' stats.Pros: A very big amount of content.  Visuals are simple and good-looking. Every crew member has his own abilities such as grenades, sniper guns and healing teammates. Beside regular missions, you can also conquer other planets. After beating a level, you also get to play it on 'hard' and 'WTF?!' difficulty. Weapons that you find no good use for can be recycled into different, high-level weapons or abilities.  The galaxy you're playing in is randomly generated. That is pretty awesome except if you manage to fall into a galaxy that has extreme lack of some material. But that is just bad luck. There is a so called 'Tech Tree' from where you can unlock a lot of new room types, products ... In most cases, you can't afford to lose even one crew member, so the game makes you think a bit and make a strategy I'm not a very rich man, but the price is very low for this kind of game. Linux and MacOS support When you click on another window (I have two monitors), the screen doesn't flicker like crazy, when it tries to exit full-screen mode. This might not mean to some people, but it's great for me as I chat a lot.Cons: There is a tutorial in this game, but it tells you pretty much nothing. I finished it and still had no clue what I had to do. I had to figure out things by myself and it almost made me quit. But once you manage to get started, things become very obvious. No multiplayer. I'm sure that it would fit very nicely into this game. Things to do on non-mission planets are very repetitive. Missions are sometimes, too, but the story manages to cover that up. Because of the 3D view, it's sometimes hard to place the buildings and items correctly. However, you get the hang of it quickly so it's not a big deal.Suggestions:This game needs a better tutorial. Badly. The existing one tells you some basics about your base, but it keeps quiet when it comes to upgrading your base, traveling, material gathering ... Luckily, the community responds to any questions to have.Also, there could be some kind of an ""idling"" thing embedded into this game. When you're not playing the game, the progress stands still. I'm sure this would attract a lot of people.The final verdict:Once I managed to pass that initial phase where I just couldn't figure out what to do, this game offered a great amount of content and, most importantly, fun. The game is great to look at, you have lots of missions and you can upgrade you crew member's abilities.If you're into that kind of games, I definitely suggest you to buy it. I think it's great fun and it offers a lot of gameplay hours.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												There's a lot about The Spatials to like, and a lot that falls flat. The away team leveling process is pretty cool and works reasonably well as a game mechanic. The base building and visitor attraction mechanic is a cool concept, though the economics of it are extremely simplistic and not really that interesting. There's also a big mismatch between when nodes in the research tree unlock and when the corresponding resources required to use the stuff you've researched unlocks. You end up with a substantial amount of time where you can't use anything you've researched. Worse, later on, once you hit level 13 or 14 officers, their vital needs get complex enough that if you happen to fail a mission and they become unhappy, you can't raise their happiness levels back up in time to keep them from leaving, even if they started at near-full before the mission began. And because you lose all their items when they leave, it's hard to replace people.Essentially, there are major game balance issues right now that keep the game from reaching its full potential. But the game is also a diamond in the rough. Fixing the game balance issues really shouldn't really be that hard. A few of the planets around level 6 or 7 should get a couple of the more advanced resources sprinkled in to tide you over until level 10 or so when the advanced resources really start becoming available in bulk. The AI for officers should be smarter about fulfilling their vital needs and cravings more quickly so that they don't time out when unhappy through no fault of the player. It's certainly possible right now to get totally screwed by suboptimal base design, but you don't know the base design is suboptimal until you're frantically trying to make someone happy again with a timer ticking on you. And the game needs a lot more variety in the missions, particularly in terms of different types of enemies. Every mission is the same couple enemies with very little variety. After the 10000th pirate you kill, it gets a little monotonous.If the game is on sale for < $5, or if they fix these issues, it's worth your time, otherwise, probably not.			"

												Fairly polished (text errors aside), looks nice, interface is good, the base building is interesting enough... but there is literally no risk, and virtually no challenge.    They've basically built a really nice cow-clicker, which would be great if I actually wanted to play that sort of game.			"

												The Spatials is what would've happened if Starfleet cared about cash and tourists instead of exploration and peacekeeping! Your goal is simple. Spread your influence, and please your customers with the most efficient tourist attraction this side of the Milky Way!In all, this Action/Tycoon game has enough to bite into and be enjoyed. However it does have a bit of a learning curve. Even with the tutorials your progression is simply up to you to figure out. (Don't worry about setting up your station at start and focus more on away missions right away.) Also The Spatials is a game that will require quite a bit of time investment to get anything really going. Making sure that you can meet the supply and demand of your ravenous guests. The game is a solid tycoon game but expect more of a relaxed experience then something fast paced. There really isn't a way to lose for that matter.  With little to no bugs to speak of. Spatials is very well put together. The only area it may lack is in replay. There really isn't much pushing you to make any station after you've gone through all that work. So if your looking for a factory/tycoon game with decent graphics, fun away missions and plenty of upgrades. An action element and relaxed gameplay. The Spatials is a solid choice.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

			This game mixes simulation base building (ie the sims) with some really nice RPG elements to create a very interesting game.		

This game is an outstanding Indie gem.  It is deep, well balanced, well thought out, and runs very smooth.  It also included a help screen and a tutorial assistant that can be closed until needed at any time.  You will likely need to use the help resources a few times however as this game is very deep and complex.  The brilliance comes with th games simplicity however.  While it offers a lot to do, it never feels overwhelming and everything makes sense.You start off with 5 random people as your crew in a tiny little room on some distant asteroid far, far away.  Every crew member has a name and a purpose and starts off at level 1.  At this early level their only needs to keep them happy and working for you is a place to sleep.  Easy enough, just use your starting 10,000 credits to have them build on add on room and toss in some beds.  They don't require micro-management and work without having to babysit them at all, which I love.  So now you got them a little space station started.  Next room to build is a warehouse, get another warehouse room added on and toss in some storage vaults and a recycling machine to help keep your inventory clean and uncluttered.Perfect.  Now what?Well, start exploring the vastness of this procedurally generated galaxy that is your game.  Start by looking in your own system and clicking on other plants or asteroids to conquer.  Conquer them by completing the missions given to you on said planet, usually killing mobs or boss mobs.  Once you conquer the planet, you now have access that worlds rescources.  Now use your points you've obtained conquering planets to research no technology on new stuff to make for your base.  Add on more rooms and more cool stuff.  Pretty soon, you'll be ready to host aliens from other universes to come and stay at your base, and by supplying them with food, drink and items that want to buy, you'll make them happy and start acquiring money.Rinse and repeat, as you start conquering and exploring planets further and further out, as the difficulty increases, and as your base grows in insane sizes.It's a brilliant game that seems to offer a bewildering level of depth, explortation, and balance.  But most importantly it is just plan FUN to play.  There isn't many Indie games that launch with the level of heart, soul, and quality that this little game contains in abundance.  This game is easily worth double it's asking price in my opinion because it is loaded with so much to do, so much to research, and so much to build.  At its current price tag, this is a no brainer for any fan of simulation or RPG fans.  Go click ""Buy"" and you'll thank me later.My Early Rating...  88% out of 100.  A great bang for your dollar!!

												Its ok,but the combat ruins it.Also the way you need to set up the space station sucks. You get 5 guys that land on the planet to do combat missions,but they only attack one person at a time,the one you click on. They also move as a group aswell. They can't split up or do much. Also its very clunky.You should change out the ground team often to prevent them from leaving or wanting to leave. IMO, really do not see the point of the classes,or the need to use 5 guys that act as one guy.You can not rotate the camra to see at anytime or anyplace in the game,makes building a tad clunk.You need to make all the rooms around or very close to the starport,as the visitors have like 2-3mins to shop and fullfill their needs.So a very large waste of the map that could have been used.5/10got about half way or more before being to bored to go on..uninstalled.

												Once in a while, you find a little gem in all those Indies these days.This is one of them.The combat feels a little like  1995 (that is not that bad, at least i was young back then), but it is good enough (albeit i really like turn based tactical battles, just saying^^).That there even IS real combat in a space-station-building-game is nice.And thats what this game is, a modern space station builder with a bunch of depth, alot of good ideas and a suprisingly fair price.When you have a look at the horrible stuff for 20-30 bucks around, EA titles from that you know after a short look that the ""game"" will stay in EA for 2-5 years, this can't be mentioned enough.I hope this game runs fine and don't gets lost like Lantern Forge.Thanks to the devs for the great game already.I know, i won't get turn based combat, but...may i ask for the option to rename and maybe even alter the look of my crewmembers? Anyway, worth every cent, thanks a bunch.			"

												If you love the Dwarf Fortress civilization sim genre, you'll find a lot to enjoy about this game.ProsSpatials is flipping hilarious and adorable. The art is great, the nonsense is nonsensical and the writing is a great blend of camp and irony. The progression system does a good job of slowly growing the complexity of your civilization and the RPG progression of your officers helps to make them stand out. The entire game is approachable and enjoyable.ConsIt doesn't take long to start feeling the grind. You start to go on away missions solely for a single resource you ran out of and the tech tree falls to the side as you quickly get so many new technologies that you just don't have the resources to really capitalize on them. At this stage, the tutorial is a little rough. It falls in the gap between needing a wiki and not. The game is simple enough that you'll get by fine without external sources, but if you don't know how to do something, most likely the tutorial will not explain it.Overall, I would say The Spatials is a great game as long as you're looking for something more approachable than Rim World or Dwarf Fortress, but not to the same level. An awesome starter for the genre and a ton of fun.			"

												Like many cross-genre games, this one suffers from not deciding which genre to focus on. The squad-based real-time combat portion feels like the controls are incomplete (where's the option to ""fight things you run into while moving""?). This suggests that the station construction and management should be the main focus, producing bonuses for the squad to make up for the reduced controls. However, the only bonus that can be gotten from the station is xp, and only at early levels (according to the help screens). This in turn makes the station management seem nearly pointless, in addition to the lack of achievements for doing well at it, as the main goal of managing the station becomes simply supplying all the needs of your away team so that they don't quit on you or go into combat with penalties. The tourists are self-balancing: the only penalty, at least so far, for not satisfying all of their desires is that they arrive more slowly. Station constructions are limited by the away team's adventures, both by the need for tech points (gained from exploration, not building/research) and by the need for resources. So both the combat portion and the building portion are crippled: the former by poor controls; the latter by lack of incentive and challenge.			"

												I have bought the spatials and the galactology second game. I decided to play the base game first. It is very very very very repetitive. It is a cute game and is good for killing a few hours. I found it a little difficult at first as the tutorial does not seem to actually cover much, and then you realise that if you click on every tab, every tab comes with it's own tutorial ... so for new players click on everything. I am hoping that the galactology game will add more to it, as after 7 hours I don't feel that there is much more to explore. There is obviously more things to find and different chemicals to build but it just seems so bleh!I will load the galactology game and see if that gives you more. I must admit to so far being dissapointed, this is at best an app.			"

												A fun base management and space exploration game. Perfect for someone who likes their games a little more on the casual side. I love the adorable graphics and light-hearted humor. Sound/music is nice too though I have to keep it turned down as the repetitive blaster/gun sounds annoy the husband. After 50+ hours I'm almost finished the campaign and still looking forward to building up my base into a mega space mall before I quit. If I were to go back and try to complete all difficulties on all planets I could add even more time to the gameplay. (at time of writing this I've done most of the planets on hard but very few on ""wtf"") The game isn't perfect. Missions can be repetitve and having to level ambassadors was a bit of a bore but still the game is well worth the price.  "

												First Impressions:""The Spatials"" is very enjoyable and easy to pick up and play.  The UI is incredibly fluid and it didn't take long for me to understand the basics and what all of the different buttons did.  It has a lot of interesting ideas, one being that officer needs are unlocked as you level up.  Instead of starting with an empty base full of officers that will require all sorts of things from the get-go, you'll only need to initially address sleep and eventually work your way up to things like hunger. I enjoyed the colony sim/action RPG mix...that is, you'll be managing a colony and building a station but will be required to do ""away team missions"" to different planets in order to gain tech points (to unlock items in a tech tree) and resources (to make said items).  There's a lot to do here for the $13 price tag and luckily, wasn't abandoned mid-development...you know who you are.

												This game is almost perfect. It is one of those rare gems that you can run for hours and hours only to realize the sun has come up and you may need to sleep at school/work before putting in another night with this game.It is also available for Linux (currently as a beta), which is a big plus.Do I recommend this game? Yes.There are, however, some issues that may affect gameplay:1. While the soundtrack does a good job of being ambient enough to not be an immediate bother, it starts to get grating when you're playing it for several hours at a time. Grating as in there's this one track that sounds as if it's glitching and it gets annoying fast.2. There is no way for tall objects (Like the spaceport) to become transparant while moused over or when using the wall-removal button, making it fairly difficult to see what may be built directly behind them.3. Apparently you can't put corridors side-by-side, yet there's no obvious other room that could be used to make corridors which are two or more squares wide. Yet, when exploring planets somehow someway the people building there CAN add corridors side-by-side, making for some interesting doorway and hallway combinations.4. You can't (de-)construct the initial teleport room, mostly because it's the only place where your officers spawn. But you can't build anything in there, not even ornaments, making it a fairly useless 3x3 square block. (5x5 if you consider you can't put rooms up against other rooms.) It's also the only place which has walls with big giant windows which I'm sure my visitors would enjoy seeing on the outer edges of my spaceport. From a glance at the research tree, there's also no way to unlock being able to (de-)construct this particular room type. I would welcome the opportunity to expand upon it and use it as a 3x3 hallway with ornaments, but alas.5. Emptying your inventory during a crisis gives you 1C for stacks of 0~1999 units, 2C for stacks of 2000~2999 units, and so on. It's pretty much useless even while you'd imagine there's a bit more compensation for the hard work your officers put into making end-products as opposed to raw materials. This is not taken into account at all and all stacks are treated equally in this.6. When sorting officers, the three category buttons do not have their expected behaviour. When all are turned off, one should see the entire list, which happens fine. But when sorting on only diplomats, one still sees the entire list. When sorting on only exploration crew, one still sees the entire list. It is confusing. A similar sorting option is lacking at the Diplomat screen, where I often have to scroll past my exploration team and already assigned diplomats before getting to the candidates I can actually put in the vacant slot I am trying to fill. This could use some optimization.7.a. Officers will walk away from big building projects after they have only put down one piece of floor or an object instead of being automatically assigned the next build order since they are the closest worker to it. Especially in big projects this may lead to officers from the farthest reaches of your station to come wandering over, slowing down the build project immensely.b. In a similar manner; officers will randomly decide to hop from one factory module to another without clear indication of what is behind their decision to do so. They would make one dessert only to hop over to the machine next to it and make another dessert at it, only to then walk over to another factory room and start making spare parts. And this is with enough officers in the station to occupy all of the factory objects simultaneously.So yes, the game runs stable (Tested on Windows 7 & Debian 8). It's playable. It's enjoyable. It could use some optimization, but there has never been a perfect game.So, If you're happy enough dealing with the issues I listed in this review, by all means buy the game. It /is/ enjoyable to play and a decided timesink.For all intents and purposes, this is what Double Fine's Spacebase DF-9 could have been. And it made me think of games like MuckyFoot's Startopia in terms of station-building, a real-time version of MicroProse's UFO/X-Com series in terms of planet-exploration/combat, and even Sierra's Alien Legacy which had attempted to combine the two elements before.

												I bought this game for $9.70, and like someone already said, it is well worth this price.This casual space-exploration game blends time-management with simple mouse-clicking combat. You started out with one room on an empty asteroid surface with a few employees. The goal is to explore neighboring planets and galaxies to exploit more resources to build up your home base. The control interface is easy to learn, although I wish there would be more guidance on manufacturings. However, after a few trial and errors, you can definitively get a handle on those things. The main thing here to progress through the game is to send your employees to explore other planets and gain expereince, resources and money. There are a lot of planets, so you wouldn't worry about play time; if you do though, you can always revisit those planets to get bonuses. So far I feel this game follows a linear progression, that is explore-upgrade-explore, interspersed with quirky story lines here and there. But I have yet to explore the majority of the galaxies out there, I will update my review once I finish it. tl;drPro: Rich content and long gameplayCon: Simple, somewhat linear, progression8/10			"

												The Spatials is a querky mix of space colonly sim and Star Trek action game spoof. You set up your base not just to make money from customers but to satisfy your officers whom get more demanding as they level up. So as your going on missions you're not always going to want to pick your A listers out of fear they'll level up before you can get everything ready for they're new desires. I love this small mechanic. Add to that, your officers are the ones whom do the grunt work at your base. Be it building new sections, making spare parts, or cooking up some food you really should leave someone to take care of that. Why, because eveything is happening in realtime. Just becaue your on a mission doesn't mean things pause back at homebase. This is why I can forgive the simplistic controls on the Action side of things. It would just get too complicated and hectic for many players. Still wish they would let you move Officers individually though. Also know that the tutorial is very passive, relying on the players curiosity. I prefer this approach but some may find it a bit annoying.TL;DR 9/10 Great Base Sim with simple point and click Actions bit to spice things up.Edit: I can't spell very good.			"

Deep Thoughts, in deep SpaceThis game is hard to describe since it's a genre mix. It has station building, civ. building, some action (the away missions), character management and... deep space exploration.The game is a lot of fun. Even when the genre might not be your faved terms of playing. It has a lot to offer and exploration often is a very good thing for earning resources, items or to unlock items for you station.Still, the developers work a lot on this game, soon there will be a new release with some new options, and already the game is a lot of fun. Though, I want to add, I would like more missions, planets and sectors (maybe even Aliens)... Maybe the wish will come true... maybe three or more sectors, even if it's on an purchasable add on, would be nice.Pros: The style of the game is cute, and yet not an overkill in cuteness. You might take different approaches during gameplay to solve a tough foe.Personal management can be painful, no not in a bad way... but with officers quiting you'll have to improvise for some time.Atmospheric and stylish soundtrack that isn't going on the nerves.Cons:Might get quite repetetive and grinding over time.Recommended? Hell, YES!Given, the game has one or two shortcomings it is a great game, you start to play it and suddenly... Oups? Four hours gone? Really? Darn... It is a lot of fun to try becoming better during the game, even if that sometimes means that your faved officer suddenly goes AWOL... and seeing them getting better and better with destructions also is a nice... and cute notion... Bombs away.Is there a reason not to like this game? Yes, maybe, you can get quite into grinding when trying to get the optimum gear and sometimes a Level One Blaster *** or a Extra Power Level One *** is far better than a Level Ten without a star. So you have to take care what upgrades go to which character... and it's quite a good way to play the game with two to four reserve teams. "

												I really wanted to like this game more. I love sci-fi, and I love base building. This game fails on too many fronts. - ""Exploration"" The mechanic of sending your teams out to constantly♥♥♥♥♥♥ pillage and plunder every planet reminds me of the move Full Metal Jacket. I wanted to see exotic Planet BLAH BLAH... the crown jewel of Southeast Arm of Galaxy Tiddlywinks. I wanted to meet interesting and stimulating people of an ancient culture... and kill them. I wanted to be the first kid on my block to get a confirmed kill!I've gotten to level 12 planets and all of the away missions are these pedantic kill squad missions. You have a diplomat, science officer, and engineer on your away team, but your ONLY MISSION IS KILLSQUADS. Just lemme take all Marines, that's all we do. To make matters worse, the combat is so horrifically basic, all you do is click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click, your people won't defend themselves even. Then you sometimes can't see enemys obscured by trees, and your wishing you had an app that left clicked for you. Exploration and combat are utter rubbish.- Diplomacy is at least a little unique and interesting. You take your officers and place them in positions of power on a solar system's capitol planet, cool right? Except now the only thing you are is a mechanism for exploiting the natural resources of the planets. That's it. There's no diplomacy, you're basically a lobbyist. I feel like I'm in Avatar, I go in, kill the indiginous population, and secure my natural resources. There's no other function for diplomats.- Basebuilding is like the key of the game right? That's what you're in this for. You build a base..... to become a Mall of America. Your sole goal is to build a base that caters to the whims of the consumers who come and go, as you♥♥♥♥♥♥planets as a wonton hedonist. You need that bug pizza? No problem, lemme just ensure I've killed everything on this planet over here, ok check, now let's install an officer to ensure I get all the bugs from this planet.. Yep.. Ok, Supply line secured - you get your bug pizza. Base upkeep is a CHORE. The stations don't have a 'build XX minimum'  - so you have build YY total, or build infinity. When you are building 120 different items, having to consantly queue up crap is loathsome and pedantic. THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS. I ended up rage quitting after a while, because I got so sick of having to tell my people to keep the ♥♥♥♥ing ice cream maker filled. It's like an intergalactic mcdonalds staffed by level 10 officers who have no maturity at all.Good things? Graphics are pretty good, I enjoyed the ""not Prison Architecht or Rimworld"" style meeples. It's has it's own graphic identity and I appreciate that. The music and sound effects are equally nice. Otherwise this thing is rage material.			"

												To me, The Spatials is a good alternative to Spacebase DF-9.I really enjoyed building my base in The Spatials, receiving visitors and meeting different kind of ""races"" with specific needs. The game can be repetitive but it always gives back good rewards (new buildings, rooms, products, planets, missions...). I had a great time playing it and i think i will play it again from time to time.			"

												Awesome game ! One of the rare games I didn't wait for a -80% sale and definitely worth buying !This is even better than I thought. The construction possibilties are very rich, the gameplay is simple (all can be made by clicking), the design is so nice, combat mechanics are unique, great humor all along the game.The thing I think make the game far better than the other one in the genre is the interface.All is accessible at the same time : you will be able to see your crew fighting on planets, and to switch to your base if you want : there is no loading screen during the whole game !

												The presentation of The Spatials is well excecuted (decent design, kwirky humour, variety of items and upgrades), but progressing through station and crew upgrades involves fairly repetitive tasks without much risk or challenge.The Spatials can be fun to click around on for a couple hours until you learn how all the crew/station options and menus work, but then you'll realize that it's just more of the same thing as your crews gain experience and the space station expands. The core concept of The Spatials reminds me of the casual upgrade games you can find for free online, so if you happen to love clicking through those no-brainers, then you'll like what this game has to offer. But if you're looking for a challenging resource management game with some combat and sci-fi nostalgia throw in, then I'd suggest checking out X-Com: UFO Defense.			"

												The music and art style are great, and I've been craving base building games, but I just don't find The Spatials fun.The only difficulty in this game is figuring out the rules for how to optimize base building and combat. The rules aren't complicated, they're just not explained well through the tutorial or interface. Once you've got them figured out, the rest of the game is just grinding.The grinding is really obvious too - enemies are just ""Pirate (lvl 10)"", weapons are ""Phaser (lvl 10)"", the buildings & activities have different names, but it's obvious that each level is just an improved version of the previous level. There's no complex supply chain, nor any high level unlockables that make the game interesting again. Optimizing your base feels more like a chore than anything - if you try to make neat, isolated rooms, you're wasting 50% of your space and you won't make much profit. You're better off smushing everything together, and filling all the gaps with statues of a bald guy, because decor helps, but it doesn't matter which decor you use.			"

												I'm addicted to The Spatials. This game has elements of some of my favorite classic sim and rpg games. Visually it reminds me of Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, but in space and theres no rides. Start off colonizing an asteroid, and build a station to sustain your crew. Explore nearby planets to obtain resources and credits. After completing the planets mission, use credits to unlock the planets resource nodes to import goods to your station after a time period. Hire new crew members and employ them at the solar system's embassy to reduce the time period it takes to extract resources from the planets in the system. Once you get supplies rolling in start building for guests to visit the station and spend credits, and expand accordingly. Explore the galaxy and unlock alien races to visit your space station, play through missions and discover your enemy. Visitors will be satisfied if they can fulfill their cravings before leaving the station.It can be very easy to get ahead of yourself in this game, and if you're not careful you can unlock the expansion nodes too early before you have set up incoming resources and will constantly trying to keep products in stock and guests satisfied. I advise new players to unlock the research nodes as your crew members or visitors need them. You can unlock the next level by beating the first planet in the solar system, but skipping planets will limit your production. Also planets have difficulty levels, and clearing a higher difficulty will increase the resources a planet produces per period, so there is replayability even after completing the first levels.There are two ways to level your crew in the game, by defeating enemies on planets with your away team, or sending crew members out on contracts for experience, resources or items. The contract system is great for hiring new crew and levelling them up to be ambassadors for a solar system's embassy. A strategy I recommend to start is hiring low level crew members as workers, and choose specific ones to level with contracts. As a crew member's level raises, so does their cravings and needs, which take away from production time and takes longer to get in a good mood. Higher level crew members will consume more advanced products which could be sold to guests instead, but also have production bonuses so you will have to balance your worker's levels with your available resources. Also item drops will increase your away crew's power, so equipping higher level items makes a lower level away team stronger.9/10 I recommend this game to anyone who loves theme park style games and space exploration rpgs. It has a fun and colorful art style. There is room for it to grow, so far I don't think the camera angle can be rotated to see the station from different directons but otherwise its a great start from new devs, thanks guys! I'm hooked.			"

												I love this game. When it feels repetative, just try to get into the storyline and it'll liven it up.This is the best simulation managment game on steam in my opinion. It has so much to do and requires you to dabble in all of it for sucess, but you can choose what to focus on.The gameplay can be slow on older systems, but still useable/playable. Tutorial is not all inclusive and honestly there are still a ton of little details that I'm not sure what exactly the benefit/do, but you can infer a decent amount of it. (TUTORIAL AND LACK OF INFORMATION ON WHAT EACH THING DOES IS BIGGEST COMPLAINT, that said, I didn't find that it made the game less enjoyable.Graphics are simple and fun, a call back to 90's sims games. Enjoyable and clean.Feel:Silly, and more interactive than just a casual time management game. It is slow at first, and then a manageable pace following, getting speedier as time goes.Suggestion: Play out the beggining a few times so you can figure out how to do some basic things, then start a new game with the intention of playing it out. Create a space for you space team and lock if off from visitors, and create a visitor space and lock it off from your team, it'll help them to both get easier acces to what they need to fulfill cravings/needs.NOTE: Spatials galactoly comes out July 7th it's going to be in beta, but it looks good and is a revamp of this game. Nevertheless this game is a blast and I totally recommend it to casual gamers, management games, and those who just like quirky little sci fi spoofs. "

												This is really an ultra simplistic game with very simple game mechanics.  I am not even sure if it is possible to loose, maybe you can if you go AFK during a mission or something, and even if you did, it seem that there are no penlties at all for 'dying' other than starting a mission over again.  The missions are also almost indentical in nature so it gets repeitive very quickly.In short, this is a boring game and not worth your money, let alone time.			"

												This game is such a gem! It combines strategy, simulation and action. It's basically Dwarf Fortress/ Gnomoria/ PrisonArchitect combined with Civilization and any kind of group fighting game. If you like games such as XCOM Enemy Unknown this will suit you perfectly. It has beautiful graphics, nice short tutorial and smart with humor storytelling. The basic idea is that you make a space base, manage production (e.g. cleaning robots, pizza), explore other planets for resources and quests, train your army and  unlock new rooms/features through a tech tree. There are 5 classes and they all come with a variety of skills and weapons that you find gradually. Finally your army levels up and develops personality traits (wants etc). Could this be my best Steam discovery? Very likely.			"

												This is essentually an interstellar truck-stop simulator. I would describe it as X-Com lite. It has similiar mechanics from Gnomoria, The Sims, and Diner Dash style gameplay. Pros:+Fun little builder that could potentially be a huge time-sink+UI is pretty well done+Fair level of complexity (i.e. from tourist mood-state to leveling up to battle-equipping soldiers)Meh:=Music is decent=Artwork is ok (for some reason it makes me think of a phone game, but thats ok)Cons:-Fighting reminds me of a seriuosly dumbed down X-Com game - there is little strategy and it all amounts to a series of clicks (go here, click here, now go here)-I personally hate that all the planets are completely flat - once again gives me ideas of a phone gameOverall, I think this is worth it if you can get past some of the shortcomings. Lets get one thing straight though - this is certainly a casual game. Nothing seems that difficult.			"

Posted: June 26, 2015
												Well I find this game overall fairly good, but it got some issues. Lets start with the first, crew management, you end up having to perpetually getting new officers from new embassies as you go along and drop out your old crew mostly to staff said embassies, because quite frankly otherwise you won't be able to get your crew up to level, soon enough my old crew were inferior to new crews that were half the level because those crew at half level had better skills than the old ones, this part I find disappointing because any officers you have most likely are going to turn useless which mean investing in them too much is a waste, however if you don't invest in your crew they'll be too low level soon enough to properly run their missions at one point, heck to some level you'll have to level some crew just to feed them to the embassies too, since the crew you do get from embassies are inevitably much lower leveled than the embassies that you recruit them from.The next issue is with resource management, starting level 11 your crew will need goods that require resources that might very well not be available, not only that but starting around the systems of the same level we start dealing with Lemurians that also require similar goods at times. I had one planet with Nitrogen in a level 10 system... than the next one in a system level 14. That mean that I didn't have enough Nitrogen to craft sufficient amount of goods for not only my crew but also my visitors, which mean I got double screwed, I tried to rush to get to the system with more Nitrogen, but when I tried to do so I had to face the issue that my crew wasn't strong enough to pull out the missions, so on one hand I need those resources quickly, on the other my crew can't stand it, I would need to get them both trained AND properly skilled, but that take time, but my crew is slowly getting dissatisified by my lack of goods that require Nitrogen, so I don't have time, so I am more or less stuck between two annoying issues that are squeezing on me, and I can't do miracles. At this point the odds for these resources to pop in from 10 onward should be FAR greater than it is right now, otherwise basically the game become too hard to progress through.I get that some games like FTL to be based on luck, usually those are 'rogue-like' games, but this one isn't a 'rogue-like' type game, its a 'builder' type game that it be so much possibly based on the luck of the draw and waste many hours of work is foolish, also luck mess with another element which is foolish, the skills, the stats on the skill levels are random, which mean a level 1 skill can be better than a level 5 skill for example, at some point I can accept some... range... on the stats, but that fact that the skill level basically mean virtually nothing however is ridiculous. The stats of the skills should be growing in layers, and when you reach the next level the stats than can't turn worse than a previous level skills, otherwise its ridiculous, sending crews on high level contracts that earn skills only for those skills to turn out worse than some much lower level skills you already have is a waste of both time and money. I mean their is the stars... I could accept that a level 1 skill with 1 star got the stats equal to a starless level 2, and a 2 star level 1 could equal a starless level 3, and so on, but it goes far beyond that in range of stats.I can accept the place of luck to some level in such game, but if whatever you can win or lose the entire game become based on it rather than player skills than the game effectively become a coin toss... and that isn't a fun game at all.Still, the question of whatever I would recommend the game or not, is... ambiguous... the results of my first game aren't all positive, the next one could be better... the fact I have to restart from scratch probably to get the good run is an annoyance considering it means I'd have wasted alot of time already, not because of lack of skills, I was doing good beyond the crew & resource issues. But even all things considered, this game has alot going for it, otherwise, I like the whole building and managing, the fact you have to manage both your crew and your visitors is interesting too, managing resources and crew isn't a bad thing, I mean its better than merely employing tons of mindless drones like in the 'theme park' games, I like that, but if it becomes too tedious its an issue.Now I think I would still recommend this game, even with my complaints its still pretty good, it got issues, but those could be resolved in updates to 'balance' things out, than it would be golden, I'd get it for sale however since for now considering its issues I'd consider it worth a few dollars less than its currently is sold for, but if the game is going to be heavily luck based like FTL, than its not worth more than FTL, at least with FTL you don't have several hours of work put into it before you are faced with a point in the game where you lose because of bad luck.

												TL;DR I love the management, simulation, RPG, RTS style of this game.This is the game that I thought Spacebase DF-9 was going to be. It's way more in depth and almost has the Dwarf Fortress feel I've been looking for. I played 6 hours on the first night I got it, so that says a lot. There's a bit of a learning curve and it has these different modes that the game forces you to play: base-building, RTS, RPG, and management. To advance building your base, you need to venture out into space in search of other planets to get the resources you need. You can then assign three officers per solar system to produce resouces at those solar systems quicker so that you don't need to constantly keep going out to space. Eventually you will have to level up your officers to get the next level of resouces to fulfill the needs of higher level officers (it's all relative). The item level also isn't dependent on the level of each officer, which is good, but you have to have officers at a high enough level to get them in the first place.Honestly, this game has a lot of depth, and tafter 6 hours of playing I still feel like I'm only 1/4 of the way to end game (maybe?) and I there's a lot of replayability, unless you don't like the grind and repetiveness. The replayability comes from the randomly generated solar systems, resources and base-building. It's sort of a mix between Starbound, Rim World, Prison Architect, Spacebase, and Prison Architect.

												Wow watta game!- This game is addictive as crack cocaine. It's pretty insane!- The graphics are good when on station but simple. On missions, the graphics are nintendo 8 bit like! And it still add to its charm!- The gameplay is where it's at. You can build your station on your asteroid to live in with your spatials and satisfy their needs or their morale go down and they won't go on missions so you won't progress further. You station also serve as a tourist attraction/layover who are going to spend money at your station if you have the items that they need to be happy.- You cand o missions each coming with 3 difficulties with your 5 spacials to get mor cash, more skills to improve your spatials and special unique items for your station. You also unlock planets that will produce raw materials for you which you need to build everything in your station.- You will spend hours designing your base only to rip it off and redesign it even better later on. Trust me on this!- Sound is pretty good but eventually the music started to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so i turned it off.- Very simple game to learn. Controls are easy too, but it's a lot more difficult to master.- The 'Normal' difficulty is a bit easy. You are better off customizing the game difficulty to add increasing pay scale for your spatials as they level up and other tougher more challenging options. At normal, the cash just rolls in too much, especially when you spend time in the 2 star difficulties missions.Yes buy this game!			"

												i had really hoped to love this game, but came away pretty disappointed.i love ""base"" layout and planning games like this (evil genius dungeon keeper) but found that there wasn't much to this game.my main problem with the game is there is no real incentive to progress your station, or your resources.  everything you ""unlock"" is basically the same exact thing as the thing you just had, so the base gameplay you will experience pretty much in full at the first solar system.away missions are a neat mechanic in idea, but are ultimately really boring and tedious.  they are procedurally generated form a seemingly tiny pool of options... most every single mission is ""kill all the things""  which gets really really boring quick as combat is basically hold down L mouse button and hit hotkeys for bland abilities periodically.in the end i played this game for a couple days, progressed about half way into the galaxies, and just got bored and didn't want to come back.  i didn't really want to expand my base, explore the system, or complete the tech tree... which is saying a lot coming form someone who LOVES this ""base building"" type game.  i rate evil genius as my favorite alltime game if that says anything, and this game just left so many empty feelings inside me... i don't know, the game should be ALL about the base, and it should make or break you and your team... and there just isn't anything like that here... bases are just money-generating and officer pleasing zones... i found myself not really ""planning"" layouts or logistics for rooms... after a while i just was plopping♥♥♥♥♥♥around just to have it... and that's not a good thing for a base building game.  however i really hope the developers get something out of this game, cuz the genre is my favorite and would love to see more games come out for it.TLDR:  disappointing, boring and tedious base builder that disappoints the hardest of hardcore base building genre fans.

Before I knew it, six hours had passed and it was 1:30am.This game is a really interesting mix of elements, like a cross between Xcom and Dwarf Fortress.  There's roster management, loot and leveling, resource management, base decoration, production management, all tied up with non-distracting visuals that nevertheless reward you as you unlock new items for your base and your officers.Thumbs up!

												Imagine if DF-9 and Cosmonautica had a baby and it was tutored by Dwarf Fortress.You build a base for two groups:  Tourists who will visit your base and give you credits in exchange for goods and services; and officers who build the base, staff it to produce those goods and services, and go on away missions to unlock more planets/systems to get more resources to unlock more goods and services to make more tourists and officers happy.As officers complete missions they level up and their needs change.  At first they just need to have a place to sleep, then eat, then drink, then hygiene etc.  Higher level officers give better bonuses but are harder to keep happy.  Unhappy officers leave.Combat is very casual.  Death is not an issue.  Failing is not an issue.  This game does not appear to have a fail condition.  And I almost did not recommend because of that.But it is fun.I enjoy the sounds of laser fire as I smash yet another pirate raid.  The visuals are pleasant to look at.  It is rewarding to watch your officers grow as you groom them for their future jobs, be it leading the away team, governing a solar system, or forcing poor Jerry to be a fry cook for the rest of his life.  The choice is yours.Pro:MusicSound EffectsGraphicsIs actually fun if you enjoy management sims/base buildingCon:No fail conditions, but that also means you are not at the mercy of idiotic AI you cannot control.

												A cross between Startopia and Sims 2 Open for Business with a tiny splash of XCom, The Spatials is a fun little sim. While I will be critical below, that is just to fully brief new players on what to expect. I have no regrets with purchase and will continue to play.+colorful+fun+casual+Longevity (you are not going to finish it in a day or two. Tech tree takes a while to climb.)-A little grindy-Cannot customize any names of anything. People, rooms, planets, etc. -Confusing construction system. Things become available to build LONG before you have the materials to build them. How do you build advanced soap? Nitrogen needed? Where's that?! Prepare to wait a LOOONG time. (Nitrogen is found on more advanced planets WAY later in the game or rarely from recycling stuff).-How do you hire people? It's very not clear (diplomat planets fyi). Lots of 'not clear' going on.-Base construction at first is pretty cool, but later the constraints are annoying. Hallways mandatory. Can only build certain machines in certain rooms. etc. Nobody uses the tables & chairs you put around.Update 4/8/2015: Just finished the main part of the game in just under 40 hours. Fun the whole time! Will continue to play a little for the station management aspect of the game.			"

												Lot's of fun. To me it seems to combine building, resource management, and dungeon crawling into one neat package. Biggest gripe is the missions get a bit repetitive after a while, as a side the combat movement takes a while to get used to and could do with some improvement (selecting individual units auto-retaliate option when enemies engage etc) . Well worth the price, stop reading and get it now.			"

												Strangly addicting from the very beginning.  The controls are very obvious and easy to get the hang of, although I had some trouble getting used to combat.I did a first impressions video and went through the tutorial, and plan to keep recording it in the future.  I'm really enjoying it so far!

												This game is a real tease. I jumped on it when it had a release discount.The game promises to be a tycoon-like game you've been waiting for for years. At least like I have! Right off the bat, it seems quite promising. The graphics are decent, there's a tad of humor and the soundtrack is surprisingly nice, if not a bit limited. At first it's a bit hard to get a grasp on everything, but eventually things become clear. You'll discovered that this game is rather shallow. It feels neither challenging nor particularly rewarding. I've spent about 7 hours on it now, and don't feel particularly compelled to keep playing.It's a game that holds promise, but the reality is, sadly, a lack-luster game. It's not exactly an Early Access game, but I think it could use some updates to improve things. Even so, the price tag was pretty fair when I got it. You can get some hours worth out of it. I find it hard to actually recommend at this time though.			"

												This games scratches the space management sim itch for a little while but grows old quickly.There is quite a lot to do in the game unfortunately there is not much depth to anything in it. From building, research, away missions and officer management all repeat the same types of formulas pretty much from the get go. Granted I have not played through the whole game but it's hard to when I have done the same things I was doing from the first 10 minutes of the game over and over with what seems to be almost no risk whatsoever. If there was a chance for failure based on making a poor layout for the base or sending the wrong officers on a mission or even making poor research decisions leading to financial ruin or needs not being met those 10 minutes might become interesting. Unfortunately there is not and this lack of challenge and depth quickly becomes noticeable. I hope they continue to update and work on the game because it does have promise, however without a bit more challenge or depth I am afraid that even the paltry $10 for this game waste of money that lead to a waste of time.

												I'd like to set the record straight. If you're looking for Dwarf Fortress IN SPAAAACE, this is not it. I've heard a common complaint is that there's really no threat in this game. Indeed, your biggest threat is officers threatening to quit if you don't fulfill their needs. Other than that, no one tries to invade your station, and, really, even off-station combat is fairly inconsequential even if the whole squad is wiped out.What this is is more akin to Sim Theme Park. Your goal isn't survival. It's the year 5781, survival is easy. Your goal is to build a thriving, booming business based on attracting visitors and tourists and selling them stuff. The challenge is in making your little corner of space as massive, flashy, and successful as it can be, instead of a rinky-dink little asteroid focused on efficiency.It is a fun game, and mostly well-done, barring some poor sound design and strange interface graphical choices, but you have to go in with the right expectations. Go into this expecting danger and tense thrills and you'll be disappointed. Expect a game about effectively making a cruise ship based off an asteroid, and you're in the right place!			"

												I wont thumb this game down, because its not a bad game. But its kind of a meh game. You run the same missions over an over with a different backdrop and you have to keep training up other officers so you can actually get materials quickly. The building process is kind of lame. They start you on a funky shaped asteroid which gives you limited building area, and then the items you put into the small area need to be strategically placed for bonuses. Your station ends up being not aesthetically pleasing at all. You end up having to build different Rooms that do the same function because you cant place upgraded items into the lower quality rooms.Anyway I know this game has a lot of good reviews and ill be giving it a thumbs up to increase its % because its not bad. but beware its not that great. For the 10 price tag, if you are a big fan of simulators give it a shot. because its a simulator you should get your moneys worth just based on the time you spend playing it. But over all it gets a big meh from me. 4/10 elbows to pointy would not bang.Edit: Also The A.I. on this game is very frustrating. Visitors have needs that need to be met but they always take care of the most needed stat first. ok sounds correct right? Well say a visitor has needs of sleep and hygene, both stats are at 0. He will go and sleep in a bed, and not the nice bed that heals 20 sleep the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ starter bed that heals 10 sleep. then instead of sleeping again right away since hes already at the bed. He goes and takes a shower because his hygene is now lower than his sleep. So you better hope the two or 3 or 5 (later in the game) needs are all real close to each other because the visitor only stays on the station for a set amount of time.Also when building items , your crew builds random as ♥♥♥♥. they dont build the most needed item they randomly walk up to machines and start building. You can fix this by making production stop on an item but then you have to remember to turn it back on before you run out. There really needs to be  a min/max stock option on the machines and when you hit your minimum it auto turns on. and when you hit the maximum you want to build the machine turns off.			"

												A good Sim-Tycoon type game with some unique mechanics, unfortunately the additions are a mixed bag.The spatials puts you in charge of developing a new human space station to expand and explore the neighboring systems. To do this, you need to put together a team to send on away missions to local planets; Success allows you to buy access to local resources, unlock tech, and progress to new systems. There's nothing wrong with the game, it just feels like most of the game mechanics are just slightly off. They either don't quite go far enough, or seem to be more complicated then necessary. An example of this is the resource collection. Once you complete an away mission you can buy resource nodes on that planet, which deliver raw crafting mats to the station for you to use. The system is complicated by the fact that you need to devote officers to the system in order to speed up harvesting, and that you can repeat a planet at harder difficulties to get more resources. While playing I never felt that this added anything to the game, it just prolonged the grind required to get some resource chains up and running.Another example is the crafting system. You put down rooms and stations for your officers to create new consumables for your visitors to buy. You need to queue up the number of each item you want to create at the crafting section, but volumes fluctuate so rapidly it's rarely useful to set anything but 'build infinite' at each station. It feels like they were setting up a system that allowed you to 'keep x items in inventory', but it was never finished or too complicated to work properly. As a result you either need to over recruit to keep all crafting going or micromanage, which is almost impossible because the station operates while on away missions.There may be systems in place that handle my grievances but the tutorials are terrible. They're not much more then a text overlay and they only cover the most basic systems in the game. You will have to figure a lot out for yourself.If you're willing to put up with some rough sections, the Spatials is a pretty decent game. The mechanics are solid, and there's enough progression to keep you going for quite awhile. I recommend it, just have an idea what you're getting into before buying.			"

												This is a great game. At first I was not sure if I would like this game or not but after playing for nearly 2 hours so far I can say it is truly addictive. It is a fun combo of RTS and SIM. You have to balance your resources in order to keep your visitors happy and in return gain a profit to expand. The exploration part is actually well done and easy yet sometimes challenging. Overall this is a great game. 10 out 10 would explore again.			"

												This is such a lovely little game!The best part about this game is how it cleverly combines several different genres. You build a base for your crew, but also for aliens that come to visit you. Then you have to meet the needs of both your crew and the aliens. They crave all kinds if different products you have to craft from resources you gather. Finally there is the action part; take your crew on away-missions to distant planets where you'll find plenty of pirates, robots and aliens to blow up!The caveat of course is that because the game combines so many different elements it doesn't excell in any of them. Nor does it bring any revolutionary new gameplay. But is that really necessary? All the elements in the game work, and more importantly they work well together. My only real critisicm of this game is that I found it to be rather easy to beat.Still, for the price I can only recommend this game. I've had many hours of fun with it. If it ever goes on sale, this is a total no-brainer; buy it!			"

												This is, without a doubt,  a great little game. It's got a lovely premise and theme, and the gameplay mix between game modes (strategy and tactics) is very well balanced.I can't recommend it, though. Its tutorial and help system is not nearly sufficient for the gameplay present. You kind of get thrown into a game and given a few tips, and you're left to figure out stuff on your own. In these days of quest markers and other player-catering behaviour, this 90's throwback to how you treat your player - an obsessive mathematics-inclined nerd - is not how to make games anymore. Don't buy it unless you're willing to put some time into learning what it's all about.That said, I eagerly look forward to Weird and Wry's next title, and I hope they either figure out the magic of approaching players and UI design, or hire a designer to guide their methods. The Spatials has touches of genius within it, and at the same time, a voice that suggests neither brother was willing to take the spotlight and argue for the audience's experience or take responsibility for the title.

Also, a space pirate told me I was privileged so I shot him, 10/10 Game of the year! Would kill again.			"

												I'm no fan of space-games. I really avoid them normally but I've seen the let's play from different Youtubers and I must say I love this game! The style is just too cute, I can rename my ""main"" crew after me and my friends (Only missing that you could change the look to fit, that would be cool). It's a really nice game, I'm not through yet but I love it. It's easy to understand, has some funny puns and dialogs and lots of pirates you can ""eliminate"". It does have a Star Trek feeling to it (which I just love) with the colored uniforms and the exploring between all the fighting missions and sentences like ""set your phasers to HURT!"" xDSo, yeah... watch a lets play if you want to get a better idea of what this game is, or if you want to know if it is for you. Like I said, I'm not a fan of space games, this is just my small exception to love secretly and prove the rule ;)			"

												After roughly two hours of game time I can confidently say this is a game worthy of your time and money.I'm a total sucker for management games and this one hits that sweet spot PERFECTLY. Not only is it an amazing Space Station Builder, which I think there should be WAY more of, I love them, Spacebase DF-9 included, but this is also quite an adventure/action game as well. With most management games like Prison Architect and Theme Hospital, I'm perfectly happy with the typical ""Build a thing, then make sure it doesn't explode physically, financially, and any other way for it to go wrong"" model. Which, is exactly what this game is. What makes it special is that it ADDS so much to that model. The biggest thing being missions that you can control while your Space Station sits idle. (It doesn't have to but I'll get to that)  It becomes sort of a point-and-click squad based shooter. Which are absolutely amazing. It's like being inside of a classic Star Trek episode.It is a little hard to acquire resources early on, but once you start to get Tourists in, it becomes sort of a breeze, without getting boring.If you have a little money to spend, give this game the love it deserves.

												More reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.comThe Spatials is yet another game that came out of nowhere for me and what a nice surprise it is. I’m fairly big fan of the city-building sim genre (except for The Sims for reasons I won’t go into now) and Weird and Wry decided to put the genre in space. (It may have been done before, but this is a first for myself.) With a bit of a nostalgic Star Trek look and a bit more complication in the genre than I’ve played, The Spatials has taken a lot of my time lately and I’ll gladly give it more.So you start with just an air-lock and you build out from there. You can build a lot of different facilities that one would expect like sleeping and storage areas, but once you get a little further in you can build bars with dance floors (which the humans aren’t too fond of weirdly enough) and sell fancy drinks. I had to do a lot of extra work to get the ingredients to be able to make the drinks, but what are you going to do. I also haven’t got to build a Duty Free shop, but I’m on my way. With as many airports as I’ve been in during my life… I kind of need one in my space port or it just won’t feel finished. *Insert end-game goal here!**EDIT* In the middle of writing this I realized that I have actually built the Duty Free shop so the new goal is the build the second version of it and a freaking Holoarea because it’s a Holode… Holoarea and that’s awesome! That does bring up a few things that weren’t the clearest in the tutorial. Granted, some of the issues I had could have been solved by… you know… reading, but that’s neither here nor there. Sometimes you’ll do a tutorial and just assume that you can handle the rest of it. Well it turns out, I’m not capable of handling The Spatials without reading the in-game notes (go figure). It is good to know ahead of time, for those of you who haven’t picked it up, that you can build facilities that create items that use materials you can’t get for a while. It is easy enough to unlock more solar systems, but the difficulty goes up as well.Moving on from there you build the places where food and/or goods get created and then you also have to create a place for your people and the visitors to your space station to purchase or consume the goods. That means if you make a kitchen to make a pizza, you’ll also need a cafeteria where you can sit down and enjoy it (or procure it and enjoy it in this instance). It makes sense, but it’s a nice and small touch that adds a little complexity. I really enjoyed figuring it out and the process of making the space station work efficiently. To really get it, you’ll want to have a little bit of everything crafted just in case someone comes in and is craving pizza or yogurt or a cold one for those who like their drinks shaken, but not stirred (if you’re over 21 of course). You’ve got to be prepared.If you want to be completely prepared you’ll have to work for it. While you can expand and conquer more planets, that won’t really help you get enough supplies to be able to create everything fast enough to be able to keep all of your people and visitors clean and satisfied. After beating a mission on a planet, you should go back and beat the harder difficulty setting to double-up on the supplies you get from the planet. (The “WTF” difficulty in later levels are not very nice at all.) Also, remember to hire more people so you can have people to staff the so that you can get your supplies faster as well. It’s a delicate balance between hiring too many, making the right products and having just enough for everyone. The nice part is that it’s not really frustrating to do this, it’s actually quite fun. I’m not completely sure how Weird & Wry managed this, but they did a great job.Last thing, because I see people complaining about this, there is a little complexity to this game. Not a lot. It’s not overly difficult if you’ve got the capacities to read and remember things. While you may be maintaining your space station and making everyone happy by supplying the proper goods DON’T FORGOT YOUR AWAY TEAM! People complaining about how “you can’t raise their happiness levels back up in time to keep them from leaving” aren’t being very observant. When you’re out on missions you get hungry running around blasting fools and picking things up. Not to mention how dirty you must get. You need to give your people time to get cleaned up or yeh, they will leave. Wouldn’t you? All work and no soap or food make these Spatials look for another port were their fun-meter can be filled properly. (You know… like my station when the bar will actually serves drinks…)Score: Tasty!If you couldn’t tell by all the gushing I’ve been doing during this review… I like The Spatials. Like I’ve mentioned before on Facebook and Twitter, if you’ve liked other city/base-building sims, you should buy The Spatials. With all the building options and intricacies there are to be had and rearranging your base that needs to be done so it’s not ugly, there’s a lot to do here. That and the missions are very entertaining and often quite humorous. The game is well done and a lot of fun. It’s nice to have a game that will give you a good smile along the way.			"

												MUST PLAY!  This is a really fun space colony game where you explore other planets on little quests, exploring that planet and gathering resources strewn about the map and killing various enemies and receiving a reward for doing it.  Completing the mission lets you harvest resources periodically from that planet.  Meanwhile, you can also send your officers on quests of their own that take time (5m for example) to complete - higher level officers are required to be ambassadors to the galaxies so you have a lowered time on harvesting resources you've unlocked.  The base is built SLOWLY.  It will be a while before you can allow visitors in my experience, because you have to meet their needs.  My first base I built a bunch of stuff and everyone got ticked because I didn't have the stuff they wanted, especially food.  Concentrate on getting resources and officers in the beginning before building a lot of amenities, or even unlocking them in the tech tree.  Some products you need resources for you won't get until you're in the 15th galaxy area, and likely beyond but I've just made it that far, so unlocking extras in the tech tree aren't very beneficial for a while.  Its a very in depth, yet light weight game it never feels like you're grinding.  There's a lot to do, spread out between different tasks and all giving a relaxing feeling.  A lot of upgrades in weapons and abilities for your officers, special decorations and such to find on planets.  The cool part about the planets and missions is they all look different.  There's a lot of graphic content and neat environments to explore.  Absolutely recommend buying this game.			"

												I find The Spatials fun! It does take some pacing to get the hang of the game and it sorta punishes you for going ahead too fast and not taking over a group of planets, then going onto the next. You'll want to sit back and make sure each planets resources are claimed so that you get them after 3-12 minutes.   You will also want to recruit officers to man those embassies to make sure the resources come in as often as possible (every 3 minutes.). At that point if money is tough, then repeat some missions or sit back and let visitors into your base, and keep them happy. If you dash ahead you'll research things your resources can't cover and with higher experience you'll get higher levelled officers who's needs are not being met. Pacing!   This is a wonderful game, I would have liked to see upset officers staying and just not working at full capacity instead of leaving the base. It's a more gentle nudge to slow down.			"

												This game has some major flaws, but it delivers on everything it promises.  Building the station is fun, combat is fun.  Managing resources is fun.  I basically didn't stop playing this from the day I started.  However the game needs some serious rebalencing:It encourages you to walk away from your computer, leaving the game running to pay for all the things you need since there is no reprecussions for not managing your station other than you don't develop as fast.  Combat has the right idea but movement is clunky at times and near the end the only stratagy to fight hard monsters on WTF mode is to kite them like a hunter in WoW.  For 5 mins at a time.  Not hard to do, but boring.Getting ambassadors later on is tedious and expensive.  The system that levels your non-main party is expenive and slow and relies on taking advantage of leaving the game running for many hours at a time as it doesn't appear to be possible to make money fast enough to keep up with your advancement.Some special powers are not ever useful.  As kiting is the only method of beating higher ranked bosses, close range weapons just don't do anything.  Scientist only should ever use one ability.  Diplomats can only use two abilities without being gimped.  That sounds like a lot of complaints (And I have more) but despite all that the game is super addicting and well worth the cost.			"

												There's too much unnecessary micro-management in this game. I'm not against micro-management but i also don't want to fiddle with the uninteresting skills of my unimportant crew everytime. Also what kind of a space explorer, alien figting engineer comes back to the station and prepares icecream for the visitors? I thought this game could be the successor of ""pizza syndicate"" with a space theme but I was wrong. If you want a simulation game and pizzas, go play pizza syndicate.			"

												An extremely fun little game, a light kit-bash of mutliple gernes. Full of goofyness, jokes and sci-fi puns (Star Trek, Star Wars, Space Oddysey, etc.), it is a welcome break from all the tripple A games we got showered over the past 6 months. I love games that do not take themselves seriously. I love games that just let you fool around with them till you feel like it, and then just save and quit, without the feel of being bound to them and forget your real life till you finish it a few times over.As usual in my guides, let's take a look at the good and the bad.The GOOD:1. Pleasant, isometric 3D graphics - very nice and colorful, with plenty of goofy looking guys and animals.2. Kit-bash of genres - I can list base-building, resource management, exploration, RPG, and I am sure you will find plenty more in this game.3. Relaxing gameplay - while you can still lose, you can still enjoy every aspect of the game to its fullest without biting your nails like it is an Ironman Impossible XCOM run. This is a game that allows you to lay back and relax in your chair and click your way to victory.4. Great replayability - all the systems in the game are randomly generated, making you adapt to the start that you are given.5. A plethora of varying maps - exploration missions take place on a huge variety of pretty maps with varying flora, fauna, climate and enemies.6. Very decent tech tree for a game of this calibre - unlocking new technologies allows you to build more rooms and further expand your starbase.7. Progress in every aspect of the game - whether it's gear or base expansion, you always feel like adding more stuff to the pot, learning more about the game and seeing more prettier things show up.8. Pew-pew-pew lasers - come on, who doesn't like shooting lasers?9. Your starbase never gets attacked - you can sit and relax and play for fun. Like fun FUN. Not the ""I beat the game, whew"" fun.10. Multicolored Spatials - strategists, scientists, engies, diplomats and doctors all have a different color. Cute - and a small Star Trek throwback.11. Character progression - whether you send your guys on away missions or on tasks (AI controlled missions with % chance of success), they always progress and you won't have anyone lagging behind.12. Progression is meaningful - leveling your guys actually matters. You need leveled guys as ambassadors on conquered systems. No more slave labor!13. You dont lose Spatials - when they get knocked out, they go in stasis and can reappear after a while or through a skill, allowing you to relax and play. 14. Wonderful music to fit the whole Sci-fi theme.The BAD:1. Exploration missions are a pure rinse and repeat - go kill this guy, go kill another guy, then some more guys, maybe a facility or something inbetween. While there is some variation in the system unlock missions, everything else is painfully average.2. Your space base never gets attacked - it could be a turn off for some players, even if I find it a good thing to promote casual gameplay.3. You don't lose characters - if a character goes down to 0 health, it immediately goes in stasis, and then reappears on the battlefield after some time, or through a skill. While it promotes casual gameplay, there is no tension and worry about losing someone like it exists in games of the sort of XCOM and This War of Mine.4. The huge amount of point and click could be a turn off for some gamers. You can literally do everything with the left and right mouse buttons. Even only the left one.The CONCLUSION:If you want a casual game that doesn't take itself seriously, with goofy stuff, pretty graphics, lots of great gameplay and very decent replayability, this game is for you.

												Spatials is a fun sim / builder / management game where you build a space station and visit planets to gather resources.+Lots of space to build on.  Lots of resources and recipes.  Simple mechanics are easy to pick up.-Away team missions can be repetitive.  UI could use some work in different areas: 1. Hard to see the visitor's status when there are 20+ visitors on the station.  2. Once a planet mission is completed on normal, the planet is marked as completed although there are hard and wtf difficulty missions left to do.  3. The embassies in the systems do not have an indicator showing if they are staffed or not until you click them.I thought Spatials was a great game, lots of fun for sim fans.  Might be a little too simple / shallow / casual for hardcore sim seekers.			"

												As someone else mentioned, there is very little to the game once you get down to it.Base building is essentially for feeding your officers, so they can go on a planet mission, there are about 5 planet missions in total, repeated constantly through each solar system and thats it, you just do the same thing over and over again.Granted you get upgrades that drop during the mission so you can go on the harder missions but in the end its 5 or so missions and a feeding station for your officers.If you want something to mess around with for a few hours until your bored I say go for it, but after a few hours I have no real desire to continue the click fest missions I have already completed 20 times pervious.

												Horrible UI. It's way too large and unintuitive, and the grid lines  are overlayed mid-air, so it's very hard to distinguish where you're actually building something. As far as I know there's no way to rotate the view, only move left/right/up/down.The combat is boring, repetitive and easy. The only challenge to the base side of things is dealing with the occasional lack of supplies you need for something, and keeping your people happy (very Sim-like).Overall a boring game that feels very much like a lazy port from mobile.

												A bit boring. Feels like a facebook game. There is no real challenge, and no depth to the gameplay. Meaningless progression - just research techonlogies that unlock buildings which allow you to resarch more technologies, which unlock more buildings. I can see how someone might like that but it isnt for me.Issues that the developers might like to have a look at:- No clear tutorial (currently you have to click stuff to get a tutorial for that specific thing, it would be nice to have a tutorial mission or similar to go over everything)- Buttons are unclear (they are all picture icons that aren't necessarily representative of what they do, it would be nice to have text when you hover over them)- Isometric grid is confusing since you build on the ground but your structures appear higher up, which gets confusing in isometric view because buildings seem to appear in a different position than where you placed them- Boring missions. A story or similar to offer some kind of progression would be nice "

												Don't buy this game if you are unwilling to work hard to figure out how to play.

And you can't ALT-TAB out of this game so the typical google alt play doesn't work.  And like most crappy tutorials, the tutorial gives you the obvious stuff but nothing important to figuring out how to play.  I can't offer a full review.  I gave up.			"

												The game is fine, there are no game breaking bugs as far as I know. What prevents it from being a great game is the somewhat simplified point and click combat. In this game, one must have plenty of 'resources' to develop one's space base.  Getting these 'resources' requires one to first liberate a planet, and then purchase 'rights' to those 'resources'. Basically the player has a whole lot of liberating to do (the game provides numerous planets to liberate) if he/she plans to have a decent space base. I am totally fine with that, but with the simplified combat, the game-play becomes a bit too average.			"

												Disclaimer of sorts: I'm in the habit of making a note at the top of my Steam reviews when I received the game from the developer for review. This isn't really one of those times. I was sent the game to review, but not on Steam; I liked it enough to buy it immediately upon finishing my play session for review. That doesn't happen often, for what it's worth.That out of the way... it's a space base builder mixed with some light dungeon crawling under a Star Trek-ish theme. Both parts are necessary; your officers need the base to support their needs, but you need to explore and effectively conquer planets for their resources to support the base and the people running it. Everything is tied together by the officers and it feels just right.My full review is on  IndieGames.com [indiegames.com] "

												The first playthrough is very entertaining and will glue you to the screen if you like this sort of game. Both aspects of the game (building and questing) are entertaining and well thought out. Though the missions are really just five guys running after your cursor and shooting things, they still managed to make it not boring somehow. Every character has a role and if someone gets killed your entire team will feel crippled and be much less effective for the rest of the mission.Everything seems reasonably complete which is a lot more than you can say about a bunch of other indie titles, and the dev page still has a list of interesting features they want to add. The game has stellar ambiance. Some of the best music and ambiant track I came across. I sometimes found myself just staring at the screen, watching the little guys run around my station and listening to the sounds of space.After a while the game becomes a bit too easy as you secure enough of the basic raw materials and are making profits like crazy. The main hurdle I think isn't really the profit, but making the visitors leave satisfied with your station. As I was playing through I was constantly looking at the happiness meters for the different species trying to figure out what to build where to make this or that alien more satisfied with my services. Really the only problem is that the shooting part gets way too difficult after a while where even your most experienced crew can berely kill the level bosses, often just by running away and sniping, whereas the management gets too easy as profits keep mounting up. I don't know if the devs are planning rebalancing, but I think the later stages of the game could use some.All in all this is a very nice addition to your librarly if you are into management with a twist.

												I am really just getting started in the game, but so far I like it and would say it is a good deal for its price.The game is essentially what you would get if Diablo and Theme Hospital had a baby.  Or if you want more modern examples, Diablo 3 and Prison Architect.  It isnt a better click-killer than the Diablo games, or a better building planner that Theme Hospital, but it does take the basics of both and mesh them into a solid and fun whole.			"

												I've enjoyed the game so far. It's a slow paced builder with simple economy and fairly repetitive missions. Yet I rather enjoy romping around with an away team and watching people visit my station. The ability to reaccomplish missions and the contract system makes it fairly easy to level a new crew up in your current ones get disgruntled enough to leave. Not for someone looking for a fast paced game.			"

												Very easy going space base building sim. A lot of games in this genre tend to be quick paced and action oriented, but in this game, you get to work on your base without fear from enemy attacks. A great game if you need a game where you can sit back and relax as you build a diverse entertainment venues for your base. They also have a little squad based RPG system integrated in the game too, if you become bored of the base building part and want to explore some distant planet, star-trek style.			"

												The Spatials reminds me a bit of Farmville in terms of animation. Don't be mistaken though, unlike Farmville this game is actually good! :P I did a breif introduction video to cover some of the basics of your first time in the game. If you're still skeptical, give it a watch! :)

												The Spatials is a very well-balanced game, in my personal opinion. The only one place that I've found it to be unbalanced is in the way that it has very little risk and very high reward. Your space base is never attacked or raided so you are free to build without worrying about getting destroyed or having your HOURS of hard work wrecked by a random event. Combat takes place on away missions where you are in direct control of your crew.The graphics are nice and friendly and the game runs well even on my older and outdated laptop. I turned off the music because I wanted to play my own, but for the short amount of time I had it on it was enjoyable.I got this game at a discount, but even at full price it is still very much worth it. Not too stressful. Not too boring. Just right.			"

												AWESOME game, I wasn't expecting anything good by the trailer, but I saw game play, and then, said, I'll try it, It took me by complete surprise, it reminded me of classic little game that you would give hundreds of hours before you realize it.  It's just great, do yourself  favor, and watch game play, not the trailer. I give this 9/10, just MORE to get 10/10.			"

												This is the best game I've bought this year.I purchased it on an impulse buy and I'm glad I did. I would pay a lot more for this game, had I known it was going to be this much fun.At first glance, it's a simple game. Once takes a group of Officers on an Away-Team mission, conquers a planet by completing a quest, then gets the resources of that planet to use in building their base, crafting goods and services for visiting humans and aliens to purchase and use, working their way up a Tech tree to get access to even more goods and services.But, it's not really just that simple. One has to acquire the gear for their Officers, level up their Officers, hire more Officers to work shifts and to take on missions while other Officers rest and have a little bit of R&R, satisfying their own needs for food, drink, fun and a bit of rest.The decisions ones makes, not only during the mission, but when giving weapons and augments to Officers or choosing the properly outfitted Officers for the mission are critical to their success. Combat isn't just point-and-click, but many times I've found myself having to kite angry robot bosses around a map or manuever my team into a good position to get the drop on a bunch of pirates.Since I bought the game, I've been playing non-stop, for the most part, only pausing long enough to grab some sleep. And, that's not something I normally do with any game, even the great ones. This game is ""special."" It's got that ""certain something"" that demands that I keep coming back to it. Whether it's the constant incentive to journey to the next system or the allure of dropped loot and leveling Officers, or even building the next expansion for the space-station and watching the money roll in as aliens plink away at pinball machines or have a go on the dance floor... Whatever it is, this game has ""it."" It's fun, it's addicting, it's a great game that doesn't take itself too seriously, but still manages to provide a great experience.If you like tactical-rpg, building, crafting, Startopia meets Space Cplony meets Action RPG games, you'll want to buy this game, right now... I'd buy it again.			"

												If you mixed The Sims, RolerCoaster Tycoon, and Diablo I together you would have The Spatials. It is a fun game to play and not feel preassured to make any split second life or death twitch moves. So sit back sip your coffee and enjoy playing.			"

												A simple, fun and intuitive space station simulator. The game is light hearted, simple to learn but deep enough to keep you engage in the ever evolving space station. For the price, this is really a good deal.You get to explore various planets, kill random Aliens and bring back the goodies home to keep your space station supplied. There's a few things that could use some tweaking but generally speaking, it is a rather well executed game. "

												Decent game with lots to do. Some things bother me(mostly combat) but there is a lot to manage that it should be enjoyable for a good 10-20 hours.6/10			"

												Simple, fun and cheap.It is worth the money and share a lot with Tycoon games and has a real time tactical system that makes it have some action. However acquiring new gear for your soldiers can be tedious at times and it lacks a weapon/Gear crafting option, if it had that it would definatly be better.			"
