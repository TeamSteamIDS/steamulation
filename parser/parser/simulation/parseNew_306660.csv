												A pleasant surprise in a sea of mediocrity!As a games industry veteran myself I have to say - this is one of the best executed strategy projects, ever. The simplicity of controls the fluidity of the battles, the flexibility of the AI and simple yet very appealing visuals make it a must for any armchair general. Some stability issues from time to time are forgiven and forgotten due to dedicated and relentless support by the developers. This is how it should be done!			"

												A wonderful and intelligent little tactical RTS. I say 'little' because the core game is the Battle for Gettysburg (of course) drawn out over 5 or 6 different scenarios. But, this is an indie game, and a great one at that, and if this doesn't sound like much, the devil is in the details. Content-wise, UG:G is quality over quantity. This may annoy some people, but for those that appreciate variation on a theme, the game offers a lot of replayability and it's clear that the developers have done as much as they can to offer as much replayability as possible within the constraints of the game. Firstly, you can play as either the Union or Confederates. Secondly, you can choose 9 or so different enemy AI types which all change the decision making process for the enemy on the field. Lastly, your actions and achievements in each scenario affect the way the game plays out, allowing you to choose from a number of concurrent scenarios that change depending on whether or not you managed to fulfill the goals of the mission before. Multiply all these options together, and for the price you get a decent amount of gameplay.The control scheme is ingenious and the method with which you relay orders to your units allows for a great deal of finesse and control on the battlefield. Instead of clicking on each point you want your units to walk in a straight line to, you draw the path you want them to take, and the units follow said path. You can flank, withdraw, shift focus, push forward, and more all with one smooth swipe of the mouse, and it allows for a great deal of tactical control without you having to monitor every individual step the units take. I've seen some complaints about orders not working or unit AI performing incorrectly, but I've never had any such experience. The topography of the map is fantastic - Gettysburg is accurately represented, and the cover-rating for your units changes dynamically as they move from open grass, to forest, to hedges, to homesteads. This cover rating is essential to survival (as in real life), and it all makes sense - when you move into an area that you think should give you cover, it does, and vice versa. You'll find the enemy responds to your attempts to flank them, and you'll want to watch you don't overextend yourself, or the enemy will exploit your failures. Your frontline will ebb and flow as the balance of power changes in particular areas, and you're rewarded realistically for pressing your advantages, and punished with a stalemate, or worse, if you fail to take the opportunities you get.I feel that this game would have benefitted from covering a larger part of the civil war, and one criticism I could level at it is that it's indeed constrained by its focus on one single battle. In saying that, I only want more because it's so enjoyable, and I think that in focussing their attention, the development team have managed to perfect their game mechanics, which makes for a much more solid and refined product, so perhaps it's not really a criticism after all? The other point I'd make is that whilst the mechanics that are in place all work well and feel very fresh, there isn't a whole lot of tactical depth in terms of the commands you can issue to the units. Your command extends as far as telling them where to go, who to attack, when to charge, and when to stop. While this all works well and provides a fun experience, there isn't a lot of variation amongst the commands, that again might have led to the game feeling fuller. But, all that said, I don't feel shortchanged, only like I want to play more and more and more. I haven't played multiplayer as of yet, so I'm dying to try the game out against a human opponent. UG:G is one of the most innovative and entertaining tactical RTS games I've ever played, and I highly recommend it to any strategy fan.			"

												Sid Meier is the Willy Wonka of PC game designers. And he's turned us all into gluttonous brats named Augustus Gloop. His games all exude a simple charm that has the tendency to steal hours from a person's life and become evidence ""exhibit A"" in about every other divorce court in the country. None of his games are exempt, from his Railroad Tycoon games to his maddeningly ""just one more turn"" addictive Civilization games. I remember playing his Sid Meier's Gettysburg! in 1998 and thinking it was the best civil war strategy game to ever grace the PC. I stumbled upon my old Gettysburg! disk the other day, but unfortunately, the game has aged terribly. Father Time has watered down and diluted Meier's twinkling charm. Oh, Father Time, you great and terrible killjoy!Enter Ultimate General:Gettysburg. Created by a modder named Darth who specializes in Creative Assembly's venerable Total War series, Darth has pretty much recrafted Sid's wonderful software toy and fashioned it into a trip down memory lane, only better! The graphics are updated, the AI is a force to be reckoned with, and the game even has its own ambient flare, reverse zoom and you see the fancy wooden trim of the dining room table you are in fact playing a living board game on. Covering the Battle of Gettysburg in its four day entirety, the game bleeds history, and branches of alternate history depending upon the decisions you make regarding your generals. The gameplay mechanics are not quite grognard level, but they're well beyond Facebook Farmville antics. Mouse lassoing of units, and point and click movement orders, troop movements dictated by drag and drop strategy lines, it's all here. I loaded the game up just to check it out, and I spent a weekend playing through the whole campaign on both sides. It's not often a game gets its hooks in me like that, but I love when it does. It's these times I'm truly honored to be a PC gamer. The cartoonlike artstyle of the board, and the soldiers which are actually sprites, (and do admittedly leave a longing for the ability to zoom down one more notch for a closer look) are crafted as lovingly as even the bold sinewy text of the location names. In another reference to the wonderful Roald Dahl, remember the sign in the school in Matilda's class that Ms. Trunchbull had erected, ""If you're having fun, then you're not learning!""? Well, this game proves that notion a simple fallacy because UGG not only proves that you can learn history by playing a computer game, but also that you can have a grandiose good time while doing so.

												If you like Total War but wish the AI was better, get this game. The graphics aren't great but honestly that isn't the focus of this game, it's about the dynamic AI that will make every fight turn out differently and actually provide a challenge. Multiplayer is coming along as well and the developer is providing regular feedback and updates. This is the start of a fantastic new competitor for the RTS genre.			"

								Fantastic! I played against an AI set to Dynamic and... wow. It was able to counter in proper and very efficient ways, making for one terrific battle (Or series of). Ultimate General has turned out to be more than I actually expected, after each fight you either win/draw/lose, and you are often given a choice of your next action, do you keep up the pressure and continue the battle? Hold your ground and wait for reinforcements? Even better yet, is that your troops and their stats are carried over from each stage. Adding a terrific sense of urgency at times.			"

Early Access Review
								Have you been a total war fan and just been absolutely dissapointed with the recent releases? The arcade-style battles and simplified gameplay experience? If so, you are in the same boat as me. Been watching the development of this game for some time and now that it's released all I have to say is good things about it. The combat is excellent, AI is smart, even on the lowest level.. The grandiose strategy of it will give the most experienced strategy gamer a challenge as you are commanding tens of thousands of troops. The complex morale system forces you to be wary of how your batallions are faring against the enemy forces. This adds a new level of strategic planning by having to sub in reserve batallions to support your exhausted and morale stricken ones. The only thing I'd like to see is a multiplayer feature. I feel this game would be excellent in a 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or even 4v4 gameplay mode considering how many troops you are in command of. It's almost overwhelming at times when it gets to the pinnacle of the battle. It would be a nice feature if each player commanded a corps of the army and joined in the battle at set time limits pertaining to historical accuracy.Thus, I rate it a 10/10 and hope to see further add ons and features. Support this indie game!!			"

												My first thoughts: ""Only one battle, this cant be any good?!?!"" It turned out to be a very rewarding game, and I loved the graphics, strategy and tactics! Casualties and the postitions that you capture carry over from your previous engagements, which made it all the more interesting for me. It had me sitting on the edge of my seat several times when a last ditch effort was made to capture or hold a crucial position. A must have for any armchair generals out there. :)			"

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg is an awesome game. For those who want an American Civil War (ACW) stratagy game, here it is. The game is centered around the battle of Gettysburg July 1-3(4) 1863. In the main mode (Main Menu-Start new battle) you can fight the battle of Gettysburg as the Union or Confederacy, and choose your opponent AI (9 types of AI: Adds a lot to replay value). The battle is fought in Scenarios, each one being triggered one after the other depending on what you accomplished in the last one you fought. There are more scenarios than I can count honestly. You keep fighting through scenario's untill you fully defeat the enemy, of you run out of time. You can also end up fighting battles on July 4, which is interesting because this never happend in history. All of the possible scenarios are playable in the ""Custom battle"" section of the main menu. Multiplayer is also fun to do, but there are not nearly as many scenario's as there are in single player, which can be good or bad, depending on your view point. But here is a list of pro's and con's.         Pros: Helpful and thorough tutorial videos.                  Combat is easy to learn and master.                  Brigades are historically numbered.                  Corps and Brigades have historical commanders (Archer,Pender,John Reynolds, Richard S. Ewell, Ect.)                  Artillery has been fixed with the hotfixes.                  Art. is ballanced so it isn't devestating with casualties, but does lots of morale damage.                  Good map design and elevation.                  TONS of replay value with harder AI and (probably) over 30 scenarios.                  Multiplayer-compatible                  No scenario is completley impossible.  CONS: All units look the same (Iron bridage doesn't wear black hats)                  No steam workshop                  Artillery can sometimes not fire even though they are looking over a field from a hill.                  The ""Texas brigade"", supposedly one of the best southern brigades, has terrible morale.                  Game can freeze (this issue is being dealt with by developers)                  Reinforcements will come earlier for the enemy than they will when you play as them.                  NOTE: I personally think that it would have been better to include more battles in this game, like Antietam, Second Manasas, Shiloh, ect. If not that, at least a map/battle editor so we could make those battles. A steam workshop would also be really nice. OVERALL: 9.5/10. Awesome game. Would definatly reccomend it for people if they asked. I wish these people would make more games like this, so here are some ideas. Ultimate General: Waterloo, Ultimate General: The American Civil War, Ultimate General: Napoleon (battles of Napoleonic era). And why stop there? The possibilities are endless.EDIT: +1.5 for the addition of Night battles and artillery limbering.			"

Early Access Review
								I am sorry to have to write this for a game with over 99% positive reviews but the truth must be told.  First off, I must acknowldege that this is a early access version of the game and so there is always hope that the game will improve, but for me there are significant short commings in the version that leave this version far short of what would make this a great Strategy game.  Having studied the strategy and tactics of real 19th century warefare I was hoping this game would be a good way to expereince and explore those tactics.  I recognize that no game, no matter how well written would be able to capture 100% the reality of that, but this game lacks all of those elements and for me fails on so many levels and makes the game unable to hold my interests.  The game does offer much as a strategy game and I do acknowledge the many good things about this game which the vast majority of reviewers have already pointed out, but I must provide a negative review in order to provide balance to others considering purchasing the game.  The game touts itself a a simulation of Gettysburg and as such I would expect it to use as much of the real commands and tactics as possible for a game, a goal that Sid Meier's Gettysburg better achieved, although that game had many short comings as well.  To make this an effective civil war startegy game I should be able to issue commands to units that real commanders would issue.  There is too much automation in the way the troops behave and act.  It seems that the only thing I can tell the troops is where to go.  I can not make a decision on how to form, single battle line, double  battle line, etc.  These were critical decisions a commander would make deciding where he needed strength (double line) and where he needed to guard the flanks (single line)  I might even want to order a unit to ""dig in""  I really only have once choice for forming my units and they are made for me,   If I have a brigade arriving to the rear, I might want to position them in a certain location to be ready to reinforce my line, but as soon as I do that they move from colomn formation to a line formation.  In fact, if I even order a unit to halt, they will move from column to battle line.  This denies me the tactical decision to leave a brigade in the faster moving column formation until I decide to move them into a battle line.  I can't order my calvary to mount or dismount,  Gamble's skirmishers remain skirmishers.  In reality, once the infantry arrived, I would order them to mount up and guard the flanks or scout the north or west, but  I can't do that again denying me important tactical decisions.  I can't order my artillary to limber up or un-limber and the artillary seems to move the same regardless taking away another important decision that can make or break a battle.     When I order a unit to ""Fall Back"" an experience unit would accept this to mean a slow withdrawl while fighting a delaying action an orderly process to tactically reposition the troops.  Instead it looks more like a retreat, even with high morale units.   All too often, units  are automatically moving to ""face the enemy"" again denying me the tactical decision to maintain my line unless I specifically remember to tell them to hold.  In reallity they should hold the line unless they are told to skirmish.  A unit in real life would never make a move like that.  This often creates units with their flanks in the air when my intentions was to have their flanks anchored by other units or natural obstacles.   It seems I have a whole army of Dan Sickles. Looking in the release notes I see there is work pending on group commands and obliques but not sure if these pending additions will significantly improve these limitations.   I also wished there was more granularity in the units as primarily I can only control at the brigade level.  It would be nice if I could issue orders at either the regimental or brigade level.  For civil war history buffs the role of regiments is of high interest and a good civil war game that fails to recognize the regiment falls short of satisfying a civil war enthusist.  Players should be able to control both the regimental and brigade level units.  For example, order a brigade to form a double battle line, but during the battle, order a specific regiment in that line to move to a single battle line at the end of the brigade to guard the flank.  I should be able to order a single regiment for form a skirmish line in front of the brigade or order the regiment at the end of the brigade to wheel right or left to avoid having my flank in the air.  While having division and corps commanders in the game adds historical interest and recognizes these hostoric figures I agree that the way the are implented in the game is correct.  Since these roles were more strategic and administative there is not need for tactical commands at the division or corps level.  I do look forward to the addition of divisional commander characters to add depth to the game.  But the lack of regimental/brigade level tactical commands is a big dissapointment.  Ideally, I should be able to issue commands to those units like a real commander would and they would react based on how experienced and well drilled they are.  For example. ordering a unit to form a double battle line might be done quickly and smartly for a well drilled and experienced unit but a little slower for a new unit.  To me it appears that the developers lack a deep understanding of civil war tactics and army procedures.  Even little things like the fact that I issue a ""run"" command instead of a ""double time"" command.  Nitpicking for sure and an easy fix, but perhaps a symptom of how far off this game is from being a true civil war strategy and tactics game.  So bottom line, a lot of hard work went into this game.  The map is beatiful and the game is playable as a basic, simple, strategy game, but as a game claiming to be a civil war strategy game, it lacks sufficient depth at this time to be a rich and satisfying game of civil war strategy and tactics.  In a toss up between this game and Sid Meir's Gettysburg, Sid would win.  While I hope there is substantial improvement between the early access and final release I can not recommend the game at this time.  However, at the early access price of only $9.99 it is worth a look by any strategy game fan and I hope that our early support and honest feedback will encourage the developers to improve on the game and help it to rise to the level of one of the best civil war strategy games ever. Good luck.			"

												With very simple 2D models and flat, weird map, this game creates the sence and feeling of real line battlefront and strategy, more than any of the Total War games. The replayability is outstanding. It will take you only around 100-150 minutes to finish the campaign (the battle of Gettysburg), but every time you approach it, the outcome is diffrent - everything change, based on your decisions, strategic points captured, and casualities. You may choose different scenarios, and enjoy something totally different. I highly recommend playing this game, especially if you enjoy the smell and sound of exploding gunpowder.			"

												4.7/10Graphics: 5 Story: -  Controls: 4 Gameplay: 5 Soundtrack: -  Atmosphere: 5Genre: RTSIf anyone out there ever played Sid Meier's Gettysburg and loved it then youre in for a treat with this game, as Ultimate General Gettysburg seems to be a clone of one of Sed Meier greatest games.With that said if you are not familire with Sid Meier's Gettysburg, the game is rudimetery RTS where you pick your side, North or South and are then given a set number of units to command over the three day Battle of Gettysburg. Your actions will determin unit size throughout the battle and eventully determine the entire outcome of the compaign.Outside the nastagia aspect, the game is pretty average. The graphics aren't 8-bit basic, but they aren't push your GPU to the limits awesome. The creaters seem to really just be shooting for a remake of the original SM's Gettysburg.There is no real story outside of you changing the outcome of the battel with how you play, and the soundtrack is almost nonexistance.However, this was the same with the original SM's Gettysburg so this really does not really detract from the game.What does however take from the game is its controls. Orders are given by selecting units and draging them to where you would like them just like any RTS. However in Ultimate General Gettysburg, this draws a movement line on the map as you drag it. If you mess up with your initial drag then correcting while still dragging will send your units marching in loopty loops across the  battle field while taking enemy fire. The only way to correct this is by selecting the unit again and dragging it again to reissue the command. This is minor aanoyence is magnified when you make this mistake with a whole group of units.With it's over simplisity and handful of flaws aside, Ultimate General Gettysburg was not a half bad game. Ultimate General Gettysburg may not be one for the Hardcore RTSer, but it is definatly something to be picked up for the casual gammer, or for the those of you wishing to relive your SM's Gettysburg glory days.

Basic InformationTitle:  Ultimate General: GettysburgDeveloper:  Game-LabsPublisher:  Game-LabsGenre:  Real Time StrategyGeneral ImpressionThis is not a strategy game for the faint of heart or those that don't consider pacience a virtue. Its brilliant AI, developed by none other than DarthMod himself, can adapt to both terrain conditions and the current state of its forces. Ultimate General: Gettysburg is just as challenging as all the AI mods created by Darth for the Total War series. The game features one of the most memorable battles of the US Civil War and it's as accurate as a bird's eye view of a battlefield can get. A raw and hard strategy game doesn't need eye candy to provide countless hours of fun to its players. Do not dismiss it simply on superficial grounds. Once you get the hang of it, defeating the AI is rewarding indeed.Strong Points+ Excellent AI that can really put up a fight.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- If only the graphical details could have been better...Rating 9/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg is one of the best American Civil War games out on the market now in my humble opinion. Pros:The map is extremely well done, with much attention to detail. Each unit has been created with precision and with close observance of historical facts.The game engine is remarkably well rounded.The AI is the most challenging AI in any real-time game I have ever played, and it does not cheat to be difficult. In other games like this *Cough*Total War*Chough* when one attempts to make the game more difficult, the computer simply gains ridiculous advantages over the human as the difficulty goes up, for instance, militia units who normally run at the first sign of the enemy, miraculously turn into the Cold Stream Guards in terms of resilience and fighting ability. In Ultimate General: Gettysburg, the computer gets no advantages, it simply out plays you. It notices weaknesses that you have not seen, it flanks, it charges, it hammers you with ungodly amounts of artillery. Simply put, this AI should be able to give any skill level player a run for their money. And the final Pro is that the game makers actually listen to the community. As someone who has had early access since the open beta, I can tell you that they have made many changes to the game based off of the testers comments. Cons:As of right now there is not a thriving multiplayer community, so most if not all of my games occur against the AI. Now, that should change as it has just been released to the Steam store so as more people buy it, it should be much easier to get a multiplayer matchup. You may encounter a rare glitch in the game where troops move the wrong way or you take losses without being fired upon, however, these are quite rare as most if not 99.99% of such glitches having been removed and fixed already. If it does happen, report it through the in-game bug reporter tool or on the forums and it will get fixed quickly. Overall: This is one outstanding game. Neither side is overpowered, both having their own advantages and disadvantages. This is a great game for any strategy lover!			"

												I initially loved this game.  It was a fun and simple Gettysburg simulator that allowed you to enjoy the carnage of the battle, instead of being caught up in micromanaging regiments and brigades.  However, after a period where I hadn't played in a while, I picked the game back up and noticed something was drastically different.In the previous version, you could tweak the AI on its difficulty, but generally the units were fairly well matched, the main determining factor of who won each engagement was terrain and morale.  When I picked the game back up, I noticed that even on the easiest possible AI selection, my troops were decimated by the opposing army.  I thought maybe this was a boost to one particular side (I was playing as the Confederates at the time), but when I switched to the Union, I suddenly was being slaughtered by the Confederates!  I would possess the high ground with a Brigade of over +1,500 strong and watch as a smaller brigade of 800 in the exposed valley below would massacre over 400 of my men with a single volley.  It changed this game from a fun experience into a frustrating beatdown where the AI had the advantage in every single scenario.  I went from being able to obliterate the Union on day one in the previous version, to suffering a draw with the AI on the lowest difficulty setting after taking thousands more casualties than they did.  The first day should be an easy victory for the Confederates, that was how the battle actually took place after reinforcements arrived.Why did you break the game, guys?  This was so much better before the patch, but now it's made it practically unplayable.			"

												Nick Thomadis, alias DARTH VADER, one of the most famous Total War modder, proves to the world that he has what it takes to make a full blown revolutionary video game.Not only revolutionary because of its historical era, which portrays one of the most important battle of the American Civil War, but because it has the best video game Artificial Intelligence of all time.Nothing comes even close, period.The only strategy game on the market where the multiplayer mode is not vital, because you can play alone against the machine forever without feeling you're missing something: every battle is unique, because the behaviour of the AI is extremely well done and provide near infinite replayability thanks to an objective-based branching scenarios on the battle of Gettysburg.To me, one of the only game which doesnt lie when it describes its features: what they wrote, what you read, is what you get.

												Is Steam going to remove this game due to its depiction of the historically accurate Confederate battle flag? People in this country are losing their minds blaming symbols and inanimate objects everytime something bad happens...I've decided to post a slightly more in-depth review now that the whole ""lets ban games because flags offend people"" nonesense has blown over. I will, however, keep the politically charged opening statement because, as you can see from certain comments about this review, it caused quite a frenzy among ignorant people.For anyone who is an RTS fan this game will be right up your ally. It is not a long game, but has far more replayability than just about any other RTS out there. It has deep strategy elements and surprisingly smart AI, especially for an indie game. The graphics are not mind blowing but they are well implemented. My lowest score is for the multiplayer, becuase I wish it was more than 1v1.Graphics:   7/10Sound:       8/10AI:             9/10Gameplay:  9/10Multiplayer: 6/10Stability:     10/10The game has little to no bugs and I have never experienced a crash. If you are a fan of hard but rewarding gameplay then get this game and support developers who stood up against ignorance!PS If you are easily offended or do not understand history then please go back to CS:GO or COD and save yourself the brain strain.

												Take the battles from Total War, strip the graphics down to their basics and compensate with better maps, throw in some elements from the 'choose your own adventure' genre when planning your strategy, and what you end up with is a short but brilliant game. Buy it before it gets banned for daring to include Confederate iconography in its correct historical context.			"

The GameA great game that demonstrates about the battles of Gettysburg, that allows we to change history, by altering strategies, and creating new opportunities. The game is played on real-time. There is no base building in this game, or unit building in this game, in this game you get new units/reinforcements as in history, thus this game have no unit building at all.The Mechanics of RTSWhat is quite different with regular RTS is that this game have few types of units : infantry, skirmishers, cavalry, and artillery. There is only few differences between Union and Confederates units, the Confederates are better at charging, where the Union are better at shooting. This game use ""truesight"", which the shooting range of a unit is defined by whether it can see its enemies or not, and unit on elevated/higher position can shot farther than units at lower position. Also, hills and terrain contours play a lot of effect in this game, as ridges and hills could afford a defensible place to shot down, and units could also take cover behind the hills from pounding artillery or from other units. Aside from elevation, terrain also play a key, units located on wooded terrain will be protected better from enemy fire.Units fight by firing each other, and get to melee/hand-to-hand combat. Because of the similarities of unit statistics, the important thing is not the units itself, but how the player positions the units. Some units do have ""veteran"" status, like the Union Iron Brigade, but the most important thing is where you place the unit.Pros This game have no political correctness. This game properly displays the Confederate flag as it is, as in history and as in facts that has happened and can't be changed again.  Allows change the tide of history. This game is separated into few battles : the first day, the second day, etc. If the Union didn't manage to slow the Confederates advance to Seminary Hill on day one (which they did in history) the Union position on the next battle will be more pressed towards Culp's Hill. If Union manages to counter-attack and capture McPherson Ridge, the Confederates will lose a strategic hill to position their artillery on the next battle. After each battle, you are given a choice on what to do. As a Union who has successfuly delay the Confederates, do you wish to counter-attack and try to regain McPherson Ridge? Or counter-attack to the North East? Or fortify your position with ""fish-hook"" position on Cemetery Hill? So much option. UI is good. The UI clearly show how your units is doing, and what type of units that is. Though the UI could gain improvement by giving out small details on what is cover or what is this thing or that thing. Quite accurate historically. The brigades, division, and corps name are named as they did in history. The name of places also accurate enough, complete with elevation, contour, terrain, etc.Graphic is great. I really love the ""arrow"" you made when you order your units to move somewhere. The overall ""drawing"" really appeals to me.Cons This game have no clear tutorial. The tutorial are only bunch of videos which are not clear enough. You can't deploy your units according to your will. After each battle, though you can choose your strategy, you can't place your units by yourself. If your Cutler Brigade is somewhere east, they begin the battle in the east, though you prefer them to be in the west.Lack of content. This is a minor gripe. After playing and replaying the game for some time, I get bored and wishes for more battles.  This game is very recommended for RTS players, most notably people who are interested in American Civil War and gunpowder era.			"

												Chances are, you’ve never played a real-time strategy game with a narrow focus on the Battle of Gettysburg during the Civil War. Sid Meier’s Gettysburg! in 1997 was in my mind last good game to center itself around this battle, and many would consider it the “gold standard” in wargaming during the Civil War, but it’s been far too long since that game. Nick Thomadis, creator of the DarthMod for the Total War series is taking his shot at the major historical battle as Game Labs, by recreating Gettysburg with interesting freedom of choice with Ultimate General: Gettysburg.Gettysburg, Pennsylvania is where the South’s advances to invade the North were stopped. The Confederate Army had suffered substantial losses, as did The Union. The grand total of losses between both sides made it the most casualties recorded in all of American history. The strategies involved from both sides made great use of the terrain, manpower, and efficiency. With only three achievements, it is clear the focus of the game is not about performing specific feats or reaching arbitrary goals, it’s all about strategy.Ultimate General: Gettysburg is historically lenient, allowing you to play both sides and potentially emerge the victor even if historically they did not record The Confederates as winning. But the game allows for this to happen should you do enough to use your army of larger numbers to great effect. What if Cemetery Hill couldn’t be defended and was overran? What if on the third day the Confederates were not repulsed, and the battle continued into a fourth and final day? The game explores these “what if” scenarios to great detail and, feels natural. Even if you go wildly outside the textbooks, the game manages to be fun, tense, and completely engaging from beginning to end.There are only tutorial videos to show you the basics, as there isn’t anything in-game to transition you into the game, proper. Thanks to Ultimate General: Gettysburg‘s clean UI, and there’s no base building, tech trees, or even producing units. It sounds simplified, but it’s anything but. The game’s difficulty is dictated by nine personality traits that will serve as the difficulty of the game. This gives you a customization of how you want the opposition to think and react to your decisions. For instance, you can set the difficulty to “easy”, but also make the opposition aggressive. You’ll be often charged and attacked frequently, but they are easy to repel. So there’s a balance and a sense of being overcome, but if you’re not that good of a strategist, you may normally lose. Here it gives just the right amount of challenge.The controls are simple enough, simply click on a unit and drag towards where you want them to go. An arrow will be painting on the screen to show you where they are headed, and will remain on screen till they arrive at their destination. The only downside I didn’t like to this method was sometimes it seems to work against you if you try to loop back. Like say you have an artillery unit and you want to make it turn once it is in place to face the enemy. I found trying to do a small turn will make it try to undo the path as the game thinks you are trying to erase the line. Otherwise the controls work well enough. There are buttons on the side to halt, fall back, or tell the troops to hold the position.The map is incredibly well recreated, most history fans should be pleased in that regard. little points on the map representing farms and such can be used as cover by your troops. Troops also have to reload, and get tired after marching a long distance. You’ll be at a disadvantage if you march your units halfway across the map and engaged with a foe that has been waiting for you. It also takes into account elevation regarding aim. You can use the M key to toggle very helpful elevation lines. I loved using the elevation lines to find the highest points to place my artillery to bombard the enemies.The graphics are fairly plain, however, with the units being simple (and somewhat tiny) sprites, though I do feel they suit the game. Once I got into it I wasn’t too concerned on how things looked. There was just too much going on. The game sounds great for what it is, occasionally hearing the Calvary charge playing or the sounds of the gunfire. After a battle the ground will be littered with little tiny corpses.Morale and condition come into effect, working in conjunction with one another. Simply having more units does not make for a decisive victory in an engagement. Your condition can be lessened by running too often or even walking too far. And being too far away from reinforcements can be costly. The artificial intelligence driving both sides are incredibly smart. Units will rout, withdrawing from the ensuing battle and will not let themselves succumb to being slaughtered. Retreating units cannot be selected. It’s laughable to see that in their minds, “all is lost” and they have to gather themselves before re-entering the battle.The real Battle of Gettysburg lasted three days. The way the game handles this, is by sundown the day is over. There’s a green timer that spans the day, and even dispatches units at the exact time of day they are believed to be sent. If a battle is delayed by charging or being engaged in some other manner, a red timer runs its course. Once fully expired, the tug-of-war battle is stopped. You then enter an intermission screen, appearing in a faux-war room to determine the next course of action. And it is here that you maintain historical accuracy, or choose to deviate and even prevent losses or turn the tide of battle quicker. And once the next day begins, depending on your choices, your units will be fresh and placed where they are supposed to be. In order to be successful, “Victory Points” are historically relevant and are essential to winning – a term that is used loosely when talking about Gettysburg.Each game is different every time you play, and makes replayability even on the one map feel completely different from one another. And being able to play both sides really adds depth, and a show of compassion to the North and South of the Civil War.Ultimate General: Gettysburg lives up to the name, making you feel as if you were actually a general, where important command decisions can be made, whether historically real or ficticious. This is a wargamer’s dreams realized. Even if Gettysburg isn’t your historical battle of choice, it is one you should not miss playing. Game Labs’ vision of Gettysburg a blueprint for the future of the Ultimate General series to succeed going forward, and presents the RTS genre with new and exciting ways to play that I enjoyed so thoroughly.

Early Access Review
								Good indie game. Have been looking for a civil war strategy game for a long time that is not a mod. It being an indie game is not bad. It reminds me of sids civil war game back in like 2000. Needs more work done definetly. It would be great to see the devs allow full control and placement of your troops like other rts games. Do definetly enjoy this game so far and hope it goes into further depth in unit control. Maybe a lil high priced for the restrictions of unit control. (update) I've put some more time into the game especially after the most current update and I have to say kudos!!! The game is really starting to feel rts now, given I am a person who prefers RTS over almost any other game, from the fist C&C to Startcraft, Warcraft, Shogun TW, Sid meier's civil war (look it up), all these titles I've enjoyed. Now this game is starting to feel like it should. One thing that would make the setting more right would be uniforms. For the union maybe add some regiments with red pants for custom battles but for the campaign definetly would be great to see a mix for rebel uniforms for we all know not all the rebs had decent military uniforms. That would be the next thing I would recommend on possibly doing. Great job Dev, this game I do recommend.			"

												This is a highly unique RTS in a way that I've never really experienced before. It's absolutely one of my favorites and I'll definitely be playing it for a long time. It's hard to describe, but it's a game about managing your territory vs your strength. Each 'game' is essentially a single long battle that is punctuated by short breaks, so unit statistics carry all the way through. Morale and Condition of your troops are only restored a little bit between phases of battle, so they're a precious resource. Because of this the whole game has a fascinating flow to it where you have directed the whole campaign, as it escalates gradually into a massive battle. Did I mention that the reinforcements you receive appear from off-map in real-time, as they did historically? Because that's another thing that propels the battle onwards. New units are your resources. It's like a book illustration of a battle come to life.It's ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. It's ♥♥♥♥ing perfect.It also has one of the most pleasant systems for unit control I've ever seen. You trace a path by holding down your cursor, and your units follow the path it leaves. It's so simple, and so effective it's stupid. It needs to become a thing.I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game 10/10 go ♥♥♥♥ing buy it right now			"

												Games based on the Battle of Gettysburg, Civil War (United States) in the past have had something missing, that left me, the player wanting for more.  Perhaps the best game on the Battle of Gettysburg, was Sid Meiers'; and it was great for it's day.  But technology has progressed much since then and for me at least, there was a desire to have a game based on the Battle of Gettysburg, using the latest programming techniques.  This game, Ultimate General: Gettysburg seems to take advantage of that.The game is easy to get into, with the AI controlling not only the opponent in single player, but your unattended units as well.  Commands, either by keyboard keys, or mouse clicks are easy to remember and not complicated at all.  Objectives are clearly presented before each battle, so there's an opportunity to plan your attack before entering the battle.  And with over 160 battles (Union and Conferderates combined, including the difficulty levels), there's plenty of ""play"" in this title, making if well worth the $15 (USD).What would make this title even more interesting is if the developer were to inclued a ""sandbox"" mode in SP, where one could create their own order of battles.  None the less, this title is versatile, and fun to play.			"

												Highly recommended. The AI is really good, and can be difficult to beat. The graphics are nice, but not as detailed as, say, Total War. for example, the soldiers are sprites, not polygons, so you cannot see much detail, and you cannot rotate the battlefield. Limited zoom too. However the scenario has lots of replay value, with a lot of different AI settings to chose from. Nice sound effects. The gameplay makes this worth buying, especially in the sale. If you like table-top style real time strategy games then give this a go.			"

												An absolutely incredible game, after years of waiting for a game similiar to Civil War Generals 2, Sid Meiers Gettysburg etc. The A.I is absolutely phenomenal, and even if you manage to conquer it you're ultimately looking at an entire new experience on the Multiplayer system.   Although people are often turned off by the 1 battle concept, there are 84 different possible ""Engagements"" depending on how you do, statistics for casualties are listed at the end of every battle which is always a plus. Something about turning a hill into a literal heap of human flesh after thousands of minnie balls have found their targets is also extremely satisfying xD.

												I am a terrible general !And for once a game is actually not afraid to show me how terrible i am.The game doesn't hold your hand, there's a short tutorial that mainly explains your keybinds and some commands you can give to your troops.Other than that, you'll have to find your own way.And i'm ok with that, because the game doesn't require you to memorize build orders, or min-max with statistics or whatever you can think of that usually involves RTstrategy.The way you play is all very straight forward.You have your troops, you have the briefing and you choose your course of action, usually involving either staying on defense or going for an attack.Once on the battlefield it's all up to how good of a strategist you are. You move your regiments in an elegant way, allowing you to make swinging flanking manuevers or try a blitz attacks on the center or create choke points that limits the enemy's movement or whatever crazy idea you can come up with.Due to the slower pace of the game, your mistakes won't be immediatly noticable. You might be running your regiments into a death trap and you'll only find out 5 mins later, when it's too late to still salvage the situation, or is it? If you're a genius, maybe you can still turn things in your favour (i have yet to find out :p).In terms of content the game is somewhat limited.You only get to fight gettysburg, but it is split up into multiple battles spanning 3 to 4 days, with a few battles per day. So one campaign usually involves around 10 battles, but it varies.While this is limited, it does have a lot of replayability. Your success or failure on the battlefield will affect the next battles, so not one campaign will have the same outcome.On top of that there are 9 AI settings which can give you a different kind of opponent to fight which in turn can affect the way your campaign goes.And offcourse you can fight with either the Union or the Confederates giving you 2 different campaigns.Anyway, i think i've typed more than enough already.If you're a strategy fan then this is a must buy.Maybe you will like it, maybe you wont, but at 12€ you can't really go wrong.Even if you don't really like the game, i'm sure as a strategy fan you will appreciate what these developers have created.I eagerly await to see which campaign will be featured in the next ultimate general game.

												I'm not usually inclined to review on games but it was the support that made me get this and I'd like to add my own to this pile.The AI makes this game. Rather than simply saying ""Easy, Normal or Hard"" The AI can be set to aggressive, passive, intelligent or bumbling and makes mistakes that feel so human. Defeat feels natural considering the battle enters ""phases"" of reformation. Playing with different styles makes it feel original without just giving the army unfair boons to make it more difficult. (I'm looking at you, Rome Total War 2.) The ebb and flow of battle really helps you understand how Gettysburg actually played out.Not convinced on buying this game yet? I'll run you through one of my scenarios. I'm running a pretty standard defensive set, sliding back, getting the high ground and letting the confederates smash their faces into my cannons. Feels good. On July 2nd I'm given an option to hold tight or extend the right flank to Benner's Hill. I'm winning pretty well on the right, so I go for it and win resoundingly. Reform the lines, and suddenly a confederate cavalry swings around and absolutely destroys my right. I overextended and bad, lost thousands and the retreat was sloppy. Had night not fallen I may have lost Cemetary Hill and the whole battle. For an hour and a half I blamed myself (not the game) and had to focus on getting beat, falling back, getting beat, falling back until we reformed completely. In the end it was a win for me but that battle lasted two more days because of my own mistake. It still felt great, but that isn't a feeling I've gotten from Rome Total War battles or Europa Universallis. Its always ""Well that guy is bigger. I'll wait until I'm bigger and then beat him."" Here, not so much. When do we get more games like this?!			"

												It's a fun game that has a lot of annoyances that add up fast. -Line of sight, while good in theory, is completely broken. At times I would have regiments have to walk to within 20-30 feet of enemy regiments on the same level in order for them to start firing (and of course the entire time that they're walking up, the enemy regiment is shooting them to bits).-Morale is broken for the campaign. I don't know why they wouldn't have your troops get a morale boost inbetween engagements. The amount of times I started a battle with troops already about to rout was ridiculous. And then of course your reinforcements come in and are all ready to rout as well. No reason morale shouldn't be at 50% minimum at the start of a new engagement as opposed to 10-15%, particularly if you've had nonstop victories before.-Speaking of routing troops, this game suffers a major Total War flaw in that when one of your regiments breaks, they don't always retreat back towards you. I've seen countless regiments of mine break and proceed to run straight into the enemy army and just get annihilated. I just had an engagement where one regiment broke at 850 men and then proceeded to run around in circles in an open field why enemy artillery just destroyed them until they were down to 250 men and stopped retreating for some reason.-Charging seems to be broken. I tried it twice and both times my regiment charging engaged the first enemy regiment and then just kept walking through the first regiment to try and fight the ones behind it all at the same time. Maybe it was just some weird glitch for me but I quit trying after I basically lost two separate 1,000 man regiments from them doing that.-For some reason, having my troops on an elevated position and firing downhill at an enemy regiment results in my men taking more casualties regularly (I recall at least four separate occasions where I had 1,000+ man regiments with high morale and only facing one enemy regiment had this happen to them). I'm not sure I understand that logic.-The amount of time in engagements is pretty short. You can't ever wait to setup your forces before attacking because you'll have no time to actually capture your objectives.-The fact that I did a campaign as the CSA and had three different maps where I captured both Round Top and Little Round Top is just stupid, no more explanation needed.-What constitutes a victory/defeat is pretty inexplicable. I'll have a map where I inflict more than 8,000 casualties on the enemy than my own casualties and capture all but one of the control points and have it say a draw. -It also seems that the casualties don't actually matter much from past engagements. The AI always has several thousand more troops than you every engagement, regardless of how many you killed the previous one.This game is fun for about an hour or two before you want to just break your computer after all of these things add up. It has a lot of good ideas that just weren't executed well. The fact that troops don't get a morale boost inbetween engagements is inexplicible, particularly when you go to the next day. Line of sight is broken for the most part. I know this seems completely negative and that's mainly because most of the top reviews already outline all the positives from the game so I don't feel like doing the same. Like I said, it's fun for an hour or two and I do enjoy it. There are just a lot of small things that seem like they could be easily fixed but aren't.			"

												The AI is absolutely ridiculous.  You can toggle their level of aggressiveness and intelligence, and then ""boost"" each of the 9 levels if you find them easy. It truly does make a difference.But this AI is damn sharp.  It feels like I'm playing multiplayer.  Except usually it is more challenging.  The AI has outmaneuvered me so many times that I really have to re-evaluate my entire life sometimes.I haven't even felt the need to hit multiplayer, because the AI is so lifelike and human.In the first five hours, I lost every single battle.Except one, which I'm pretty sure I lost but it told me I had a major victory somehow.I hate this game.But I can't stop playing.

												In no other game have I had to PLAN my retreat when things didnt go my way, and I've never had to fight a delayed action in any game but this, theres a depth of strategy here that I had to learn from scratch, a defenite challenge for everyone who loves Napolean or Empire total war.Don't expect to play moderate right away. Its intense, and the number of troops in the fray makes retiring dwindling regiments key to maintainging your front line. Knowing when you are losing ground is key, knowing when your enemy is losing ground and not baiting you is key, you'l have to pull out of bad situations but unlike other games you still have the time and manpower to turn things around if you fight hard and smart enough.People talk about depth but hardly know what it truly entails, the tactics you'l be able to use is limited only by your cunning, An excellent game!

												The pros: Beautiful board, and fairly addictive gameplay that's pretty easy to grasp. Bears repeated playing.The cons: The damage calculation is embarrassingly bad and slanted heavily in favor of the A/I. A single battery of 120 troops (6 cannons) is somehow capable of routing a brigade of 1,200+ men in a stand-up fight - as if that ever happened in the actual Civil War. A/I infantry brigades are virtually unbeatable head-to-head no matter the numerical superiority and can lose 90% of their men without routing. I've won the battle multiple times and NEVER lost less than the A/I. The artillery is also frustratingly hard to use effectively - sometimes they'll be unable target an enemy unit directly in front of them, despite no obstructions. It's also kind of weak the units go no smaller than the brigade level. On the whole it's a lesser version of Sid Meier's Gettysburg - better looking, but the engine is nowhere near as good.			"

												I can't quite understand how this game is so loved, perhaps the following for civil war era RTS games has carried it perhaps i've missed something while playing it. Forewarning this review is exclusively of my experiences with the single player, the multiplayer may have been fantastic, but i'll never know.I'll start of by saying I'm quite a fan of RTS games. But this game absolutely wastes its potential in my mind, through a bunch of frustrating issues, that for me obviously were deal breakers. The AI.The issue isn't so much the enemy AI, altough it completely does broken crap all the time, as your own unit's AI being absolutely frustrating. Please explain to me how a 1000 strong unit can't destroy an exposed enemy artillery unit, or as to why it doesn't take literal seconds.Attack commands don't work as you would expect. Move commands also don't work as expected.Enemy AI routing is stupid. I've encircled you with the entirety of my army. Spent the billion minutes it takes in game to take the long way round your army with a sizeable handful of troops and a few cannons. I've decidedly turned the battle into my favour. Not only have your men realised how screwed they are, but now you're men have fled, and quite rightly so. The day is mine. Watch them flee! Then take hardly any damage. AS THEY LITERALLY RUN THROUGH YOUR LINES! No matter they've fled the battlefield? Apart from they bloody didn't. They've gone a 100 meters past your line. Decided that they day isn't quite lost and turned around to now shoot your exposed back. In a wonderous example of turning the battle now into their favour. This is futher compounded as more and more troops ""rout"" en masse to this new superb position, taking less casualties than if they had been ordered too. To now decimate the men you've sent to encircle them.Routing a cannon unit means they rout with the cannon. Why? Because when fleeing the enemy the first thing you do is hook up you cannon, load up your equipment, and ride away into the game equivalent of a sunset (which as previously mentioned is most likely your exposed flank)Your cannon's will not hit anything. That 2000 strong infantry unit? Nope. Might as well ask them to hit the moon. They will however happily destroy the ground around them. Remember how decimating an accurate cannon shot was in total war? Well these are nothing like that.Flanking.Why bother? Attacking an infantry's flank in this game provides you with no discernible advantage. No massive drop in moral or men. They just fight on like they normally would and usually get the advantage of you having not fired on them while you took the effort to flank. Just don't.Graphics and UI.Quite fine. The units are more like sprites with their unit strength above. If you were expecting men individually rendered you'll be dissappointed. The topological map is a nice touch. However due to the camera angle it can be visually hard to judge whether you are sitting in a defilade or not.Illogical crap.Can't for the life of me work out how to target enemy generals. They just stand there around their dying men then retreat to their other soldiers like they're trotting through a rose garden.The Default controls are some of the worse I've ever seen. Why is everything a group move. WHY CAN'T I TARGET THAT UNIT? I CAN SEE IT. I JUST CAN'T CLICK ON IT. STOP TARGETING THE INFANTRYMEN TARGET THE CANNONS. I'm pretty sure if i was a real general i'd have shot whoever commands half these units. Some difficulty ordering a charge to ordering a ranged attack. I gave up trying in the end.Conclusion.For me this game is incredibly frustrating and unrewarding. However if you are quite a fan of battles that take place during civil war era, you might be willing to discover the nuances required to play around your men's ineptitudes.			"

												This is probably one of the best historic ACW realtime strategy games out there.  Anyone with any interest in the American Civil War will want to have a copy of this and it is well worth the 15 dollars being charged for the game.  The games does a very good job balancing historical accuracy with playability and the visual presentation is stunning.At its core, this is an American Civil War tactics game with the brigade being the primary building block.  The battle of Gettysburg is represented as a series of scenarios  which represent significant engagements fought by the 2 armies.  Each brigade is modeled historically in terms of size and performance based on how they did at Gettysburg historically and their reputation throughout the war.  Each scenario sees the player commanding 8-10 brigades on average with accompanying artillery modeled as seperate units that take 30 minutes to an hour to complete.The primary gameplay is derived from testing the player on executing and making decisions using ACW linear tactics and  trying to present to the player an idea of problems that require solving by Division, Corps and Army level commanders during the Battle of Gettysburg.  This includes selecting good terrain that affords units  good cover and holding elevated positions as well as forming a coherent battle line which is not easily enveloped by flanking manouvers.  Learning when to hold reserves, where to hold them and how to attack positions are simulated and the decisions asked of the player reflect reasonably on historical tactics from the time period.  Morale management is also a serious consideration as units which are sent in on their own against overwhelming odds will break very quickly and become useless to the player in battle.The highlights of the game include the saving of unit casualties and position during the campaign as you shift from scenario to scenario.  Poor performance and excessive casualties earlier in the battle may come back to haunt the player as a subsequent engagment may have the player using depleted and exhausted brigades in later maps in the scenario.  This emphasises the need to preserve troops under player control as asking the player to balance between a potentially more costly victory in the immediate scenario and risk having shattered and demoralized troops  in later scenarios.  In between each scenario, the player gets to make a strategic decision as to what the overall battle strategy should be employed which brings the player to the next scenario and map.  Completing a well executed campaign while minimizing casualties is very satisfying and there is great replayability in attempting to replicate historic decisions made by executing the battleplan better than your historical counter parts, or by ""what if scenarioes"" by selecting different strategies than the one actually taken historically (ie.  What if Euwell attacked Cemetary Hill on Day 1 instead of being cautious).  An overall order of battle listing at the end of each scenario gives the player easy to understand reports.Movement and control is both well executed and at times frustrating.  Moving units involves a simple system where you draw a movement path for each individual brigade you wish to move.  It is intuitive and easy to learn but the some more precise manouvers require you to either be able to visualise exactly how a brigade will form up out of march or require some tinkering to maximize use of cover which is very important to the game.Flaws in the game range from minor inconviences to omisions that should have been dealt with before release.  The most pressing problem is that this game is lacking on a good tutorial.  The one presently in the game is rather barebones and doesn't explain key concepts well to brand new players.  Those players with a background with ""battle simulators"" whether they be from the aracadish Total War series or the more rigid and historical offerings such as Civil War Generals 2 or the Close Combat series will adapt quickly as will anyone with a solid background in ACW or Napolenoic linear tactics.For those who are not well versed in historical tactics or are used to Command and Conquer / Starcraft style gameplay will be in for a shock and there have been frequent forum posts by such players not understanding core mechanics.  A good tutorial will go a long way to resolving the issue.Line of sight obstruction is another inconviences as the game does not relay easy to read information and lines of fire can be obstructed by things which are not always obvious.  A player set up a position he thinks is advantageous only to find his units do not have line of sight covering areas he expects to be covered as enemy troops come up.   Similarly, areas where the thinks he is obscured from line of sight may unexepectedly be open. Others may find historical inaccuracies jarring though in my opinion as a historic gamer, the developers have made a decent trade off between playability and historic representation.  For example there is a vocal player in Early Access that has continually stated that artillery is anachronistically to powerful.  I personally have not found it to be so and in most battles the game sims out, artillery casualties are well within line of the 8-10% casualties caused as accepted by most historians.Overall this is not a perfect product but it is a very enjoyable one and for 15 dollars, its is a steal.

												I really want to like this game. Planning movement is nice, the ebb and flow of assaulting and defending ridges, since heights block fire and vision. But things just dont work as they should. I've got the entire opposing army surrounded in a valley south of the town. They are tighly packed with no cover and firearm and artillery fire is raining down on them from all sides. It should be a slaughterhouse. and yet... casualties end up being about even. Doesnt make sense.The game - the engine - has great potential but as it stands now it is an exercise in frustration.			"

Posted: June 22, 2016
												Let me say upfront that I enjoy UG:G quite a bit.  I hadn't played a Civil War strategy game in many years, not since the classic American Civil War, published by iMagic (who, amazingly enough, are actually still around, unlike most of their contemporaries).  This game, though, was developed by the indie company Game-Labs.  If you want to know upfront if I'd recommend this game, the answer is yes, with just one caveat - although the tutorial is adequate, its still pretty basic, and the online guide is missing some things, as well.  So, if you really don't like having to work some things out on your own, or consult Steam guides, you might give it a pass.Now, for some more detailed Pros and Cons:PROS- Strong presentation.  There's not much music, but the opening/title screen theme is nice, and the sound effects in gameplay are realistic.  The portraits for the different generals, colonels, majors, etc. are all well-done, and aren't just lifts of old black-and-white photos.  The map is very nice, quite accurate and detailed.- The AI is very good, and comes with a lot of customization - there are nine, different AI settings, based on aggressiveness and difficulty, and you can mix and match to create your desired strength of opposition.  There is also a Boost AI setting that can be enabled, though I have yet to be brave enough for that.- You can tell that the designer is knowledgeable about both Civil War and Gettysburg history.  I just recently finished Gettysburg by Allen C. Guelzo, and UG:G gets almost everything correct.- Branching scnarios - let's say you're playing as the Union, and you manage to hold onto the northern ridges in town through the first day, instead of losing them to the Confederates as per history.  This will prompt the game to give you options for your next strategy - launch an attack on a Confederate position, or withdraw to the southern ridges.  If you choose to extend your right flank with an attack on the Confederates and succeed, this will then also lead to additional, non-historical scenarios.  This is also true for the other side, but I have only played as the Union forces so far.- Replay value - you would think that a single-battle game might not have much, but I've been through it several times now; partially to see if I can score a more decisive victory than was recorded in history, and partly because I haven't done as well as I would like to, and want to achieve better results.  The different, branching paths, plus the possibility of a Pyrrhic victory (winning the battle but losing too many troops) are strong motivators to play some more.CONS- Although the branching scenarios are great, sometimes they can be a bit perplexing.  For example, as the Union, I secured part of the map that historically had been lost on the first day of fighting.  While this did lead to the branching paths described above, the text briefings indicated that I'd had to reteat to Seminary ridge anyway.  While losing the ground outright does not result in an option to launch an attack to take it back, such that your strong performance still results in a change of sorts, it would be nice if all of the scenarios branched directly off the actual results.  Most do, but some don't.  I suspect this disconnect comes from trying to create alt-history divergences that still fit into the original scope of the battle.  It's not a huge problem, but it's somewhat disarming.- Some aspects of gameplay, while fully revealed during the course of play, are not explicitly mentioned in the tutorial.  Artillery fire, for example.  When you select an artillery unit, you'll get an FOV cone and can click on enemies within the unit's FOV to attack.  If the FOV cone is darkened, rather than bright, that means the unit has no line of sight.  Likewise, if you click on an enemy unit to attack, and it simply flashes briefly but does not remain highlighted in red, that unit is not within your artillery unit's line of sight.  No line of sight = no firing.  When you click on a unit that is within your line of sight, the enemy soldiers are highlighted in red, not just for a moment.  If you click over somewhere else and come back to your artillery unit, it's targeted enemy will still show up in red highlights.  These are the visual cues that tell you whether your artillery is placed correctly so that it will attack the enemy, but you have to figure them out through gameplay rather than being told explictly.  Honestly, I expect to spend a lot of time with a strategy game, learning, so it's not a big gripe on my end.Overall, I think this is a very good game, with good presentation, good historical accuracy, nice design, branching scenarios and most importantly, it's a lot of fun.  There are a couple of issues that may render it unsuitable for some, depending on their preferences, but I think that most Civil War enthusiasts will enjoy it.			"

												First of all, I am an early backer and have been testing and playing this game since it was released on Steam Greenlight/early access.Graphics:the graphical style of the game is fantastic. It gives an impression of a large battlefield, while still showing enough detail. Everything is clear and crisp, with the smoke and explosions looking great, and the battlefield getting littered with dead bodies. The landscape is a beautiful rendition of the land around Gettysburg, and you will easily pick out all the historical spots, like the Cemetery, The Peach Orchard, Devil's Den, The Round Tops, The Angle, etc.Gameplay:The battles are fluid and smooth. You can either play individual battles, or play the full 3-4 day Battle of Gettysburg campaign. Factors like morale and casualties carry over to the next battles, so managing your soldiers is important, and fresh reserves are valuable. The game is relatively balanced between the two sides, with each side having its own advantages. The battles give fairly realistic casualty results, and the battle lines ebb and flow as soldiers push forward or fall back. The AI is probably the best I've ever seen in an RTS game like this, and on the hardest difficulties provides a formidable challenge most of the time. The AI will fall back, use its reserves, launch assaults and flanking maneuvers, etc. The game is very replayable, with the campaign having many different branching outcomes based on your decisions and performance in battles, and you can play against different AI personalities who have very different playstyles, giving a different experience every time.Sound:good. The cannons and muskets and rifles sound great, and give a good ambiance to the battles. You hear the men shouting, guns firing, trumpets sounding, and it gives a great feeling of the intensity of the fighting going on.The music in the game is decent. Not outstanding, but it is acceptable.Realism:Overall, the game is a fairly realistic representation of the Battle of Gettysburg, with three large exceptions:1) the performance of cavalry. Cavalry in the game are way more powerful and influential than they ever were during the American Civil War. In the early battles, the fictional ""Vidette"" units are capable of wiping out artillery batteries and are more resilient to getting shot than they should be. In the later battles, when the Union and Confederate Cavalry divisions arrive, they are able to cause massive casualties in melee. The cavalry are simply not historically accurate in the game.2) artillery. In the game, artillery units show men rolling around cannons. They move very slowly, and are quite resilient against gunfire, leading to the possibility of using artillery units like tanks to push forward into the enemy. They also tend to inflict more casualties than they did historically. Historically, ACW artillery had horses and limbers that allowed them to limber and move around the battlefield quickly, even faster than infantry marching. This prominent feature is notably missing from the game. In short, artillery should be more mobile, but also more vulnerable to casualties.3) entrenchments and breastworks: historically, infantry entrenchments and breastworks were a pivotal part of the American Civil War, particularly at Gettysburg. While cover (like forests, fences, rocks, etc) do give a sizable cover bonus to infantry, there is no feature simulating how infantry holding a position for an extended time would dig in and fortify it, making it very hard for the enemy to push them off (see Culp's Hill).Controls:Controls are very easy and fast. Extremely intuitive. The way you can give movement orders by dragging a path is perfect.OVERALL:This is a great game, and I would definitely recommend it. It is very fun, sports top-notch AI, and is a very unique game. While it has some serious historical inaccuracies, it is still a good game. I personally hope that the devs introduce some modding support eventually, so that players can fix those inaccuracies themselves. I am looking forward to future sequels and expansions, as well as future patches to the game.Oh, and I wish they would work on an Android version, and not just one for iPad.			"

 - Highly Recommended Title -One of the best strategy titles I own, and one of the best games developed to date. UG:Gettysburg is a lesson on what to do right. Immersive game-play, stunning visuals (just love the little puffs of gun-smoke), a dedicated dev team whom engaged frequently with the steam community throughout duration of early access and developed a game, for gamers. It also has a fantastic multiplayer experience. Out of the two civil war titles I own (Battleplan: American Civil War, is the other) its the best, but B:ACW is still a fine game in it's own right.UG:Gettysburg - a must have for war strategists and armchair generals.Game Score: 10/10 "

												[DISCLAIMER: This is a review of an early access game. Since it was written for the (very) first version of early access UG:Gettysburg, quite a lot of changes have been made in the meantime. For example, a terrain/elevation-overlay has been added. However, I think that my main critique, which touches some fundamental/design issues (delay of orders, no proper information/uncertainties/fog of war-system, etc.) are still valid.]My negative vote or this game surely is an individual decision, and I can also understand that other people give positive reviews. It certainly depends on what type of player you are and what kind of game you expect. Even though the game is still in early access stadium, it's highly unlikely that the game will be changed so much as to cater for a different player-type. If you're searching for a historically inspired, light weight and uncomplicated tactical game, you're spot on with Ultimate General. The presentation is its strongest asset: the map has a very nice and addictive art style, the little smoke clouds and flying bullets that your soldiers' muskets produce are just adorable and the sound effects are great. It really feels like a table top game come alive. Another strong-point for me are the controls which feel very slender and streamlined, and ""painting"" movement-path-arrows on the map gives you the proper general-feeling. There are still some issues that will hopefully be improved (terrain-elevation-overlay is desperately needed, e.g.). As for the actual game-mechanics, they're certainly successfull in providing you with a lot of back and forth and indeed there is a certain dynamic in the battles. However, if you're trying to look a bit deeper, my experience was that you don't really have to make a lot of interesting tactical decisions. The scenarios, albeit or rather because they're using historical setups, feel very restricted. In fact I sometimes get the feeling that all I can do in the game is to move my preset army towards the opponent/objectives and react ad hoc on whatever happens. There is no need for planning. Although the game is set on a grand tactical level (the standard units are brigades, not battalions), the game imho fails to deliver the tactical depth that this scale could offer. This is partly due to the restricted scenarios that don't give you enough space and time (to do anything else than just straight out attacking/defending) and partly due to the lack of the most important aspects of warfare: information and communication. There is a line-of-sight feature implemented in this game, but you can instantly see everything that any of your units can see. It's a problem that besets most ""mainstreamy"" tactical games (unlike, e.g. Scourge of War, or the Combat Mission series for WWII), that do not want to exchange visual appeal with tactical depth: instant satellite view. There cannot be any wargame or ""simulation"" if there is instant satellite view. Another important factor is that there are no delays of orders whatsoever. Taken together, instant reaction and instant information lead to a gaming experience that has no ""simulation""-character whatsoever, and is focused on (fast) clicking and ad-hoc reaction rather than carefull thinking, planning, anticipation. I fear that this aspect will be even more perceptible in multiplayer battles (not yet in the game).So, if you'd describe yourself as a die-hard grognard and if you're looking for a wargame/tactical SIMULATION, Ultimate General might not be to your liking, or at least it won't be the game you were expecting. But for the current price, you can't really go wrong either. To me it's a nice, slender and light-weight game with a minor tactical appeal that doesn't really force the player to do a lot of brainwork. The AI seems to do okay most of the time (I can't really share the euphoria in other reviews though), which is probably partly due to the fact that there are not too many important tactical variables to be taken into consideration, and also because the game pace is very fast (the player can't have his eyes everywhere, the AI can!). So, for my personal taste, the game is not ""simulationist"" enough. It has not distanced itself enough from ""arcadey"" (i.e. fast click, don't think!) mainstream games like the Total War series. I would have wished for a game more inspired by actual wargames, in which you have to make lots of important decisions, deal with uncertainties, anticipate.			"

												The system requirements for this game are pretty light so if you have an old computer, this will play just fine. I can only think of maybe one negative about this game and that's how strong the Union arty is. Needs a  nerf or something because it just doesn't seem balanced compared to the Confederates' arty. I know they had production problems with shells but this just seems out of balance to me. Just my opinion. What I love is how unit casualties carry over and also trying to do new things on day 1 to see how the battle ends up. Buy the game and put on some Civil War-themed music in the background.			"

												I found this game disappointing and ultimately frustrating. I appreciate what the developer is trying to do, but it hasn't gotten there. It is supposed to focus on in depth management of terrain and other mechanics for h-core tactical simulators, but it doesnt come close to that. Terrain is not nearly exact or detailed enough. Ability to fine tune deployments is severely wanting, and unit AI (of friendly units) is erratic and low. I've had many units just wander out into the open passed cover and get demolished while I was on the other end of the map doing something else (often trying to get units back into position lol). Hey Union Jack, care to take a stroll out beyond the stone wall whilst Pickett gets his charge underway? Bad idea? I guess you're right, cause now you're dead. I see that this game is trying create both a user friendly casual gamer interface and in depth tactics. Unfortunately it does not succeed in the compromise. It comes off as a causal RTS gamer's stab at the civil war genre, rather than a serious civil war era tactical sim. If you want the latter, look elsewhere, though, obviously, the choices are slim. I haven't played this genre in a while. After trying this out I have a civil war bug again, and to scratch that itch to Much better satisfaction, Im going back a decade and reinstalling Take Command: 2nd Manassass.Keep working dev, I'd like to try this out again after a serious overhaul. Thanks for working on it!			"

												When I ran this game for the first time and started a battle, it didn't convinced me to itself, but after one hour it got my heart - Ultimate General: Gettysburg is an outstanding strategy, where taking strategic points and pushing your opponent off the field is the most important. To manage a win you need to use your units wisely - taking care of morale and condition does matter, because it has huge impact on battle abilities, and if both are too low brigades won't be effective in combat. However there are much more thigs you should  watch for, commanding is very simple and everyone can become a real general.Unique, beautiful graphics style, sounds of battle and authentic map of Gettysburg encourages to get more information about  bloodiest battle ever fought on American soil between Army of Northern Virginia (CSA) and Army of Potomac (USA) and lot of joy and satisfaction from playing.We can play  Campaign, where we choose to fight as Confederate or Union general, fight some single, Custom Battles with many, different AI difficulty levels or face people thanks to Multiplayer in 1v1 fight on several maps.Multiplayer is very emotional - although there are not as many maps as in singleplayer, there is enough number of battles we can fight with another player. By winning we rank up from 2nd lieutenant to Lieutenant general.Also, there are differences between CSA and USA soldiers - Rebels are more courageous veterans; Yankees are less brave and experienced, but have better equipment and deploy more efficient artillery.Personally, I would recommend this game not only to people who are interested in American Civil War and love strategies, but to everyone who likes military history. UGG, created by a small group of passionates can compete even with biggest well-known strategy games.			"

												First off- I am crap at RTS games. There I said it now everyone knows. But this game - aah! this game has redeemed me. Yes the number of commands is limited but for the less gifted generals like me this is a big plus. Also having troops who know which way to point their guns and who to shoot at without being told every few seconds makes this game a really enjoyable experience. You feel like you are really in command and can move your troops about easily with a few clicks. No vertigo inducing flights back and forth across the battle field to micro manage each unitTerrain matters especially for artillery but you soon learn how to position your batteries to the best effect and the ability to show elevation on the maps helps a lot.Maybe its just me but I think the sound effects/design on his game deserves special mention. The overall sounds of battle and the cannon/musket fire in volleys and  when poor old Will becomes the target are brilliantly done.I really recommend this game for amateur generals and judging from other reviews the West Point graduates like it as well			"

												This should always be the case, but as usual always take caution when reading reviews by people with low play times.I am currently 50 hours in at the time of this review and I am only now confident in my ability to understand the way this game works and play it with a certain level of skill.It's clunky sometimes, yes, but its an enjoyable experience all around. The thrill of controlling an entire row of forces and executing your strategy is wonderful. There are many different scenarios and variations to play, it isn't just one single player 3 day repeating mission.The difficulties of the AI are more than just easy, medium, hard, It's a selection based on how aggressive and how skilled you want the AI to be. Do you want to AI to defend and be masterful at renforcements and positioning? Do you want the AI to be aggressive but not wise? You can set that as you see fit. I'm not going to list pros and cons, you can read other reviews for that. I won't deny the weaknesses put forth by some reviewers, but I still absolutely love this game and recommend it.RTS fans and Civil War buffs should really enjoy this.			"

												This game was great before the last patch.Lets pretend that we all know the pros and cons about this game so that I can get to talk about the AI in this game.They made it the most prominent point of UG. And yes the AI is hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥but not for the good reasons.You will find it cruel and unfair, capable of pulling out tricks no human could do. It knows how to render your charge useless by making it's unit pull back the micro-second before yours can engage it in hand to hand combat. Then it will drag your unit to the very end of the map and if you try to pull back the AI will start shooting it litteraly decimating your ranks.But in term of general strategy the AI only knows how to crush you head on with charges and canons. And some of those charges are completly stupid and you start wondering why it did it.The AI also know the states and morales your units are in while you have no way of knowing the state his units are in and hardly what your owns are in.And you can't try any daring strategy because of that, try to get one unit out of the raange of your general to flank his units and you will blankly watch as it get one shot by one battery of canons and one unit of infantry. Losing hundreds of men or the whole unit in the process.For those reasons I cannot recomend the single player, a frustrating and utterly cheat experience.			"

												A lot of fun.  Different from most RTS games.  No finding resources and building an army, building defenses (not sure if that's a pro or con with most of you RTS fans).  You're given a set amount of soldiers, and you occassionally get reenforcements based on what happened in history.  Controls are a bit hard to work with, so be sure to read the tutorial.			"

												It's good. It has that feel of Sid Mier's Gettysburg.Developed by faimous Total War series modder. Originally was made for tablets, had zero sucess and later ported on PC.Controls are simple, there are only four units. But it has depth and feel of Total War game.P.S. Unlike in Total War series A.I. in this game is quite good and challenging with list of different behaviors to choose from.			"

												I haven't played too many RTS games in my life but I'm going to say this is my favorite RTS game of all time. It is a spiritual successor to Sid Meier's Gettysburg! and it is probably one of the best spiritual successors ever made. The battle system is very easy to get into but it's also complex and hard to master. I highly recommend this if you are into the civil war and when you play this, do yourself nice favor and listen to confederate songs while playing(To Arms in Dixie). I also wear my johnny rebel cap and my confederate aviators while playing this. So glad I got this on the Winter Sale. One of the best purchases I have ever made on steam.			"

												Positive. Very positive. If, as has been said countless times, you remember Sid Meirs Gettysburg released around 1997 or so, then pick this up at its good price. It, for me, bit that bug so long ago I had (I remember trying to replay SM:G several years ago and to get it working on modern tech was just too much hard work. Unfortunatly its not on GoG either, so its gonna be harder with mutli core 64 bit systems) from playing it. This game is good, the AI is challenging, could be better, but its not terrible and will keep you interested. The feel for the battlefield is great, the graphics are good with smoke from your musket volleys and cannons, good sound effects (although I think Sids game had that one much better..but hey not that important), and it makes good use of the Unity engine - a very adaptable thing. Its a tactical game, not strategic although your playing the whole day of Gettysburg and the game is split into time segements and after each time period you have several strategic choices to make, like holding the line, retreat to defensive positions etc..and thats a neat thing. Your casualties carry over from each time period, so use your Iron Brigade wisely in the first part...Its interesting, its a good homage I would call it rather than a clone of SM:G; this is like a game that has been missed since the late '90s...Recommended.

												Surprisingly good. It takes some time to get used to the flow as the entire battle is made up of multiple engagements over multiple days with different corps (depending on your success in previous engagements). However this leads to a delightful tactical and strategic setting where you won't angrily reload saved games if you happen to lose in an area because you know you'll hit them somewhere else.The AI is good enough that I haven't seen a need to try multiplayer yet. The developers are also continuing to release balance patches.Ideal for people who feel the battles in Total War games are dry and simplistic but more serious tactical games are too much of a commitment.

												My first impression of this game was graphically it looked very appealing. Upon further playing it, I found odd simplistic qualities that somehow was able to grasp my attention and keep it. I easily spent an hour in this game my first time before realizing how much time went by. This can be a good strategy game for some while others may find it extremely boring. This game will either appeal to you or it simply won't.Ultimate General : Gettysbourg throws the gamer in a room staring at soldiers on a battlefield that sits comfortably on some table. The story follows the American civil war between the Union and the Confederates. The difference here is that history can potentially re-write itself and that battles can carry on for days. The gameplay itself is actually quite simplistic and very easy to use. The challenge is how to approach each situation (like any game right)? In this particular game, one does not simply produce units out of a factory or thin air. Rather, units every so often may come as reinforcements. Depending on the battle, reinforcements may not come at all or very late in the game. I'm not a huge American civil war buff so I cannot comment on the accuracy of everything historical in-game. I can mention, however that there are a lot of facts and a timer that will try to accurately end the battle. The battle can obviously go longer than expected but going too far over the original clock will stop the game. Everything seems as accurate as can be to me.There are different units that have different abilities in game. Union units are more technologically advance while Confederate units excel at close quarter combat. Skirmishers are basic units that do not have too much range but are obviously meant for close combat. Archers have a longer range but aren't as efficient in close quarters. Artillery is a cool unit type that the player can use to decisively manipulate the outcome of the game. Artillery is able to choose between shell, canister and solid shot. Shell is mid-range and will hit units in the target impact area. Solid shot is used from afar but cannot take out as many units as shell does. Canister is sort of a rapid fire feature that can take out many soldiers in one go. Issue here is that the artillery has to be in pretty close range to reach the units. Grabbing any random unit and watching them follow the arrow you've so nicely drawn out on the map is satisfying. Selecting individual units can be done by simply clicking them. To select more than one group of units, click and hold the left mouse button and freely draw a circle, encircling the units that you want to pick. I find this to be a neat feature that others games should perhaps follow. Choosing exactly who you want is a lot more powerful that picking specific units with a square.The AI is definitely no push over. They will react in real time to whatever movements you make on the battle field. They can also get extremely annoying (in a good way) with their artillery that'll blast you from afar. Troops owned by the player also have a mind of their own. If they are getting bombarded and completely destroyed they will retreat on their own will. It can be annoying watching troops run away from a fight but they can come back and support when they calm down. Orders that could be given to units is move, run, fallback, hold and charge. Charge will have your units engage in hand to hand combat with the opponent. The Confederates have the advantage here as they are given a more aggressive stance.The visuals are appealing and are done decently well. You cannot zoom in all the way to see the blast effects but smoke/gun effects are all there. The HUD contains some useful (and colorful) information for the player. These four categories are quite important : morale (green), condition (blue), cover (yellow) and reload (red). The higher morale means the better your troops will perform. Conditions allows for you to choose the ""run"" option to move quicker on the battlefield but depletes the longer the displacement. Cover is an especially important one as it will definitely give you a leg up on the opponent. If you're not in some woods or on a ridge be extremely careful as your troops are extremely vulnerable. Reload obviously indicates when the troops are ready to fire. Points are awarded for certain points being captured which is made extremely evident without disturbing the eyes. Sounds are decent and are suitable to the game. It would be nice to hear some in-game dialogue or more explosive effects.Overall, not a bad game but I would certainly say this is not recommended for everyone. It is somewhat of a simplistic RTS that sometimes will not demand too much micro-management. This isn't necessarily true at all times but some people that have tried the game seem to think so. I think a little bit more could have been done to immerse the player by giving them more of a immersive role in the game rather than simply planning everything. If this was the goal to simply be a planner, then the game succeeded in it's role.RATING : 6.95/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots :  A nice view These lines are not drawn strategically "

												This isn't a bad game. However, its a game that very much seems to resent being played.Firstly, if you want to play this game, you must read this guide written by a dev ( 


Tactics Guide (22/4/2016 Update) 
A Guide for Ultimate General: Gettysburg
By: DARTIS

			Useful tips on how to manage your army and a multiplayer scenario guide.		


 ). It details some of the mechanics that are not covered well, or at all, in the ingame tutorial, or guide. or otherwise conveyed in any way by the game interface. This game plays very similarly to Sid Meier's Gettysburg, and can be thought of as a spiritual successor. If you had played that game and enjoyed it, then you will probably find something to enjoy from this game as well. The game is a single ""battle"" that takes place over several engagements; battle setups are generally pre-arranged scenarios with some variance depending on what occurred in previous stages, and what stages are available later depends on what ""victory points"" are controlled by what side at the end of an engagement. Reinforcements are also scripted, with some variance on their arrival times; their actual arrival times and locations are not told to you, which can lead to your army being suddenly flanked if you're unlucky. The AI is fairly competent, and benefits from the mechanics of the game being fairly forgiving towards the occasional boneheaded move that the AI is wont to try to do; units are fairly resilient, preferring to rout rather than die, and as the battle takes place over a series of ""engagements"" with escalating troop counts, earlier loses become irrelevant, as even when the AI loses over half its total forces, it will still easily match or outnumber your forces. However, even though the AI is frequently a selling point, its capacity to provide a challenge comes more from the nature of game mechanics than the AI being terribly clever. The AI also has a propensity to ""know"" gameplay rules that players are forced to guess at (the AI will never have difficulty managing its cannons, for instance, and is also able to ""guess"" where it can position its forces perfectly to avoid your own guns) and to know when, for instance, it will win a charge, when yet again, a player must estimate. The AI gets to avoid much of the frustrations with a very fickle ""Cover"" mechanic, where a player must yet again guess at which terrain and facing will result in high cover based on the often tiny features on the map; a minute distance can result in a huge drop in unit cover, and the game's control scheme, based on drawing movement lines on a map, are deeply unsuited for these tiny adjustments you must make for each one of your units. Map features can also block LOS, which can at least be deduced by clicking on your unit, but a problem arises where a unit can fail to have a firing line while still having a clear LOS, leaving you deeply confused why a unit or cannon battery ""refuses"" to fire. There is no feature on the interface that tells you when or why this happens.The AI also does not have to cope with one of the game's selling points, the ""Unit Self Awareness"", that causes your own units to move and act on their own, often to your great disadvantage. Although the idea of removing ""micromanagement"" is an attractive one, this ""helpful"" feature (than cannot be disabled except via a very limited ""Hold"" command) means that your units will often move on their own, often out of cover and into great danger, for a variety of undocumented reasons. Ironically, this means that, compared to games such as the Total War series, you will be forced to actively micromanage your units to a far greater degree, lest they decide to wander down your own battle lines while under fire, blocking the rest of your troops from shooting. Your units also very stubbornly will refuse to change targets once this ""Self Awareness"" AI decides what they are to shoot at.Much of the game mechanics must be guessed at; knowing, for instance, what contributes to a units morale dropping (a incredibly critical feature) is not documented, only hinted at in a frustratingly coy manner. The advice from the development team seemed based on the idea that their game is highly realistic and much of their mechanics are ""common sense""; suffice to say, I do not agree with this viewpoint, and much of the difficulty of the games involved coming to grips with unintuitive and undocumented elements, leading to an incredibly grating experience when things fail to behave as you'd expect, and leads to a huge ""trial and error"" element; given that the battles are so slow paced, combined with the strictness of the battle time limit, means having things go horribly wrong due to factors you can only guess at is rather unforgivable. This is the primary reason I cannot recommend this game in good faith; although there is much to praise about this game, even in comparison to more popular titles, the constant issues of coping with a variety of frustrating design decisions and defects taints much of the experience, even in comparison to the game it borrows so much of its mechanics from, Sid Meier's Gettysburg. If you are willing to put with with a lot of frustration, there is a good tactical wargame worth playing here. But this is a game that does very, very little to win itself over in comparison to other series.			"

												I have played many tactical or strategic Civil War games, each of which has a focus on different aspects of the period and different pros and cons. In Ultimate General, I would argue, you get amongst the best all-round experience of warfare in the period. The AI is really tough. The unit combat 'feels' authentic with reasonable casualty numbers resulting from the different sorts of fire. The scenario-to-scenario system owrks really well and allows for lots of different 'what if' scenarios to emerge from your gameplay. Finally, the control system is FAR more intuitive than just about any other game for this period. You can pick up the controls within a handful of minutes. All in all a fantastic experience.			"

												If you have played Sid Meier's Gettysburg! you must play this game. The basic idea of the game is you either control the Union or Confederate army during the Battle of Gettysburg. The campaign lets you make choices before each battle which can greatly change how the campaign plays out as the ""maps"" you play on and the unit layout will change. (i.e. Attack their flank or stay back and defend a ridge will lead to different battles). The controls may be simplified but because of this, it makes the game greatly enjoyable. To move units, you select them and trace their movement path with your mouse. There is no unit formation selection or anything like that which lets you focus on your overall tactics. The game is very easy to get into but difficult to master since you must learn to use the terrain to your advantage. In terms of difficulty, you have a great way of selecting the AI as you select your difficulty on a graph chart. You can select an AI that is careful but smart, an aggressive idiot, or some form of combo (you have 9 different choices). There has been many times where the AI has surprised me with it's tactics and pushed me across the map after I thought I had won. For anyone who likes rts games or history (especially if you played Sid Meier's Gettysburg!) I would highly recommend this game.			"

I love how the battles aren't static and important strategic positions on the battlefield will change hands, which leads to tough melee and and close quarter fights. The aspect of carrying over cassualties from the previous battles further adds more realism to the game as every move no matter how strategically important has a significant role, in the overall outcome of the battle of Gettysburg.

												AWESOME game!!! I really enjoy the detail they put into the map. The map allows for victory by utilizing strategic high ground or cover on the map. Perhaps the one thing that is disturbing is the ridiculous power of artillery in the game. I use this to my advantage and beat people all the time, but to be fair, I SHOULDN'T be able to move artillery around the map like little tanks and blast infantry away using canister. We're talking 1,000 men in most brigades, and when they fire at an artillery batallion, it should take just one volley to obliterate a battery of 70 men.Other than that gripe, the game is INCREDIBLE for strategy buffs! Highly recommend!			"

												A spiritual successor to Sid Meier's Gettysburg, with very familar interface and gameplay. Brigade control is somewhat less intuitive than necessary, and leads to micromanagement of regiments and generals. Artillery are a great deal smarter than SMG, and an additional shot type in the form of shells has been added (halfway between solid shot and cannister, with qualities of each). The abilaity to draw in marching paths is tremendously useful, and allows you to set an entire flank's orders and focus your attention elsewhere confident your regiments will end up in the correct formation in due course. Overall it plays much quicker, and due to this fact, gameplay is somewhat limited in duration. That said, it is a lopt of fun and very easy to learn.			"

								Ultimate General: Gettysburg is a game that successfully manage to recreate a realistic, plausible and logical line battle experience at the right pace.It divide the battle of Gettysburg into difference phase where either side has a chance to either attack or defend against larger or smaller forces that are persistent from one battle phase to the other.After each phase you have sometime the opportunity to make some strategic choice as to where you would like to position your forces in order to attack the other side or wait for reinforcements, leading to some variations as to where your campaign is fought.You also have to possibility to choose a good variety of AI behavior in the way it fight leading to potentially some replayability.Visually speaking the game has a colorfull apperance that make you confortable and happy to play it.When it comes to the UI it's very simple to click and drag your units arround the place and you have ultimatly more options to control your units than you would have in any Total War game resulting in a much more realistic battle of movements.Movement in the game is key to victory and using the terrain is also very important every position with cover preserve your units from getting killed as well as being targeted, leading to a refined war of movement as well as the necessity to building up forces on a specific location to chase away well positionned forces by breaking their moral.The moral in the game is an important element as it was during the real line battle. The game make the moral very sensitive and that can take a short while to get used to, while feeling believable. Very few troops will stay in line, while half of there man are dying, in the middle of a field under musket and artilery fire as it should be.This game current flaw is that it's very focused in terms of campaign to Gettysburg. Since Gettysburg is the entire point of the game, it's justifiably so. On the other hand, if the battle system of this game was mixed with a grand scale strategy game such as Victoria II or even something as simple as Risk with a multiplayer element added as well. This game, game mechanic would have an enormous potential of endless entertainement.We can only hope that this is a prototype game that will lead to the developpement of something greater in the future.So I indeed recommend peoples to buy this game, it's a lot of fun for a low price and it will make you happy for a while.

Posted: November 2, 2014
												First, let me start off by saying, if your a total war fan, or a fan of other very RTS games with frontline action and controlability, then BUY THIS GAME. RIGHT NOW.Now then... Ive had this game since it was in a state of human vs AI only, and it was suggested by a clan leader and friend of mine whom i saw play quite frequently. He told me the features and i was pretty psyched to say the least. Just so i dont make this review paragraph based, let me number off the pros and cons and info.Pro's:1. The Dev and The AI Behavior This game was made by a popular Mod developer for the total war series, more specifficaly, the Darth Mod series. yes, same guy. And please take very good note of this, THE AI WILL KICK YOUR♥♥♥♥♥ Im VERY suprised CA hasnt hired this guy for the Total War series yet for thier new A.I. behavior manager! The Computer acts just like a human in some if not all instances depending on the way you want it to act, its VERY releiving to see a compinant AI smashing a human player. If you buy this game, thinking that its just another game that youll steam roll the AI in, your wrong. Period.2. Genuine BattleField terrain and locationsI live in mid Michigan, and the Gettysburg battlefield is roughly 300 miles away. I am also a dedicated Civil War reenactor, and historian, and i have been to Gettysburg and other battle sites multiple times. I must say, the developer has really put time into making the battlefield map as authentic as possible. By doing so, he has the terrian set just right, theres ALOT of small locations like the Penn. College, and several small areas like family houses, mansions and farmhouses with titles signifying the property. This really adds to your sence of thinking, like instead of thinking, 'Gotta hold that house' or 'Hold that hill' your more in a state of mind saying 'Hold the Henery House Property', 'Hold Oak Ridge', 'Defend the Unsbruck road'. It all makes you feel like more of a gerneral than most offical game companies for RTS and frontline action.3. Realistic Chain of Command and RegimentsInstead of Regimental numbers and which state their from, theres titles to mark each regiment, or birgade by their colonel, core leader, or the actual nick name they had during the war. Like the Iron Birgade, The Texan Birgade, Bucktail Birgade, Irish Birgade, Kelly's Birgade, and thats just to name a few of the nick named. Other more common units are named after historical regimental commanders and birgadier generals who were present at the battle. THAT is true dedication to the games authenticity :)4. A very high sence of carnage and urgency Most people dont mindor think about this, but i beleive every war game should have sound effects of not only weapons, but voices and screaming and other things to give a more sence of the heat of battle. Whenever i engage the enemy, the new sounds of battle erupt and i feel like im more rushed or needed of concentration just to see it through. Plus, bodies stay where they lie, and it makes the feild more littered with the dead to give a better sence of war horror and chaos. One time, me and a freind playing online (explained later) fought over a wheat feild for nearly 20 minutes, and in that time, it switched posetion between us nearly 17 times! It was grusome!5. Simple but very robust multiplayerDont expect this game to have a server or host list, but instead it has a mainly matchmaking based mulitplayer system. better yet, it even ranks your person and you can even select avatars! Though theyre only portraits of generals from both the Union and Confederacy, and nothing much else, which is a little dissapointing. 6. WHERES THE REINFORCMENTS!?Throughout the 3 days at the battle of Gettysburg, both armies were conjured in a day or so by the arrival of reinforcements from different roads in order to manifest their armies into a whole. Reinforcemnets, are DEPENDED upon in this game to ensure victory for either side, and its very nerve racking to wait for their arrival. They even come in various sizes, types, and diractions to the feild of battle. So it really dicates where they can help most immediately, or spend time to get to another area. 7. The enemy army is breaking camp, let us do the same...During a human vs AI battle, the fight can last to a max of 4 days or so. You only have so much time in a day to capture all objective locations or to route the enemy army until both sides being too exhausted to fight and break camp for the next day fallowing. Whats even more cool is that the gains or losses you make in one day can influence the lines of battle for the day fallowing, THAT is awsome and i cant even beleive no RTS game developer companies have even considered making that system an element in their games yet without making it for the prupose of cinimatic.Cons:1. The line of sight for cannons Cannons were a must have in both armies during the period, but in this game, it takes alot to get them operating effeicantly. Cannons must be set up with a proper line of fire in order to fire on the enemy, so youll be CONSTANTLY checking your artilleries line of fire. It also sucks that the Ai cant even automatically deploy them to a favored postion after being ordered to attack a certian enemy. I even had a battery of cannons on a hill overlooking an open feild in which the enemy were crossing, and they didnt even open fire! The enemy was completely exposed as well, and it even cost me the battle because they didnt open fire even though they were overlooking a hill. Be aware, the LOF for artillery peices, are VERY picky.2. Poor/Slow morale recharge and gainIn game, Southern armies have more of a moral boost because historically, they were mostly made of volunteers willing to fight, whislt most of the Northern armies have lower moral sicne alot where drafties and didnt even want to be in the army in the first place. However, once moral is depelted for a unit, its over for them. They might as well leave the feild because theyll be so useless. I had a birgade of 1280 southern men, and after being repulsed, they automatically got behind the lines to safety, but the moral was jacked. i checked on them and their morale seemed fine enough to get back into the action, but as soon as they get near the fight, theyre morale was depleted, and mind you none of them were even fired upon when that happened. Even on the Northern side more especially, if a units morale goes below 20%, its over for them. They wont have the will to fight anymore. This needs to have at least a curtiosy balance or fix to be more acceptable. 3. Once more into the breech men!... men!?...Charging the enemy is a needed factor in the game, but it needs to be a little tweaked. The Confederate armies have the benifit of actually fallowing through a charge but the Union wont even charge at all. Theyll hold their ground with great dediction, but a charge, even against the smallest units, just kills the moral of the Union units and they all run away before a charge even commences. It somewhat defeats the purpose of have a charge option while playing as the Union.Final Verdict:This game came out of the blue, and it wasnt another board game based civil war game nor a mod for a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥RTS. Ultimate General is a slight arcade like game but its a mus thave for all RTS fans and those of 'frontline' combat. Like i said however, some tweaking might have to be done here and there, but the Pro's far outway the Con's. I give this game, a 7/10 in its current state. 8/10 if your a Civil War history fanatic or an RTS fanatic for that matter, AND if the developer tweaks the strengths and weaknesses and morale of both sides. This game DESERVES to be a series, not only that for JUST the Civil War era, but maybe Napoleonic Wars, 1700 Wars, Crimean War; it DOES have great potential! And i encourage the dev to keep up dedicated work!			"

												This game had gold plated reviews when it first came out, but the last and final patch to the game has made it... a little difficult! That's why its rating dropped from 90%+ to recent heading down to 50% levels.Let me be frank here - playing the AI on this game is like advancing into machine guns. Entering a firefight on anywhere near equal terms will leave you with hundreds of casualties, I have had brigades lose 800 men while inflicting zero kills. This game is HARD, and was clearly patched in its final form for ultra veteran players. If you idea of a good time is getting your teeth smashed in by AI then get it. I am loving every minute and totally recommend it - but know what you are getting into. This is the exact opposite of the usual 'murder the AI for lols in single player' wargaming. This is brutal, this will make you angry, this will kick your♥♥♥♥♥again and again in a way you have never experience from an AI. Totally recommended.			"

												When it comes to delivering a historical representation of the names and number of soldiers present at the battle of Gettysburg, this game is great. When it comes to allowing the player to recreate the battle of Gettysburg, this game is terrible. One of the biggest complaints people had with some of the total war games, was that it was too hard to place your units where you wanted them. By comparison, this game makes all the total war games seems amazing. Changing unit position is almost impossible while in battle, and the UI, while very clean, is completley useless. I had high hopes for this game fulfilling my desire for at somewhat accurate/competant American Civil War game, but I guess I'll have to stick with CWG 2 for my Civil War fix			"

												8/10, would recommend at current normal market price. Ultimate General: Gettysburg, is a great indie strategy game, in which you command either the Union or Confederacy during the Battle of Gettysburg, June 1st-3rd/4th of 1863. The game has a top down command style, with good sound and graphic qualities. The premise is rather self explainitory, yet this game allows for a very immersive view of how the Union and Confederacy fought at Gettysburg, as well as how geography played a major role in the battle. Honestly, this game is a little light in gameplay features, but the impressive and easy-to-use functionality and mechanics completely make up for it. I wish that this game was expanded into an entire Civil War game... It would be so good. The mechanics of the game really do have much more potential than just this game. That said, this is a great start, and a great game.			"

												Right from the start, you dive into battle. A game that assembles the real strategy you need to think in a real war, and with that, you either win or die trying. Great mechanics, with a not so bad AI that actually thinks itself a lot more than you can imagine, feels quite sharp, difficult and realistic. A must if you enjoy strategy games that throw you into battle without knowing sometimes what really happens.			"

												1st July, 1863. 9:48 am. Having encountered forward elements of Lee's Confederate Army, my Colonel deployed his skirmishing units to blunt the forward movement of the enemy thus giving the ""Iron Brigade"" and the other line units of I Corp time to come up. The enemy countered with a sledgehammer style assault on the weak points in the skirmishing line driving back Devin's and Gamble's units to McPherson Ridge. I ordered my cannon to fall farther back to give them time to set up again. We can hear the pipers of the ""Iron Brigade"" and are well aware of their stature on the battlefield. The enemy is surely aware of this as well, and I think they can expect a hot welcome of fire and shot when they arrive.  My Colonel has trained his cavalry well but has reservations about the quality of the commanders he has been given. However our Detached infantry units have performed admirably in their mission of delaying the enemy's advance.10:13 am. Davis' brigade has suffered terribly as they tried to cross the valley floor and the enemy center is considerably weakened. Our line held at McPherson's Ridge only because Pettigrew and Heth's Skirmishers elected to take the comparatively  minor Oak Hill. The ""Iron Brigade"" has arrived and is busy in the south pushing Brockenbrough back towards the Confederates gun positions. As General Buford seems to have things in hand in the north, especially with the arrival of the remainder of I Corp the General has decided to push the right end of the line north, in an effort to accurately gauge the strength of Pettigrews brigade. Our cavalry has done some very good scouting and we are fairly confident of the locations of the artillery and hope to move on them soon. Orders from the Colonel are to leave our guns on Oak Ridge as a deterrent to Pettigrew and the light forces with him. We should be getting artillery reinforcements at any time now, and several more Brigades.10:38 The Rebs have regrouped and have forced the light units off McPherson Ridge. The General has pulled all the units back to Oak Ridge, there to wait until Cutler and the others are able to come up. There was bloody and savage fighting by the light units in the valley as they screened the other Brigades repositioning, but they have taken minimal losses and are still a bright beacon of Valour for the rest of the Army. The General plans to visit those men tonight.11:00 am. Our enemy has nothing more to throw into this fight and we are slowly but surely pushing him back. The Iron Brigade has done the impossible and taken Herr Ridge from the weakened and demoralised Rebs. The damned cannon continue to harass us though as it was deemed more important to take the strong point at Herr Ridge and deny the enemy a vital point of contact with the main body. 11:45 am The fighting has been horrendous at the bridge near Spanglers farm but Baxter and Paul have inflicted a serious bloodletting on the enemies III Corp, driving them back and killing them mercilessly. The ""Iron Brigade'"" occupation of  Herr Ridge seems to have thrown the enemy into confusion and forced Heth, and Pettigrew to move off Oak Hill, which now has our scouts on it, observing the enemies movements. The General has begun telling his subordinates to push the Rebs hard and give them no respite. If we can trap them in the valley we can inflict awful casualties on them in that dead ground.Would I recommend this game? HELLZ YA! A good replacement for Meyer's Gettysburg. However, it is not that game, so try to give it a shot on its own merits. There are some things wrong with it. For example. Why on the next phase of the battle does the computer move my units from where they were on the previous map? After I had carefully positoned them for maximum effect. AND in some undesirable locations.  The map is hard to get used to but with patience it can be read. I thoroughly enjoyed my first couple of tries. I  still like the random General selector button. Haven't used anything else really. Got my @SS handed to me a few times before I got the hang of it. I like that you can save at any time. SAVE OFTEN!!! The controls are easy to use after you get the hang of them, and the tutorial video set up is a great initial learning tool.  Nice Work DarthMod and Team. RECOMMENDED for gamers. But gonna downgrade this from a 8.0/10 to a 7.5/10++++++++ I would like to commend the Developers for the ongoing community involvement in this game. The latest patch just hit, and I am very excited by some of the changes. I have not played with the new patch but will be doing so shortly. This game is worth every cent I paid for it and I have great hopes for the future of this game and hopefully others of equally high caliber will follow.+++++++++++			"

Basics are easy to learn, but mastering the game, especially in mp against other players is a different story. As far as mp goes there's still much to improve in matchmaking and (perhaps) ladder departement, but so far this game has provided me with much more then I've initially expected. If you're a history buff, American Civil War enthusiast you'll appriciate this game for sure!			"

												I recently discovered this game when I read about how Apple had pulled it from the Itunes store so I figured I'd buy it on steam to support the developer.  I'm glad to see that it is back up for Apple. Kudos to the developers for standing their ground and not bowing to a wave of censoring political correctness.  The game is pretty much an update of Sid Meier's Gettysburg which was one of the first strategy games I ever played. It's nice to revisit something that feels familiar with an updated engine and AI.			"

Early Access Review
								Highly recommend this game if you are a fan of tabletop war games or looking for a RTS that is both tactically rich yet easy to get into.  It's early access so there are a few bugs, but it's beautiful to play and very thematic.  I've been following the development of this game for a while having been a fan of DarthMod for total war (it's the same developer).  I'm not a big fan of early access, but with the first patch out and the game looking great in YouTube videos I was more than happy to drop a tenner to give it a go.Graphics and UIThe map is beautiful and being hand drawn has a tabletop war game feel to it.  The units are sprites but for the level of zoom available are more than enough and the animation is very smooth and polished.  The UI looks like it has been designed for touch screens and something you could use on a tablet, but is very playable with mouse and keyboard, especially once you start using the hotkeys.  I love the history channel style movement arrows.  Menus are simple but they work.  There is no menu art although that's something that can be added later in development and for me is a low priority.SoundVery atmospheric, there is a background track of drums and musket fire on top of which is added cannons, muskets and bugles for fighting units.  I found the sound to be subtle, which added to the tabletop war game feel.AIVery good with 3 levels of intelligence and 3 levels of aggressiveness giving you 9 different options for the AI.  Over all I found the AI to be sensible and able to react to my moves on the battlefield. GameplaySo as the name suggests the game focuses on the 4 day battle of Gettysburg, with the battle split into phases.  The campaign starts you off on the first day and on completing the first phase you are given various options, depending on your performance.  Each phase lasts 30 minutes or so, so you can easily fit in a game when you have the free time. The next phase then starts with unit position and strength caring over from the previous phase.  This branching approach to the campaign adds some replay value even with the limited map.In addition there are custom battles where you can play what if scenarios, however these must be unlocked via the campaign game.Multiplayer should be coming in a later update which could make for a very fun and enjoyable game/ "

												If you have fond memories of Sid Meyer's Gettysburg, then Ultimate General: Gettysburg will be right up your alley.  Although you might think it looks too pretty to be a serious wargame, don't let the graphics fool you.  On the other hand, the command structure is simple and intuitive enough that you don't necessarily need to be a hardcore grognard to appreciate the game.  Some basic knowledge of military tactics and terminology is helpful, however.  From a structure standpoint, the game's campaign breaks down the 3-day Battle of Gettysburg into smaller scenarios (that still can be fairly large), which are fought in pauseable real time utilizing graphical units in accurate formations -- basically, it's all in the style of the Total War series.  A helpful arrow shows you where a selected unit is heading, which is accomplished by clicking and dragging the unit.  Multiple units can be moved (in formation) by using the ""General"" in charge of them.   A minor nitpick:  the game isn't always entirely clear on line-of-sight restrictions for units, and it's sometimes difficult to judge terrain height, which is a critical factor in placing your artillery (as it is in reality).  The AI generals have ""personalities"" that can be selected before the game using a 9x9 grid of types.  Want a more conservative, cautious opponent?  Or a reckless gambler?  Your choice.All in all it's a really enjoyable game, especially coming from a first-time developer.  Here's hoping that this isn't the last Civil War battle we see recreated in this engine!			"

												If you're asking yourself ""Should I get Ultimate General: Gettysburg?"" the answer is a resounding YES! I don't normally write reviews on here, but I just had to take the time for UG:G becasue it's such a well designed game, and such a breath of fresh air for the strategy genre.I won't bore you with multiple long paragraphs on how great the game is, but I will say this: if anything about this game sparks your interest, from a trailer, to a gameplay video, to a recommendation, then GET IT. $15 is an amazing price for this game. I normally wait for games to go on sale beforte purchasing them, but I bought UG:G at full price, and have absolutely no regrets about doing so.Combat *seems* simple, and for the most part it is, yet there is such a depth and complexity to it that you'll still be mastering new techniques dozens of hours into the game. Gameplay is fun and engaging, and you're never left feeling like you've been cheated by the AI. Speaking of which, both individual units' AI, and the the enemy general's AI are extraordinary. There are nine different diffuculty settings for AI matches/campaigns, each with differing strategies and characteristics, so there's massive replay value, even for purely offline play.Ultimate General: Gettysburg is the first of hopefully many Ultimate General games. I'm happy to show my support for  UG:G, and I'm excited to see what's next.God be with you, General!			"

												Ever since i played Sid Mier's Gettysburg back in the 1990s, I have loved these style of games.  This was a lot of fun to play.  But It didn't quite measure up to Sid Mier.  It would have been better to be able to move the camera around at different angles.  The graphics were not top notch.  I would liked to have been able to zoom in closer to the action and see the troops up close.  I definitely recommend it for the price.

												Pros: Beautiful game, great mechanics, dynamic tactical gameplay, your performance in battles determines the progression of the game.  Cons: Plays too fast or too slow depending on the point in a batlle. Have to pause every 10 seconds to move units into position sometimes. Takes too long to wait for reinforcements or for units to finish moving/recovering during others. Too much micromanaging to deal with for the game to move as fast as it does. Feels more like a clunky starcraft than a battle sim.There really needs to be a way to adjust the speed of the game on the fly like in Total War, at least in single player. For being one of the premier modders of the Total War franchise you'd think they would have implemented such a core feature.			"

 Ultimate General: Gettysburg  review Overview This game is in the Ultimate General series of historical and strategical games. You play the civil war in the US as either the Union or the Confederate. It's very well executed, the maps are very large and there's tons of them, they all look unique and have multiple strategies. Some maps are based on woodlands (giving off cover), some are basically next to a town (giving off tons of cover but makes battles a lot slower, also slows movement speeds), some are a mix of two etc. In my time of playing, I did find that the Union was superior to the Confederate units as they can eliminate even Pettigrew squads (2K Confederate units) when outnumbered as they (seem) to reload faster, have way better and more accurate weaponry and artillery and don't flee as often because of this, so you can actually hold your ground longer than the ""hardened war veterans"". It's just really unfair and doesn't help make the game fun at all. It's just such a chore to watch everyone die off to the Union playing as the Confederate. Another thing that needs improving is the reloading mechanic. Sometimes artillery just refuses to reload, in which case they are just there, not doing anything but being targeted by enemies. So basically: combat needs work. Gameplay Despite the flaws, it's still actually pretty fun. Strategies do have a big effect on the outcome of a battle, such as flanking. Other things as a full frontal assault is, well, it doesn't have the largest effect for a strategy. The exchange of unit speed for cover is also very interesting, it doesn't have that much effect on how much slower units will die, so again, I just think it's a number that is there, but nothing is being executed. In the overview I said that the maps are very large, which they are, but the units just take forever to navigate even just a small distance, which gets even worse during forest map matches.  You will be surprised how much an effect this has. Heck, even while setting the units to run, they do take quite some time to reach the end goal. This makes me not want to use even a flank as it's just going to take up so long of the battle time to set up. Artillery needs an improvement in terms of movement as well, they will often refuse to lock onto an enemy squad for no apparent reason. They're in range and they're already spotted. Until, of course, it's too late and the brigade is now just debris. The movement planner is helpful to find where every unit will try to move, however. Especially when trying to encircle the enemy. You will not need to check every unit seperately as the movement arrows are always on screen. Combat  As solid as a 2cm sheet of plastic. It's alright enough to be used for many things. But it can certainly be improved. I may have a stack of 1K Union units attacking a single 1K stack only kill, lets say, 200 enemies every reload turn. This makes very little sense as 80% of my units have the aim of a potato. I'd understand 450 units every reload turn, as then it's more realistic I suppose, but this is the main reason why battles can even take up to an hour and some minutes. The main feature of the game should be more solid than what it currently is.  Pros and Cons Pros:Pretty fun Large scale battlesLarge mapsVery detailedPretty graphicsThe UI doesn't get in the wayCons:Combat and Movement need work Finale A realistic depiction of the Battle of Gettysburg. The game's score will vary significantly wether of not you want full realism. The game is generally great but this is just my experience of fully realistic mechanics, such as the Union being overall more powerful in terms of technology.			"

												I've given this game another shot after buying a new mouse with a functional middle mouse button.  I'm a big fan of wargames.  This game was recommended by a lot of reviewers as the next evolution of our hobby, so I had to find out what the fuss was about.The fuss was about nothing.  This game is an awkward mess.  The unit control feels disgustingly sloppy (I can never get my units where I want them), the vaunted AI makes completely unrealistic decisions, and there are better civil war games out there even of the beer and pretzels type.  I like that people still make wargames.  I love the civil war.  This game was overhyped by people that liked drawing arrows on the screen, which is a cool concept, that can't make up for the rest of the mechanical mess.Another thing is this game could use would be an actual playable tutorial.   They have a few movies, but they really need to go over the strengths and weaknesses of the various units.To Admin : While I am happy to see  you supporting your projects you shouldn't back away from good advise.  A lot of developers get tunnel vision.  A tutorial level would help your game.  I also understand most of your points about the civil war.  You are correct, but all games can be found on this fulcrum between sim and game.  Too me what you guys were going for was on the game side.  There are far better civil war 'sims' out there that simulate realistic command structures.  I get frustrated though because the game world probably work better without the bad controls.  Controls are a choice made by the developer and the medium.  A real general can speak.  I have to input commands and I have a limited number of commands.  There were positions no company commander would ever take that my troops would assume because i was inputting commands into a PC and not giving simple orders.  I was restrained.  The game can do better.Try looking at Combat Mission : Battle for Normandy.			"

												My biggest issue with this game is the way the different battles link together.  There is no real logical progression based on your achievement.  For example, you can take several ridges in one battle, and in the next battle find yourself starting one whole ridge-line further back than what you captured at the end of the last.  It is a poor implementation of a campaign mechanic, and feels like an afterthought.This game is really a simplistic simulator of 10-15 minute skirmishes and lacks any depth.			"

												Normally I do not make a review for a game which I have played so little of. But from what I have seen so far, I cannot possibly recommend Ultimate General: Gettysburg.  Pros  -Concept itself-Acceptable graphics -Fitting soundtrack-Flexible customization in settings-Adaptable scenarios Cons -Terrible troop placement. Moving your troops in UG:G is a massive hastle. In order to do so, you must click and drag to where you want the selected unit to move. Sometimes I have experienced clicking on a unit and it not registering. I'd have to mouse back to the unit and click again, which wastes a huge amount of time relative to what I have available. Often times, that unit overlaps with the one next to it because it's pretty difficult to estimate the size of them when I'm trying to deal with 1800 men fleeing from 600 men and a single unit of arty (we'll get to that latter). When ordered to move a tiny bit ahead, the entire unit breaks from their organized battle line into a mob and becomes easy pickings for artillery and troops firing at them. -Horrendous system of 'morale'. Morale is impacted largely by the General and artillery. Yes, artillery, a normal part of 19th century warfare that these troops are accustomed to, will cause morale to drop in half after firing a few times. As mentioned before, I've had a unit of 1,800 troops retreat after a single unit of 23 arty fired one volley at them. This makes having engagements of any kind difficult, considering your troops will just break and lose 300 men.-Union forces definitely overpowered. Confederate infantry is absolutely abymsal and will get crushed by the Union every day of the week. One volley of union forces=200 fatalities in one of my unitsOne volley from my unit=10 kills. Yep,  10 . I counted. The opposing forces were only one level topographically higher than mine and yet they dominated my troops. It's absurd, historically inaccurate, and quite simply enraging. I can't play a campaign where even the most cautious and gradual tactics by me results in a pyrrhic victory at the most, and a 'major defeat' at the least.Some of this may be wrong, but it's what I personally saw and experienced. So, again, I cannot recommend this game on account of its poor mechanics and unbalanced nature. P.S: I have been playing strategy and grand strategy games for 6-7 years now. I am not someone who just started with the genre. I have 1,000s of hours in various titles and games from Total War to Crusader Kings.			"

												TL;DR version: highly recommended for Civil War or military history enthusiasts. Good AI, very good replayability from a dynamic campaign and many individual scenarios, and mechanics that force you to take into account the morale, fatigue, and cohesion of a unit instead of just its size.Full Version:Overall, I think this is a very good game. It reminds me of the 1977 Avalon Hill game Gettysburg's advanced game, which was a great simulation--just incredibly taxing as a board game. Making it a computer game instead hides a lot of the bookkeeping and tables that are involved in a board game, and the whole thing flows better. In fact, the mechanics are similar enough that I wonder if the people who designed this didn't look at the Avalon Hill game for inspiration, at least in part.The game is very unforgiving of mistakes, and forces you to keep track of your forces--not just their number of men, but their overall state as well. Troops have a ""Morale"" rating, which is their will to keep fighting, and a ""Condition"" rating, which is a measure of thier cohesiveness and fatigue. If Morale is depleted, the unit will break and run, and if Condition is depleted, it will be less effective at maneuvering and firing--accurately depicting the fact that Civil War combat relied a lot more on morale and unit cohesiveness than actual casualties to put a unit out of action. That brigade that just broke and fell back behind your lines can be sent right back into the fray, but you'll lose a lot of troops for very little gain.The campaign is something I haven't seen in any strategy game of this type--it's split into bite-sized engagements, in which you control a part of your army rather than the entire thing. Based on your performance in one engagement (and sometimes on general strategy decisions you make between battles) the game will decide the reaction of the AI general and generate the next scenario, in which you units' casualties, morale, and condition will carry over--so don't burn out your army on the first day.Speaking of the AI, it's actually very good. There are three different difficulty levels, and three different aggressiveness levels. They do make a difference in the AI's behaviour. I played the beginning of a campaign as the Confederacy with the AI on balanced mode--moderate difficulty and aggressiveness--and by the evening of the first day I controlled all of Cemetery Ridge except for the Round Tops. I started a new one on the same difficulty but with a defensive AI... and all of a sudden it didn't make counterattacks I could beat off and exploit, and I found myself running up against well-positioned troops that shattered my advancing units. It radically changed how the game played, and I always have to work to outmaneuver it, I can't rely on taking advantage of the ""idiot AI."" There's an array of individual scenarios, both historical and hypothetical, which let you try out a particular possibility without having to play an entire campaign to get there. Quicker, easier to get into (although the later scenarios put you in charge of more units, so you've got more to keep track of), and a good learning tool to use in the more drawn-out campaign battles. There are some bugs, like artillery seeming to forget the target it's been ordered to fire on, and the artillery in general is difficult to master (you almost have to be proficient in actual Civil War era gunnery). But the learning curve is worth it, and it puts you in the same shoes as the actual commanders. You feel the tension as you watch an attack go in or a lone brigade desperately holding until its support comes up; you feel the gut-wrenching pain as you watch the number of troops in a unit melt away, desperately hoping the attack is worth it. As a Civil War buff and reenactor, and as a military history enthusiast, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who falls into any of those categories.			"

												Highly entertaining, if a bit sparse. It's apparent that the developers took a lot of inspiration from Sid Meier's Gettysburg but this isn't a bad thing. The former game was released in 1997 and there's been a definite void for this type of game since then. The game is also very basic, lacking features and has a highly minimal UI. Could either be a design choice or from lack of developer experience but I can't say for sure. I do not know enough about the developer to come to a conclusion on that but, again, it isn't a bad thing. All that said, I can still highly recommend this game. It's fun, engaging, and the AI is actually a tactical opponent. TL;DR: If you want an RTS of the Battle of Gettysburg and don't want to play a game from 1997, pick this one up.			"

												As far as strategies go, this is one of the best out there.  Each battle you can be winning and loosing, and the results may come down to the line.  The campaign can be a long and brutal one, with each day starting based on how well or poor you did the previous day.The controls are easy to master, so you spend time thinking about strategy instead of figuring out how to control the troops, allowing you to jump right in.

												A great Civil War tactical/strategy game.  It clearly has some insipiration from the total war series, but built upon those mechanics to create a truly unique and memorable gaming experience.  The game has its bugs and balance issues, but nothing so overwhelming to not recommend the game to avid real-time strategy fans.  I hope they release a Ultimate General: Civil War game with a slew of new battles; they may not be as comprehensive or choice dependant as UG:G, but more battles and scenarios will be welcome.			"

It isn't exciting, with its 2D sprites persay, but its definitely challenging.I would recommend this game, 10/10.This game has come a very long way since the initial closed beta test, and is definitely worth $15.

												While I tend to prefer faster paced strategy games, Ultimate General was a fresh breath of air -- for a very short time. UG tested my patience. While the small sprite graphics are charming at first, I soon realized I had no indication of why certain troops were totally dominating another one. Even troops with hillside advantage and numbers can be mowed down for no real reason. The game needs to do a better job of visually indicating clear advantage or disadvantage. Computer AI is a lacking as well. Many times I'll try to move a troop to another location or to fight the enemy, but they'll just stand there idly by.  All of the troops start to blend into each other since they look so familiar. Zooming is almost useless. I gave it a shot.			"

												It focuses on just one battle, but does it well, giving you managable chunks to deal with in managable time frames, and lets you take a good amout of control within the historical restraints of the battle.  What could the Confederates have done to win?  What if the Union had been more aggressive?  What if Reynold's First Corps never had to fall back?  What if Longsteet took Little Round Top?  What if Early pressed his attack on Cemetary Hill in time?  What if Meade ordered an all-out counter attack on the third day?  What if Pickett's Charge had broken the line?The battle plays out depending on what you do, and you can very well play out an alternate history leading to signficant changes.			"

												I'd put this game at 4 out of 5 stars, and I consider myself a fairly harsh reviewer.  The thing you're paying for in this game is a deadly opponent that will match you in actual strategy.  The main selling point of this game from the standpoint of a war strategy veteran is the competency of the opponent AI.  The computer opponent has 9 different behaviors to choose from that act as difficulties.  This is in stark contrast to the strategy game norm where your ""difficulty"" options are based on enemy statsitic buffs to give it an edge over the player.  Your UGG opponent gets smarter, it doesn't become a sharp shooting bullet sponge.  The AI regularly does a tactical retreat into kill zones, provides screening fire for its units as it tries to out-flank you, and uses your line-of-sight restrictions to move troops about behind hills to hit you from weakpoints on the final two AI behaviors.  It is a master of defense and a ruthless attacker.The battlefield is nicely detailed and you'll gain a familiarity with the Gettysburg area that you didn't previously have.  Places like Cemetery Hill and the Round Tops will take on a new life as you progress through the stages of the battle and find yourself forumlating strategies to take some of the most famous defensive holdouts of the Civil War.  The single battlefield complaint is entirely valid, and I believe that's the one thing that stops this game from being a 5 star piece of art.  I can see how the limited area is good for the AI's ability and how it could become increasingly difficult to add in more battlefields and get the AI behaving well on all of them.  While you're always fighting on the same battlefield I would also argue that you aren't always fighting the same battle.I find that I got my money's worth a long time ago, but I still keep coming back to this game.  It's really light on micromanagement and focuses on grand strategy.  The controls are super easy and your units are fairly intelligent at doing things on their own- it is really easy to take long breaks from it and come back.  Recent updates to the game have made Confederate victory in this game very difficult to achieve on the last three difficulties (still haven't done it after 96 hours) and I find that I like having it around as an ""ultimate challenge"".  This is probably not a game you'll sink 1000 hours into, but I feel like the price point is more than fair. "

								Ultimate General Gettysburg is a masterpiece in the making.  So far it has met and surpassed all of my expectations while still only being in alpha stage and I would have not expected any less with Darth leading the way.

												Bought it as early access and I have loved it ever since. As someone who wished they still had their old Sid Meiers games, this game is the closest any game has come to replicating the feeling I had playing those games for hours. The difficulty of Scorge of War and Take Command are not here. This is trully an ACW game that you can jump right into and have some fun without alot of complexity, and I don't say that as a negative thing. This is a  well tuned, enjoyable little battle sim that delivers every step of the way. I hope that this game expands to include more battles, and if the early access was any indication of this developers commitment to the game/franchise I cannot wait.			"

												Definitely to be recommended. Every Total War Empire/Napoleon fan should give it a try! Battle mechanics are even more realistic, no fighting to the last man, but an ebb and flow of battle. Units rout and regain morale a couple of hundreds yards further back. Brilliant also that even unsupervised units react to dangers as they would have in reality by changing facing etc. so that the player does not have to go into the futile task of micromanaging every single unit on the battlefield.The AI is also an enemy to be reckoned with. It seems that the time that devs usually spent to increase the graphics of a game so that the player can scroll down to the last detail of a single soldier (honestly, how often do we do that when playing?) in this game is wisely spent on making the AI responsive and dangerous; different AI personalities can be chosen that increase the replay value of every single scenario. For its price the game is a STRONG BUY! "

Posted: May 24, 2016
												I like this game, yet I should also give a heads up to anyone expecting an accurate civil war simulation, in which this game isn't.Starting off with the bad, the UI is very basic and gives you no access to formations, or any way of helping my unit to defend itself, where in this time period there were formations a unit could use to defend themselves.  For exa; building fortifications, digging in, nothing like that is in this game whatsoever.  Fortifying was made an option in the mobile version, yet was left completely out for the original.Many can say ""UGG has great AI"" or ""UGG has fair AI"" however both of these are wrong to an extent.  The AI will always get a boost in casualty rate, no matter your choice for playing as the Confederates or the Union.  Selecting a more difficult AI type only results in more casualties for you, despite this AI using the same strategy/tactics as the AI below it.  The AI as a whole is capable of effectively attacking or defending, making it smart, yet higher leveled AI only seems to rely on higher casualty rates, nothing else.Bugs are terrible in UGG, from artillery disobeying your orders and switching to a different target despite it being in range of the target you wanted it to hit, or infantry not firing, etc.  These are common and should be fixed, they probably won't unfortunately.The game does a great job in accurately depicting brigades, generals, positions, how the units look, etc.Overall this an above average game, and I would recommend it if you can get past some of its faults and know anything about the history of the Civil War, or Gettysburg, but for the average person, I do not recommend this game.

												238 hrs on record playing, mostly single palyer. I followed the developments of this game in greenlight and was as giddy as a school boy when released. Having gone above and beyond a sane persons playing time on Empire and Napoleon T/W (3200hrs) with Darth's MODs i might add i've finally found a new addiction to satisfy my 18/19th century warfare. Being a student of military science and history i find this game pretty through in its portrayal and historical accuracies.  The game play is smooth(1 crash on record) along with the controls and at some points it feels like the game plays itself without any direction. The infantry is truly the queen of battle and the homewrecker here. Theres only been a few circumstances where  where i've scratched my head and wondered what a brigade was doing after i ordered it to do something else. Now for the hair puller, ARTILLERY. The king of battle, is not the king of battle in this game. True it does have some good times where they kind of act like they know what their doing but for the most part they are completely lost. Ive seen battery's stand there and do nothing while the brigade directly in front of it is getting its butt handed to them by another infantry unit or AI arty unit and then all of a sudden they'll start firing at a target half way across the map! There is no targeting at all, not like the infantry units. I've noticed 50 guns will all of a sudden start shootin at a retreating enemy with 9 men half way across the map while engaged in support role or counter battery fire. The AI's counter battery fire is accurate and can wipe whole batterys in one shoot. For the most part arty units just stand there and do nothing unless i place them up the butt of an infantry unit and of course they immediately start taking rifle fire and  begin dwindling away rapidly. And theres no quarentee even then that they'll open fire however they may be brave and instead start advancing through the infantry to set up and get slaughtered wholesale. Infantry will charge them and they may not fire even if loaded. Cannister fire by several arty units or more will stop an infantry attack and will cause significant caulalties but not necessarily in the game and the medium range shrapnel shot/cannister will devastate units while behind good cover. Also long range cannon fire seems quite useless as it does not produce any  significant loss in men or condition. I've observed long range fire might kill 1 man in 2 or 3 shoots. Lets see, what else. Oh, if i choose the ammo selection other than  auto it usually results in more lollygagging. I think that about covers the artillery but i might be forgetting something. The cavalry units dont really play a big role they can cause some serious havoc if handled properly. Im not really sure what the corps staff are suppose to do other than mark the general area of a corps and get in the way. I know your suppose to be able to move your corps with them but usually it just moves half leaving the rest. Cosidering the fact that they are the brass and suppose to have some kind of aspiring leadership qualities It would be great if we could use them as morale boosters for faltering units or reconditioning units resting. The sharp shooters dont really do much either except retreat rather quickly and they never rack up any decent number of kills. A lot of times they'll get caught between 2 brigades and just get decimated instead of staying on the flanks.  Still with all these little quirks i'll continue playing the game and enjoying it immensely. Hopefully some of those arty problems can get sorted out??			"

												I owned this game before it was cool. But seriously... it's a good RTS in a similar vein as the battles from the Total War series. It's my understanding (and the reason I bought this) that the guy behind Darthmod stuff made this. I'm always up for supporting indie developers and modders. My hour playtime gives away the fact that I wasn't too grabbed by the game. It's similar to Total War, but unit sizes are realitically larger. Any obviously, it's just the battle of Gettysburg. No state managing, building, etc. That actually drew me into the game a bit. I would love Total War type battles from the Civil War era. Unfortunately, and superfically, I find the inability to zoom in and watch individual units took away the fun of the game for me. If you like the Total War combat system, though, you'll probably like this game. Oh, and the AI is wonderfully more aggressive than Total War. I'm going to recommend it, especially if you can grab it for cheap.			"

												UPDATEDOverall 7/10.Tactical Gettysburg campaign, gets right the important stuff but it has some flaws.PROS+ Several days, several different scenarios within a campaign, that is what Gettysburg was and the game gets it right.+ Some interesting ideas to give commands to units, groups and so on+  An excellent way to set the AI ""mood"" and skill rather than more obvious and trite difficult levels.+ The tutorial is thorough and very helpful+ Recent patches have VASTLY imporoved the AI+ It truly feels like a battle, where tactics matter. It's not a mosh pit or a huge brawl (yes, that's you RTW2)CONS - The campaign is truly short, 2-3 hours tops unless you really screw up something. - The graphics are quite basics, and other than being gray or blue you can barely distinguish each unit. - Sometimes, moving from one scenario to the following one, the game ""forgets"" what you have accomplished in the previous one (""hey, I'm sure I held that hill! and that one too!"")

												I'm kinda torn about this game. The gameplay in itself is fine, it's just so little of it. The battle is in several stages, and your troops, position and enemies depend on how you fought previously and how many objectives you completed. If you're really into history, I guess that all those potential what-if scenarios makes sense and gives a tremendous replay value. It doesn't do that for me though. Still, the game is fine, if a bit expensive for it's short gameplay.			"

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg, is a brilliant game. Graphically it doesn't compete with any games of it's type really, but the strategy and thought that goes into it is just what Total War lacks. Ultimate General is a very diverse tactical game, where your mission is to pick either Confederate or Union, and win the battle of Gettysburg, which ultimatly saw the fall of the Confederate States. I am a Confederate supporter, so I always play Confederate. I am good at strategy games, but I am yet to win a Battle as the CSA. I came so very close, but their troops just aren't as devastasing as that of the Union. This game is very realistic, and it takes unit positioning into account well. A silly mistake could cost you a flank, and the AI has the intelligence to seek this opportunity. Confederate Units don't generally take as much of a beating, I have noticed. I have used 2 v 1 on good Union units such as the Iron Brigade, and only just won. Moral is a problem for the CSA, and I notice they are happier to run generally, than take a beating. I haven't yet found a tactic that works, it is a very challenging game. Where you place your units, height, cover etc, really matters, and judging it wrong will cost you, most likely. I really like this game, and it get's very intense towards the end just because of the sheer amount of units on the field. The battle is broken up into parts, and sometimes you have to take the decision to push on a certain position of he union army, seperatly from the full scale battle. Afterwards, you may be taken back onto the full battlefield with all of your armies, and all of the enemy against you, and you have to crush them ultimatly. I do find the time limits a problem, as I am not a very agressive player, and last time I was winning as CSA slowly, but the game ended as I ran out of time. It really takes a lot of practice, it is NOT an easy game to play, but it is fun. I reccomend it 100%, especially to those that like the game type, or the era. 10/10, the CSA will win some day...I am trying.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm really a big fan of developers because they're the creators of 'DarthMod' in Total War Series, they have improved the dynamic of the battle pretty greatly, AIs did not become dumbasses as before. And for this game is even better than many strategy games in the markets thanks to smart AI from both our side and enemy side. They react to incoming fire or movement, you don't have to babysit them all the time unlike other games. Also troops did not run away from the battlefiled when they were routed, they will run out of combat and take some rest. Every consequence you made will affect your next battle, if your army was devastated in the previous battle you will have a really hard time to fight the next one. Please do alwasys think thoughtfully before sending your army into the battle, otherwise they will die in vain.It's a really decent game for the early access better than any early access games I had played before, it didn't come with a ton of bugs. Anyway, it's not the perfect game at this moment because it still have some bugs that really drive me insane such as enemy skirmishers and calvaries ran into my line formation, they suppose to flank and harass not to run into directly, or I can't see the height of the terrain, so I cannot find a good spot for my artilleries.I recommend this game to every commander out there to play is game. It's only $10 atm, and the price will go higher when the final release come!10/10			"

Early Access Review
								Excellent Early Access game by one of the worlds best Total War modders. - Great and believeable AI with nine distinct playstyles. You can choose from one of them or have the game randomly pick for you and be surprised. - I was also pleasantly surprised at the strategic choice of how to continue the fight after my first victory: I got to pick from three distinct strategies that were possible after the outcome of the battle. Too bad there was no map (as far as I could tell) to review the battlefield in advance of this choice, it was just plain text. A small gripe though..- The game models arty like it should be modelled: hard hitting guns with solid shot, explosive shells and cannister shot, each with their own ranges. The enemy bunches up for an assault, you have seconds to reload the guns with cannister, your heart is pounding as the enemy line approaches... BOOM.. dozens of men fall victim to your shot. But will the battery survive the onslaught? Amazing stuff.- The damage dealt by charges, particularly on routing units by cavalry or in the flank, could use a small damage boost I think. Again a small gripe to what is otherwise a very, very nice early access title.The game at the moment of this review isn't done. A lot is still to be implemented. But for what is there, at 7,50 euro, you get a very new, already very complete battlefield experience. Scores 9/10 for me! "

Basically it's a less cinematic total war that's more in depth with tactics.  If you're into an RTS with a heavy focus on strategy then I strongly recommend buying.			"

												When I saw this sim on steam I immediately thought of Sid Meier's Gettysburg. This Ultimate General improves on only one aspect of the game over the Firaxis version: the AI. But here is the problem, in order to increase the difficulty, the AI does not get better, instead, the enemy units simply become more effective at killing on average. When the game is set to high difficulty, the disparity becomes absurd as weak Union units on the AI side deal damage at twice the rate of strong Confederate units when both are on open, flat ground. This would all be manageable if utilizing terrain was straight forward, but it's not. Some forests are better than others and it's impossible to tell which ones are better until you bring a unit into them. Then, when artillery are supposedly under 100% cover, enemy artillery are still able to rout them in only 5 or 6 salvos of solid shot from half a mile. No 3 inch ball fired half a mile is going to reliably hit its target especially if it is fired unsighted. Unless you memorize this game front and back, when playing at high difficult, be prepared to be surprised at how much damage you take and how little you can dole out. This is coming from someone who has won decisive and triumphant victories. It all makes the game incredibly unsatisfying.			"

Early Access Review
								Made by the creator of the famous Darthmod of the total war series, this game is the pinnacle of the strategy genre. Gameplay is fluid while not being too fast or slow. It is fast to learn and hard to master. A must have for strategists and ACW experts. The campaign can be played from either side, each side is unique in their gameplay style. With the confederacy being weaker alone but their commanders are much more effective at raising morale. The Union troops are much more disiciplined and well trained. The campaign is dynamic with each battle taking place in one day. At the end of each battle you get choices as to what to do next depending on the objectives you were able to take in that day. This includes many what if scenarios aswell as the historical ones.The graphics are beautiful, personally I am a big fan of sprites and this is a perfect example of how they can look good even in this day and age. The map is geographically and historically accurate while being living up to the artstyle of the rest of the game. The only downpoint at the moment, is the single battle in the game which is at the name suggests Gettysburg, however browsing of any of the forums shows you that the developers have big plans for this game, including other battles and time periods. It's a yes from me!			"

								I only have like an hour playing so far, but even only with that I feel confident enough about it to write this review.  If your tired of strategy games with dumb@$$ AI, then buy this game. I played my first battle against the ""balanced"" AI, which is about average difficulty.  The AI made me pay dearly for my mistakes.  It didnt cheat, it exploited oppurtunities I had left open for it. Each side of the conflict has pro's and con's.  And you must use them to your advantage.  This game really will force you to think carefully about each order you give and I love that.  It was awesome to see that the dev's wanted the game to be historically accurate.  The battlefield is amazing and recreated to look like it did in the real Battle of Gettysburg.  So far I havent encountered any bugs, but as I said, I'm only like an hour into the game.  If some do happen to occur I am confident they will be fixed.  On a side note, anyone who has played any of the Darth mod's for the Total War series will be familiar with the lead dev.  Having played the mod for Empire:Total War, buying this game was a must for me.  Do yourself a favor and get into this game now, while its in early access.  I cant wait to see what they planning on doing next with this awesome(so far) game.			"

												This is hands down one of the best authentic RTS out there.It's accessible, but certainly not a ""casual RTS"". Movement is slow, and much has to be pre-planned ahead when giving orders. Units cannot, and will not sprint from one end of the map to another if you make a mistake. It's a slow moving chess game where things must be planned in advance prior to executing them. Unit morale and cohesion must be taken into account before committing them into combat - and a good general is certainly well rewarded.Giving orders is as simple as clicking on a unit and dragging the desired path. Not only does this eliminate stupid pathing problems, the arrows drawn over the map visually shows you and reminds you the orders you have given, allowing you to see and organize the battle lines and battle rythm you intend on executing.10/10			"

												I went into Ultimate General Gettysburg with pretty low expectations. imediatly started the battle and chose to fight against a balanced AI, the middle choice out of 9 AI ( 2 axes with 3 levels each, one beign defensive to agressive, the other one slipped my mind)I was pleasantly and seriously suprised at how it was able to push me off a controll point and keep it defended against my counterattacks to force me into a minor defeat ( though I was able to kill more of them than they my troops the confeds had the superiority of numbers on the first day of course)  I decided to fight the entire battle from the side of the confederates against a random AI. after several engagements I ended up fighting the AI into a stalemate ( thus losing out on the confederate victory achievement) at the end of the third day, where it was revealed I had been fighting a defensive AI.mistakes might have been made waiting for reinforcements between the first and second day and to attack the union left instead of the right or the (historical) centre.a single soldier in a troop represents several soldiers, a number above a troop representing the actuall amount of soldiers so losing 5 or 10 soldiers might be represented by a single actuall soldier falling down. however the style and frame of the game makes this work perfectly, and as depressing as it is to see hundreds of troops break and run from the field (wich has happened to me several times when I sent them to hold  out or march against overwhelming odds)it is so exhilarating it is to see an entire enemy battery fall down to 0 men.If you like grand strategy games and want to test your mettle in one of the biggest and decisive battles in the history of the US civil war I would recommend this game and its amazing AI to you.

Short Summary: Great game! No flaws at all. Constantly updated. Value for money. Very informative. Very addictiiiiive. ""Armistead, Pettigrew i want your Brigades to committ to a full scale attack  on Cemetery Hill.You will suffer flanking fire but not for long...."" I usually dont write reviews on Steam. But this game deserves a review. This is the real- time strategy game I have been waiting for. Purchased it when it was still on Early Access. Still playing it now trying to master multiplayer.This is just the game for you if you like:-historically accurate Real Time Strategy Games-a good smart solid  and challenging AI ( there are 9 AI characters)-and if you were always dissapointed by the broken TOTAL WAR AI ( sry but with modding those games, namely with Darthmod, SP campaign was just ridicously lame)- the ACW Period- the battle of Gettysburg ( there are so many historical Details in the game, u truely feel emotional about leading those brigades on the actual historic map: "" Ah there comes Ewell Korps, time to flank Culp's hill via Bennetts Hill and show Schimmelfennig the road back to Prussia. But wait ill have to keep casualties to a minimum and save Gordon and the Tigers, which are two solid experienced brigades. I might need them for the later game. Shiat Stannards Brigade arrived. Wait nevermind I mean look at the Iron Brigade I shot them down to 600 already.Should be feasible.""^^)--No seriously theses thoughts usually come to my mind while playing. -games which actually are value for money (unlike other rip off games,especially those from the big and greedy companies,who actually give a sh*** about ur gaming needs )Some people complain about the graphics, I say: Who gives a f*** about the graphics. Graphics follows Gameplay! Btw this game was developed by Nick Thomadis,aka Darth Mod. He did a great job on his first project. The way this game is setup and created, shows a lot of potential for upcoming projects or sequals!THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE! Remember:Time you enjoy wasting, is not wasted time. -John Lennon			"

												this is a gemit's also one of those rare games where what you see in the trailer is what you get , so if you like the look of it i'dd highly recommend it.and don't think for a second you're only getting one battle, the battle is cut up in different stages the outcome of each stage decides how the next one starts allowing you to create your very own battle, the ai is great to and the has a great morale systemyou might be wondering why your 1500 man strong infantry regiment just got repelled by 800 yanks, until you realize your men have been fighting since the early hours and have lost 1000 men already. my only gripe is that there is no way to check how many the enemy's troops have lost leaving you to guess whether you're fighting 800 fresh troops or not unless you are an expert on the battle of Gettysburg. overall though i highly recommend this game to anyone. if you like the idea you'll like the game you don't need to be american to like this game but knowing a bit about the civil war increases your enjoyment tenfoldi'dd love to see a Napoleonic expansion like Waterloo for this now for my only negative points:-the controls are great overall however sometimes when trying to circle troops for selection you accidentally select 1 unit to walk in a circle  once you get used to selecting units it's no longer a problem though-the art style is great but the infantry lacks some variation, i'm no expert on civil war uniforms but i'm certain there was still some diversity between regiments at Gettysburg , the iron brigade or black hats for example are all wearing a blue kepi iirc and the southern infantry is very uniform compared to most images I've seen			"

												I whole heartedly recommend this game. While I don't find the game to have a lot of depth, it is one of the best casual RTS games I've ever seen. Improvements on the AI only enhance the enjoyment one gets playing against a competent AI for a change. And it's Civilwar based, an added bonus for me. I do wish the map design was a bit better, but it is adequate and does not detract from the focus, which are the units and moving them about the map. The on map action is colorful, busy and engaging.			"

												As a big Civil War buff and strategist, finding a game with either of the two is difficult. Sure you have the Total War games, but it seems to be missing the Civil War element. Whereas you have Darkest of Days, or the History Channel Civil war games, that are always wanting more. UG:G is a perfect game if you're looking for something like Total War, but on a bigger scale. The possibilities are literally endless. The historical factor, down to the unit size is amazing and it makes me so excited to see this on my home screen. Now that UG: Civil War is out, I'm looking forward to writing another positive review. 10/10 Would Crush the Union Again.			"

												'Ultimate General: Gettysburg' allows you to reign as the commanding general of the Union or Confederate forces partaking in one of the most bloodiest battles of the American Civil War.The game might be mercilessly difficult for some newcomers commencing their first day on the battlefield, but it also allows time for the player to learn through a mid-tier learning curve. The battles in the game are spread over a couple of days, with each battle lasting a set amount of time before troops from each side call to retire from exhaustion and replenishment.Orders made on the battlefield could have rippling effects on the outcome of the next few days, and the impressively smart enemy AI will constantly push the player to make split second decisions that can alter the course of the battle as a whole. Falling back from an important defensive position on the field might save a whole brigade from utter annihilation, but losing the position might prove very difficult for the player to retake it from the enemy, hence allowing the AI to use it as a staging area for the next days to come.Art in the game is pleasant to the eyes, and the gradient colours ironically allows a sense of relaxation even in the midst of stressful decision-making.In hindsight, the duration of the game is very short with a mere three hours of gameplay in my initial playthrough. However, this shortcoming is cushioned with some replayability in the game, as different decisions made in the battles can allow for very different outcomes and areas to fight on.Pros: Unique battle mechanics and gameplay. A variety of outcomes from players' decisions, offering a chance in replayability and exploration. Artstyle is pleasing.Cons: Gameplay is short, and might leave much to be desired. Learning curve might be steep for some players.All in all, 'Ultimate General: Gettysburg' offers unique and intelligent gameplay, and presents fresh battle mechanics that are properly executed and rarely seen in the tactical strategy games of today. I personally would recommend this game to fans of the genre, and dare say that this gem will leave an indelible impression on you.			"

												This is a cool little title. It reminds me of the old Sid Meier's Gettysburg. You control one side or another and the branching battle structure will put you in new positions depending on how you did in the previous battle. The basics of a simpler but still complex enough to be fun wargame are all here. You've got your troops, your skirmishers, artillery and cavalry and each has its place on the battlefield. It doesn't take long to learn but it might take a while to master. The maps are attractive - if a little too zoomed out - and fthere's some pretty decent tactical options here. The UI is great and it's easy to learn but tougher to master because you need to get your positioning right and know how to play to your strengths.At the same time, the game is very limited in scope. Because battles are broken up into small segments I never got the feel of playing the largest battle in the Civil War. There's no point where I commanded 100,000 troops on the battlefield and that's disappointing. I really don't care much about the units - they're just numbers to me - and the feedback on what's happening isn't always great. To be fair the game feels more like a tech demo and not a complete game. There's no strategic layer whatsoever and I feel like my ability to manuever into the right tactical positions is limited by the scenario structure.There's replayability here but I'm not feeling the need to go through it again. I like the engine but I'd like to see more of a game wrapped around it or have a few more tactical options. Still, the price is right so if this interests you I'd say pick it up.			"

								Honestly Ultimate general: Gettysburg matches and in some way exceeds the quality of total wars RTS battles. Deep tactical combat, smart AI, friendly user interface, and atractive art style, will aw you when you are in comand of thousands of soldiers fighting to win the hirstoric Battle of Gettysburg. This game is perfect for historic and or tactical gamers like me. The creator of Ultimate general: Gettysburg is not new to RTS games, he also created the darth-mod, a very popular mod for the Total War franchise. I find many Total war fans (me included) are loseing hope in CA. Maybe this can be a Plan B?			"

								Every now and then you a game that gets the flow right.I first heard about this game on Three Moves Ahead. If you like strategy even mildy go listen to these guys and be amazed by the sophistication these guys bring when discusing games. It makes me feel smarter just listening to these guysso, listen to http://threemovesahead.libsyn.com/episode-268-picketts-chargethen buy the game1. It can be played in short chunks. This is important for us gamers with jobs.2. Although it is RTS, IT CAN BE PAUSED. It is not a click-fest. Truth be told, as I play more i'm using the pause less and less because the controls are so fantasically simple yet capable. 3. It real gets the feeling of the horrifc give and take that you read about in the histories. The assualt on the same ridge and hill being contested every foot. It is frantic and frenetic. you fill it really is the pitched battle that it is known to be.4. This is the strategy game of the year. More people need to play it.  This team needs to be supported so we can get another game from them.			"

												I must say it is a very nice game despite the fact it's only a single battle, a very long one but a battle nonetheles. If Devs will release a turn based campaign with it like Empire TW or Napoleon TW than they've got my money. The map looks great though I'd like to see hills and ridges a bit more elevated to make it more obvious. The AI is simply the best I have seen in any game and whats more you can choose how do you want the AI to play (aggressive, defensive, cunning etc..)Animations are simle but for me it's good enough, I play zoomed out most of the time anyway and for me it always was about gameplay not the graphics or animations.Nowadays most  game developers focus primarily on graphics and dlcs while the gameplay and bugs are second on their list so its good to see UG Gettysburg being different.There is still a lot of room for improvement but because its their first game devs deserve a credit.Finally I want to say again: add a turn-based campaign map in the next game and you will become a huge competitor to the total war series (fingers crossed).

												I have beta tested this game for a very long time now, also played on live quite a bit.  This game had alot of potential to bring back the glory days of the old SM Gettysburg! However, the imbalances in the multiplayer and constant desyncing really killed any desire for me to play this game.The community around this game is soiled by ""Non-Gamer"" types, more concerned about what caliber the cannon graphics are instead of how the game actually plays. This game has ALOT of potential, and I hope one day it gets fixed. However, I highly doubt it.I have played atleast 20 multiplayer games, I have won every single one of them simply by playing the United States and winning on imbalanced maps.  However, if you try to validate that I am 20 and 0  you cant. The ladder function doesnt work and hasn't since release.I REALLY want this game to be good, I really miss the old SM Gettysburg! I just dont think there is any hope left.If this game could come out with a map editor, or the devolpers began to care about a competitive community it could be much better.			"

								Ultimate General: Gettysburg is something I have anticipated ever since i first found the website. Now that it is finally out I can say that it lives up to the hype I set for it in my mind. You can play as either side and it's really immersive with a fine variety of sounds and enough game to keep me going for the considerable future. Despite how amazing i have found it keep in mind I am a History fanatic and enjoy anything to do with the American Civil War. It still needs some work. A total war style campaign is a hope, but not a necessity. The ability to have different formations is something this game could benefit from greatly. A large mob is not exactly what I want all the time, sure there are formations that they form themselves in but I'd feel much more immersed if i could command them to do such things. Other than some minor bugs and a few little quirks this game is definitely worth a purchase even if you are only mildly interested. So much to offer so early in it's release. This is a early access game i hope turns into a full-release success. Buy it now.			"

Early Access Review
								One of the most innovative and easy accessible strategy games that I have seen in years. Ultimate General: Gettysburg is great mix of realism and fun, combined with a user friendly interface and simple, but perfect, game mechanics. The Battle of GettysburgThe setting of the game is centered, as the name implies, around only one battle: the battle of Gettysburg. One of the pivotal moments of American Civil War history. This was the battle in which General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, after a series of victories over the northern armies launched his second attack/invasion in Union territory. All preparations had been made to assemble as many men as the south could muster to decisively defeat the Union army in the north on their own soil just prior to the US presidential elections. The rationale behind this invasion of the south was to destroy Union morale and cause President Abraham Lincoln to not be re-elected for another term, opening the door for peace. Alternatively, if things would go extremely well, the objective would be to take Washington D.C. and thereby end the war almost immediately.On the 1st of July 1863, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and the Union Army of the Potomac met each other near the town of Gettysburg. The battle that would follow would be the largest of the entire conflict, ultimately resulting in a decisive Union victory. The game puts you in charge of the entire Union or Confederate Army from the earliest moments of the first day right through the entire multi-day battle that would be Gettysburg.First ImpressionsFrom the start you can choose to fight as the Confederates or as the Union, you start from the 1st of July when the first elements of both armies met each other at McPherson's Ridge. From then on it is you, the player, who decides how the battle will progress. The battle map has a unique art style that is very appealing to the eye. People that familiar to for example Total War games might feel that the graphics of this game are inferior. The difference is that where Total war puts emphasis on graphics and more lighter, arcadish entertainment, this game puts more emphasis on the more realistic tactical and strategic part of a battle. The graphics are therefore of lesser importance, but that does not mean that they are bad. As a matter of fact I very much liked these graphics as I think they are functional and allow the player to have a good impression on what is happening on the battlefield. Battle Phases and MapThe aim of the entire game is of course to win the battle, either as the Confederates or the Union. However, in order to win, the entire battle is divided in a number of days/phases as are many battles throughout history. You start out on day 1 with mostly a skirmish between the elements of both armies for control of the western ridges of the town of Gettysburg. On the map each objective has victory points. These are the points one needs to capture in order to win that phase of the battle. The amount of time in which you can achieve this is limited usually to half a day, which progresses quite slow in comparison to other games on the market. This game therefore actually feels much more realistic and gives you way more time to think over your tactical strategies. During each phase you might get reinforcements as they approached the field at certain time during the real battle. Your handling of the situation finally determines the how the battle will progress. For example, if you capture more key objectives, such as Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill as the Conferates, during the first day of the battle this might result in an early victory. Between each phase of the battle you will have multiple tactical decisional options available that can be historical or not, depending on how the battle went thus far. Units that were in battle earlier and  that suffered losses or are on low morale or exhausted, which is abstracted by a unit morale and condition parameter, will inherit this status to the next phase. This gives much more tactical depth to your decisions. Do you push hard and capture key objectives early on with many losses or play more conservative with the risk of losing momentum? Do not forget: enemy reinforcements could still turn the battle even when you are already celebrating victory or in despair. It is these details that make this game stand out from many other strategy games I have played over the years.UnitsUnit commands are simple, yet effective. You simply click a unit and drag and drop a line along which they can move. You can also group multiple units and move them together and units will automatically form up formations depending on how far they need to move. If they need to march a long distance they form a column and form a line when getting closer to combat or their final destination. You can have units walk or run, though running will reduce their condition, thereby making them less effective in a fight and letting them rout more easy. Also units can be forced to hold, which will force them to stay at their location and only move then either ordered or routed. Objects on the map, such as woods, houses or stone walls will give units cover, which is calculated by the cover parameter. High cover reduces the chance of getting hit, which can be vital to give your units the edge over the enemy in firefights. Units can also be ordered to charge, though the outcome can be unpredictable. Charging towards cannister shot loaded cannons might not be such a smart thing. However charging with rested troops into weakened enemy troops holding a position can be a great way to quickly take an objective and gain ground. Here the key is to do the right stuff at the right time and moment. An all out charge with all troops will likely result in a defeat, so picking your battles even within a battle is vital to success.The AIWhen you start a new game you can choose the opposing general's attitude. You can pick many different attitudes, which are distributed in two ways: difficulty and aggressiveness. You can thus have for example a difficult defensive opponent or a balanced one. On the field you can notice the difference between these attitudes. This therefore means that the Union will not always be on the defense only, as was mostly the case in the historical battle under the risk-avoiding Union general Meade. The same goes if playing for the Union, though the Confederates will always attack on the first days, the attitude can matter on how aggressive an opponent is. More difficult opponents tend to flank more and more aggressive opponents tend to charge more often or place their guns closer to the front line. The AI is therefore a welcome surprise and you will find the AI not a pushover, though as a human I must admit I tend to finally win, though individual phases of the battle can be lost.Closing CommentsUltimate General: Gettysburg, is a great game that is still being developed as we speak. It combines excellent tactical decision making with realism all coated with decent graphics and art. The sound effects of the game are functional, but not special. The simple handling of units works well and the slower pace of the this game compared to other tactical war games allows for easy control of the units and a very to-the-point system. The AI is good and the different attitudes that can be set, combined with your own different handling of the battle, gives the game more replayability. The multiple battle phases/days and dynamic tactical options between each phase allows for more freedom of choice and again adds to replayabilty and depth to the game.Though only as of now, one battle, this battle was been implemented the most user friendly and best way I have ever seen from a game. I hope the team that makes this game will continue to add battles in future. I would say for strategy fans, this game is a must buy.			"

								First of all I want to give this proudly under-stated development team the long over due credit it deserves. You all are definatly showing your impressive chops with this submission. As not only a gamer of 3+ decades but also an avid historian this Gettysburg ... I guess the word is expected to be ""Simulation"", but that can hardly do it justice at all. I personally see this as more of a virtual re-enactment game. Case in point I have read this product to be rather over compared to Sid Meirs Gettysburg from nearly a decade and half ago. I can not agree with that assessment at all. Apples and oranges. I have played that game on a Win. 98 pc and an emulator very recently. If that era is classical Greece. This game is Victorian England. Pax Britainia may lack the unity and tradition of it's predicessor however the one thing it has in spades is adaptability. In it's present form this title has about three great innovations going for it and about 5 that are heinously broken. Three of which I think will get smoothed out in time.Pro's:#1 The graphics are atleast as fluidic as the gameplay. To some this may be a no-brainer but as I have noticed over the decades. Games that look awesome often play like crap. Tweak report: Better zooming in and out. Overlay FMV scenes for special events. (I.E devils den, little round top.)#2 Commanders and regiments are not only diverse in character but also manage to perform true to the peroid specific level of technology. (In english that all means that instead of rapid fire shoot and scoot, we are getting an almost 'real-time' 3 shots a minute line of battle.) In previous game's of this era you could easily creep toward the enemy and push them away. If you try that with this game you're likely to get half your regiment shot up. Very true to form indeed. Kudos. Tweak report: Please don't take this as a critism but command units, especial cavalry, of the post napolionic era were attached to there units. Litteraly could not go more than about 50 yards away from the captain or Major in line of battle. If they did NOBODY had orders or knew what direction to go. It was all done by a rather rediculous web of riders, runners and couriers. Through out the civil war walkie talkies could have saved THOUSANDS of lives. In game terms. The little horse command units that tend to wander all over Pennsylvania until a skirmish unit kills them are about as usefull as titts on a bull unless directly attached to something dependant on moral. The exception to this is of course Artillary. They did not have upper ranking officers. The were drawn by individual division commanders.#3 Objective points that are actually worth fighting for rather than just over-running on the way to destroying the enemy. Straight forward, basic and to the point. The difference between an educational game and a fun one is in the details. Finally a game where you can really get a feel for making the opponate ""Pay for the same real estate twice"" as G. Patton would say.Cons: As of my writing this, these are the bugs and glitches that I personaly feel need the most attention. I will try to by pass the ones that have already been brought up by others.#1 Stick-man-mania. Most all RTS games have had this problem in one form or another since the dawn of Pong. In battle, troops DO NOT move as one no matter how well deciplined they are made out to be. Some stop and stand in place. Some fall down and stand back up. Others soil them selves and run off screaming like there sister. A formation of 'soldiers' that is prone to be a block with a hit point rating is VERY easy to manipulate into doing whatever the heck you want it to do all the time. A phenominon that has happened in battle pretty much... NEVER. And even worse tends to lose it's fun value. Tweak report: Perhaps incorporate a chaos responce matrix into individual regiments. No more or less than 13% will react to something like being green battle fatigue or of course the rebel yell. Johny reb was not as well fed and would have less stamina but more likely to make a stand against a larger force. Billy Yank has the mini-ball and more acurate at range but also went into Gettysburg with annoying little problems like alarmingly poor morale and a language barrier.#2 Terrain perspective confusion. This may have just been me doing something wrong... But I had a regiment on one side of a grove of tree's trading shots with an enemy on the other side of the grove of trees and I'll be darned if both sides were not getting shot to hell. Rivers / streams seem about as hindering as roads. Buildings can be walked through as though they are not there... etc.#3 No capture or bayonete melee. I imagine this will be on the top of the list to fix, however I just wanted to add the idea that their seems to be a charging, routing then they turn and fire at you thing going on... ALOT!All just my respective two cents. Looking forward to coutless hours of fun with this. Hoping to see such expansions as Antietem, Fredricksburg, Vicksburg to name a few.Jim "

Early Access Review
								Alright so i have not played this game for long.....yet. I know i will play it much more though as it is a fantastic game. You know Rome 2 and the absolute horrible AI? Well this game is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE in a way that is hard to describe. I wouldn't say it is like fighting some other person, that is a bit of a stretch, but it is amazing. It seems as though it ""adapts"" to the situation at hand and it always provides a challenge. While the game is only a few segments long (depending how good you are) it has quite a bit of replayability in it. Did i mention the graphics? While not phenominal, i do quite like the scale and ""smallness"" of the units and bulidings on a huge map. The only gripes i have are probably the uselessness of cavalry as they seem to run away from everything, the game seems to be semi-fast and is kind of hard to keep control of, and the fact that some battles can seem to drag out forever because of the semi-broken morale system that seems to make people run away at random (or atleast, in my experience). Also there will be multiplayer in APPROXIMATLEY 2 weeks (at the time of writing) which sounds very fun and i can't wait. THIS GAME, IN ALPHA ON THE FIRST UPDATE, gets a 9/10			"

												- charges will only kill your entire units and never succeed even againt one weakened attillery gun, horses will simply never be able to get to the enemy unit before retreating or will simply wait there to be shot- artillery is totally useless except the very short range cannister that never hurt your infantry even if they stand right before your guns- 2000 men shooting a single art unit when they are reloading will lose miserably with the artillery unit still intact- not realistic at all, you cant even kill enemy generals- hard to play, honestly- many more listed in other evaluations			"

Great value, with an entire campaign, dozens of individual battles and a few ""what if"" scenarios. A must-buy for the civil -war lover, or any lover of tactics.			"

Early Access Review
								Did you like Empire/Napoleon Total War, but disliked the terrible ai that just rushed in a big blob and never did anything that made sense? Did you also hate the awful controls that made managing your units a chore? Ultimate General is the polar opposite of that. Writing this, I have only played for a short while, but already the battles are much more enjoyable and challenging than Empire/Napoleon Total War ever was. After spending years fixing Creative Assembly's mess, Nick Thomadis, the creator of the Darth Mod for various Total War games, decided to make his own game and the result is this. The ai is intelligent and fights hard and your own units manage just fine without you micro managing them. Leaving you to take care of the larger plan. The controls are streamlined, in a good way, instead of having to micro manage your unit's formation and making sure that they won't die the moment you move away, you give more general commands and the ai figures out the rest intelligently. I never had to tell my troops what to attack specifically, only where to go. They made good choices on their own. That doesn't mean you just sit and watch the battle unfold. You still have to make sure that your troops are in the right places to ensure victory. The game does allow some micro management but it is often not needed.Game is still in early access, but already it is a lot of fun. With the addition of multiplayer it can only get better.Highly recommended, especially to those who are looking for a game with great ai. For real this time.			"

												The first hour or so of this game was frustrating. The developers did not include much in the way of a game guide or tutorial, however Dartis actually has an awesome tactical guide on steam. You can find it  at this link .If anyone is having trouble with this game, or finds it to be flawed I highly recommend reading this guide. It goes into detail about things like condition and morale, which play a huge role in charges, retreating, etc. Once you know these concepts god damn does this game become fun! The past 10 hours (as of now) since the first hour I played has been only enjoyable.It is tactical, brutal, tense..the ground in front of you changes hands six times, canister shot after canister shot being poured into the lines. makes me excited just thinking about it.This is a game of patience and maneuvering. It is a fair amount of stand and fire, fallback and replace the line with reserves, and so on, just like the actual civil war. However a cunning, opportune massed charge or flank attack can break through and roll up the enemies line. The important thing is being able to utlize this advantage, which in the actual civil war was sometimes not taken advantage of (as in, a charge that broke through had no real plan for afterward and would be repulsed).So it is purely a strategy game. What will you do after breaking through? Do you have reserves to follow up? Are you going to/have you created a salient? This game reminds me of chess in some ways, in that each move must have a larger plan, must have something it is following up, and you must be ready to counter any move the opposition may make.No game is perfect but in terms of pure, straight-forward strategy with a fantastic historical flair,  Ultimate General: Gettysburg  comes pretty dang close.

												I'm only giving this a thumbs down at the moment while I await improvements, mainly more variety.The game itself has a very good look and fun gameplay for the most part, but it is a little weird having an RTS for Civil War battles. Being that RTS games are speeded up or contstrained to very small areas for gameplay sake, it makes this Civil War battle much, much more frantic to play than the actual battle would have been for the area covered.And RTS should really cover a much smaller area with troops that move very slow in real life. Or as other have said, larger maps are better as TBS games. But it is what it is.The main complaint is the single battle content. Simply way, way, way too little. I read than an antetam battle is coming, but this game should have launched with at least a half dozen battles if not twice that many. One battle seems like an early access tech demo, not a finished game. I'd pay DOUBLE the price for more content.So I'll re-review when/if the content amount is boosted up.			"

Other gripe is that the LOS for artillery can be finicky.  But excellent game overall!!! make one for the napoleonic wars!			"

This game is unique and innovative while being perfectly balanced and easy to learn; it succeeds in introducing a completely original style of gameplay and is, at the same time, an exquisite, scholarly, sensitive essay on the dynamics and circumstances of the Battle of Gettysburg. And while accomplishing all these goals, which on the hands of many studios are plagued with design flaws, Ultimate General gracefully delivers a clear, engaging experience that has depth, character and substance while being superbly intuitive and dynamic.  My hat is off to Mr. Thomadis and the team: you guys  have created a classic. Thank you!			"

Posted: January 16, 2015
												I've played a lot of strategy games, and being an avid history nerd, mostly historical ones. From Rome: Total War to Civ 5 to everything inbetween by every developer to every time peroid. From Paradox Interactive to Relic games, from World War 2 to the Antiquity. I've also had the pleasure of playing Darthmod's amazing mods for the Total war series, my particular favourite being the Empire and Shogun II Varient. In short, I have no life. After announcing he was going solo on his own project a while back, I was surprised when I saw this pop up in my recommened list, as it had sort of gone under the rader for me. I picked it up in the Christmas sales, and gave it a whirl. I have only a faint intrest in the ACW, but I knew enough about Gettysburg and the scale + importance of the battle to be interested. What a shock I was in for.Firstly, I was struck by something that CA and others have dragged it's feet on for so long now, and that's proper AI difficulty. You can choose to face AI who is Risky, Defenesive, Caustious or Aggresive to name just a few, and it also gives you the option to face a Random AI charateristic, as well as the option to boost the AI. Something as simple as this can add a lot for replay value, not to mention be incredibly fun.Upon loading in the game (Confedrate naturally, because nothing beats shouting ""YEEE-HAAAA!"" at the top of your lungs in a Mississippi accent charging into canister shot), I was presented with a nice clear tutorial, and thrown into it. It took me three tries to beat the first day of the battle, but it was the most fun I've had with an RTS ever. The controls were so fluid, giving orders was simple, the terrain  and line of sight mechanic were so easy to understand due to simple lighting effects, the combat was brutal, and by using a simple casulty ratio to dead sprites, you could fit the realistic amount of men without feeling the map was cramped,  and the continuation from day to day with yesterdays resources was a really nice touch. I emerged with a minor victory and a beard Grant would envy after 3 days of bloody mayhem , but I was proud as punch. The Map in the game is a piece of art, with the terrain and hills being prominent features that look and feel important. Historical POI's  and landmarks are all labelled (everything is labelled in fact) , so for the history nut it's really a great insight into what sort of conditions the battle was fought in. The noise the battles produce feel real, with rifles peeling and cannons booming. Projectiles and impacts fly around the place like rain, with thousands of men firing volley after volleys into each other. It feels and looks epic. There are a few drawbacks. The game is still realtively new (not ALPHA new, but new new) and bugs exist, sometimes controls can glitchy (especially with cavalry), Multiplayer can be cruel, and considering your playing nearly 10 euro for the 3 days of Gettysburg, I feel it's a little much to ask for. However, I'm happy to give it over beacuse the game is being patched all the time, and for the first time since the bitter dissapointment of Rome II, I'm really looking forward to seeing forward what comes after this. So, in conclusion, buy this game because not only is it the most realistic ACW battle simulator I have ever seen, it's also breaking ground in a rather stagnant strategy genre, and it's beautiful to watch. TL;DRBuy this game, so you too can know the joy of being a Southern Gentlemen (the best kind of gentlemen) whilst losing your entire army beacuse you risked Pettigrew's brigade charging up a hill and forgot you had cannon reserves somewhere to the rear. But God Damn, it looked spectacular didn't it?  "

												Who doesn't love a good flanking? With Ultimate General: Gettysburg (made up subtitle: 50 Shades of Gray and Blue), you can bust out all the clever flanks, quick marches, and brave hilltop stands that your little 19th century heart desires. I won't go over the same ground everyone else has trod a hundred times, so if you want to see about tactics, history, or cute little pointer arrows, see the other reviews. What I want to talk about is fun. The game is fun. Period. Like many people who are both reading this and over 30, I enjoyed several copies of Sid Meier's Gettysburg until they wore out and/or technology made it obscenely difficult to play, unless you download these 14 programs and employ a wizard. Along comes this game, which has apparently been dubbed ""UGG"" by people who are bad at thinking things through (seriously guys?). The playability is easy to learn and more importantly easy to work under pressure. So you'll have plenty of time to watch closely for attacks, counter attacks, feints, troop movement, and all the swirling of mayhem and chaos that is a Civil War era battlefield. As well as plenty of time to scream at your troops to  ""MOVE DAMMIT! The Rebs are coming!"". Just like a REAL general. Multiplayer is a growing and fun experience as long as you plan to play before 9pm PST, because apparently everyone else is asleep after that. Perhaps dreaming of more charges and attacks. Maybe even dreaming of wrenching the controls from the esteemed Historical Gamer, so that maybe his division will face the right freaking direction at some point in the battle. Either way, matching wits against a fellow time displaced tactical thinker is always a treat, from the most nail biting battle of wits to the ""Oh for the love of God he just rolled right over me with two divisions and a light cavalry.""It's worth playing. It's being improved constantly. It's growing. It's a ton of fun and a great mental exercise for the person who missed out on the ability to send tens of thousands of young men to their deaths for glory, honor, country, duty, and about 10 cents a day. Just play the damned game. And seriously Von Gilsa! Why won't you MOVE!			"

It's a ton of fun and a great mental exercise for the person who missed out on the ability to send tens of thousands of young men to their deaths for glory, honor, country, duty, and about 10 cents a day. Just play the damned game. And seriously Von Gilsa! Why won't you MOVE!			"

												A previous modder of Total War games did what CA could not - make a proper AI.If you like strategy, RTS, planning, tactics, etc., then you should consider getting this game as well.The reason for this, is that this game has the best AI I have seen in a game. Ever. It's capable of adapting, taking the advantage, and so on, just like real human players could.And if you're not that big a fan of RTS, and so on, then this could still be a good start. It's a simple game, has a nice artstyle, and is quite unique. Since the game is simple, you can quickly learn the controls, and get right to it.9/10, considering the size of the game, genre, etc., in my opinion.			"

												It's a very simple and very good game. Simple?Yes, cause it's very easy to control. You move your units just by drawing them over the screen, you can turn them by holding the mouse button and there are just a few additional orders like 'charge' or 'fall back'.And that's it?Yes sure, and no! There's much more!Compared to most other titles of the genre this game has a very high level of strategical and tactical depth. The morale system is very complex. The positioning of the units has to be thought out well. Even the strongest brigade will route at some point when it's getting attacked in the flank. And a general always has to ask himself if his troops are able to perform the given orders or if he demanded too much and sent them on an impossible mission. From this point of view the game isn't simple at all.Btw the developers are still working on it, improving the game, adding new features and functions. Thus the game will get even better....edit: meanwhile there's also 'Ultimate General: Civil War' which includes a full campaign			"

												Darth has struck gold with this one, what all the Total War games wish their combat was like. I never thought I'd get this many hours out of one three day battle, but I honestly feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. I only have two complaints, 1) I wish you could play out the entire battle in a multiplayer, instead of just individual little battles. 2) Sometimes your troops do dumb things, like can't shoot down a hill at an enemy right at the foot of the hill, or break and run towards the enemy, instead of away from them. But I'm sure those issues will be fixed in future updates. I'd be interested to see maybe something like Ultimate General: Somme, or maybe something really ambitious like the entire Civil War or maybe World War One, Hopefully, if the developer decides to do something like that, they have the sense to stay well away from World War Two, as that's honestly way too overdone. Anyway, I really recommend this game to any fan of wargames, or RTS's. Keep up the good work Devs.			"

												This game has the hardest game A.I. I have ever played agianst. It goes up there in difficulty with games such as castlevannia and dark souls, even on the lowest difficulty the A.I. is no push over. there are no gimmicks or tricks to be used agaisnt he A.I. the comabt system is like a catch 22 since the south has superior morale and the union has superior fire power so most ingagements go as the following . 1. the south aproches the union line 2. the fireing goes on for about 30 minutes (in game) and the south retreats under the unions fire power then the union tries to capitilise on the retreat. 3. then the south regains their morale and then charges the union lines marching forward, since the union has inferior morale the union line buckels and retreats to thier original postions. 4. repeat the process.  But that does not take away from the games amazing game that it is. so if you are looking for a challenge then this is it if you have a day to spare learning the mechanics.			"

												I LOVE military history and this does not disappoint.  Accurate locations and people.  Now, how does it stack up to other games?  I set the bar for realistic, history based, strategy war games at Company of Heroes.  If you haven't played it, it is one of few games that get a 10/10.  Really the only things I dislike are the fact that sometimes the controls are a bit clunky.  Also, there are some things in the game that need explaining that are not explained within the game.  I had to go outside of the game to find out what they meant and how they affect the battlefield.  The game IS fun, make no mistake.  It cannot receive a 10 because it is not deep enough.  There are plenty of units that work well against other types but I think it could use a little tweaking.  I bought it for $6 and its been worth every penny.9/10The civil war was not fun.  This is.

												I have to say I'm quite impressed with this little gem. The AI alone gives the Total War series and all other strategy series a run for their money. After playing multiple RTS and Strategy games, I'd have to say this game has the best AI. They react to your every move, won't give up a hill or position without a massive fight (Depending on how aggressive or defensive you set them to), and WILL exploit every little weakness in your defenses. Even though the game only centers around 1 battle, this battle will last for hours as you struggle to attack their lines while defending your own, and capturing strategic positions such as hills. AI aside, the game is quite simple. The graphics aren't amazing, but they do have their charm. The historical detail with actual events (e.g. Pickett's Charge), and where every division and every brigade has the appropriate commanders with little portraits for almost all of them (Most artillery commanders have no portraits) is pretty awesome. There's a few issues with the order giving system and a bit of a learning curve with how to move troops, as it's not just a select and then right click where you want them to go type of system, but once you learn how to not mess up the unit movements, it runs and plays amazing. If you are a Civil War Buff, or someone who loves intense strategy games with impressive and cunning AI, by all means, buy this game.			"

												A great solo and multiplayer game presenting the Battle of Gettysburg as a branching mini-campaign of engagements in part of the field taking part of a day.  Each fignht shapes the next, offering alternative historical paths that can keep the game fresh over the years.  There are also extra maps, many prepared precisely for balanced multiplayer action.  The UI controls are straisghtforward and easily used, and the action can be paused for reflection by the player at any time. The AI (v1.7) is impresssive with alternative AI commander personalities that have different playstyles, and each scenario is playable in the range of half an hour. I recommend this to anyone with an interest in wargaming or the the Civil War, and as a thoughtful gift to give to anyone who enjoys such an interest.   "

								 Short, sweet, and loads of fun! Crush the dastardly Yankees at Gettysburg and secure victory for the Southern people!   An RTS, Ultimate General: Gettysburg is a really well made game. Players are given predetermined troops who must seize certain objectives on the battlefield. The landscape is beautifully rendered in a clean, vibrant style. At the end of the battle's time limit (which may be delayed for certain reseans), scores are tallied to determine the victor. Casulties (I believe) are carried over into the next battle. The Iron Brigade was crushed in the first battle and practically ceased to exist (take that Lincolnites!). Before the next battle, the player is given two option to choose from on the overall goal of the next battle (seize Seminary Ridge, hold Culp's Hill, etc). Even as such a short game, this creates a lot of replayability. First time I played (Dixians of course) I narrowly lost. Second time round was an epic victory with 37,000 Yankee casulties to the South's 25,000. ""Field promotions all around! President Davis will be most pleased.""     I really hope this same system spawns sequels. Ultimate General: Sharpsburg, Ultimate General: Atlanta Campaigns, and Ultimate General: Spanish Fort and Fort Blakely would not only be epic but extrordinarily unique!   For the South!			"

								This is a great game, well worth the $10 to purchase it.  As someone who has nearly passed the Gettysburg Liscensed Battlefield Guide exam, missing the cut by three quetions, I can say that this game is a real treat for the historian as well as a casual gamer.  This game mixes historically accurate scenarios with the always wonderful what ifs.  The playing field is wonderfully detailed, included much lesser known landmarks than your traditional game would have included.  Ultimate General Gettysburg takes me back to the days of playing Sid Meirer's Gettysburg.  The two have quite a lot of similarities, so if you are familiar with Sid's version you can see how this game plays.  The only draw backs to this game that I have come across are two things.  One: you only get brigade command and not individual regimental commands, so the tactical command in battle is kind of simplistic.  Two: the brigades aren't historically accurate to the condition of the troops.  In several scenarios, Brockenbrough's brigade, which in real life was poorly lead and filled with lesser quality troops, but in this game they will stand and fight almost to the last man; meanwhile crack units will retreat after the first volley they receive.  Other than those picky critiques this game in extremely entertaining and is a pleasure to play.			"

								These game is what Empire:TW & Napoleon:TW should be. I mean in terms of battles of course, not strategic level. In contrast to TW series about XVIII-XIX century what Ultimate General has? Firstly, it has really nice enemy Al which can adapt to changing situation on the battlefield( but don't worry it's not so hard, you just don't feel like you're playing with a moron). Secondly your units Al, you don't have to watch after every of yours units because you afraid that they make something stupid. For example - artillery units don't shoot through allied units (gods, I hate that in E:TW, moment of inattention and your art is ripping through your infantry units because they stand too close). Next good thing is 2D graphic, but it is only my opinion. I don't need beatifull 3D graphic in strategy game. Of course it's nice feature for a game, but you admire your pretty 3D soldiers only for 5 minutes and after that you're playing in max zoom out mode. In addition to these things these game just got multiplayer patch ( just 2 maps by now, but playing with human is always better than with a machine).And these all fine features and many more cost only 7,49 euro. It is really admirable that people from Game Labs don't charge full price for game in early acces.			"

The AI is like I've never seen before in a strategy game.  Wow.  Elevation, condition, cover, morale, positioning, all of it is important in executing your tactics.  I look forward to its finished release and to further products by this company.  This game has a breakthrough in artificial intelligence that other grand strategy game companies can learn from.  Additionally, civil war games usually involve only two factions: Union and Confederates.  Ultimate General Gettysburg does not get boring!  Two factions, yes.  But the strategy is a blast.

								This game is priced appropriately, if not slightly to the purchaser's advantage. For what you pay for and what the dev delivers, you get a pretty darn sweet little game.  The game's menus are simplistic and easily read and understood.  The graphics are simple, yet clean and fitting for a game like this.  Terrain plays a proper factor in battle.  Troop movement, for the most part, works how it should, and tactical decisions seem to have an impact on the battle.On the other hand this game has a few flaws.  Ive been able to completely push Union forces beyond the edges of the map without having a quicker, more decisive victory.  I have to maintain a certain distance from the edge of the map, in order to kill the forces more effectively.  Also the Confederate troops seem to retreat an awful lot in close quarters and during charges, despite having greater numbers than the defending units being fought.  General Davis' troops, in particular, seem to retreat almost every time I send them into battle.  Overall the game is great, but with a few various AI flaws.  The dev is, however, actively developing this game and updating it regularly, so I am quite happy with this purchase, and do suggest purchasing this game before the price increases.(I have updated my scores after the last few updates)Graphics - 8.25 (Rated this high based on the subject matter and stylistic approach of the dev)Gameplay - 8.4 (This should only increase as the game reaches its full potential)Replay Value - 8 (Multiplayer hs been added, but is still new)			"

								Downloaded the game 5 days ago and I have spent hours playing this game.   I have played every Civil War PC game that has ever come on the market and I think this game has a lot of potential to be the best one.  There are only two recommendations so I am going to go with a ""thumbs up"" but if there was a ""so-so"" button I would press that. Again, this game has the potential to be the best and it looks like the makers of this game are constantly improving it. <h2>Pros:</h2><b>Ease of Gameplay/Movement</b>I was able to start playing this game from the moment I downloaded it. There was little to no learning curve at all.  They have made the controls so easy, a caveman could do it. Its very easy to move troops around and position them where you want them to be. <b>No Limber & Unlimber</b>Limbering and unlimbering your artillery makes for a more realistic gameplay. That is something artillery really had to do. However, when you're in the heat of battle and being overrun by a charge, its redundant and annoying to have to keep doing that to every artillery brigade. I forgot to do it sometimes in past games.  This is a detail that I am glad they left out. The AI just does it for you. It still takes a little time for them to get going but you don't have to press a button for them to do it. <b> Multiple Scenarios, Both Historical and What If </b>This is something most Civil War games have but it seems like this one has more ""what if"" options available. I have been to Gettysburg twice and know the layout well. Never heard of Benner's Hill. So I got to learn something new. <b> Accurate </b>All of the names, Generals and locations are accurate to the letter.  Impressive when you consider the developers are all from Eastern Europe. You can tell they spent hours doing their homework on even seemingly insignificant details.  Even the farms are labeled by their proper game. <b> Fun Gameplay...At Least Initially</b>If I were to give the gameplay a fun rating from 1-10, I would give this one a 6. Despite some faults that I will point out in a minute that annoyed me as I got into it, this is an overall fun game to play, at least for the first couple hours. <h2> Cons </h2>Here are some things that I think definitely needs to be fixed for this game to be great. They were not apparent during the first few hours but as time went by, got really annoying. <b> Confederate Army Has Obvious Advantage </b>This is a complaint that some other players have said and after playing with both armies, I totally agree. The CSA has a distinct advantage over the Union. <em>Background: Sorry if its long but I think it needs to be said. At the start of the war, the CSA had a distinct advantage in generals and quality of soldiers. Many of the generals had experience with the Mexican War 13+ years back and the men who made up southern army handling guns from the time they could walk. What's more, people from rural backgrounds will most likely be able to handle the rigors of long marches, lack of food, lack of adequate shelter and stress much better than their city counterparts.</em><em>Having said that, as the war drew on, this advantage disappeared. For one, many of the best southern generals were killed and the northern soldiers were catching up. By the summer of 1863, the quality of soldiers from the Union was pretty close to their southern counterparts.  The reason the Army of the Potomac was losing battles had nothing to do with its soldiers. From all accounts, the men who were present at Fredericksburg, 2nd Manassas and Chancellorsville were as brave as you can be. It was the successive appointments of unqualified and incapable Major Generals (many of whom got their position by their connections in Washington) that were responsible for blunder after blunder after blunder.</em>Now...back the the game. The Confederate troops are unrealistically better than the Union.  Its overblow to an obvious level that gets frustrating quickly. They can withstand the worst of situations (very low moral and condition) while the Union troops seem to run at the first volley that gets fired at them. Every charge done by the CSA ends in a route for them. Pressing ""charge"" for any Union unit is a complete waste of time b/c it never works. They always loose the melee. The Iron Brigade and Vincent's Brigade were not the only decent units at Gettysburg. <b> Infinite Artillery </b> There should be a limit to the amount of shells each artillery unit has. They either need to run out until the next battle or have to resupply. The only advantage the Union army has is its superior artillery. It seems to have more artillery most of the time and can be better concentrated because of the compact interior. You can really mass artillery units together to help make up for your poor quality troops. <em>However, the amount of artillery available is also relevant to the battle.  Some may call me nitpicking but this has a HUGE IMPACT on the battle. The CSA had enough cannons but couldn't resupply them as fast as the Union. This could never be more true than during Pickett's Charge. The whole plan of General Lee was to bombard the center into smithereens and then send 15,000 into a softened center. Problem is, they ran out of artillery ammo shortly before the charge started and couldn't support the army. While they were charging on the 3rd day, the Union shooting everything you can imagine into their ranks while their guns were silent.</em>In essence, I'm saying that if you're going to make the Confederate soldiers so much better than the Union then you need to make the Union's artillery advantage equally better than the Confederate. As the game stands, the Union has a small advantage in this department but not enough. In this game the CSA wins the 3rd day with too much ease. The Union artillery doesn't do enough to break their ranks up and the Union soldiers crack. When I'm doing Pickett's Charge as the CSA, I can put the troops on autopilot. I told every brigade to charge towards the center and won with ease. Main reason: the Unions primary advantage on this day is high mitigated. Note: I know the 3rd day is hard to replicate because no Gettysburg game has gotten it right. Sid Meier's....same thing. The artillery of the Union, as programmed, can't do enough damage and their soldiers can be easy overwhelmed. <b> Seminary Ridge Needs To Be Further From Cemetery Hill<b>They are way too close. They need to be distanced. One of the reasons why the 3rd day is so unrealistic is because they CSA seems to only have to charge a couple feet to get to the center line. This make the 2nd con I just mentioned more pronounced because the the Union gets a 1-3 good shoots before the Confederates are upon them. <b> Calvery </b>It seems awfully easy for Stuart's cavalry to to flank me from behind on the 3rd day. Custer's men don't put up much of a fight (even though they win a battle one day later) and the southern cavalry easily charges through massed volleys. I find myself having to divert an insane number of men and artillery to keep him at bay. No matter what his casualties are when I do this, he regroups after a couple minutes and charges at me again. Unrealistic! Harass. Maybe. Attack supply lines. Yes. Disrupt. Yes. Maybe I'm wrong but I never remember horse cavalry attacking the main army in massed formation like that. Bufford could be used to counter my argument but he was doing more a delaying action that anything and they were dismounted.   "

								Ultimate General is one of those hidden gems for historical, and rts players alike. Greenlit this game offers much for such a cheap price. This game has also been rigoriously compared to Sid Miers Gettysburg, though not played ive heard Ultimate General a lot better from various sources.Command either the Union or Confederate in the battle of gettysburg, play though each day of the battle. Your armies have factors like condition, morale and cover. Each is taken over to the next day, so if you rest your troops you get the same % of what you had in the day before.Reinforcements come streamlined as in how the battle of gettysburg took place, terrain is also a major factor that can give cover for your units as well as your positioning, fighting with flanks is imporant as well as to have reserves in case one of your regiments gets too tired you need to fill the gap and let the exausted army rest.As each day progresses and you have certain capture points on the battlefield you are asked about different tactics such as flanking benners hill, falling back to cemetary ridge ect which you can choose if you feel your armies are scattered or you wish to push for more ground ect; this gives way to a unique and effective means of creating a real life battle simulation.Artillery has three variations of firepower from lowest range to highest. Canister (heavy damage) Shell (medium) and Roundshot (low damage). Each effects the morale of armies and their willingness to fight.For Darths first game, (see his Total war mods) I cant recommend this enough, its too cheap, not to get and not to support such a great user in the r.t.s gaming community.

								Bought this game on the back of getting Darthmods for my TW games. I saw it in green light and waited for it to be released, £5.99 early access. I had my fingers burnt with the pre-order of Rome 2 so I was a bit cautious, but I decided at that price I'd take a punt and I'm so glad I did. At about 25 hours in I'm loving it. It's early access not the finished product but I think with Darth behind it, it could grow into something big (CA you've been warned)			"

												I so wanted to like this game.  I supposed I can say that I do like it, even love it, up to a point.  That point occurs when play stops, and the next phase of the battle begins.After the reset and start of the next pahse my troops are generally nowhere near where they were before the reset.  Why on Earth should I continue to play, using my own tactics when the @#$%%@$ game is just going to reset and put my troops where General Lee's troops were at that particular point in the battle?  What is the point of fighting based on General Lee's decisions?  He lost the battle.  I am playing to win, not to follow a set piece of failed tactics and improper use of terrain and concetration of force.Like I said, while the game is playing it is great, but dare to succeed where the ANV failed and the game will remind you that the CSA lost this one, and you are not meant to have an orginal thought in your head.  Instead of wasting time putting inputs in to the game, it should play out like a movie or just have a bunch of prompts to tell you where you can and can't go based on the upcoming reset.  I had my HQ inside of Gettyburg and had the Yankees nearly completely enevolped under crushing concetrated artillery.  Then poof, my HQ is back on Herr's Ridge and my artillery is all over the map.If you want to play out Lee's mistakes, it is a great looking game with an outstanding interface.  If you want to try new things and win the battle for the ANV, go back to the dinning room table and play Thunder at the Crossroads or This Hallowed Ground.Bloody waste of time and money.			"

								At first it reminded me of the visuals of North & South on the Amiga, but if you just scratch the surface you really get a very intuitive smart strategy game that really handles the big amount of troops in a very good way.+ intuitive way of handling lots of troops + cute artstyleFormations ?I missed the possibility to change formations, but after playing a while you get to understand that there is no time for switching formation for each of the unit ( also it wouldnt be realistic if you could choose formations for all your units as a commander in the middle of the battle, so in that sense I really can´t se why there would be formations in this game.- No replay possibility- To little statistics after the battle ( for analysis)- Very boring HUD and the mainmenu + no music, I´m very sure this will be put into the game later on- A bit hard to see if you are on a hill or deep down in an valley.Experienced troops ?Havent read of found out if my units get experience during the battle, but also it wouldnt be very realistic that units would get very much experience during the same battle they are in.

								I play all types of wargames - from Gary Grisby's War in the East to Total War: Rome II. This game is the best wargame I've ever played. It's a fine balance between realism, entertainment, and eye-candy - three of them being equally important to me. Its AI is the best I have seen in any game and it doesn't cheat - the computer opponent doesn't have access to resources or information not available to the player. The control interface is intuitive. You draw arrows with a swipe of the mouse, telling your men to march along specific path for specific distance and end up facing specific direction. Simply beautiful. With multiplayer, this game is everything I ask for in a wargame.			"

								I have been waiting for a game like this for years now and finally someone has made one.  Thank God for Indie Devs.  The graphics are fairly simple but don't let this put you off as the AI is what you need in a strategy title.  This game delivers with a variety of different difficulty settings and a genuine foe that is always throwin a spanner into the works of your overall master plan by attacking your rear with cavalry and out flanking you or rushing exposed guns.  With a fairly simple control system it allows you to scroll ur way around the map and direct units into the required positions.  My pc has crashed a few times but this game is still in dev and to be fair my pc is startin to chug a bit being 5 years old what with all the porn on my harddrive and CIA/ MI5 spybots keeping an eye on me.Give it a blast for a few quid you can't really go wrong.

												Whilst having great controls, surprising and smart AI, Ultimate General: Gettysburg is severely hampered by its orthographic camera view, which makes it extremely difficult to judge not only height of terrain but the actual layout of the map. Every bit of me wants to instinctively pant he camera at a different angle to better understand the battle but the game simply is what it is. I look forward to the next entry in the series to see if either the current graphics can be made more understandable or whether a new style is taken on entirely. "

												Always been a fan of the Civil War era and there's not a lot of contendors in the genre these days. So it's nice to be able to dive into a fairly decent Civil War game again and bring the Rebs another win over the Union.Pro's:- Solid infantry battles and line movement, important to keep your troops connected, you really feel the heat if you    don't keep your army in formation or a section of your line breaks- Solid sound effects help bring home the ambiance of the battlefield without overdoing it and the graphics are just right- Smooth game-pace which is fluid and engaging throughout the battle, you will be paying attention and having to make efforts to either take the offense or ""hold the line"", you control how much territory you want to hold or defend, or advance on- Variety of AI settings (although I have not tried them all) which help you create the kind of game dynamic you're looking for on the battlefield (some people like a defensive AI where others prefer to attack)...I believe there are 9 different options to choose fromCon's:- Finding the range, elevation and line-of-sight of your troops can be frustrating, once you figure it out it's not as bad and although there is a tool to help you, it still feels quite non-user-friendly, so you will spend time fussing with this- Infantry units seem to break at odd times and have a strange pathing when they do, it's a bit unpredictable how they'll react at times, it should be easier to take a quick glance at moral without having to look at each unit or making them hold- It's not a full-game in the sense of a large drawn out campaign, but for the money it's well-done and the system works well with the style..after all it's called Gettysburg, it's not just the name of the game but honestly you may not even notice as it feels like a series of different battles based on your performanceIt's not a AAA title, but if you enjoy Civil War strategy games, I doubt you'll be disappointed. There's not a lot of bells and whistles here, with options and imaginative or breath-taking graphics, but it's what you expect from a Civil War game and it's a good buy if you're just looking to spend a few hours or more on the Civil War battlefield.

												Certainly worth the price and a very enjoyable treat for anyone who enjoys a Total War style game. Only complaints as of this review is occasionally the unit AI will shuffle itself a little too much out of positions I want them in during long fire fights, When there is a few thousand soldiers occupying an area and one unit will just move and then move again to put itself well out of the group. I don't mind it because it seems the AI is aware that the troop is exhausted and moves them out so they can rest but still contribute. However thats not what I wanted, you will not give a dirty damn inch you grey little ♥♥♥♥♥.The artillery can also be a bit ♥♥♥♥y, sometimes its really difficult despite the elevation map mode to position artillery to fire upon the targets you want. They also don't use the infantry behavior which is where you click on a unit and they move to attack (thats not really a complaint). So artillery is always positioned by hand which can be painstaking because despite that position looking right, it is infact not.That said, the AI is really good, and the depth to the game is apparent despite its simplicity. The AI gave me a good fight on the Determined setting and I was on the edge the entire time throughout the several day long battle.  Would recommend and have already.			"

Whether you favour sneaky flanks or straightforward charge under the generals whip, this game let's you do it all, no forced meta, just a battle of witts. In the multiplayer it's your battlefield entirely and you can engage in one of the most fun strategic experiences I've had up to date.			"

												After having Sid Meier's Gettysberg in order to gain inspiration from, this game has shown how to take a step back in gaming.  The controls are clunky, the action is incomprehensible and the mechanics are downright bad.  Charging units will stand on top of each other for thirty minutes taking a loss or two.  I had a unit of 800 stand on top of a 50 man artillery unit swapping coffee for tobacco or something.Units will randomly move in random directions.  Sharpshooters positioned behind units on high, protected ground would move between two brigades on open ground while I moved my camera.Units which were, historically, elite (3rd Corps - Confederates) ran from a charge from a, historically, unreliable unit (11th Corps - Union) while fresh, on high ground, against even odds, standing still and with the corps commander sharing a drink with them.This is to say nothing of the company's ""multiplayer"" promise.  I bought the game for a friend when it released hoping to be able to play a grand campaign splitting corps between the two of us.  However, the devs decided to cancel plans on that to move onto a new game.  To say I'm disappointed is an understatement.  I wish they'd offer a fifteen year old game as it was vastly superior to this trash that the developer abandoned to make, disgustingly enough, another Civil War game.			"

												The game can best be described as a more detailed total war battle surrounding the battle of Gettysburg. The game ideas and concepts seem pretty interesting but some of the execution seems off. I've only played the game a couple hours so far but I've seen strange behavior such as 2 bridgades kind of being in a mess between each other but not in melee (soldier numbers not going down). Artillery is kind of fickle in terms of being in a position to fire and LOS doesn't always seem to be respected. I placed a brigade on the downside of a hill to 'ambush' an enemy coming over the crest but instead they just shot at each other through the top of the hill. Cavalry charges to the rear of enagged enemy units seem to have almost no effect. I think the game has a lot of great ideas and the setting is extremely interesting but I think I'll come back after some of these bugs get sorted out.			"

Nope can't do that.Half of the game your troops will be running away due to moral.And if the game is supposed to realistic it's far from it, you could surround your enemy and yet the enemy somehow manages to fight on all fronts with balanced casualties on both sides.

												As far as RTS games go, this one sounds unique and interesting but ultimately is pretty poor.  You control the forces of either the Union or Confederates and must capture and hold key positions on the battlefield.  Each battle starts off uneven, but reinforcements to each side periodically enter the map.  This means you may start at a disadvantage, having to use guerrilla tactics until reinforcements arrive, and then overwhelm the enemy before they too are reinforced.It sounds cool, but the mechanics don't actually work in practice.  Attack and movement commands never function as expected.  Units seem to randomly ignore commands to move or attack.  An entire battalion of soldiers can be facing off against an enemy and will suddenly turn and flee despite clearly winning the confrontation.  Artillery units will blatantly refuse attack orders and just sit still, doing nothing.Movement controls are downright atrocious, often resulting in units organizing themselves in a way you did not intend or desire.  Anytime you issue a move command, the units run around in circles to change from a combat formation to a marching formation.  You cannot tell an entire line of soldiers to fall back and instead much select each troop individually.  The list goes on...The game leaves you with a feeling of overwhelming confusion.  Why do my units ignore my commands?  Why can't they move in a straight line?  What causes morale and condition to go up or down?  The answers to these questions and more are never provided!			"

												Wonderful game that is easy to immerse yourself in. It has intelligent AI who are a real challenge at all times and the game has a great aesthetic overall. I would reccomend this game to anyone interested in the American Civil War or strategy games. Definitelyworth $15 and if it is one sale it is an amazing deal.			"

												WARNING: IF YOU DONT LIKE DEATH, AVOID THIS GAME!!! MANY CASUALTIES OCCUR DEPENDING ON IF U ARE STUPID OR STRATEGIC.... but death occurs nevertheless.How would you like to see Lane's Brigade lose 800 people because they charge my line (where my artillery was heaviest), lose 200 people or so, run away still dying, decide to turn north which makes them run parallel to my line, and lose another 600 from running across my whole line? See what i mean by death? Or if you would rather be encircled by confederates on top of Culp's hill and hold them off to win, you can have plans be made for that too. Or if u are little Johnny Reb and like to find weak points and charge and drive them Feds off Cemetery Ridge, be sure to have lots of grave diggers at your disposal, cause it wont be pretty. TWO THINGS TO REMEMBER: 1) union sucks at charging. be it uphill, downhill, against bad morale/condition troops, u lose a lot of people. 2) Union artillery will make 100 widows every 3 seconds. the homefront will hate you if you charge Fed. artillery. THESE TROOPS ARE NOT THE RELATIVES OF THE BLACK KNIGHT FROM MONTY PYTHON. THEY DO DIE EASILY, AND PEOPLE CAN PASS ONCE THEY DIE. PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND. You get exact # of troops of one brigade and both armies, and kills/deaths for each brigade. at the end a chart shows you the kills, deaths, troops left, and more. Dont know if many people care about this, but the history is actually accurate, which is just the cherry/shell (which is a cannonball for dull people) on top. so get this game because 1) i said so. 2) death is life in this game, so make the most of it.

												Superb little game covering the entirety of the Gettysburg campaign at Battalion level. Immensely enjoyable, it captures the feel of large-scale ACW warfare perfectly, awarding strong tactical play. Battalions and supporting units (artillery, skirmishers) act in concert. Tactics involve the use of maneuver and terrain to overcome an opponent, making the game quite challenging if fighting an aggressive AI. Campaign is broken into days, with surviving forces carrying over into the next day in the same location on the map captured in the previous days' battle. Reinforcements play a crucial role, and arrive at historical times during the campaign. Game starts out as a small (though challenging and at times chaotic) skirmish, eventually evolving into a massed pitch battle. AI is highly scaleable to suit any desired play style.Game-Labs has put out a classic game of the genre here, don't be put off by its tablet roots. For the price a must buy for any PC grognard.			"

												I am a major history buff and my favorite thing to learn is the American Civil War. I am a reenactor and a member of the SUVCW. My favorite battle is Gettysburg and i have visited the battlefield many times. I feel this game truly shows the layout of the battlefield and the most of the units stationed there. I love all the different scenerios that can happen depending on what you do. I also love all difficulties you can choose. I like the seperated parts of the battlefield but I wish there was one scenerio in which it was the entire battlefield and all the units. I also which there was a gamode in which the battle doesn't end and moves through the three days without stopping. I truly love this game and i hope the developers make more games like this and maybe add more content to the game.			"

There is lots of replay value as you can change the difficulty of the AI, which will add more situations. There are also some battle choices you can have, such as close in on enemy ranks. Overall its a great game which I look to playing more in the future.Also, thanks Valve for not deleting this game due to the CSA flag BS.			"

												Pros:-Very simple controls-Easy to understand especially if your are familar with ACW combat-Doesn't require any real knowledge of the actual event (though it does help)-Very Competent AICons:-The map is 2D which makes it hard to figure out exact line of sight or height advantages-It's only Gettysburg but then again it's only $15So the guy who made the Darth mods for Total War made his own game and I decided to check it out being a fan of his work (espeically his AI tweaks).  I have to admit I wasn't expecting too much here but I got a very addicting light war game that has the best AI I've seen for this type of warfare.  Alot of this has to do with unit changes from say Total War (like units being able to shoot while moving but suffering reload penalties) and AI for individucal units (they choose more or less whether the march in collumns of 4 or line for instance).  The graphics and sound get the job done but you can check a video to judge that, where this game stands out is how right everything feels, from volleys to morale you get a sense of being in command of a large force during the time.  Hope to see more from the series in the future but this is great start.			"

I won't get into the details of the graphics and such, which so many other reviews do so well, but I will say that if you are looking for a US Civil War game this is the one to get. I cannot wait to see what the developers do next, and add to this game, as it has so many possibilities for future time frames and aspects of the US Civil War. A single game covering the entire war would be amazing.Also note that through the entire Early Access period this game received many improvements to both the base game and the AI. It was very nice to see a game do Early Access right, and respond to the users suggestions. The games full release to steam with no extra BS, just a good working game, is to be applauded.			"

Early Access Review
								So Far so good.  I have a couple of suggestions, but who would listen to me anyway?  I like the concept of the game (It really reminds me of a Civil War History book I used to own that had these beautiful birds eye view renderings of the important battle fields, with scaled down units fighting at the different hotspots over the maps) and it plays fluidly.  THe scenarios seem to mesh very well into one another based on the outcome of the previous scenario, which is nice.  This game also brings to mind a classic: Sid Meyer's Gettysburg.  If anyone of you out there played and loved that game, you will like this.  As for the downsides (in my opinion) the game plays a -little- too fast and has a sort of...oh I dunno...Arena style feel to it.  This is probably what the creator intended and if that is the way he wanted to go with it, far be it from me to judge.  I say slow it down just a tad and you have a real winner.  Also, I would like to see more unit info, like which units are in the brigades, what losses the regiments are taking, and the state of their equipment.  Do not get me wrong, I kind of like playing at the Brigade level, but still, I'd like to -see- the suborniate units.  Anyway, a good game, a good work in progress.  Pick it up while it's cheap!			"

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg is properly compared to Sid Meier’s game that came out well over a decade ago. That begs the quest why a game in 2015 would be compared to something that old. The simple answer is that nothing as good has come along, and the complex answer is that nothing this good is out there now. With both the decline of Creative Assembly’s Total War franchises, and the Real-Time-Strategy (RTS) genre, this game fill the niche for historical RTS solidly. Ultimate General: Gettysburg has as simple but easy to use UI. The AI is also very intelligent, and hard levels are quite hard! There are some inferred mechanics, but nothing too obtuse to not be understandable. Yes, there is room for improvement but not much, and the game is very addicting. Some people are unhappy with there being one map. However consider this; At the end of each day or phase, you have three options that are essentially new-ish areas to work with. Additionally, having one map also demands from the player careful use of troops, as they carry over too.  The lack of maps isn’t a hindrance to having fun. EDIT: I have heard rumors of a full campaing coming. I would wait now to get this until it's either on sale or the rumors become true.And, since the devs went overboard on nerffing the Confederate's Rebell Yell charge bonus, final score is 80%. I dont mind patches tweeking the game, but they really made the whole expereince too different with the last patch			"

												I have to say that I very much enjoy this game. Civil War games like this are hard enough to come by, let alone one that is relatively well done. The learning curve to this isn't too bad at all, and if you have a basic idea of how the war was waged, then you have a decent grasp on the gameplay. The biggest thing I found a little challenging to learn is the morale mechanic. In terms of the campaign, I'd (forcing myself to say this bit) have to recommend starting with the Union campaign, due to the number advantages. Until you are more comfortable with dealing with being outnumbered. Once you've got a good grip on that, buckle down, bayonet up, give the yell and charge like furies into the yankees and end the war for old Virginia. 10/10 would rout the Iron Brigade to capture Seminary Ridge again.

												First, as a someone who enjoys learning about the Civil War, this game quite literally takes you through the Battle at Gettysburg with unit names and strengths closely matching those actually deployed.  When the troops arrive, including times of day, where and the subsequent battle locations also follow the real battle over its three day course.  All set over geographically accurate terrain.  Second, the game allows for you to influence the battle through each engagement by securing objectives, while still adhering to basic advantages and disadvantages each army held, including as mentioned the initial troop strengths and the arrival of reinforcements.  What your actions accomplish the first day carry over into the second, and so on.Last, the game play is ponderously slow, RTS, which I found fantastic.  The pace gives time to appreciate the battle, look over the progress and make adjustments accordingly, without having to practice improving hand-eye coordination, key memorization, and so on.  There are a lot of little nuances you can learn over time, and several game play options from either the North or South's perspectives, all of which allow you too improve as a General, take on more difficult AI opponents and add replayability.  I highly recommend this game.			"

												if your thinking about getting it...do it...darth did an incredible job with this one. it calls itself gettysburg, but its more of a dynamic gettysburg campaign generator, as i found it really hard to follow the historical path. every single playthrough will be different than the next. you take up either side of the war and your job is to route the opposition from the battlefield, and the results of one skirmish/tactical battle will directly influence the next. if you dont want to play the campaign, there are loads of single scenerios set up with different starting positions and troop composition. you can play historically, or you can totally change history and fight the battle the way you think it should have been fought. listen to lee or longstreet? hold the defensive lines, or prepare for a counter attack? consolidate gains, or withdrawl to better positions? you will have to make decisions like this before, and during the battle that will guide the path the fighting takes. probably the single greatest civil war battle game...ever....no joke.

												Ultimat General Gettysburg is a very nice game. I palyed a lot of RTS Games and this is one of the smoothes and most logical ones.There is no clumsy positioning and no special abilities which unbalance the game. It is simply a question of who is the better general und who finds the better position on the map.You can easily do encircelments and fast advances, aswell as staying defensive and holding your position.The graphics are nice, nothing spectacular but beatufully made and straight forward.The gameplay is fast paced but still tactical.The music is fitting although sounds of guns and cannons are somewhat lackluster.The AI can be modified to a very defensive, very offensive or any setting in between.The multiplayer is still very basic and a litte underpopulated, but the devs are very active and adressing the issues as soon as they arise.The singleplayer is well made and challenging, you can't modify much But this is a simulation of the gettysburg battle with all historical units who took part in it.I only can recommend this game and i am looking forward to further updates by the devs.			"

												Hi,honestly I just can't stop playing this game since I purchased it in december 2014. I have always been really into the history of the American Civil War, although I am not from the States. As a 9 years old child I had been playing a simple game called Civil War on one of my very first PCs in the 1990s. Than for years I have been playing Sierra's Civil War 2 Generals. And now besides AGEOD'S Civil War games this is my favourite game from this era. I have just beaten the AI on ""Determined"" level with the Confederacy.The game is dinamic and feels very alive. It responds to the player's decisions very well. The AI can be adjusted to your taste very easily. The game captures the historical settings very well, but the progress and the outcome of the battle depends on your tactics. I really like the modelling of morale and how generals can influence the behavior of your troops. If you are a Civil War fanatic just like me, this is your game.			"

												This is extremely well done RTS game and one that definitely should appeal to a wide variety of gamers. Gameplay is extremely fluid and terrific UI makes it quite easy to control even the largest battles without any frustration. Although UGG lacks the extreme realism of Scourge Of War games, for example, it definitely makes it up with the enjoyable frustration free gameplay rarely seen on any RTS game withi similar scope. Don't get me wrong, gameplay isn't overly simplistic. This is just one of those games that is easy to learn but hard to master. There are quite a lot options for your troops but all actions are beautifully integrated to the one of the best UIs of RTS genre. In addition to that, AI does good job and developers are improving the game with patches, so for the price and all in all, this is a must buy.			"

												I have tried several Civil War games and this one comes close to being the best.  You are limited to this one battle over a period of the few days the battle was fought.You are given divisions, battalions, and arty to command.  The game gives you objectives for your army to take, capture points or value points are given for the objectives taken.  You have to pay attention to moral, movement, terrian, etc.I like that you can save your progress in case you want to re-think your stragety.  The game seems to replicate pretty  well how battles were fought and how soldiers might react.  So keep the officers close to boost moral.What I don't like is doing real well in capturing, (like Culp's Hill). and then the next game I have to do it again. It re-sets back to the historical settings of the battle fought that day.  Any one who's familiar w/ the history of the battle will know that if the confederates had taken a few key hills at Gettysburg, the Civil War and our history would be different.I finally won playing the confederates. The game, or campaign feels like it didn't take a very long time to play. I hope they have some more options of this genre game available in the future.			"

												I have to say that I very much enjoy this game. Civil War games like this are hard enough to come by, let alone one that is relatively well done. The learning curve to this isn't too bad at all, and if you have a basic idea of how the war was waged, then you have a decent grasp on the gameplay. The biggest thing I found a little challenging to learn is the morale mechanic. In terms of the campaign, I'd (forcing myself to say this bit) have to recommend starting with the Union campaign, due to the number advantages. Until you are more comfortable with dealing with being outnumbered. Once you've got a good grip on that, buckle down, bayonet up, give the yell and charge like furies into the yankees and end the war for old Virginia. 10/10 would rout the Iron Brigade to capture Seminary Ridge again.

												if your thinking about getting it...do it...darth did an incredible job with this one. it calls itself gettysburg, but its more of a dynamic gettysburg campaign generator, as i found it really hard to follow the historical path. every single playthrough will be different than the next. you take up either side of the war and your job is to route the opposition from the battlefield, and the results of one skirmish/tactical battle will directly influence the next. if you dont want to play the campaign, there are loads of single scenerios set up with different starting positions and troop composition. you can play historically, or you can totally change history and fight the battle the way you think it should have been fought. listen to lee or longstreet? hold the defensive lines, or prepare for a counter attack? consolidate gains, or withdrawl to better positions? you will have to make decisions like this before, and during the battle that will guide the path the fighting takes. probably the single greatest civil war battle game...ever....no joke.

												Even for $15, I currently have buyers remorse. Though the controls are easy. The 2 demensional map is fairly dynamic with available cover and topography bonuses/disadvantages. You are at the mercy of the moral of the troops, which adds a great deal to the accuracy of warfare. The graphics and sounds are fun. Once everyone starts shooting at eachother it is pretty fun to watch. But I havent had one satisfying ending to any battles...I'm on the fence whether or not to recommend it because of one thing. The battles are designed to take forever but it gives you a short time limit. I'm talking 15 minutes tops for a lot of battles. By the time each battle starts getting interesting the time ends, and I lose because I have fewer troops than the enemy, which is how the battle started anyway. The rate that casualties are inflicted is not accounted for in the time allowed. It is driving me crazy! Let me kill my enemy!I have not found a way to get rid of the time limit. If the developers could change this I would recommend it for the price asked. $15 isnt bad though			"

If you are looking for a great civil war battle game look no further.  Be advised this is strictly a battle game, no campaign stategy here.  Could be improved by adding more battles or a custom battle section that has more than bits of the Gettysburg battle, but I may be nit picking.  Best Civil War game I've found.			"

												Overall well done Darth, been using your mods since you started.The campaign mode is  disappointing. the way victories are calculated needs reworking. as sometimes the choices of next battler are strange.  eg i held all my objectives hammered the union in terms of casualties and one of the next battle options was retaking two of the objectives the campaign randomiser seemed to think I had lost. I get the impression it was not a relative high priority.The length of a single campaign is far too short and feels as if it was tagged on at the end.Tactically, in battle, there is no map rotation which  feels a bit odd   but being an old fart using fixedmap angles came back quickly. When issuing orders i found it often necessary to pause the game. I have only used ballanced game difficulty so far and as he Confederates found the AI not difficult (after a couple of test battles to get used to the game). It probably would benefit from a basic set of formations hotkeys for corps level deployment. The tutorial is simple straight forward and tells you all you need to know about the basic commands.I am not sure how effective artillery, which is usually a sign of ballance needing tweeking. The Confederate charge is very effective. quite possibly a little oiverpowered. It is what it is, a small team project on a relatively small budget. For that reason alone I recommend it. Games are becoming far too samey because the producers are business people not gamers as  they were in my youth. A good first attempt.  and I imagine great for the multiplayers out there. "

												Everyone raves about the AI.   I am not that good of general, but I am able to crush this game everytime even with the AI boost on.    There are also many frustrating oddities.   - Iron Brigade is decimated by my fire, loses over a 1,000 men and marches through five Confederate units on its way to take Herr Ridge - really?- I targetted two of my units to attack 1 union unit.  All three intermingle but there no losses on either side.  The units just stand there. Very weird.  - I flanked the left side of the union army, and one of my units is routed. Instead of fleeing away from the Union line, it flees toward it and then turns Northward to run down the entire union line, losing over 1,000 men in the process. - Game seems slight tilted toward Union, making it easier to play Union side. When I am on the verge of taking an objective as the Union, the game will delay the end of battle several times.  However, when I play as Confederate, the battle is not delayed even though the objective is being contested.  Also playing on the Confederate side, I have decimated the Union forces only to be told at the end of the scenario that I received a crushing defeat.  Two rounds later I have pushed the Union forces from the map, which I feel is a sweeping victory, but instead I am told it is a minor victory even though I have 6,000 fewer casualties and control  of the entire map. It is a fun game, and worth the money.   The claims of great AI are exagerrated,so I was a little disappointed, but I still like it.			"

												A simple, yet eligant update of Sid Meyer's old fan favorites. As an amateur historian and civil war buff there was no way I could pass this game up. The AI is very smart and counters your moves or makes you counter theirs. I personally always set the AI to random, so that I have no idea what stance I will be facing. Nothing gives a history nut more satisfaction than watching the Iron Brigade drive Archer's and Davis's brigades off the map the morning of the 1st or breaking through the round tops on July 2nd with Hood's division. The extent of nerdiness required to fully appreciate this game is very high, but if you want a challenging, but not impossible RTS without unit creation, Ultimate General: Gettysburg is the game for you.

												Remarkably well-balanced presentation of the epic battle. The player is allowed to command units and formulate battlefield strategy while the individual unit 'commanders' manage the logistics and mecahnics of implementing that strategy. The learning curve is reasonably short and the game flows quite well. I spent many years studying and playing the Avalon Hill and SSI hex-based table games which set the standard for this type of game for decades. Ultimate General: Gettysburg is a glimpse into the future of these grognard staples.

												Best Civil War game I've ever played! Fairly simple controls, no learning curve, and exciting gameplay. What more could you ask for? My only gripe is that the controls are a little cluncky, with the regiments not always doing what I want. But, in real war, orders would take ages to be passed down, so I guess I shouldn't complain! Overall, great game, you should buy it.			"

												A simple, yet eligant update of Sid Meyer's old fan favorites. As an amateur historian and civil war buff there was no way I could pass this game up. The AI is very smart and counters your moves or makes you counter theirs. I personally always set the AI to random, so that I have no idea what stance I will be facing. Nothing gives a history nut more satisfaction than watching the Iron Brigade drive Archer's and Davis's brigades off the map the morning of the 1st or breaking through the round tops on July 2nd with Hood's division. The extent of nerdiness required to fully appreciate this game is very high, but if you want a challenging, but not impossible RTS without unit creation, Ultimate General: Gettysburg is the game for you.

												For many there is not much to this game on first glance. Essentially it is just a battlemap on a table and you tell your battalions where to strike. But that is what makes this game so great you are after all a general and that is what generals do; coordinate the battles. You drag paths for your forces to follow and await the outcome. The field plays a lot like a tug of war. With the winner being decided by the person who manages to lose the least forces yet capture the most strategic points by the end of the battle. To keep you on your toes both your forces and the enemies forces get topped up from time to time by various elements of your army, presumably how it occured at Gettysburg in a psuedo historic sense. Batallions seem to carry there numbers between each battle day so its especially important to play in a very strategic way ensuring you retreat forces who are overwhelmed as death means death.Overall though I personally was awaiting an American civil war game that was appealing yet realistic at the same time.  I feel this game captures those reenactment scenarios which are often roleplayed by groups today. And ports it over to the generals chair scenario quite beautifully. And therefore is a great addition to both reenacters and those who are simply interested in macro management RTS. "

												I've only played it a little and am still getting used to it. It is quite difficult! This isn't a game that will hold your hand and give you an easy ride. It has some rough spots - the fact that you don't get any information on the relative strengths/weaknesses of your units is a problem. Hint: skirmishers are awful at melee combat. Once you get over that hump though, the battle itself is involving and challenging. You will endure heavy losses to your troops and strategy plays a big part - terrain, positioning, and timing of attacks as well as smart use of units all factor heavily in your chances of prevailing.A lot is made of the controls being simple - I don't have that much experience with the genre so my comments are specific to UG:G. I don't like that you need the CTRL key so much in order to position your units facing the correct direction. I think this could have been done better. The grouping of units is also not ideal - grouping them is easy but again the CTRL function of a grouped unit seems flawed with units often crossing paths to reach their positions.Still, definitely recommended.

												This is one of the best strategy games I have played in a long time.  The way it handles difficulty is a new and refreshing idea.  This leads to completely different battles every time you play.  The only down side and there aren't many, is the scale could be different.  I think using brigades was a bit large.  I'd enjoy regimental level for the scale.I'd reccommend this to anyone who is a fan of the civil war, or strategy gaming in general.			"

Posted: March 16, 2015
												Ultimate General; GettysburgCongratulations to the developers of this fresh take on an old idea. In spite of the obvious, that this system has yet to be highly polished, it is still worth purchase and play. The developers have taken the game to a point where it is enjoyable and highly playable in spite of current limitations. They had the sense to keep the price at a point that makes it worth buying even now. I see it as a form of crowd sourceing.The innovative elements that add a new sense of control are relatively few, yet they add a refreshing twist that makes this game feel different from it's forebears. The mechanics seem suited to this era. Indeed, one can see this system supporting titles that could stretch across a couple of centuries.The elephant in the room is obvious. One map, one battle. However, Gettysburg was an excellent choice to start, because the sheer complexity and scope of the battle offer more replay value than might otherwise be available in a single conflict. Gettysburg is so well known, and the larger flow of the clashing forces is so pre-determined that the fog-of-war is inherently diminished, and gameplay thus centers around the tactical rather than the strategic. Of course, all titles that are based around historic battles have the same issue. For this reason I would hope, down the road, to see a module perhaps titled, ""Unknown Battles of the Civil War,"" that would present interesting original scenarios created to use this engine in a complete fog-of-war environment. Though I've had a long interest in these types of games I am not a ""Grognard,"" and would gladly accept non-historical scenarios that retain the flavor of an era.One of the wisest decisions was to accelerate movement and action to avoid a situation that could quickly mire the player in a nightmare of overwhelming scope and micro-management. Self-managing AI-reactions, such as (most of the time) automatically turning to face opponents after movement, contribute. The result is a speed-of-play that remains in the realm of fun rather than tedium.In service of this idea I would like to see a variable ""throttle"" to manage game speed. Though a PAUSE button is available, I would like to have the option of having the clock slowed, but not frozen, so I could continue watching the flow while making large number of simultaneous tactical decisions.As this scenario progresses the numbers of units and the size of the conflict become so impossible to track in real time that I imagine most players MUST pause the game to issue orders effectively. Eventually so many units occupy the same space that one must zoom the map in-and-out merely to pinpoint and activate units of interest. If not paused While doing this it's easy lose the big picture, and become overwhelmed by the adversary on unseen parts of the map.It would be interesting, at certain stages of a large battle, to be able to...say...""quarter the map"", and play out just that segement of the battle to some fixed future time point. After individually playing each map segment the results would be merged into a new, current overall battle situation and play would continue. Not sure that this would even be possible though, since what happens in one segment is also continually effecting what is happening elsewhere.A couple of minor issues I would like to see addressed soon: Between battle segments, when a strategy must be selected before continuing to the next phase (largely determining where the default start positions will be), I would like to have access to the full, empty map. The tiny thumbnail maps presented with units in position are not large enough to identify locations and their names, making it difficult even for people like me, who are fairly familiar with this battle, to make a decision.An important and needed change: I want to select a unit HQ and have all the member units' icons highlight simultaneously. Without this capability, keeping units within contact range of each other, or even finding them, is almost impossible.Some minor tweaking of the UI is also necessary. For example, even zoomed in to max, it's hard to tell whether arty units are limbered or not. The LIMBER button needs an alternate UNLIMBER button to help determine status. Directional controls also need a bit of tweaking to make them less sesitive.I also purchased the iPad version of the game. And though I have only played it partway through, I can see that, ironically, a game that seems ideally optimized for a touch interface doesn't fare well on a small screen. Though I think the port to mobile devices is worthwhile, Scenarios need to be restricted to smaller battles. Fingers are just too big and the screens are too small.So people! Loosen those pocketbooks and fork over a little dough for this title, which is showing immense promise. For a pittance you get a good taste of an engine that could end up being really great, and offer support and encouragement for the developers. RECOMMENDED!			"

												Where to begin?This game is one of the best 'raw' strategy games that I have played. Every move you make is important so it forces you to actually think about what you're doing and the consequences. The visuals are basic but pleasing and the sounds are decent , that said, the meat of this game is really the battles. The icing on the cake for this game is the AI, it seems that for too long that we strategy gamers have settled for less than adequate AI for too long and it is in this regard that 'Ultimate General: Gettysburg' sets the bar for future 'armchair general' titles.

												the game has a very steep learning curve that requires a lot of micro management and getting used to the game's controls which were very hard for me to get the hang of initially being used to Total War Napoleon's method so anyone jumping into this from that game be prepared to face some catastrophic losses as your ""maneuvers"" turn into massed blobs that are shredded by prepared guns. The game also makes no compromises in wanting you to conform to its mechanics istead of customising the experience to your wants. this has led me to a great deal of frustration, as i can't choose the composition of my army, reinforcements arrive at set times, battles end adruptly at times (when i was winning them!) with no option to continue, cannons won't fire when ordered to, units fail to follow orders sometimes, and the reasons for these circumstances are vague or completely opaque. Thankfully the community is there with detailed guides and explainations and is a must if a player wants to get a grasp on this games various quirks (although some of the guides out there have a slightly patronising tone).i'm very tempted to rate it no as frustration has so far outweighed the fun that i've had, but those moments of fun when i was able to play the game exactly the way it should be played have so far kept me interested.bottom line is i can't see this or any other game with similar mechanics being more than a niche title for strategy die hards, however if you buy it on sale (like i did) and can invest the time the rewards are certainly worth it.

I like how you have the unit commanders names and unit size easily visible. I like the troops fire and loading as they would, I'm not entirely happy with some aspects though. The troops are constantly shifting or moving and not doing what I tell them. Artillery seems to be ineffective IMO.

												If you enjoy historical rts games and have a vested interest in the civil war this game will appeal to you. For a small development team there is a surprising amount of depth here. It also needs to be said that the game offers one of the most gorgeous maps I have seen. Gettysburg and the surrounding terrain are drawn with loving detail. The UI is simple and easy to navigate. There are a variety of options for the enemy AI and you can tailor the game's difficulty to your liking. You can set the enemy to be defensive, aggressive, balanced etc. The controls are so good its a wonder other games haven't done something as intuitive. You move your units by clicking and drawing a 'arrow' on the map. It just is satisfying and reminds you of those old battle maps from your history class. Changes have been made to the game overtime allowing for even finer tuning of unit movement. For $10 bucks this game offers a lot and is worth every penny.			"

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg faithfully recreates the chaos, confusion and fluidity of the Civil War battle field. With its cutting edge AI players can recreate the opportunistic nature of Henry Heth, the assertive and confident Robert E. Lee or the daring of Pickett's charge.Far beyond the old I go; You go turn based games we all know - and love - the Commander must watch EVERYTHING in EVERY sector and plan their strategies accordingly.Morale and Leadership are key to units either breaking under fire or successfully completing charges. Command structure is faithfully recreated with the need for Coprs Commanders to be in proximity of thier subordinate units. use of terrain, for lines of sight and lines of fire and for concealing units to gain a tactical advantage over the enemy are crucial. The only thing missing is the aroma of spent gunpowder - and you'll swear you smeel that too!			"

												In june of 1863, after two years of bloody conflict, The Army Of Northern Virginia, Robert E. Lee commanding, slips across the Patomac to begin the invasion of the north. It is an army of 70,000 men. He moves slowly, using the Blue Ridge to screen his movements. General Lee knows that a letter has been prepared by the southern government, a letter which offers peace.And from there its up to you to either stop the rebellious confederates from realizing their grab for independance as the union, or do something the confederates failed to do: Take Gettysburg and destroy The Army Of The Patomac. If you enjoy the total war series, or like real time strategy games, this one is for you.			"

When I saw that Darth was making a game it was an automatic buy and my way of thanking him.The game itself is a lot of fun and the hand drawn maps are very well done. Very easy controls and the AI is pretty competent. Troop movements are as easy as clicking and dragging your mouse. Where the game really shines is in the immersion. The cannons firing the bugles calling attack and retreat orders, the rifles and musket fire with the war cries of soldiers as they assault some nameless point on a map really draws you in. "

												Recommend only if you're civil war buff or on sale. This review is mostly going to be criticism. Check out other reviews for postive things about the game. I decided to give it a thumbs up, because I did have some fun with it. This game is pretty shallow for an RTS.You mostly just order your units where to go and watch them kill each other. There isn't enough strategy or choices that you can make to turn the tide in battle. -No way to rally routing units or inspire units.-No period formation options for units.-Lacks music. I'd like to some music in the game. At least some period fife and drums for infantry. The game has no music apart from the main menu. -Cavalry are a joke. They play like cowardly infantry on horses. No option to charge in close with sabers.In the future I'd like to see more Civil war battles besides Gettysburg. I feel they need to add more to the gameplay first though.I was able to beat two medium AI opponents with both sides and get all the achievements in 9 hours. The AI only defeated me on one day of the battle. That was because he had over double the amount of men I had. It wasn't very hard for the most part. I could try the hard AI's or Multiplayer. But I don't feel the urge to play this game anymore for now. It doesn't have enough depth to keep me interested. I hope it gets better in the future. I'd like to play it again.			"

												*** update 09.16.2016***If you played with army men, and still do, this is such a gr8 game. I have played it much in 300 hrs. The LOS is a little wonky AT TIMES but overall it is amazing for a PC game. I love sending all my trrops in a flanking bash, or to plant my cannons n beg em to come get some. IMHO the replayability is massive.If you like hisorical wargaming, I can not recommend this game enough. My only complaint is that i want more civil war battles to play!PLZ = so g00d!It is not turn based, but you can pause the game and issue any orders, etc.It is like a box full of army men and a glorious battlefield.When I'm not playin my 10 hrs a day of HS I am playing this.10/10this is a sweeeet historical wargame.i have been using it like a box of army men with a very competent AI.flank north...flank south...defend... so many strategies to try.historically accurate. so fresh!the interface is very easy to learn, but the gameplay is nuanced. i am just scratching the surface, but i learn something new with each play-through.a full ""campaign"" can consist of multiple phases over multiple days. the carnage and positioning carry through from phases/days and i have found many different scenarios branching as the days develop.the AI is solid. i choose ""random"" and get at em.my only knocks are i wish i could zoom in closer, and i wish the camera would rotate. it would also be nice to have a time control with 1/2x; 1x; 2x; 4x.sometimes things move too slow n sometimes too fast which ends up with down time and a lot of pausing during fights.i have learned about the historical battle from this game which has been quite enjoyable. I have done additional research to help me understand the terrain, men that fought there, etc. This was very interesting AND has helped my tactical understanding of the battle.i can't wait to get their next one!OH YEAH, you can play the game with just a mouse, no keyboard = the way i like to game in the mornings = leaned back, feet on desk, coffee in one hand, mouse in the other, playin general on the big screen.10/10if you like armchair generaling, this is for you.

												As a person who has not been a fan of the line and fire warfare of the time period I must say that I really have fun playing this game.One might think that to get a good experiance of this kind of fighting would be to pick up one of the total war series games, however I felt that the combat was more dynamic and that battels played out more realisticaly.Battels are also interesting in that you may need to fight a seris of battels some of wich can be devistatigng losses and still push though with the same units and reinforcements on the way and ultimataly claim victory over the campain.The controls take time to get used to however and there are things I wish they did to make them easier or more fluid. A positive on the controls though is the freeform path movement orders you can issue. These allow for some beautiful manuvers that are made relatively effortless.All in all I think if possible give this game a try it hits a spot other games don't and historical games also make us aware of  the nature of the world and people we dont always realise or appreciate.

												Recommended.A very good tactical/operational take on the battle of Gettysburg, even though I feel it lacks some options. It has what is needed though, and allow for a good gaming experience for those interested in the battle itself and in civil war battles in general. As a real-time tactical game, it's sort of a spiritual successor to Sid Meier's Gettysburg, although slightly streamlined.In fairness, even though I myself would like some more advanced options for units and leading, I think this game actually is a very good blend that suits new players and more veteran players to this genre alike. As a new player you won't have a hard time understanding this game, as a more veteran player of this type of games you will have your work cut out for you as well.For anyone interested in this period and this battle, this is a very good pick, but it does lack some replayability once you've played each side and won. It will give you alot of fun hours up until that point though.			"

												Great little game. You have to watch the tutorial to get the interface quirks, but once you do, you're set to go.  The battles are fun and dynamic.  Multiple options to set the AI, which is quite challenging.  A little gem, worthwhile for a wargamer and casual player alike.  Hope they make another one.  Gotta run fight another battle.			"

Early Access Review
								Have a chance to command Union or Confederate forces in one of the bloodiest battles in the civil war. The battle of Gettysburg. And man oh man does this game do it perfectly! In Ultimate General: Gettysburg you play as a general in the Union or Confederate army with the task of capturing or defending the town of Gettysburg. You will have access to thousands of soldiers to lead to glory. All of which truly have a purpose on the battlefeild. Cannons, calviery, riflemen just to name a few that you'll use.  There won't be an instance you're going to push a unit off to the side and not use them. Which is what I love in a good strategy game. Apart from this,  there are other pluses about the game that give it an A+ in my book. The maps are both historically faithful and well crafted. They're bright, colorful, and have a unique artstyle to them. The AI is extremely smart and has variety to be selected for various degrees of challenge. I'm not talking about the standard Hard, medium, easy set. I'm talking about the AI having several different personalites that will play completely differently each time. So players looking for a reason to replay can look forward in that regard. On top of this, the battles are fairly lengthy and can get intense pretty quickly. All Ranging from small firefights to massive waves of enemy soldiers charging on your position. Plus you can even pick what strategy to take that will effect the battle flow, another reason for replaying. I highly recommend this game for any strategy gamer, you get a lot for ten bucks here. None of this half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bug filled crap thats the same price.  "

												SUMMARYExcellent strategy game.  Definitely worth purchasing.  Very challenging and realistic within each 6 hour time period, but Southern forces are moved back from taken objectives after each 6 hour time period change.  If you can live with that frustration, it is a great game.PROSVery accessible, intuitive controls, adequate graphics, realistic movement, tactics, morale, cover and elevation advantages.AI is fully adjustable from very cautious to risk taking.The individual time period slices are great fun to replay to try different moves etc.I saw no glaring bugs or performance issues, it ran very smoothly and glitch free.It is fun to play as the South and try for a different from history outcome.CONSThere is one glaring problem.  Southern units are moved back from taken objectives every time the 6 hour time portion changes.The 3 day battle is chopped up into 6 hour portions.  During each portion you have complete freedom to implement your tactics and try various what if approaches to how the South Attacked.  This yields a great deal of re-playability.The problem is that when the game changes to the next 6 hour period, it completely repositions the South's forces far back from the objectives they previously had achieved.  Hundreds of yards, not just a few feet.  Example:  By 6pm the first day my rebels were able to capture Culps hill.  When the time period runs out and jumps to the next one,  Souther forces are moved north about a mile and the Union again is in control of Culps Hill. The only thing that remains constant between time slices is each sides casualties and troop count.  Heavy losses are carried over to the next time slice.  In a nutshell the South can kill more Northern units than historical, but it is very difficult to take objectives since the time slices forfeits them over and over.			"

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg is the best Civil War Strategy game I've ever played. It's simple yet focused and does everything it sets out to do.

The reason I love this game is large scale strategy, map control, and how my performance in one battle has an effect on the next.

												I bought this out of nostlgia for the good ol fraxis classic sid meiers civil war. I will sum up my review (i wont go into too much depth on specific units, locations etc as my civil war jargons a bit rusty) in the one battle i played last night and it lasted simply one hour. Being the cockyish rts gamer experienced in many hardcore strategy games i picked a custom battle, chose devils den as the location and put the ai on the hardest most aggressive difficulty with the ai boost (whichever one was in the bottom right for difficulty selection).    On the first match which lasted all but 15 minutes the csa made me believe that i had won our first engagement, it was a tough 5min firefight and i was still learning the controls but the csa soon retreated. Feeling overconfident in my perceived strategic prowess i sent all my forces in to not only route but ahnillate the csa forces. To my horror i not only had sent my men into the main artillery brigade of the csa forces but was soon enveloped in what i would say was a near perfectambushing maneuveur that surrounded and then routed my forces. Mouth agape, and pride wounded, i went for round two. This time i used every trick i had.   I formed a tight defensive perimeter focusing on holdingwhatever high ground or structured positions and keeping my flanks secured to the point where i was nestled in the upper right hand corner of the map. I slowly advanced with sharpshooters acting as scouts and marking where batteries and battalions etc were. as the first forces of the csa began to engage (quite effectively) with both musket and artillery, whilst my artillery was out of range, I quickly ended the skirmish and fell back to the upper left corner. As the confederates advanced toward the treeline and farm (again i dont remember the exact names) down from there position of the high ground they soon came under range of my artillery. The main bulk of the confederate forces began to sweep down to my right flank and using scattered forces harrassed my main line and left flank. Their artillery effectively pushed my main force back as far as i could allow. all the while I was cycling fresh troops in with those who had been fighting and taking heavy losses. The fight was at a dead heap with losses pilling on both sides.   The csa forces then recieved reinforcements and proceded to attack my left flank which was already slim as I had moved almost half of them to fortify the rigth flank. I sent two artillery batteries within close rang of these attacking forces and with the excelsior and iron brigades as the last defense for the left flank. The csa forces soon went in for an all out charge on the left flank whilst the right flank was still in a dead heap and the main line exchanging light musket fire, with the majority being harrassing from various artillery on both sides. Just in time the V corp (i believe) came in to reinforce the left flank which was now routed. My main line at this point was in danger of being flanked from behind, simultaneously the csa forces engaging my main line went in for an all out charge in an attempt to route my entire III, and II Corp (again i dont know which was which at this point). In a last ditch effort to buy time I put my previous danger close batteries set to canister shot to fire relentlessly at the charging confederates, the csa only mistake at this point was rerouting its troops that were still in a pitched fight with my right flank to join the main attack.   I quickly but at great risk moved my fresh V corp to the right flank (i did have a plan). At this point my left flank was broken my main line was all but enveloped. If it were not for those two batteries that were preventing the confederates from maneuvering completely around im certain 75% of my forces woudve been wiped out or routed. Im hectically recycling routed troops with semi routed ones, units that had 1800 men were down to 600, the iron brigade had all but 200 men left. As i said earlier the csa main mistake was all but abandoning the right flank, with my fresh V corp and semi-battered reminince of the I believe IV corp I swept up in almost a semi circle taking heavy fire from csa batteries and routing the small remaining csa forces guarding the right flank. The bulk of my now IV and V corp swept up and I saw my chance. A chance which im sure the ai saw as well. My IV and V corp formerly the right flank swept up and semi enveloped the now mob consisting of my shattered left flank and near routed main line and the bulk of csa forces who it seems as the victory bar (bar in the upper right corner) were about 75% to my 25%.   However since they maneuvered their right flank to try and brank my left flank, and theire main force was in hand to hand with mine, the only defense their rear had was a couple of batteries (not to be taken lightly) but not within range of canister shot. The ai attempted to secure its now completely open rear but its attempt at routing my left flank earlier in the battle had left their forces too battered and simply too far to defend itself in time. As i began to envelope them one by one they began to route, csa batllte flags began to flash white (except for the texas brigade they didnt give a sh!t that they were completely surrounded) and just as it had begun it was over. I was absolutely ecstatic at seeing that I had procured a hard fought major victory for the union I hadn't felt tht accomplished with a game in years. I lost roughly 10,000 men to their 9,000 losses, though i was outnumbered, in the end though I was not outmaneuvered. I had my ego realigned and reminded myself the reason I had so much confidence in my abilities was simply because of hard fought and as my first game showed me hard lost battles like these. So to end this long story I learned three things. One this is not sid meiers civil war, it is something, different, it is more chaotic, and like chess you win or lose in the first moves of the match.Two the Texas brigade has to be wiped out, dont think you can route them, dont waste your time trying to, trust me. Third if youve stuck around long enough to read this whole thing and if any of this sounds appealing, BUY IT. I know ive only played this game for an hour but ive played enough of these and i consider rts, and simulations to be my bread and butter for gaming and i can tell right away that it is worth the fifteen bucks.Thank you Game-Labs I look forward to your future projects, 5 out of 5			"

												Well, it was a close call, but i went with ""Recommend"".Let's break it down:Pro:- The AI. There are some instances when the AI drops the ball - esp. by ignoring some of his separated units (much like i sometime forget about a brigade, after it regroups). But generally the AI is very solid and entertaining. The best thing is that it really seems to react to your actions, and initiates actions of its own. This is a breath of fresh air in a world where the AI seems to be very scripted. For this alone, i recommend this game.- The commands are easy to use, esp. the movement order is very simple and clear. i don't like that you have to always use ""Hold"" - it should be the default option (i think this is an on-going issue with TW games, which the devs have a good knowledge of).Con:- This is happening way too often:

In case you missed it - the AI charges a brigade, you reinforce your own brigade with a 2nd one. Your first brigade runs off, and then the AI and your 2nd brigade just stand there, mixed with each other. And they never fight or retreat; also, the units next to them just ignore the enemy, not firing in that direction.This is a bug that was around since early access, and it's still very common (as 30 March 2015).- There are still issues with art fire. Probably the height elevation & obstructions are not very clear, but i spent a lot of time in pause, wondering why my art isn't shooting when it had a whole range of enemies in range - and i couldn't find anything preventing them. It's very annoying, as you have to very finely move your art in a position where it will finally shoot.- Sometimes the game just won't take orders from you anymore. Normally, it's 1-click= attack, 2-clicks= charge - but sometimes, your units don't shoot and just charge, even if you just single click.- The game feels shallow, because the units & leaders are ""empty"". Since this is a one-battle-show, there should be a lot of things attached to a unit, besides a name and a leader - they have no history, there is no visible difference in equipment, no leader benefit etc. etc.- The game needs a minimap. Or a stay-on-screen alert when and where your reinforcements arrive, at lest. But a minimap is useful for tracking regrouped units also.So to sum it up - the AI is something that i would like to see in other games (hopefully, without some present issues).But the rest is nothing spectacular. i give it a 6.5 / 10.

												There are not enough words to describe how good this game is. The developers have certainly revolutionised some key elements of strategic games, most importantly the way you can command and position your units to make use of strategic advantages provided by terrain (cover, elevation, line of sight, ...). Other aspects such as unit condition and unit morale, which have also been implemented, play a key role in planning your moves as well. If you order a brigade to stay in combat for too long, its condition will slowly diminish, giving you a severe disadvantage in prolonged engagements. If morale gets too low, your units will be easily routed through cavalry attacks and bayonet charges, causing them to retreat in disarray, disobeying your commands. So you need to really take care of your units as you go, especially since they will reappear in later stages of the battle. As you go and make your decisions, lose or win single engagements, the Battle of Gettysburg will always take different courses. So even though the battle itself lasts a maximum of five days in the game, the gaming experience will never be entirely the same. The AI of your opponent is pretty good. You can select different types of AI commanders when you start the battle based on difficulty and aggressiveness. A defensive computer player will try to position itself on the high ground, pounding your positions with artillery barrages until the arrival of fresh reinforcements encourages him to attack your weakened positions. An aggressive opponent, on the other hand, will try to spot weaknesses in your formation, attacking these positions vigorously and without fear. All in all, this is a must for any person who loves strategy games, in particular those who are interested in the American Civil War. Chaaaarge!			"

												Quick and fast:- Competitive AI. It responds dynamically and will punish you for making mistakes or leaving a unit exposed. Effective use of artillery and skirmishers. I was initially highly discouraged from aggressive, risky action with flanking maneuvers due to this.- Entertaining campaign. The battle campaign is quite long, and there is tremendous replay value due to the effects of your battles having permanent effects (controlled terrain, casualties, etc.) carrying over to each mission, and so the missions can become quite ahistorical depending on what you have accomplished.- A pleasant art style, good sound effects, satisfying immersion. The battalions move convincingly, with smoke and rifle crack.- Morale is modelled well, as is training and experience levels of units.Overall,  a very entertaining game with which you can kill 10-20 hours easily. This is a fantastic game for $15, it exceeded my expectations.			"

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg is an excellent strategy game, you get to take command of either Union or Confederate forces during the battle of Gettysburg. The controls are unusually easy and simple for a strategy game, after your first battle you should have them down pretty good. The art style is unique and fits the game perfectly. Developers give a great deal of support for the game. Bugs/crashes in the game are a rarity (only have suffered one crash in my 28 hours of playing)If you're a Civil War buff, or just want a game where you can line up hundreds of men and let them fire guns at eachother with no cover (LIKE ME :D!) then this is the game for you!Overall, great game and I hope the developers add into the Ultimate General franchise.

I know they can hit the target I tell them to, because it's right next to the one they're already shelling.  But do they?  No.  They sit there dumbly until I tell them to autofire.  And when infantry get within canister range, do they target them?  Silly question, of course not.  They lob canister at troops half a map away.Infantry:  Sometimes they can shoot thorugh other units, sometimes they can't.  Though I notice it's only my soldiers who are concerned about fratricide.  Also, they're a pain to position.  Drawing the arrows is a cute gimmick, but impractical for fine positioning.  Fortification:  Units don't dig in when they're standing around idle.  Given any sort of down time, soldiers would pile rocks, logs, dirt, even bodies into makeshift breastoworks to improve their position.  Given enough time, truly formidable defensive works could be assembled in as little time as a few hours.Walls:  They tend to block fire going both ways.  Infantry should be able to man the walls, gaining the defensive bonus while being able to shoot over it.Map: The height map is not all that useful. It's better than not having it.  It can be tough to tell at a glance what the height difference is if there are no hills around to give context.All in all,  a game with promise.  Alas, it doesn't grab my attention and make me want to put the effort into it (Civil War Generals 2, I'm looking at you. And for you. What did I do with your disk!?).			"

												I want to recommend this game, but I can't right now.  It needs improvements.The graphics are good and the sound is ok...though I do wonder about the ""jungle drums"" that randomly play in the background.  The AI can pull off good maneuvers, but it can also fail miserably.The mechanics are overly simple to the point that they can cause problems.  Examples: Morale...your grizzled veterans (blue or gray) often have morale swings similar to American teenage girls having mood swings while watching Twilight.  Your men can stand in the open with no cover and have so much enthusiasm that it puts cheerleaders to shame.  You can also put them in a very good position and find that they are so depressed that they might need a psychiatrist and a smiley face balloon.The combat capability of a unit is dependent on whether its commander has a PhD in Motivational Speaking (inspiring) or if he is lactose intolerant and boring.  If he is the latter and isn't worth his milk, your soldiers will forget how to load their weapons and will shoot very slowly, even if they are veterans who have fought in 10+ battles.Artillery can shoot straight through some of the hills.  Its effects are very random.  The enemy once fired about 8 cannons, in total, at one of my brigades a half mile away (directly to the front of the cannons).  My unit lost 350 out of 800 men.  I don't remember anyone having laser-guided bombs in the 1800s.   I am convinced that my soldiers are actually Canadians because they are so polite; if you move one of your brigades too close to another brigade, one group of chaps will politely step out of the way.  The problem is that when they do so, they can go straight at the enemy and get shot to pieces.Infantry will only fire volleys.  The developers took the time to allow cannons to fire different types of ammunition, but they were somehow unable to give you the option to tell your infantry to either fire a volley or fire at will.  Firing a volley at the beginning of combat is good, but most of the time you would want your men to load and fire as fast as they can afterwards.Victory...capturing certain pieces of ground is the primary objective.  Your men could be completely surrounded on a hill and cut off from supplies, but it matters not.  I once had the highest level of victory at the highest difficulty setting because I used my entire army as cannon fodder to take objectives.  The game didn't care that I had almost completely destroyed the ability of my Confederate army to defend a single tree from a handful of rabid squirrels.Historically speaking, the developers seem to have left out a number of Union units that were in the battle, so they end up being short thousands of men (I am especially looking at your troops, Generals Meredith & Cutler).  If it was a dozen here and there, that's a margin of error and is perfectly fine; when it's thousands, it's Abraham Lincoln's carriage sitting on concrete blocks without wheels in front of the White House.I used to do volunteer work at the battlefield with park rangers, so I know more about the battle than many.  I do not expect the developers to read a dozen books on the battle, though a couple short emails to the National Park Service at Gettysburg to verify information and proof-read would have been helpful.

												When I first played this game there were no tutorials, so I had no idea how to play and gave up shortly after. Now that the tutorial is there I gave it another try and I am still not a fan. The game looks great, but the gameplay is frustrating. I even put the enemy AI to the easiest and I get beaten soundly. I am not new to strategy games and am usually pretty good, but I have no idea how this one is supposed to be played I guess. I shouldn't have to use google to figure out how to play a game.			"

								The game is fun when it works. I keep on getting bugs that prevent me from controlling my army. Othertimes the game just freezes. Within the first two hours I encountered these bugs no less than six times. It is very frustrating as I am unable to really enjoy this game. While I appreciate the effort Darth has put into this game, it is far from complete. There has to be substantial improvement in my opinion before this game becomes really playable. Before people state that it could be my rig. I play every total war game with pretty decent settings and no problem. Nonetheless, I still encourage others to give it a try.			"

								I am a Civil War reenactor and living historian, a history teacher, and a long-time gamer.  This game is extrememly good.  It reminds me of the Sid Meier Gettysburg and Sharpsburg games, but with much easier controls and visually-pleasing graphics.  The new additions of choosing a strategy, while still rough, is promising, and much better than a simple linear game.The only things that I would like to see changed are a better way to tell what units are attacking (and charging!), as well as a ""Limber"" feature for artillery (ideally to increase their speed while not firing.)  That said, even without any changes to this game at all, it is VERY solid, visually fantastic, and an absolute steal at $10.Thank you, game creators!  This is exactly what I've been hoping for!			"

If you favor Civil War battles at the brigade, division, and corps level, but don't want to get bogged down in the details, then this may be what you are looking for.  Once the developers have finished refining this title, I hope they release other Civil War battles as well.  Well worth the money at this stage of development.			"

								i LOVE this game! it looks like the old american heritage battlemaps in the books by bruce catton that introduced me to the civil war when i was 10! i love the .85 patch with the flanking attack bonus and the downhill attack bonus. now the game acts much more realistically.the whole game is so simple and elegant. such ease of play. all the critical info right at your fingertips. a masterful game and it looks gorgeous.it seems like the ai personalities have become random in the latest patch. i set it to cautious but it acts opportunistic or recklessly.some suggestions:i think the cavalry is too overpowered. let infantry attack cavalry with a flanking bonus. no cavalry in the civil ever dared to face infantry while mounted on horseback. they would have gotten slaughtered.and an artillery battery without infantry cover would get butchered by rifle fire or melee with an entire infantry brigade. they never allowed artillery to fight uncovered by infantry.with the new patch i seem to notice some odd little bugs. often when you try to pick up a battle where you left off, you can't 'continue' to the next battle. you just lose everything.there are other things that would be nice; an OPTION where there is corps and division integrity, where related brigades need or least have an option to stick together, which would usually be the case. but don't lose the manual option the game uses normally; it makes the game so easy and fun to play!i wish artillery would 'suggest' placement based on a mission, 'defend selected units or terrain' 'attack selected units or terrain' i find it really hard to place artillery. but in real life, artillery commanders would make these recommendations. and pretty much every general in the civil war was a trained engineer who would know how to read terrain and place artillery. but we don't have that knowledge. a hint would help.i think you should add lee and meade to the battlefield. and stonewall jackson with a two wing varient to the confederate order of battle.dramatic music might be a fun addition.i hope eventually you'll be able to save battles at various stages, so that you can replay a good start a few times. and i hope that you'll have a game editor to make your own battles. maybe something that can generate terrain maps from google, or from topographic survey maps, and orders of battle from textfiles we might find online.on a deeper level, there should be a varient where the confederates can hunker down and meade has to attack them or get fired or get lincoln impeached for failing to kick the rebels out of the north. that is the most important what if civil war buffs argue about.millions of suggestions. but never forget the bottom line. we LOVE this game. might be the best battle game i've ever had. and what a great price. with some extras like i'm saying, it would be worth $40 easy. it's almost worth that much as it is.

								Finally, a developer that isn't just 'digitizing"" a hex-and-paper wargame, but instead thinking through what the platform offers and building a wargame around those elements. Intuitive controls, beautiful presentation, great attention to detail, and all manageable in real-time; a very accessible and very unique Gettysburg game. Probably the most elegant computer wargame I've ever played.Update: This really is a masterpiece of design. An excellent example of how to innovate, how to make an approachable game, how to nail the controls, and how to create a truly focused experience, but still with depth. They basically took 20 years of pen-and-paper wargaming and turned it on its head, focused on what the digital platform could offer, and made this beautiful new hybrid. /me loves it			"

								Ultimate General is an easy to get into wargame which is great fun. The pacing of the game is great. Individual firefights can last a long time which I mean as a compliment compared to some other ""wargames"" where everyone rushes in and one side dies very quickly. There is plenty do (adjusting your men, trying to flank, bringing up reserrves etc) and I never felt the need for an accelerate time button. After each battle there is a brief summary of how then battle went and depending on the outcome you get to decide a broad strategy for the next battle which can vary the map and placement of units. I found the end of battle summary text a little disconnected from the battle that I thought I had fought but this is a small gripe. I suspect the replayability is not as high as I would like as it is based around one major battle. However, I am guessing there will be many mods or battle packs in the future.			"

								The current iteration of this game is great for how early it is being released.  They have a LOT on their todo list, so I'm excited to see some of it added in.  There is a good bit missing that someone that plays strategy games would expect, but if you check out the known issue link, you'll see they are aware of it and plan to add to the functionality.  That being said, the game plays great for me and has a solid base for them to continue developing on.The only thing that worries me is their projected timeframe.  I've only seen one or two games do as much as they say they have to in that kind of time frame.  I'd hate to see it rushed because it seems like they really have a chance at making a game that could compete for the best Civil War game to date.For the price, it's definitely a winner in my book.

								I would highly recommend this game to others, especially since it brings strategic and tactical elements that a player has to consider and react to which are rarely (if ever) found in other games. Flanking plays a big part in this game, both in trying to flank the ememy while being very aware of being flanked yourself.     This game also forces you to consider issues of concentration of force- you want to exert enough force at a point to make a difference, but not so much where the high density of troops causes more casualties because of cannon fire.    Last, this game really forces you to consider the placement and use of your troops. Do you move more troops to point A to try to gain a strategic point? And if so, where do you pull them from? If you pull them from point B, you may become very vunerable to an unforseen attack in that area. If you use your reserve troops from another area  in the attack, you won't have any fresh troops to stem the ememy attack in another area later in the game.    To sum it up, this game presents the gamer with a lot of strategic issues that you have to resolve. Do well, and you live to see another day. Otherwise.... "

								This game is great. It plays really well in its current form and is quite challenging. I'm hoping for some new features in the future that have to do with unit control and formations (something like total war's right-click and drag to set the line). If you like Civil War history and appreciate historically accurate battlefields this game is for you.			"

												First of all... This game is only in ""beta"", but it make a lot of fun and I like it for that.It´s a very nice game with a superb AI. Now, some points who I like and some points who I see room for improvement(only a small selection)+ superb AI+ Good troop movement (like the moving with arrows)+ nice map+ good and easy to play (nice for afterwork playing)room for improvement* only 5 groups are possible* fire range should be in another colours (maybe red for no range and green for in range)* seperate colour for armycorps, if I click the commander* maybe a counter, who show the various time for the next reinforcementThe developer need a chance to complete this nice product and I hope they take the feedback of the communityto improve this game. That´s the reason why I bought it and I was absolute not disappoint.  "

												Love RTS games and thought I would like this as well. I did not.I did loads of research to try to get better in this game, but much of it seems random. I can use the same strategy multiple times (on the same map) and sometimes my troops will route and other times they will not. Maybe it was because I positioned my troops 2 degrees to some direction and a stray shot from some other unit positioned 1 degree in opposite direction managed to hit my ""flank"" and drained my morale? Don't get me started on artillery, half of the time they won't fire and there will be no explanation. This game is pure frustration and despite the overall good reviews many agree with me. How do I know? Look at the achievements, 80% get the achievement just to finish the first level - yet, only 12% finish the Confederate campaign and 16% finish the Union campaign. Even if every player who finishes a campaign is unique (ie, no player completes both), about two thirds of players never finish any campaign. Realistically, considering many ""hardcore"" fans will finish both campaigns, something like 70-80% probably never finish the game.The game has good ideas and is pretty fluid with good UI, but it needs a tutorial badly and also needs game mechanics that are more consistent.

								This game is from the developer of one of the best modseries for Totalwar (Darthmod) If that is not recomondation enough the game has wicked ai and is very fun to play!I went into this expecting the ai to be harder compared to the totalwar games, i did not expect to get destroyed quite so handely by the ai.. I lined up my men, tried to flank the enemy artillery expecting the ai to bug out over my ""advanced"" manouvers only to find most of my cav and two full battalions of infantry surrounded behind enemy lines, the north lost many good sons that first day. First game results: Resounding defeat and the confederacy won the battle! (Sorry guys, but it seems you will be picking cotton on the fields for a good while yet. I have failed thee) :(And thats just vs the balanced ai setting!! There are many different settings from cautious to super aggressive! I cant wait to try them all out (And hopefully start winning battles)Edit after some hours of play: Ai is showing some weaknes after you learn the game. Its hard to lose now, and the game spawns armies behind your lines even with me controlling all locations, feels kinda gimicky to increase difficulty. I know armies could come from different directions but not without warning. Also, rivers and other terrain impact the game to little with cannons able to set up in the river and cross rivers without using bridges and so on.. Regardless the ai is still better then anything else out there imo.The game is really fun, and at this price (early access) its a steal!!! G0 buy right now, you wont regret it!!			"

Ultimate General: Gettysburg, which, instead of playing out over the course of the entire Civil War, focuses on its most famous confrontation. The game is a lot of fun, blending historic names and locations with alternate courses of events that keep games fresh and exciting. While it might not be concerned enough with its historic accuracy to please those most interested in a history lesson, it’s a game that should be on the radar of anyone with a passing interest in the RTS genre. Ultimate General: Gettysburg handles the flow of its campaign extremely well. Obviously Gettysburg, being a real battle in a real war, had a distinct outcome- the Union defeated the Confederacy on the third day. It’d be pretty boring if players were tied to the ebb and flow of the real battle, but the game instead plays like a choose your own adventure novel. The first battle always starts out the same (except for your choice of playing as the North or South), then after that, depending on how the battle goes, you’re given a few choices on what you want to do next based on how much damage and land each side took in the previous confrontation. You can decide to make your next objective taking over a location to earn Victory Points (basically just number for how strategically valuable different locales are to the overall battle), to protect a certain front, etc. Additionally, unit losses carry over from one campaign battle to the next, meaning that even if you’re dominating there’s still reason to be careful. Thinning out your larger brigade at the end just to finish a little quicker may seem like a good idea, but it’s going to come back to bite you in the next round when the opponents get lots of reinforcements and you’re suddenly overpowered. These combined to make each of the three campaign playthroughs I tried vastly different, which was great. Unlike some strategy games, most forms of resource management aren’t something you’ll have to worry about in Ultimate General: Gettysburg. You won’t have to try to be a careful spender, keep track of research trees or raise combatants’ stat points, etc. You don’t even have to worry about what units to produce. In fact, the entire management side is really quite simple. There are only two things you need to keep track of among your soldier groups: morale and condition. Morale is what you’d expect- the willingness to fight.Ultimate General: Gettysburg does a great job of being simple enough for anyone to learn in a short sitting, but deep enough to keep you learning and perfecting your tactics deep into subsequent playthroughs.DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												First battle I played my troops wouldn't stand still for a single minute to fire at the enemy. I then realize there was a ""hold"" command, so after restarting the battle I utilized this command. It helped, but then a single brigade simply ran through my lines. I lost about 50 troops despite flanking them with cavalry. They took almost no losses and preceded to calmly walk through my lines towards the victory point. I tried to charge at them but my troops were too scared to attack their openly exposed flanks. I lost because the enemy used a single brigade, calmly walking it from objective to objective despite being completely exposed to my units. In reality, this would have been suicide. I can't believe I wasted more money on a game that doesn't work (few seem to these days). Avoid this game unless you want to play PC-Cheat Simulator 2014.			"

												Civil war nerds this is for you (I would know). Its simple, engaging and fun.MY ONLY COMPLAINT:Line of Sight or ""LoS"" is a huge part of this game. If your units have no line of sight, they won't fire on an enemy even if they are in range. The higher your ground, the better your LoS, so this game is all about capturing the high ground and ridges. Unfortunately, it's not intuitive as to which areas will give you good LoS. I'll fight for the highest ground on the map for half an hour, move my cannons to the top (they are epically slow), ready to blow up evrything in sight and once they get there, for some reason have worse LoS then when they were in their original position. So that can become annoying. I do wish there was a way of ""scouting"" out a position before sending your entire army up a hill and realizing it has no LoS advantage whatsoever. I can't tell if this system is slightly broken or if it's just mastery of incredibly minute movements that get you good LoS once on top of a hill.overall fun game, worth every penny.			"

								If you can get this for the early access price of $9.99, go for it.  Otherwise, stay away... it has some aggravating issues.The propaganda says ""no more babysitting your units"", untrue.  I found that I absolutely have to micromanage because the AI does such a poor job of handling my units.  Some examples:I've found units with their backs to the enemy (and not facing another enemy unit, nor had I previously issued any facing instructions to this unit).  One time, I watched one of these units to see how long it would remain facing away; it did so until it routed.Sometimes units will go into what I call ""Night Rider"" mode where they constantly change their facing, thus never actually firing on any nearby enemies.I have ordered artillary to fire on units which are in range and in LOS, only to have the artillary advance toward the enemy unit, rather than firing from its current position.I have found artillary firing at distant skirmishers in cover, rather than a nice juicy unit in line formation begging for a dose of cannister.Bottom line, if you can get it cheap, do it.  Otherwise, wait to see if they fix some of these vexing issues.			"

												Brilliant tactical gameplay. The battles are like the total war series, but far better executed in my opinion. The way soldiers charge, break and reform is awesome. It is very difficult to cause a full blown rout, but units will be broken, retreat, and usually reform once they are out of harms way. The balance of morale is in my opinion stunning, and is one of my favorite things about the game.Obviously, the only battle is Gettysburg, split into several scenarios depending on how things go. The battle is immensely enjoyable to me, but if you have no interest in the american civil war, you may not find it so interesting. All in all, I recommend this game, as I feel it is superbly balanced, and a lesson in how to do tactical battles right.			"

												To start i love American civil war games which helps a lot , ive played Sids Gettysburg , and AACW both which were very good , This game is for a select few who enjoy the civil war genre, its an indie game so the devs dont have vasts ammounts of money to throw at it.Having said the above the game is very good if not a tad overpriced , however they need all the money they can get if they are to continue developing the game which hopefully they will.The game itself is the battle of gettysburg with each battle a couple of hours long gametime , only 30 mins normally realtime , each time you finish part of the battle the results are carried over into the next bit of the battle and you get to chose a stratergy .The historical aspect is very well done , if you play the rebs you need to push very hard the first day if you dont you will end up having to make that same fateful decision Lee did on the third day.As the Yanks just survive the first day etc , you get what im meaning , if you have knowlege of the battle of gettysburg it really helps so read up if you plan to play this game.Overall the game is good and represents the gettysburg battle very well , try not to use the pause button to much to get a real feel of the game.Edit 07/10/15 since the last patch its has been very hard to play the confeds union troops seem to be vastly better in every aspect now.

Thomadis menulis bahwa meskipun secara historis tentara Union-lah yang memenangkan pertempuran tersebut, pemain dapat merubah segalanya dengan membuat tentara Confederate menang. AI dalam game Ultimate General: Gettysburg ini juga dibuat lebih pintar sehingga membuat pemain menjadi lebih tertantang.<h1>Kelebihan</h1>+ pasukan spawn ketika loyalitas perang semakin turun+ permainannya cukup simple+ graphicnya ringan dengan tampilan HD+ soundnya cukup baik+ anda betul-betul mengendalikan sekitar 10.000 pasukan dalam 1x battle+ pengunungan, perumahan, tempat tinggi bahkan tempat rendah anda gunakan sebagai taktik perang<h1>Kekurangan</h1>- cuman ada 3 type pasukan : tentara, artilery sama knight- tidak bisa buat pasukan menunggu loyalitas perang- campaign misi pendek sekali sekitar 6-7x battle anda sudah men-tamatkan game ini- banyak army, susah kontrolnya<h1>Apakah Game ini direkomendasikan</h1>iya, tetapi game ini hanyalah sebuah RTS simple sehingga bagi anda yang mengharapkan lebih dari game ini, maaf ini hanya game yang sangat simple sekali dengan tampilan hd dan tidak terlalu rumit untuk dimenangkan. Smart AI membuat game ini susah untuk melawan sebuah bot, botnya sangat pintar sekali dalam hal mengatur strategi sehingga di awal-awal anda hanya akan dapat frustasi bagaimana cara mengalahkannya, ingat jika anda bertahan di posisi bukit maka anda akan menang 50% tetapi jika anda menyerang melalui padang terbuka ataupun perjalanan naik ke bukit, itu hanya 20%. sehingga gunakan sesuatu disekitar anda untuk bertahan baik itu rumah, hutan dll.

												The game is fun to play and has little to no learning curve involved.  The AI system is worked out pretty well with each setting have certain strageties that makes each play through different.  If you enjoy strategy games this game is for you.Pros-easy controls-is not wildly inaccurate.  There is no Lee or Meade as they rely on Corps commanders to be on the field.-strong ai system.  It adapts and will constantly outsmart you on harder difficulties-can be played through several times. I have finished the battle on day 1 with less tha  10,000 casualties or on day 4 with over 73,000. There are so many different outcomes-The bonuses for each side are evenly balance (though the US better trained infantry does not make as much sense considering they have been fighting since 1861) thus making it possible for either side to win.Cons-still hard to figure out where artillery needs to be placed.  I spend quite some time just shifting artillery around so they can shell the enemy.-No Full battle or day scenarios.  You cant fight the entire battle of Gettysburg in one go.  The way they have it set up you must fight segments of each day.  Though this can also be seen as a pro as it wouldn't be as hard on the pcs as it would if you had all 160,000 men on the field.-No chance to capture enemy.  In Sid Meier's you could surround an enemy unit and he would surrender giving you extra points and eliminating them from the rest of the game.  They did not put that in this game so it does get frustrating when you incircle Reynolds corps and watch them rout to safety.			"

								I am an graduate student of Military History, and my emphasis is the American Civil War.  I find Ultimate General: Gettysburg to be historically accurate concerning the units involved and their positions on the Gettysburg battlefield.  I find this game quite enjoyable and easy to learn, while at the same time offering a challenge.The mechanics of Ultimate General: Gettysburg make for a fun and easy-to-learn/hard-to-master game.  The difficulty selection allows for a player to choose between a variety of AI opponent playstyles, from Cautious Defender to Ambitious Attacker.  The user interface is easy to learn and frees the player to focus on strategic concerns.  The AI are smart and will take advantage of weaknesses in player strategy.  Artistically, UG:G gives the player the feeling that they are the supreme commander of their army looking at their battlemap.This game is definitely not for everyone.  Persons who are not interested in strategy will not enjoy this game.  Persons who are more interested in graphics and visual entertainment will not enjoy this game.  Strategy gamers interested more in realistic tactics than graphics will enjoy this game.In conclusion, I give this game a rating of 8 out of 10.  My reason for dropping 2 points is that I would like to see more battles than just Gettysburg.  Perhaps in future updates the developers could add more historic battles.			"

												To start i love American civil war games which helps a lot , ive played Sids Gettysburg , and AACW both which were very good , This game is for a select few who enjoy the civil war genre, its an indie game so the devs dont have vasts ammounts of money to throw at it.Having said the above the game is very good if not a tad overpriced , however they need all the money they can get if they are to continue developing the game which hopefully they will.The game itself is the battle of gettysburg with each battle a couple of hours long gametime , only 30 mins normally realtime , each time you finish part of the battle the results are carried over into the next bit of the battle and you get to chose a stratergy .The historical aspect is very well done , if you play the rebs you need to push very hard the first day if you dont you will end up having to make that same fateful decision Lee did on the third day.As the Yanks just survive the first day etc , you get what im meaning , if you have knowlege of the battle of gettysburg it really helps so read up if you plan to play this game.Overall the game is good and represents the gettysburg battle very well , try not to use the pause button to much to get a real feel of the game.Edit 07/10/15 since the last patch its has been very hard to play the confeds union troops seem to be vastly better in every aspect now.

												Brilliant tactical gameplay. The battles are like the total war series, but far better executed in my opinion. The way soldiers charge, break and reform is awesome. It is very difficult to cause a full blown rout, but units will be broken, retreat, and usually reform once they are out of harms way. The balance of morale is in my opinion stunning, and is one of my favorite things about the game.Obviously, the only battle is Gettysburg, split into several scenarios depending on how things go. The battle is immensely enjoyable to me, but if you have no interest in the american civil war, you may not find it so interesting. All in all, I recommend this game, as I feel it is superbly balanced, and a lesson in how to do tactical battles right.			"

												<h1>Review Ultimate General: Gettysburg</h1><h1>Rating</h1> 7/10<h1>Detail/Deskripsi Game</h1>Dalam designer note, kreator dari game Ultimate General: Gettysburg Nick Thomadis menceritakan mengenai fitur-fitur apa saja yang terdapat dalam game tersebut. Thomadis menulis bahwa meskipun secara historis tentara Union-lah yang memenangkan pertempuran tersebut, pemain dapat merubah segalanya dengan membuat tentara Confederate menang. AI dalam game Ultimate General: Gettysburg ini juga dibuat lebih pintar sehingga membuat pemain menjadi lebih tertantang.<h1>Kelebihan</h1>+ pasukan spawn ketika loyalitas perang semakin turun+ permainannya cukup simple+ graphicnya ringan dengan tampilan HD+ soundnya cukup baik+ anda betul-betul mengendalikan sekitar 10.000 pasukan dalam 1x battle+ pengunungan, perumahan, tempat tinggi bahkan tempat rendah anda gunakan sebagai taktik perang<h1>Kekurangan</h1>- cuman ada 3 type pasukan : tentara, artilery sama knight- tidak bisa buat pasukan menunggu loyalitas perang- campaign misi pendek sekali sekitar 6-7x battle anda sudah men-tamatkan game ini- banyak army, susah kontrolnya<h1>Apakah Game ini direkomendasikan</h1>iya, tetapi game ini hanyalah sebuah RTS simple sehingga bagi anda yang mengharapkan lebih dari game ini, maaf ini hanya game yang sangat simple sekali dengan tampilan hd dan tidak terlalu rumit untuk dimenangkan. Smart AI membuat game ini susah untuk melawan sebuah bot, botnya sangat pintar sekali dalam hal mengatur strategi sehingga di awal-awal anda hanya akan dapat frustasi bagaimana cara mengalahkannya, ingat jika anda bertahan di posisi bukit maka anda akan menang 50% tetapi jika anda menyerang melalui padang terbuka ataupun perjalanan naik ke bukit, itu hanya 20%. sehingga gunakan sesuatu disekitar anda untuk bertahan baik itu rumah, hutan dll.

Early Access Review
								I am an graduate student of Military History, and my emphasis is the American Civil War.  I find Ultimate General: Gettysburg to be historically accurate concerning the units involved and their positions on the Gettysburg battlefield.  I find this game quite enjoyable and easy to learn, while at the same time offering a challenge.The mechanics of Ultimate General: Gettysburg make for a fun and easy-to-learn/hard-to-master game.  The difficulty selection allows for a player to choose between a variety of AI opponent playstyles, from Cautious Defender to Ambitious Attacker.  The user interface is easy to learn and frees the player to focus on strategic concerns.  The AI are smart and will take advantage of weaknesses in player strategy.  Artistically, UG:G gives the player the feeling that they are the supreme commander of their army looking at their battlemap.This game is definitely not for everyone.  Persons who are not interested in strategy will not enjoy this game.  Persons who are more interested in graphics and visual entertainment will not enjoy this game.  Strategy gamers interested more in realistic tactics than graphics will enjoy this game.In conclusion, I give this game a rating of 8 out of 10.  My reason for dropping 2 points is that I would like to see more battles than just Gettysburg.  Perhaps in future updates the developers could add more historic battles.			"

												I went into this game thinking i wouldn't like it very much, considering RTS isn't typically my genre of choice. This game definitely surprised me. It is very different, and much better than any other RTS I have ever played. First of all, the game doesn't have rigid movements, like the Civilization series. It is not turn based, you can move freely and whenever you want.  The game also has very nice sound, including guns firing, people murmuring, cannons blasting, and armies yelling ""RETREAT"" when they see you coming near them. The best part about this game is the advanced AI. You can change the AI to your liking at the start of every battle. There are several different choices, ranging from very aggresive to very defensive. Overall, this is an incredibly well made game that is amazing at it's current state, and is sure to get even better as it further develops!8.9/10			"

												Actual garbage. I really wanted to like this game. I've played a couple games, and honestly, I just can't get into it. The controls are incredibly weird for what kind of game this is, as almost the entire game is just the left mouse button. Also, throughout every game that I've played, the AI's range is just far superior to that of the troops at my disposal. Entire charges are useless, as your men die by the hundreds every second, only to look to see that even though they are technically in melee combat, the enemy hasn't taken a single casualty. Entire games go by where even though you flank the enemy, use artillery, and outnumber regiments, they never break and even cause your men to break. If you can find out how to play the game better than me, and have a fun time playing, by all means. Please research the gameplay and possible strategies before you buy this. All this being said, I wish the developer much success. 4/10			"

												Confederates are underpowered. Putting an entire Corp (3-5 infantry divisions) attacking on an open field against one Union Division (not a Corp) located in some trees results in the Union Division winning. You have to win through maneuvers, you can't bash the other side away. Also, Confederate charges don't work, and that is supposed to be the strength of the South. Easy wins if you want to play as the Union, but not a balanced gameplay.			"

												The only reason this game got such high reviews is because of the controversial decision by apple to pull it from the itunes store. Seeing the reviews (which I now know are just a giant ♥♥♥♥ apple circlejerk) I was excited for this game as total war like strategy games from indie developers are few and far between. Then I actually played the game. God where to begin with the problems with this game. The mechanics are horribly flawed, the ui is garbage, and the controls are annoying.  Summary of the main♥♥♥♥♥♥wrong with this broken game  I didnt even know you could use control and right mouse button to move your units instead of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ inaccurate drag technique for like 10 hours into the game. Its not in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial they provide.  unit movement is annoying as most of the time they will refuse to stay in formation and have to form back up because the front of the formation has to turn around and come back to the rest of the trooops the ui is 2005 level basic. No effort whatsoever was put into it and if there was any, it was in vain.  the game gives a 2-3 sentence explanation of your armies and strengths and weaknesses. Thats it. No unit explanations, not that there are hardly any units anyway, but you'll have to find out their capabilities on the battlefield for yourself as the game provides no information at all. mechanics aren't explained at all. Many times your artillery won't be firing due to one reason or another and you'll have no clue as to why they are just sitting there with their thumbs up their asses. Nothing is explained to the player and any information you want is going to have to be found online.  Melee combat in this game makes absolute no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. In the first mission, if you play as the confederates, and at the beginnign you have a huge advantage in numbers and supposedly your troops are better at melee. Surefire win right? wrong. As you charge the union skirmishers, they run away slowly. losing only about a one man per second in melee ""combat"". The enemy skirmishers will lose a third of their unit but not really care as they just keep slowly jogging off the battlefield. Eventually, your troops will become exhausted and have to stop, and it is then when the skirmishers will turn around and fire on you like nothing has happened, causing your units to flee. This game could've been a very good, creative game but unfortunately it lacks the polish that is necessary for a good game. Instead, this game falls pretty flat and is easily forgettable as a mediore, lackluster title. If you're really interested maybe get it on sale for >$2.50 but other than that I wouldn't pick this one up.  "

												There's a litte bit of awkwardness to the controls at times, and the maps themselves can sometimes be a little muddled (victory-points that have a larger radius than you'd ever imagine, line-of-sight obstructions that don't always make sense). And there's a few minor issues regarding how the game calculates a winner and what victory screen you get. And you're always playing the Battle of Gettysburg, though there are enough permutations of it that it's more like having 3 or 4 battles to pick and play... which is still not a ton.So, why am I recommending this?Because the gameplay is reasonably fun, the AI is usually rather good (even when compared to AAA title strategy games), and the price is right.Ultimate General: Gettysburg is not exactly a great game. But it's a good enough - and cheap enough - game to warrant picking it up and learning it, getting a play out of it here and there. Ultimate General: Gettysburg reminds me of Unity of Command in terms of price, variety of content, and quality of CPU opponents. The games themselves are an RTS and a Turn-Based, respectively, and play quite differently, yet share the same strengths. Overall, for the price, Ultimate General: Gettysburg is a good game, and is worth a look if you like RTS-style games that utilize some of the same mechanics of Total War games (the developer for this game modded Total War extensively).

												After 15 hours of play I still can't express my feelings about this game. Things I'm impressed by:- Beautiful, legible graphics. System of arrows inspired by classic maps is excellent;- Historical exactness of Gettysburg and vicinity;- Nice combat mechanics.Thing that makes me mad:- System of deploying the troops and the quantity of brigades after winning the battle. For example, please imagine oyur EPIC VICTORY of Confederates. You totally surround Cemetery Hill. Objectives fulfilled by Union: None.Objectives fulfilled by you, o' brave Johnny Reb: Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, Seminary Ridge, Culp's Hill.Losses: Union-10927, Confederates-11825.Next fight you are going to be ""awarded"" by significant ~40% less troops than one gentleman, who posted video of this particular battle. Can't understand this kind of logic. Frustration won. Can't give thumb up with a clear conscience.In general - it's good game. Even very good for people interested in this world-changing battle of American Civil War. So if you're ready for some good tactical combat - give it a try. God bless Robert E. Lee. "

The games themselves are an RTS and a Turn-Based, respectively, and play quite differently, yet share the same strengths. Overall, for the price, Ultimate General: Gettysburg is a good game, and is worth a look if you like RTS-style games that utilize some of the same mechanics of Total War games (the developer for this game modded Total War extensively).

												I have to say that so far this is one of the coolest titles that I have played.  It is very relaxing for an arm chari general.  I really like the flow of it.  The look of the game is super.  It really feels like you are watching a documentary or reading a textbook covering a historic battle.  The game is smooth.  Looking at it at first glance it seems overly simple but honestly there is a lot to consider when playing.  The beauty to me is that the UI is so clean and out of the way.  It is so refreshing to have a strategy game that allows me to direct my troops without having to drill thru a thousand and one levels to do so or pull me out of the game with and overly complex UI.   I very much hope to see other battles covered both from this and other wars.  As much of a Paradox fan as I am and enjoy grand strategies, sometimes it is refreshing to have a strategy game like Ultimate General: Gettysburg where you can just sit back and plan the battles and not have to overly worry about the logistics.   Yes I know that logistics is a huge part of real world battles, but thank goodness I don't fight real world battles.			"

												Gonna have to avoid recommending this simply because the game does a really bad job at explaining itself. And you're pretty required to read a forum post by the developer to understand all the hidden-and-unexplained mechanics.I didn't find the game interesting enough to warrant that kind of time-investment before I could start making sense of it, and I have far too many other games that don't have that kind of unnecessary barrier.

												The game is good but at the same time very VERY frustrating. The Texas Brigade is WAY overpowered and takes no hits compared to whatever brigade is up against it. An entire Corp can be carried by the Texas Brigade  while the Texns will take about 5 hits. Not even canister shot seems to phase them. It's a shame to spend an hour and a half fighting a battle just to get hammered by this untouchable unit.  Time to change this!			"

												Ultimate General: UNFAIRsburgReally disappointing, the idea was great, made with Unity and by people who seems to know how to create a strategy game based on the XIX century wars, who really studied the American Civil War.This would be great by itself, but this is not a historical documentary, this is a videogame, and the gameplay mechanics are so vague that after playing no more than 5 hours I cannot deal with it. Too many problems: you can´t manage formations, you don´t know differences between the unities, you don´t really know how and where the troops are moving and finally the unity selection system that is really awfull.The word that best describes all is UNFAIR, your troops fall back really fast and against less number of troops, I know the troops behaviour depends on so many stats but it is not true, more than a time with more moral, cover and condition falling back seems to be the best for them. This fact makes you exit from the experience and then the game becomes unplayable.My recommendation is that if you wanna play a well executed strategy game based on that period give a chance to any of the two Total War saga, Napopleon or Empire, those are better than this one.

Note that you only control the battle, there is no strategic element involved, nor any resources to be managed, just men, cannons and horses.I really like the way Ultimate General: Gettysburg finally turned out.IMHO well worth the regular entry fee.Currently one of my favorite games, although the hours played might not show this fact.

												There's a litte bit of awkwardness to the controls at times, and the maps themselves can sometimes be a little muddled (victory-points that have a larger radius than you'd ever imagine, line-of-sight obstructions that don't always make sense). And there's a few minor issues regarding how the game calculates a winner and what victory screen you get. And you're always playing the Battle of Gettysburg, though there are enough permutations of it that it's more like having 3 or 4 battles to pick and play... which is still not a ton.So, why am I recommending this?Because the gameplay is reasonably fun, the AI is usually rather good (even when compared to AAA title strategy games), and the price is right.Ultimate General: Gettysburg is not exactly a great game. But it's a good enough - and cheap enough - game to warrant picking it up and learning it, getting a play out of it here and there.

												This is Sid Meyer's ""Gettysburg!"" rebuilt in Unity-- more or less.  Units are at brigade level.  It's got all your heroes from reading Bruce Catton under the covers when you were 11:  Iron Brigade, Kershaw, Bucktails, Vincent, Stuart's Cavalry, you name it, its got it.  Battles are scaled up a bit (Little Round Top generally is fought over by about 10,000 men on each side instead of 3,000 Union and 6,000 Confederates).  Union can be overpowered in some configurations. MP is great, but has a few quirks.  Some LOS mapping issues, a dead MP map (at the moment). *Update - Map has been fixed*Support from developers is fair, but could be better if you buy the game from them and give them money. *Update - Most recent patch is pretty good and improves balance.*10/10 - Still picking canister shot from my teeth.

												I have played this game off and on for the last two years, I have got to say I like the game in some instances. I enjoy the game when it is not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.THIS IS A GREAT GAME! BUT IT CAN BE REALLY FRUSTARATING. It is in the instances in which the game's battle programming screws up, that I get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.I do not reccommend this game based off of its AI, simply because I cannot tell whether or not my troops are about to get massacred by some lucky barrage of musket fire from an enemy unit, in the forest, on the other side of a hill. Another thing, cannons are terrible in this game in places that they absolutely shouldn't. I could be firing a solid cannon shot onto an open field of units and it doesn't do a thing. The only time I have effectively used cannons are when the enemy gets into close quarters with them and I use cannister shot or grapeshot. This drives me up the wall because I cannot figure out the point of having cannons if all they really can do is act as an extremely vulnerable shotgun. Despite the game having hills and forests and a map to kind of show you the elevations of everything, I still can't figure out if my units are on top of a ridge or hill or if they are just cresting it, this is more of a personal issue I suppose but I can't figure out where to position my troops. This causes me to take massive calcusties or I am not able to get an optimal position.DESPITE ALL OF THAT, I still enjoy the game simply because there is nothing else of its kind.			"

								EARLY ACCESS THOUGHTS AS OF 6/17/14So far so good. Especially since they are saying it's just 70% done.Love:1. I love the clear unit control. Really well done here. I feel like I have all the control I could possibly need. I really didn't feel like a needed grouping and group formations with all that I was given.2. The condition + moral meters. This is huge. A unit may have high moral, but if their condition is low and they are worn out they're going to get it in the face pretty quick. I really enjoyed that mechanic and balancing the reseverse with the main attack. I'm impressed.3. The scenarios are well paced to me. Really interesting with one scenario taking up from the next. It never really feels overwhelming. And sure you may lose ground on day one, but you've made them pay in blood which will be felt later in the scenarios. Love it.Improvements:1. Need a quick movement and fire tutorial. Possibly in the form of a little drilling minigame. Went several scenarios without realizing I could rotate troops without using the movement arrow. (admittedly I probably should have looked on the forum which I did later, but still, it would be a nice improvement)2. Minimap. I've had small holding actions on one front turn into something bigger by accident as the AI decides to press the advantage while my attentenion is diverted. Meaning that that unit soon gets surrounded and shredded. Then again I guess that did happen back then so yeah, but it would be nice to have a full picture at a quick glance.Hate:1. Artillery sight lines. I had a lot of trouble trying to position my artillery with proper sight lines. I routinely moved them to places that I thought should be perfect and I ended up not being able to see the front at a crucial time.2. Artillery targeting. I felt like I couldn't really command artillery to focus fire properly either. I wanted to weaken up a flank or keep some troops pinned down, but I never felt fully in control of the artillery fire.Other than that I'm really shocked how good this game is so far. Well done. $10 well spent in my opinion.			"

I picked this up because it was cheap and looked like a bit of fun outside my usual WWII and later wargames.  My expectations were not particularly high.I was amazed.  This is one of the most immediately engaging wargames I've ever played.  The friendly AI is smart enough not to need babysitting so you can focus on the overall battle, the enemy AI is responsive and quick to make you regret any tactical indiscretions.  The interface is minimalistic but sufficient and the slightly cartoonish visuals are gorgeous.  The whole package works really well.Obviously ACW nuts will buy this if they have any sense, but if you have any interest in pre-20C wargames, this is a great title. "

								This game is interesting.  Unlike Total War, you must take objectives that are marked on the map to win.  Total War battles are last man standing, instead of a more historically accurate, taker of the field.  Simply take and hold the stronger positions and the enemy will eventually rout.  The AI is incredibly smart, and you must be wary of such a foe.  I give this game 4 stars out of 5.			"

The friendly AI is smart enough not to need babysitting so you can focus on the overall battle, the enemy AI is responsive and quick to make you regret any tactical indiscretions.  The interface is minimalistic but sufficient and the slightly cartoonish visuals are gorgeous.  The whole package works really well.Obviously ACW nuts will buy this if they have any sense, but if you have any interest in pre-20C wargames, this is a great title. "

												Pros:Challenging single player-realistic feeling-AI-well thought through game mechanics-Absolutely fantastic multiplayerCons:Can be quite overwhelming at first-Unit formations flip out around steep hills and it looks ugly, despite having little effect on gameplay-not enough people to shrek in multiplayer (although it WAS 3:00am on game launch day I guess)I've been a fan of Darth and his mods for some years, so buying his game was a given. And I don't regret a single cent, everything I ever wanted from a large scale strategic game. Whether you favour sneaky flanks or straightforward charge under the generals whip, this game let's you do it all, no forced meta, just a battle of witts. In the multiplayer it's your battlefield entirely and you can engage in one of the most fun strategic experiences I've had up to date.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played, I always loved strategy games and this has become one of my favorites.I heard from people it was from the maker of DarthMod so I thought by myself let's give it a try and I don't regret it, the 12€ are totally worth it!I recommend this game because I like the morale system and the pros and cons of the Union and Confederacy also you'll get different scenarios in the battle of Gettysburg if you lose or win, at one point you get also the chance to wait and rest or just go and attack.Are you going to be an ultimate general?

												This is a great new strategy game that gives you the best value for money.  With the various AI personalities and multiplayer, the game has excellent replay value.I played the Sid Meier's version of this battle and it set the bar very high.  In many respects, Ultimate General  has already surpassed that venerable game, but there is still work to do.  This game lays a foundation for better things to come and with such a dedicated developer, will become a cult classic.  And maybe with its price, it can find its way into the mainstream.			"

								Game is awesome!  I love how the makers focused on terrain and cover for your units, that along with reloading gives it an almost realistic feel.  Also, it's educational in a way, the detailed maps give you a real idea of how the battle might have been.  Next time I read about the historical battle, I have a better understanding of how the ridges and hills played a big role.  Really fun to play, it's a challenge, but not so much that it gets frustrating.  My only complaint is that it just covers one battle, I hope they make a new game that covers the whole civil war, or at least more of the main battles, Chanceslorsville, Shiloh, Manassas, ect.  Also, they could do Waterloo and the Napolonic Wars as well.  Hope to see more.			"

												This game is just gorgeous. I saw it while surfing on steam and i bought it a few gameplay videos later. What a beauty, not just because of its look also and especially because of its simplicity. There are not fifty buttons to push, not a complicate camera to handle with, you just have to concentrate on the battle. I miss that consequense in many big strategy titles nowadays. Reading the terrain, placing your troops in a good tactical position and then striking the enemy are the most important things in Ultimate General. And with that innovative steering feature it works so well.Not to mention what a great AI this game has. Normally, i suck at online multiplayer, but here i have done two matches, lost the first one very tight and won my second match against much more expierencend players (four and five stars). So the game rewards you for a good tactical performance and the brilliant AI trains you very well in it. Sure, there could be a better tutorial for beginners and more multiplayer maps. It is also obvious, that the placement of troops on hills look a little curious sometimes. But i think, the team will fix this in the next time. Overall a great title and for me one of the best games this year. Thanks to Nick Thomadis and his team for such a great gaming experience. Can't wait to see more things to come for Ultimate General!			"

								          Wow, this game really challenged me.  I love the Total War series to death, but there are some things that I get out of this game that those could never really achieve.  First off, one of the things I love the most/the bane of my existence, complex moral.  Once a unit is broken, you can almost guarantee it will come back, which really makes it more viable to move your army around, take advantage of situations and also it keeps some units really tied up keeping an eye on the routers.  It’s really interesting to see the men slowly start trickling back and then everyone run for it.  It adds quite the element to the battle.          Secondly, I like that the battle is broken down into phases, or days, and that unit sizes and locations (to an extent) carry over day to day.  It’s good to have the map move around like that and between fights I like balancing my options of what my next step should be.  Press my advantage now?  Or wait until tomorrow when I am re-supplied and re-enforced?  It can turn the tide of the battle.          I enjoy the fact that both sides are not equal and have their own strengths and weaknesses as well, and that this even works its way down into single units having differences as well.  It makes planning your strategy and setup much more interesting.  This combined with being able to set the AI's difficulty and tendencies is a killer combination.          Unit placement can be tricky however, and I would like to be able to see the space my regiment will be occupying with perhaps a hotkey of some kind, and a more cohesive grouping ability would be nice as well.  Sometimes I noticed some units move about on their own, even if they aren’t routing, and I understand this to an extent, but it could be dialed back a tad, it creates more micro-management and can leave holes in your line when a regiment gets excited and charges around for no reason.  Also, I get that high ground provides an advantage, but some more environmental effects would be nice as well.    Aside from unit placement, I think I’m just nit-picking.            Overall, I really like the game, I’ve had some intense fights, like the Union holding cemetery in the last quarter of the battle, and me desperately charging them where you could almost hear “I wish I was in Dixie” playing in the background as I captured the hill.  Keeping in mind the game is early access I give it 7.5/10, but I expect on full release this will get bumped up by 1/1.5 points or so.  To anyone who enjoys strategy, this is a fun, cheap game that has already given me hours of fun.  I recommend it strongly. "

								This game is interesting.  Unlike Total War, you must take objectives that are marked on the map to win.  Total War battles are last man standing, instead of a more historically accurate, taker of the field.  Simply take and hold the stronger positions and the enemy will eventually rout.  The AI is incredibly smart, and you must be wary of such a foe.  I give this game 4 stars out of 5.			"

												This is Sid Meyer's ""Gettysburg!"" rebuilt in Unity-- more or less.  Units are at brigade level.  It's got all your heroes from reading Bruce Catton under the covers when you were 11:  Iron Brigade, Kershaw, Bucktails, Vincent, Stuart's Cavalry, you name it, its got it.  Battles are scaled up a bit (Little Round Top generally is fought over by about 10,000 men on each side instead of 3,000 Union and 6,000 Confederates).  Union can be overpowered in some configurations. MP is great, but has a few quirks.  Some LOS mapping issues, a dead MP map (at the moment). *Update - Map has been fixed*Support from developers is fair, but could be better if you buy the game from them and give them money. *Update - Most recent patch is pretty good and improves balance.*10/10 - Still picking canister shot from my teeth.

												I usually shy away from complex war games, but this one seemed too streamlined for me to ignore.  Don’t get me wrong…I really enjoyed playing the Total War series when I was younger, but then again, I had more time to kill back then.  “Ultimate General: Gettysburg”, as you may have guessed, is a “Tactical Battle Simulator that allows you to lead thousands of soldiers in the famous Battle of Gettysburg as commander of either the Union or Confederate army.”  I have a feeling that Civil War buffs who don’t mind the occasional “light” war simulator will really enjoy this one.  I know I am.

												Warning: Grammar is a bit off, I have a hard time seeing the text clearly as it strains my eyes with the light text on this charcoal grey background...When I first picked up this game, I was quite excited. Why? This game is developed by the modder who created Darthmod, who basically perfected Empire: Total War. But even this developer too made the same mistake some total war games suffer. The units do not listen to you and have a mind of their own. This makes the game extremely frustrating and tedious to play.When will I change this review? When there is more player control. One way to fix this is to maybe add a option to disable AI or unit behavior that constantly causes my troops to do stupid things I did not order them to do. Another thing, more formations because everything is rigid to just huge blocks. Like maybe a column formation that increases movement speed or a rest option to allow more control over morale. I have played many wargames and there is a much better way to calculate morale instead of treating it like a water filter that becomes half-full because of a few shots. This can even be expanded in DLC is if that is needed, but as is this game is frustrating and a chore to play at times.Final note: This game is great, i've played many games and a variety of wargames set in the civil war. This game is definitely unique and is fantastic to play at any time of the day if you want a casual experience, and as a wargamer I appreciate this type of game because I play many games similar to it. I hope the development team can take some of this points and review them and implements at least some of this changes, if not all of them. Thanks for reading.			"

												I was pretty underwhelmed. It seems the best strategy to this game is to just keep throwing soldiers at the enemy. I played the Union and it the first few battles I was making moves and trying to for some type of strategy. In a few of the later battles I just let it run without doing anything and I still won. Maybe in the future there will be expansions but I don't feel there is much gameplay to this. The maps and UI are terrific though.			"

												This game is amazing! Very enjoyable and replayable. It has dynamic strategic gameplay with many factors affecting the effiecientcy of the troops' performance in combat. Such as terrain, condition of your troops and cover. I dont play much of the multiplayer mainly because you cant find many people to play against and it's not always as challenging as fighting the most difficult ai; it also doesnt last more than one battle, but the single player in this has never been better. This game's last update(Nov. 23rd, 2015) has made this game superb. It now has challenging ai that can actually do some damage to you and can make moves that you would and that can survive the whole battle of Gettysburg. This is one of the best strategy games I have ever played.  9/10			"

												Honestly, this game caught my eye when I first seen it, but after spending about 3 hours on this game it has me RIPING MY HAIR OUT!!! On one hand the game is sorta cool from a historical stand point, but on the other the historical factor faded away, and this game shows its true colors. The men miss for absolutely no reason when in point blank range, and the cannons completely sucks if they miss their intended targets (they will definitely miss) and hit the guys behind them, but nothing happened !!!! something really needs to be done to them. The confederates are impossible to beat when they get their reinforcement, and the men always fight to a stalemate, because you cannot brake trough their lines at all. The damn horses are completely worthless when it comes to combating skirmisher or any units for that matter. the union rout for absolutely no reason, and the hand to hand combat is stupid you don't even have a chance to beat back the attackers once engaged, and on top of that you don’t even know if you’re winning the damn battle because it doesn’t event tell you the total amount of kill in game when you pause. In conclusion this game needs to be improved and tweaked, before I can play this game again.			"

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg at first started out as an enjoyable in-depth strategy game for the first hour, but then the game goes downhill quickly. I cannot recommend this game since it is plagued with extremely slow gameplay and unresponive units - units also have a delay before they adhere to a command and less than 10% of the time cannon units actually respond to the commands and fire. Furthermore, at times the units just stand there and will not fire back even when the enemy is firing at them. Trying to get your units in formation, or trying to move them around or re-orient them is a chore in this game and often times impossible to do when in battle. Since the gameplay is so unresponsive and troubled the game is very frustrating. The sound, music, and graphics are all very nicely done but all of that is overshadowed by the dull and poor gameplay. Lastly, it would also help if there was a mini-map of some sort to quickly jump around the battlefield and also give keyboard commands/shortcuts to units.			"

The game is very unique in the way it handles men and their actions. It is extremely hard to destroy anything as units will generally attempt not to be destroyed (run away).  Units melt from adversity.. and reform.. and can be put back in the battle until they run again. While I truly hope that the multiplayer expands to include a campaign mode.. and perhaps the rest of the war.. this game stands already on its on, and deserves high praise.			"

It feels very amateur. No mini map in a strategy game? Come on.The gameplay itself is pretty straight forward, you jump right into the fight and it sort of stays there. No growth or replay value.

												I really wanted to like this game. I really, really did. As once-upon-a-time veteran of the ages old Firaxis game, Gettysburg!, the predecessor that this game OH SO CLEARLY rips off, and seeing the good reviews for this one, I snapped it up as soon as I learned it existed. Mistake. See last two paragraphs for TL;DRThe AI is good...I guess. But the controls and responses of individual units are clunky as hell and uninspired. Cripplingly so, in fact. I can barely even make it past the first battle without something random happening to my units that isn't my fault. I'm not talking about morale breaking (get to that pile of bullcrap in a second), I'm talking about painstakingly arranging my lines to have them deform and shift for no apparent reason, and in this game, that kind of nonsense loses battles. Example 1: Skirmishers and the Vidette's on the Union side act like garbage. You'd think mounted ranged cavalry and light foot marksmen would know how to chase down a marching enemy and shoot them on the move. Apparently not. Told three groups of skirmishers and two groups of videttes to engage a regiment marching for Oak Hill.Not one of them fired a single shot. They all just faffed about, well within firing range, jitterbugging around. Morale fine, reload fine, LOS fine, I paused and I checked to confirm. This is not the first time this has happened. In fact, the unit handling seems to generally just be♥♥♥♥♥♥ And that's putting it kindly. Where the AI brigades will turn and wheel snapily, my brigades sluggishly pivot, not firing, as the AI jukes, maneuvers, and out flanks me with ease because their soldiers aren't acting like sea-slugs with chronic narcolepsy.Example 2: Not firing at greybacks marching up your♥♥♥♥♥seems to be favorite thing of Union soldiers. They will often refuse to automatically engage enemy brigades coming into range. Posted on highground, in cover, I was micromanaging some other group and saw three whole brigades in line on one of the ridges just standing there, jaws slack, as Confederates shot them off by the score. Also multiple incidents that caused immediate, critical defeats. Example 3: Upon arriving at their destination, brigades will often change their positioning for no reason at all, resulting in horribly skewed firing lanes that, in turn, result in crap along the lines of Example 2. It's not a morale issue, it's like they say, ""well. Now that we're here, let's face that river for no reason instead of facing the massive army of rebels coming right at us!"" Multiple incidents. It also seems like there is a terrible imbalance to the Confederates. I'm not talking about historically accurate numbers and the order of battle, I'm talking about the fact that 1 much larger regiment of 3 star (max efficiency) line infantry on the Union side are supposed to be way better than the rebels in sustained ranged combat.If that's true, then why did they lose to a regiment a third of their size that was standing in an open field down hill? My soldiers had 60% cover behind a stone wall, 100% morale, and 80% condition with their general just behind them. 15 seconds later, they're barrelling off down the opposite side of the hill, totally routed.Really? Meanwhile, Confederate AI gets practically unbreakable morale short of a double flank sticking minie balls and/or bayonets in their ears and  up their asses.Example 4: Sudden unit slaughter and charges. Lost a group of 90/130 cavalry for no reason. Number of men alive dropped extremely rapidly as they were chasing a single, routing enemy with no one firing at them. When I say rapidly, think immediate death of 90 cav in a single second with no source. As for the charges, units seem to be impetuous with no clear reason??? I keep having soldiers cease fire to just...march to the enemy. Not a charge. They just stop what they're doing and start marching to them instead of them attacking. No movement arrow. It's like they've run out of ammo but are noncommitally trying to decide to fix bayonets like men or maybe just commit assisted suicide. The latter is the only result I've ever seen thus far.Example 5: Finally, on the subject of ""the AI not cheating,"" I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Switched sides, charged 2000 Conf. into a single brigade of 750 skirmishers to test morale mechanics. Confederates broke morale FROM MAXIMUM and ran, their morale deserting them faster than Kim Kardashian did Kris Humphries.WHAT?As Union, the exact same Conf regiment charged and killed all three of the Union skirmish groups as they were all firing down into them. They crossed a river, a forest, and ran uphill./end bug examples (adding more every time I try and play this garbage in order to find some redeeming factor)Time to talk about the stuff that is mechanically functional, but still doesn't actually work.The game has no idea what elevation is when it comes to units and knows nothing about stacking. Units behind one another can still fire on a target, regardless of elevation and whether or not friendly fire would occur. In regards to the stacking, as far as I've been able to tell, feel free to clump all your units in one giant glob of flesh and musket. From what little testing I've done of this aspect (can hardly get past all the nonsense), doing so will only result in damage of individual target units. For example, AI clumps together three brigades. Canister shot? No problem! Damage only done to one unit in the clump! The one I'm targeting! Have fun micro-managing your cannons, thus adding to this game's 0/10 ridiculousness. Cover planning is also a joke. Historically, all sorts of cover was utilized during the battle, yet it seems as if very little save forests actually matter. It's also impossible to tell what kind of terrain offers any sort of arbitrary cover. From fences to stone walls to rock outcroppings, the Union utilized their strong defensive positioning at every turn. It's impossible to effectively do that here.Would write more, but I think I've spent more time hating this absolute kick in my nostalgia-balls than I have actually slogging through it.TL;DR Controls and unit responses are game ruiningly clunky; poor balancing in terms of faction perks; unspeakably glitchy in bizarre, unsettling ways; absurdly unintuitive compared to nearly isometric line warfare games that already exist. It's like Goat Simulator: 1863 except the bugs aren't SUPPOSED to be there.I genuinely cannot comprehend what anyone sees in this carnival freak show of a game; will not buy any of their future abortions.

												The combat was rather clunky. I'm sure with further updates and a bit of polish, it will be a solid strategy game but right now it is simply not worth playing or purchasing. Reason: So I rode my calvary around the flank of the whole army to come up behind the general, the horses wouldn't attack no matter how close they got. Eventually all his cannons had enough time to pick up, turn and fire to destroy my unit in one volley and he took no casualties whatsoever even though my calvary was within striking distance of EVERYONE the whole time. I promptly hit quit and deleted the game to write this review. Conclusion: Worst $1 I ever spent, all I got to do is practice my writing skills.			"

												Amazing strategy game with an equally great price tag. The AI is where this game really shines, presenting a unique challenge with every play through, where each decision you make carries on to the next phase and potential outcome of the battle. I find there to be an increased level of consideration with every decision I make in a battle, knowing that the order I give may cause the unit to be too fatigued or low on manpower to prove effective for the other phases of the battle.

												Honestly I like this Game, but there are some things in here that have been frustrating me alot. Firstly i've been playing this game all weekend coming up with strategys on how i can improve taking positions, holding positions, taking the fewest amount of casualties possible and ideal places to put my artillery. Well its gotten to the point of I just cant understand why units i face take little to no casualties whenever I have them flanked and being shot at by superier numbers but when I put a 2 or 3 star unit ontop of a well fortifeid position they just get creamed by whatever they decided to pit against it. the csualties that some units take is ridiculous, especilly when im facing one unit with 3 of my own (one engaging the front with the other 2 on its flanks) and still doing roughly 30 causalties with every volley while they do about 80-100 to my men. I love this game its on the right track but youve gotta fix the causualty ratio and how much damage artillery is actually doing.			"

								Excellent AI and in depth strategy. Much potential and a very experienced team, this game will definitely satisfy hardcore and casual strategy gamers out there. If you are a fan of ACW then this also might be for you. There are several Ai types and decision making that provides a dynamic and complex opponent within the realms of the game. Do not underestimate the power of your opposition as you will be surprised. This game is not your every day strategy game. The core principles and mechanisms of this game are exactly what is needed for a true challenge.The game itself for being at Early Access stage is fully functional and doesn't have any major issues, not any i have encountered anyway. If you are fimiliar with the Total War Series and Darth Series Mods, Then I am sure you will enjoy the progress of this game as it is the man himself who put all of this together along with his team. Good job and looking very good for future.			"

								Sunk 2 hours into this game tonight and don't regret a moment. Excellent game for war gamers and civil war buffs. At no point in time did I feel like I was playing an early access game...though it does show on the menu...but who the hell cares about that?As far as the game play goes, it has shades of Sid Meier's Gettysburg for sure, but that is in no way a bad thing. The addition of strategic choice between the individual phases is a nice touch and definitely beats the usual chaining of one scenario to the next.			"

Early Access Review
								I never, i repeat never, buy games at full price, it’s almost an obsession, sometimes i buy games i might not otherwise have bought just cuz there on sale. Then i saw this game. I am a huge fan of history and i love the civil war, so i started to consider this game, watched a youtube video, when i saw it was the guy who did the mod for total war, i bought it FOR FULL PRICE! The only game in my collection that was bought at retail. This game is awesome, whenever i read a new book on the civil war i always study those diagrams of movements and tactics. This game is laid out exactly like those pictures, except you control it! The gameplay feels smooth, and can cause you to exceute some pretty advanced offensive strategies by accident just because it feels natural(pincers, flanking, oblique attacks). The graphics are good and so is the art style. I wish there were more maps, but that might be stupid of me since the game has Gettysburg in the title. I hear people say its 10 bucks for one level, well, one battle that can be played 8 million ways so its up to you if you like that. $10 is a lot for me to spend on a game, but since it is an indie dev i was more than happy too. This game is only for fans of strategy games and history otherwise you will bore quickly. 7.1/10			"

Posted: January 28, 2015
												I been a big civil war buff since I was very young. I read any books or movies I could get on it and I played most of the video games. The first being Robert E. Lee Civil War General the hex game back in 1996, and some time later Sid Meier's Gettysburg, I even played Gettysburg mod for Starcraft because of its awesomeness. So of course I have ridiculous standards, I won't deny that, I will not say this is a bad game, for me it makes me want to go back and play my old favorites. I will just say for a game on this subject I cared about so much to get the thumbs up from me, it would need to give me something more. I feel the developer wanted to take an approach for realism, but this for me has been done, with games like Sid Meires, and better. I loved the unit progression in some of the older titles, where you actually got to upgrade your guns between battles, maybe even some stats for generals.Pros+ Progression - after every engagment your casualties carry over to the next one+ Progression - again the game focuses on one battle, but its not just the lineral historical route of the battle, you get to make choices after every engagment, many strategies were never implemented in the actual battle, but here if you for example win you can chose to hold the hills on the outskirts of town instead of falling back the ridge behind it.Mix-+ Multiplayer - There is a multiplayer, can't complain about that, its balanced in ways FPS are, its skill based; can't complain about that either! Its just nothing like the predecesors, its 1v1.. When I think of civil war I think of multiplayer, before there were 'clans' in video games there were very well organized armies in games like Sid Meires that put almost any form on online groups to shame these days. We do not get the 3v3's we use to have back in the day, not much community here.-+ Realism - I always loved realism in games, In this game the units will do what they want, and the choice to have them unpredictable was a choice by the developer to add realism or in his words: frustration (since thats what actually happend in the civil war, your subordinates didnt always listen to you) I sort of think a better choice would be the ability to give your leaders overall stance orders, like aggressive, or defensive. This would let them do what they want, yet not do something ridiculous like a rouge brigade charging down a hill you wanted them to defend.Con- Graphics - They are functional and look good, but the terrain is 2D, the units are sprites, - Line of Sight - I think this needs some work, its very difficult to figure out where your artillary can actually fire, since half the time if you actually check their LOS they wont actually be firing at units within its range, the best thing to do is to find 1 arty unit that is firing, then put all your artillery on that spot, which is a bit crazy in terms of historical strategy.I am basically giving it the thumbs up for if its on sale, its not a bad buy at all.

												I have played this game through, both sides and loved it! However.....the replayability is sooo limited that I can honestly say I am done with it after 5 hours! The developers have done a magnificent job at the graphics and just pure simple enjoyment, however there is no longevity to the game at all. I was left wanting each and every game. Perhaps it should have been released as a entire war period game which would give 50 hours or so of game play. If your okay with the short shelf life of the game, then I highly recommend it, however I am ready to delete it unless I see some promised updates.			"

												(Writing as of patch 1.7v and earlier) I like that despite all the ""balance"" thats been done over the life of this game it took me my first ever game to win as the Union, and about 100 hours of attempts at the south for no victory ever. (With and without guides) Save scumming is not enough, sweaping the union from the field is not enough. http://i.imgur.com/4pTI788.jpg https://i.imgur.com/KBrWJZc.jpg Sweep the field every fight, but still lose the campaign to stupid massed nigh dead Union? YEP https://i.imgur.com/oCEtJlC.jpg http://i.imgur.com/VJoToZv.jpg This supposed balance just makes the Union even more top heavy (From the last 4 game hours testing this new patch I feel it is) I love the game but come on man I eat up games like this, it should never take 100+ hours to win as anything. The more deadly game-play is welcome but does nothing to fix this, Its just not fun playing confederates if victory is legitimately barely feasible. (I assume it can be done as people have the achievement) Even using the bad AI types despite dynamic being the most fun you get shut down anyway. Games that kick your♥♥♥♥♥only work if the hard work players put in is rewarded not just snubbed by unbalanced game-play. (Yes I know its supposed to be historically correct, and I'm all for that but its still a GAME YOU KNOW.) Good game-play is what makes a good game, not historical correctness.Now the positives of this new patch though . . . HOLY CRAP MY LINES FINALLY STOP MESSING THEMSELF UP, MY PEOPLE DON'T JUST RETREAT FOR NO REASON. BEST OF ALL MY CHARGE ATTACKS NO LONGER END WITH ME GETTING SHOT AND OF COURSE BROKEN DESPITE BEING IN MELEE BY THE UNION!Recommended for only union gameplay.EDIT: Left out that double clicking a commanding general selects all units under them, and gets my people killed when done accidentally which is the only way I have used this function. Wish I could remove that.			"

												Are you kidding me? this might be the worst game of this type i have ever played. Troops scatter and run after a few rounds while the AI troops can stand there ground forever. This quick battle time gives you no real chance to set up an attack or proper defense, even tho that doesn't really matter when their 950 troops can fire a few rounds into your 1800 and get them running away so easy. I have also noticed if you somehow do get one of their groups to flash and flee the AI troops run right to where they need to be to get right back into battle while yours will flee somewhere far away from where you need them ( you have no control over fleeing troops )			"

												Are you kidding me? this might be the worst game of this type i have ever played. Troops scatter and run after a few rounds while the AI troops can stand there ground forever. This quick battle time gives you no real chance to set up an attack or proper defense, even tho that doesn't really matter when their 950 troops can fire a few rounds into your 1800 and get them running away so easy. I have also noticed if you somehow do get one of their groups to flash and flee the AI troops run right to where they need to be to get right back into battle while yours will flee somewhere far away from where you need them ( you have no control over fleeing troops )			"

												This would be a good game but when you play the computer it's very lopsided no matter which side you play. The computer gets all kinds of hidden batteries, not on their army list, that pummel your army right from the start and you cannot target them. Also, the players brigades are constantly retreating, yet you can throw up to 5 brigades at one enemy brigade and expect to have all 5 retreat and the computer brigades rarely retreat. A player's brigade vs. a computer brigade of similar size always goes to the computer - no matter what. The computer gets way too many advantages which is very aggrivating and takes away from the authenticity as well.			"

												14.99, well the dev's must have a shiny pair of gold balls that they have to higher a maid to dust.This game would be enjoyable on a tablet or phone, perhaps the game is actually more suited for that because moving your troops can sort of be a pain, a touch screen would help out a lot.I kinda went into this thinking Empire: Total war, which you can tell the idea of lines breaking came from the total war world, battle game play wise. Given I didn't spend a lot of time with it, but actually getting your troops where you want them to be to volley is a little tricky. Generally they take a couple of volley hits before they get into range, which of course makes them break faster even when they are close to full strength.  Your troops break way to easily, it may be me in all honesty but they run away to a safe point and a second later they are really to join the fight, but with dimished numbers they break even faster. Sure sending a new unit in to take the brunt of the first few volley's sounds like a good idea with your other troops in the back, but yet they still break.You have an option to make your troop's ""run"" Sometimes this works out great, other times you can't tell if they are actually running or not. I don't know if they get tired, because there is no bar ot anything else to tell you that they are. "

												If you enjoyed the late 90's ""Sid Meier's Gettysburg!"", you'll love this game. It's impossible to say this isn't influenced by it. While Meier's offered a greater level of control over regimental tactics e.g. formations, orders, etc., Ultimate offers a more streamlined approach to orders which lets you enjoy/evaluate the big picture instead of micromanaging your units. The map is beautiful, and terrain plays a big part in making decisions. Scenarios directly influence each other, with unit positions and strength carrying over. If I have any criticisms, it's that cavalry is useless for anything except scouting your flanks. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RTS, maps, or the history behind the Battle of Gettysburg.			"

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg has just one thing that speaks for it self, that makes up everything, gameplay feeling and emersion! Game-labs, the creator of this game is the creator of Darthmod for Total War series, and the experience gained modding Total War clearly shows in this game! The graphics are obivously not Total War graphics, but it`s not even the purpose. It`s there to make you feel like you are in a tent 3 km from the front line looking at a map of the battle, and getting reports about troop movements. As a seasoned gamer my conclussion has been that in these days when even simple graphics can look good and fill a purpose, who need the flashy animations of Total War games? The graphics of Ultimate General: Gettysburg is indeed simple, but beutiful, and gives the player the opportunity of feeling like master general, drawing out lines of attack on a map. So it`s pretty much established that it`s the feeling and gameplay emersion that trumps good graphics in most cases. At least in my opinion. In terms of gameplay, I do really recognise some things from the Empire & Napoleon games from Creative Assembly, that reflects the creator`s previous work. But I have the feeling of everything having been improved upon and well thought about. How you have to place your troops, when you move them, and how to engage is basically about looking at the surroundings in the map and at units stats moreso  than in previously mentioned games. It`s noticable that Game-Labs have improved on many things from Total War, and created a far more historically accurate battle simulation. There are really stuff here that Creative Assembly would be wise to consider if going back to the Empire franschise of the Total War series.Since this game obviously is about one battle, the game is not like Total War, were one battle is one major set-piece battle that takes 15- 45 minutes, and that`s it. In Total War this fills a purpose, given that you also play a grand strategy game on a large map filled with several battles. Instead Game-labs focused on one batte and came up with something really clever;  You don`t really fight the battle of Gettysburg all at once. You fight larger skirmishes as a part of the bigger, several days long battle. The campaign is non-linear, and how you fight the campaign depends much on your overall strategy decisions in and between battles, since you carry all your troops with you from different battles. In between battles you have options; Shall I reinforce flanks? Should I hold the line no matter what? Should I do tactical retreat? All these decisions make each playthrough unique. Especially since you can decide how your AI opponent should behave. This has made me come back to the game a couple times and realized that I`m not fighting the same battles, and I can suddenly find myself pushed up against the wall by something unanticipated. This makes the relatively short campaign really interesting and replayable.Ultimate General: Gettysburg is unique game, that the RTS and history nerds defintely will enjoy!! I`m falling into both of those categories, and I did! :) I recommend it for anyone who enjoys tactical battle games set in historical settings. For the sequel under development, I would only ask a few things of Game-labs, and that is to include more than one battle and perhaps make som of the details stand out as 3D in the otherwise 2D landscape, such as houses, towns treas and ridges. Otherwise it`s a great game as it is!			"

Early Access Review
								Positive:  From the man that brought you Darthmod Rome, Medieval (II), Empire, Napoleon and Shogun, comes an independant title that is sure to please any fans of the strategy genre. This game provides the deep tactical gameplay you would come to expect playing a Darthmod title. It is also worth mentioning that the graphics themselves give the game a nice flavour. Lastly the AI... It is a true challenge to defeat the computer in a battle, which is refreshing in itself. The computer will respond to your tactics in realistic ways, this makes exploiting the AI very difficult to do. However, being that this is an early access game I have only been able to face the AI in one of the scenarios. I have no idea how it will act in later battles, if it is anything like the first battle though you will be in for a challenging yet enjoyable experience. Negatives:  The game is very solid, even in its early stages. However, there are a couple of things I found lacking in it. First of all is the controls. The buttons on the bottom right seem to work fine, but the way you must move your troops does take a bit of getting used to. You must click on the unit and then drag it to the place  you want them to move to. This doesn't sound like a very big deal until you realize that there is no way to order your troops to stand in a specific spot or line up in a specific way. It really negatively affected the gameplay in my opinion. The only other issue I found was your own troops AI... I say this because, your own troops will auto adjust their lines according to enemy positioning. This usually is very affective at cutting down the amount of micro-managing you would expect in a game like this. Although in certain situations your troops will auto adjust even when told not to. I've even run into situations where my men will just turn around when fired upon only to expose their back to the hot lead volley of musket fire that ensues. These are things that really take you out of the experience. Final Verdict:  My final opinion on this game is an 8/10. It is truly worth picking up if you're a fan of strategy games or a casual player.DISCLAIMER: This game is still early access. ALL issues that have been listed above are able to be changed.			"

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg provides the best way to experience 18th Century warfare at its finest. There is a extreme ease when it comes to manuevering, whether its the Army of Northern Virginia or the Army of the Potomac. Simply click on a unit and drag the intended path of travel, you can also hold down control and right click, then rotate until the unit is facing the desired direction. The only time troop movement can get wonky is when they move up very steep hills for example Culp's hill gives my troops fits and Ill find them not even moving or facing the wrong way somtimes it works out and they do actually get to the desired position. In terms of sights and sounds, the audio (when wearing headphones) is actually awesome, especially in the more heated sections. Sights can be lacking at times being the Units are sprites however I must say the map looks great and actually when you have large amounts of units lining up and engaging one another, the large clouds of smoke along with reloading and firing animations also look cool in large numbers. Content this game is well worth the price even though it is one battle, every single battle feels distinct and different each play through. You may sweep the field as the Union on the first day and push the Confederates back off of Herr's Ridge. Or as the Confederates you may push the Union off of Cemetery Hill....etc. The battle can also last up to 4 days aswell. There are 9 different difficulties along with the ""boost ai"" option always being there for whatever difficulty is chosen. Each difficulty varying in aggressiveness of ai, and the overall difficulty of the battle.The Army of Northern Virginia and The Army of the Potomac are very different armies. The Confederates consisting of Highly spirited troops who lack the efficent weaponry of the Union, can take volley after volley. They Confederates are really lacking at long range volley exchanges. It is more wise to close the gap when using the Confederates as close range combat is something they tend to excell at. Their artillery is also extremely lacking, specfically in terms of range the Union arty can hit you with canister shot and be alot further from your men then the Confederate arty (where it seems the Union troops have to be right on top of the cannons in order for them to be in range for a canister shot). This is very cool to be able to play two very different armies however it seems as of late (The latest patches) the Union have an advantage and this wasnt always the case. As back when the game first released in 2014 the Confederates where able to just walk through walls of lead seemingly and not waiver.  The Multiplayer is almost non-existant it takes days to get into a game with an opponent. All in all this game is one of the best games featuring 18th century warfare, I've heard rumors that the developers plan to expand to other battles of the Civil war which will be really cool. I feel the sky is the limit with this soon to be series (hopefully) , that they can capture the Napeleonic wars along with the 7 years war and many more. I highly recommend this to any strategy player.			"

								Challenging AI, unique game-play. The game is very well done for its reasonable asking price of $10.Compared to the Total War series this game relies more so on unit morale than annihalting the enemy units. This brings a much more historically accurate gameplay experience. You will slowly advance and try to flank and out flank the enemy to capture key ""Victory Points"" on the map. However, it won't be easy. The AI is very well done and will react to your moves.The game reminds me of an early 2000's game called ""Austerlitz, Napoleon's Greatest Victory"" except much more polished because of the victory point system. Depending on how well you do in a scenario you will unlock a set of strategies for the next part of the battle. Will you try to keep Oak Hill or fall back?Keep in mind this game is in early access mode. That means the game is unfinished and some of the text unwritten. The worst complaint I have so far is the clunky artillery controls. Is it going to stay and fire or run head first into the enemy lines? However I do believe the dev team in Ukraine will address this issue and the other issues. Don't let this turn you off from purchasing. I had to really knit-pick this complaint. If you enjoyed Empire Total War or Napoleon Total War battles and want a more realistic battle experience this game is for you.			"

								So far the game is a bit simple, but it's still very fun. One of the most unique things about this game is that there are 9 total difficult levels with varying levels of aggressiveness and skill. For example, you can set the AI to be aggressive but not skilled, and vice versa. Or you can set it to be both aggressive and skilled if you enjoy losing. But even on the least skilled and least aggressive setting (which I call the McClellan AI) it still puts up a considerable fight, which is unique in an era where it's not uncommon to be able to steamroll a game's AI even at the highest setting.The gameplay is still in early development, but one of my favorite features is the ability to easily draw your own unit routes. In many strategy games, the only way to get your units to follow a specific route is to set various waypoints, which can be time-consuming and tough for the path-finding AI to deal with. In this game, you just drag the mouse where you want the unit to go and it will follow that path. It's a great tool that makes it easier to flank your enemies and increases the mobility of your army.Even though this game is still in early access, it's well worth the 10 dollars. Even though it only covers one battle, the game offers many ways to fight that battle from either side, which makes it highly replayable and very fun.			"

								This game is very good and may be one of the best ever, once it receives the rest of its beta polish. More ""experienced"" gameers may remember a game called ""Fields of Glory,"" in which you played the role of Napoleon through the Waterloo Campaign. Those who don't may remember ""Sid Meier's Gettysburg."" Ultimate General: Gettysburg combines many of the things that made both of those oldies fantastic wargames for people like me, who don't really like desktop-style wargames. The stress builds during the realtime play, whether or not you pause the action. That map is one of the most beautiful  and original strategy game maps I've seen since Civ V. All for an incredibly low price!The game does still need polish. charges seem ineffectual, the units move too quickly, expecially in rough terrain. I think cover needs tuning, and most importantly, You should be able to kill a general who puts himself in harms way, just as several generals and more than 20 regimental commanders were killed in the actual battle.But these are small concerns that I'm betting the dev will iron out. BUY THIS GAME!!!			"

												Wow! A great game!This is basically Sid Meier's Gettysburg! updated in to modern day. Wonderful tactical simulator with great, informative graphics, easy to use interface and great AI.The campaign is a bit odd, as it doesn't take in to account your positions/success in previous battle as well as I would have hoped it to. Doesn't really matter much if you can get past the fact that you sometimes lose terrain you fought hardly for.While AI is great in this game, the morale etc. doesn't seem to work all that logically. I have had few occations with my units standing next to each other, having taken similar casualties etc. with the other being near 0% morale while the other constantly staying at 100%. But apart from that, the AI - depending on how you set it - can be damn devious and cunning giving a great challenge.What I would mostly hope for is clearer line of sight and enhanced visuals for height of the map. Even when contour lines are on, it can be difficult to judge if your men can see the enemy in their front or not. This also causes problems with the artillery, sometimes you think you've got excellent positions but they don't actually see much. I would also love to modulate the speed a little, right now the game feels a bit too fast and hectic for me sometimes, as I would like to see my tactics play out a bit slower, allowing me to micro manage more.In the end, it's a great game well worth the money, well executed, beautiful graphics and fun to play. I highly recommend this, if you are looking for an ACW game like Sid Meier's Gettysburg!, but in modern day graphics. This doesn't compete with games like Scourge of war in the same category, so owning both of them is alright!			"

												The game stands alone when it is up to tactics. The AI is very good, and with it's unique visual style (I like it) the game feels polished. Only negative point: the game is not really emmersive, It feels like a game, the music is odd, and there is no binding with companies and generals. I play it now and then, and after two battles I get bored.But then again, it's only €10, so try it out.			"

								Ultimate General: Gettysburg reminds me a lot of Fields of Glory, the old DOS game that covered Napoleon's battles. It has that same abstract quality to it. Unlike Total War's battles, which try to give you a cinematic view of the fight, UG:G gives you the a more abstract view of the fight.The visual style is what makes this game, for me. The map itself is gorgeous, and I wonder if a high-res .jpg is available as a wallpaper. The wording, drawing right onto the map, the tiny 3D buldings, the trees, it all contributes to the feeling of seeing a miniature battle played out on a 3D map. (This is helped by the fact that at the edges of the map, you can see the table it rests upon!) The tiny little soldiers are animated, but not overly so. The smoke effects are subtle yet clear. As far as sound goes, the game's battle sounds much like you would expect it to, if you were hovering overhead. Gunfire is muffled but distinct, as are the drums. I can only hope that as development continues, musical cues are added. AI is another strong point, here. Unit will withdraw if pushed upon too hard, but unlike in Total War, where they go from fighting to total retreat, soldiers here will back off and regroup. The AI seems more realistic than in TW, and absent any player's orders, the units will move on their own and adjust to the situation. There is less control here than in TW. You can't dictate the length and depths of firing lines, or even their facing, really. You click on their unit flag, and drag their route across the battlefield, making turns and flanking maneuvers as needed. The unit does the rest, deciding where to direct their fire. Here, you are truly a general. You can only point, and hope your officers carry out their orders. No micro-managing here, and that makes for a more laid back, contemplative approach,You'll note I have not gone into any depth on content. It's all there, all the various battles that make up Gettysburg, as well the option to create custom battles. But really, for me anyway, the selling point was the visuals and audio. It's Fields of Glory all over again!This game is $10. If it never saw another added feature, I would still consider this game well worth the money. As it is, the developer has far more to come, and I expect nothing but excellence from him. This game is well worth your money!			"

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg has just one thing that speaks for it self, that makes up everything, gameplay feeling and emersion! Game-labs, the creator of this game is the creator of Darthmod for Total War series, and the experience gained modding Total War clearly shows in this game! The graphics are obivously not Total War graphics, but it`s not even the purpose. It`s there to make you feel like you are in a tent 3 km from the front line looking at a map of the battle, and getting reports about troop movements. As a seasoned gamer my conclussion has been that in these days when even simple graphics can look good and fill a purpose, who need the flashy animations of Total War games? The graphics of Ultimate General: Gettysburg is indeed simple, but beutiful, and gives the player the opportunity of feeling like master general, drawing out lines of attack on a map. So it`s pretty much established that it`s the feeling and gameplay emersion that trumps good graphics in most cases. At least in my opinion. In terms of gameplay, I do really recognise some things from the Empire & Napoleon games from Creative Assembly, that reflects the creator`s previous work. But I have the feeling of everything having been improved upon and well thought about. How you have to place your troops, when you move them, and how to engage is basically about looking at the surroundings in the map and at units stats moreso  than in previously mentioned games. It`s noticable that Game-Labs have improved on many things from Total War, and created a far more historically accurate battle simulation. There are really stuff here that Creative Assembly would be wise to consider if going back to the Empire franschise of the Total War series.Since this game obviously is about one battle, the game is not like Total War, were one battle is one major set-piece battle that takes 15- 45 minutes, and that`s it. In Total War this fills a purpose, given that you also play a grand strategy game on a large map filled with several battles. Instead Game-labs focused on one batte and came up with something really clever;  You don`t really fight the battle of Gettysburg all at once. You fight larger skirmishes as a part of the bigger, several days long battle. The campaign is non-linear, and how you fight the campaign depends much on your overall strategy decisions in and between battles, since you carry all your troops with you from different battles. In between battles you have options; Shall I reinforce flanks? Should I hold the line no matter what? Should I do tactical retreat? All these decisions make each playthrough unique. Especially since you can decide how your AI opponent should behave. This has made me come back to the game a couple times and realized that I`m not fighting the same battles, and I can suddenly find myself pushed up against the wall by something unanticipated. This makes the relatively short campaign really interesting and replayable.Ultimate General: Gettysburg is unique game, that the RTS and history nerds defintely will enjoy!! I`m falling into both of those categories, and I did! :) I recommend it for anyone who enjoys tactical battle games set in historical settings. For the sequel under development, I would only ask a few things of Game-labs, and that is to include more than one battle and perhaps make som of the details stand out as 3D in the otherwise 2D landscape, such as houses, towns treas and ridges. Otherwise it`s a great game as it is!			"

												Ultimate General: Gettysburg provides the best way to experience 18th Century warfare at its finest. There is a extreme ease when it comes to manuevering, whether its the Army of Northern Virginia or the Army of the Potomac. Simply click on a unit and drag the intended path of travel, you can also hold down control and right click, then rotate until the unit is facing the desired direction. The only time troop movement can get wonky is when they move up very steep hills for example Culp's hill gives my troops fits and Ill find them not even moving or facing the wrong way somtimes it works out and they do actually get to the desired position. In terms of sights and sounds, the audio (when wearing headphones) is actually awesome, especially in the more heated sections. Sights can be lacking at times being the Units are sprites however I must say the map looks great and actually when you have large amounts of units lining up and engaging one another, the large clouds of smoke along with reloading and firing animations also look cool in large numbers. Content this game is well worth the price even though it is one battle, every single battle feels distinct and different each play through. You may sweep the field as the Union on the first day and push the Confederates back off of Herr's Ridge. Or as the Confederates you may push the Union off of Cemetery Hill....etc. The battle can also last up to 4 days aswell. There are 9 different difficulties along with the ""boost ai"" option always being there for whatever difficulty is chosen. Each difficulty varying in aggressiveness of ai, and the overall difficulty of the battle.The Army of Northern Virginia and The Army of the Potomac are very different armies. The Confederates consisting of Highly spirited troops who lack the efficent weaponry of the Union, can take volley after volley. They Confederates are really lacking at long range volley exchanges. It is more wise to close the gap when using the Confederates as close range combat is something they tend to excell at. Their artillery is also extremely lacking, specfically in terms of range the Union arty can hit you with canister shot and be alot further from your men then the Confederate arty (where it seems the Union troops have to be right on top of the cannons in order for them to be in range for a canister shot). This is very cool to be able to play two very different armies however it seems as of late (The latest patches) the Union have an advantage and this wasnt always the case. As back when the game first released in 2014 the Confederates where able to just walk through walls of lead seemingly and not waiver.  The Multiplayer is almost non-existant it takes days to get into a game with an opponent. All in all this game is one of the best games featuring 18th century warfare, I've heard rumors that the developers plan to expand to other battles of the Civil war which will be really cool. I feel the sky is the limit with this soon to be series (hopefully) , that they can capture the Napeleonic wars along with the 7 years war and many more. I highly recommend this to any strategy player.			"

												FOR THE UNION! (although playing as the Confederates when 'Dixie' is playing in the background might be in my top 10 favourite videogame moments) Seriously this is what a Total War game wants to be when it comes to tactics, truly massive battles that don't turn into cluster-fs but rather evolve with multiple fronts, generals, cannons firing, men charging. If you like strategy this is the game for you. What I loved:-How you control your units does take some time but being able to draw arrows is amazing. -How detailed the map is, (tip-Press M to give you height map, vital for arty)-How naturally the battle unfolds over 4 days.

												This is not for new players. For me, it was hard to figure out all the controls and all the AI. I was confused and was not expecting how fast the game ended. There is no real easy, medium, or hard settings, but it just seems confusing on how my men don't shoot nearly half the time the enemy does. I played as the union and confederates, and each time, they kept falling back when I was dealing more damage than the enemy. I even tried to flank multiple times which was no help at all. The artillery is also terrible and most of the time doesn't deal damage, but the infantry is better, and when I click charge, I expect their numbers to drop faster than 1 per seconds. (They normally start off with over 1000-2000 men for each brigade) and it was also hard to select two or more brigades and group them up for some reason. It was easy to group them, but sometimes it just wouldn't group, so I reset all the groups and still didn't work. It was very confusing and I love Sid Meiers, which when I looked this up, thats what they were comparing it to. (Note: Sid Meiers is a very fun game series) I believe i wasted my time and money buying the game and expecting different stuff from what I got. I really wanted to see something more actionish than this, i mean, your morale is the biggest thing, that and condition. They drop so fast. The reload isn't much of a problem because the enemy can't reload much faster than you, sometimes slower depending on the weapons and ammo equipped, but O would only recommend this game to new-comers to strategy games, and i'm not even new to these games. I have multiple games that are strategy based, and I love those, but this is really confusing, and takes more than alot of practice to start understanding. (Note: If you don't like this review, it's what I experienced) But i will admit, it seems like a good game, just not for beginners. I would play again if the difficulty settings and controls get a little bit more understandable for new players.			"

								This modder is amazing, before he made this, he modded the AI of Total War games. this guy has made one of the greatest RTS i have ever played. If you look beyond the fact that it is one of those : games, it has a unique concept. most games avoid Civil war entirly, and if they do make it turn based. this one the other hand has fantastic movement and battles. (and playing as the Confederates is the best) if you read this maker of Darthmod, please, please don't stop. (and maybe a WWI Ultimate General? eh? eh?)			"

												After playing one battle after the tutorials. (Arrival at gettysburg) as the Union, I was stoked that I won the battle.This games takes a sharp mind, a lot of thinking, and not messing up. You can never win a battle with your initial men. In the first battle I did, I had some skirmishers, and cannons. Not much to defend, but it probably was enough to hold until reinforcements arrive. I did some stupid mistakes, and lost an entire unit.Going off track on that a little, you learn more while you play. I learned that putting stuff on higher ground DOES indeed help, not putting them on the lower ground. You can change what you where doing before instantly. Doing the same mistake the Union did at Gettysburg without knowing it, and before it's almsot to late you recover and send those confederates packing? You can do that.It may seem like a small game, but just a single battle can show you how amazing it is.Whether you love history, love strat. games, or both, I highly recommend this to you.Word of warning though, you're probably not going to do very well in a battle without first going through the tutorials.Good luck if you get it!

								The short: Not quite a replacement for Sid Meier's version, but enjoyable and more up-to-date.The long: While maintaining the historical roots, Ultimate General: Gettysburg favours a slight arcade edge to it, such as fast combat. It's not clear exactly how detailed some of the mechanics behind elements like morale and condition are, but they appear fairly simplified - it would be good to see some added detail in that area, and possibly the inclusion of supply & ammunition.While the game saves when you exit, there's no ability to save/load at arbitrary points. You also can't resume at the beginning of a phase of the battle, so replay is limited to starting again.Ultimately, the game is still under development, so some of these negatives can be taken with a grain of salt. The game is enjoyable, and shaping up well.			"

												Sid Meirs Gettysburg upgraded!  If you liked Sid Meirs Gettysburg then you will love this.  The sounds are updated, the stats are better if you like to get deep in the weeds on units and you actually get to choose how the battle will progress as the commander.  For example, I played Day 1 and after the first battle, where Sid Meirs would base its historic change off that, you actually choose one of 3 scenarios on what should take place next.  I'm lovin this!			"

												This is not for new players. For me, it was hard to figure out all the controls and all the AI. I was confused and was not expecting how fast the game ended. There is no real easy, medium, or hard settings, but it just seems confusing on how my men don't shoot nearly half the time the enemy does. I played as the union and confederates, and each time, they kept falling back when I was dealing more damage than the enemy. I even tried to flank multiple times which was no help at all. The artillery is also terrible and most of the time doesn't deal damage, but the infantry is better, and when I click charge, I expect their numbers to drop faster than 1 per seconds. (They normally start off with over 1000-2000 men for each brigade) and it was also hard to select two or more brigades and group them up for some reason.

I sure hope this game gets the support it deserves and hope to see further titles done.Points to improve upon in the next titles:- Cavalary charges should have a more realistic and profound effect.- adding more in-game 'fluff' - more side specific battle cries, more sound effects etc.- Unit quality should havea more profound impact on unit performance.

If the owner of the game reads this...

The Confederates are harder to play and the hills on the map are difficult to see without contours turned on, but apart from that this game is excellent.			"

								So I bought this game with very little expetations. Watched couple videos on youtube and I knew more and less what im getting myself into. And since its only for 9 euro..i said heck, nothing new in rts/strategy world  so I can buy it.And this game is awesome!Of course its not major studio production, and you cant expect graphic engine with advanced strategy and maps like in Wargame..but its still TONS of FUN! Its not complicated but when enemy have more units you need to start thinking!Def. its not hard core realism game, and it have some issuses, but its still in development..and it will be even better if its fully released! You can play it now, but it missing some features that are added daily.No to negatives. Its very short game, main campaing is like couple hours, and you can play many random battles too.. but its all to very very short.Nothing fancy with units, you have your basic line inf, skirmishers, cav, and arty.But then agian its 9 euro!!!And even I dont like some stuff dev did in this game, I think its move in RIGHT direction.Something a bit new, somthing fresh. And that def. deserves my money in current game market.I hope this only beginning, and game will grow! I see potential and ususally small studio dev's are more likely to listen to their base.I would give this game 7 out of 10.  "

												Great game. Seems simple at first glance but after a few battles (and higher AI difficulties), you'll realize it has a bit of depth to it. The best aspect of the campaign is the dynamic nature, where your performance in one battle affects the subsequent engagements. Multiplayer is also a blast and that's where the depth can really shine if your up against a good oponenent, you'll want to maneuver and use your artillery wisely. If this game just had even a half-hearted totalwar style campaign map where you could fight the whole civil war and jump into tactical-style battles like this each time a battle happened on the campaign map, it'd probably be the best civil war game out there.

Posted: August 21, 2016
												When I first booted up this game (as someone who enjoyed Darthmod for Empire Total War, a mod whose lead designer now works for Game-Labs), I was confused and mildly annoyed: units seemed unwieldy and inflexible; playing as the Union I was unable to conduct the fighting retreat the first scenario demanded; the UI and controls didn't quite allow me the flexibility and fine control I wanted; Confederate troops seemed too numerous and nigh-invincible on the charge.As I stuck it out, though, some of the nuance crept in, and now I find myself heartily recommending this game. It is, as you might expect, similar to the Total War series, but it's different in several ways: for one, units will not, as in Total War, act as clockwork automatons until their moral breaks and then flee the field completely. Instead, infantry brigades advance, waver in the face of overwhelming fire, break, and then reform out of the line of enemy fire. Permanently defeating an enemy unit is unlikely, but doable if you have massive local superiority. Control of formation and frontage isn't as fine-grained as in Total War, but it's also less relevant, and skew-whiff lines are usually the result of sprites moving into or staying in terrain that provides cover, which is usually a good thing. Cavalry is almost nonexistent, but that is, as I understand, a function of the ACW setting, rather than a design oversight. There are a number of scenarios available, many of which can be played in order through the main battle - the game's version of a campaign, which requires you to general one of the two sides throughout the three (or four, if things change from history) days of the Battle of Gettysburg. This requires you to keep an eye on the future and preserve your units, even at the cost of ground - sure, you can sustain 50% casualties to your elite brigade on the first day fighting for Oak Hill, but by day 3 you're going to feel the lack of quality troops. The custom battle functionality lets you select individual scenarios and play those out without worrying about future engagements, and there's a number of interesting and challenging ones available. I can't speak to the quality of the multiplayer as I haven't tried it.There are some issues, though: for one, the tutorials and online guide, while okay, aren't quite as detailed or useful as I'd like, leaving the player to work certain things out through frustrating trial and error - like what those stars by unit commander's portraits mean, or what general units are really for. The default map-view, while pretty, isn't very readable and really should have the optional contour lines enabled by default. It's often difficult to read which ground overlooks which, and whether what looks like a small rise is actually dead ground overlooked by nearby terrain, even with the contours enabled. Similarly, the line-of-sight system works well (when a unit is selected, areas where it cannot see are darkened), but isn't adequately explained and is a little too subtle at the default settings. These sound like minor issues, but in a game where good placement of artillery is crucial, they can be serious problems. The rest of the UI is decent, albeit a little bland - again, a little more explanation of what each gauge represents and what effect that will have on your units would be nice. Similarly, there are some confusing UI choices regarding General units - selecting a general will highlight all the units recieving a buff from the general's presence, which is fine. What's not fine is that this highlight looks exactly the same as the selection indicator, leading to early circumstances where I wasn't sure if moving my general would move all those units out of position.  Further, the controls, while an interesting setup, have some issues in the PC version. There's no selection box, and while the draw-around-the-units-you-want system is cool (and must work well on tablets), it feels a little counterintuitive, although it does allow some nice fine selection of units. It's not particularly easy to quickly deselect units in the heat of the moment, leading to me ordering my brigades to march in a circle while attempting to select more units. The drag-the-unit-across-the-map method of unit movement is very, very cool and I like it a lot, but I'd also like a more normal right-click to be implemented alongside it. This would also make the use of the game's rare cavalry units a lot more intuitive, since using them to attack isolated artillery units requires a lot of move orders that cross the artillery's position, rather than a less micro-intensive charge order, which doesn't quite seem to work with cavalry.The only real gameplay complaint I have is the balanced AI's tendency to make a bunch of aggressive moves just as the battle timer runs out, thus seizing more time for itself to put your ragged forces under pressure. That might just be a failure of my generalship for showing it weakness, though.If it sounds like I'm harshing on the UI, that's because it's really the only thing in this game I have a problem with. Other than those issues, Ultimate General: Gettysburg is a near-perfect strategy experience. Not huge in scope, but perfectly executed, with a nice visual style and deep, complex gameplay that's tunable to the level of difficulty you want. I'm planning to check out Game-Labs' Naval Action at some point, but mostly I'm waiting eagerly for the next game in this series (and hoping for a French Revolutionary/Napoleonic setting). "

What's not fine is that this highlight looks exactly the same as the selection indicator, leading to early circumstances where I wasn't sure if moving my general would move all those units out of position.  Further, the controls, while an interesting setup, have some issues in the PC version. There's no selection box, and while the draw-around-the-units-you-want system is cool (and must work well on tablets), it feels a little counterintuitive, although it does allow some nice fine selection of units. It's not particularly easy to quickly deselect units in the heat of the moment, leading to me ordering my brigades to march in a circle while attempting to select more units. The drag-the-unit-across-the-map method of unit movement is very, very cool and I like it a lot, but I'd also like a more normal right-click to be implemented alongside it. This would also make the use of the game's rare cavalry units a lot more intuitive, since using them to attack isolated artillery units requires a lot of move orders that cross the artillery's position, rather than a less micro-intensive charge order, which doesn't quite seem to work with cavalry.The only real gameplay complaint I have is the balanced AI's tendency to make a bunch of aggressive moves just as the battle timer runs out, thus seizing more time for itself to put your ragged forces under pressure. That might just be a failure of my generalship for showing it weakness, though.If it sounds like I'm harshing on the UI, that's because it's really the only thing in this game I have a problem with. Other than those issues, Ultimate General: Gettysburg is a near-perfect strategy experience. Not huge in scope, but perfectly executed, with a nice visual style and deep, complex gameplay that's tunable to the level of difficulty you want. I'm planning to check out Game-Labs' Naval Action at some point, but mostly I'm waiting eagerly for the next game in this series (and hoping for a French Revolutionary/Napoleonic setting). "

												This game is very much the spiritual successor to Sid Meier's Gettysburg, it has excellent depth despite the fact that it only covers the battle of Gettysburg as you can play as either the Confederates or Union against a variety of different AI opponents. The Confederates are harder to play and the hills on the map are difficult to see without contours turned on, but apart from that this game is excellent.			"

Sometimes they won't respond to your commands, and they'll execute commands they never received. If you want a casual RTS style game, then grab this. If you want actual tactics, look elsewhere.Edit: They improved the AI and targeting system a bunch. Now the game is actually enjoyable.			"

												I had high hopes for this game, especially after reading the previews from Pocket Tactics and various youtube videos.I know that it only states I've 0.8 hours on record; however, I had played a lot over the Christmas Break in absence of an Internet connection.  I've about 4 or so hours I would say.  Unfortunately, at least on OSX, this game is highly unstable.  It is very common for the game to freeze, mid-battle.  In fact, I've only been able to successfully finish one battle without it locking up.  It is just not playable and I deeply regret buying this.  Hopefully this gets fixed, but if you have OSX (not sure if this impacts Windows), avoid the game for now as it is absolutely not fit for purpose.			"

												It's just one battle, one map, Ok the clue is in the title, Gettysburg, I just imagined there would actually be more to it. Dull and repetitive. Why would I want to keep  doing the same thing over and over. Ok I know American History is short  but not that short! There must have been some more battles somewhere, maybe worth drawing up a few more maps, I mean how difficult is that. So it was cheap so that's alright then yes? Well no, actually it was a rip off if you paid more than £2 for it. Unfortunately I paid £10, how much was this game originally, surely not more? You would be much better getting an old Total War title, which will have infinitely more variety, most of the world to play in, bigger battles, more detail. Shall I go on? But there's custom battles isn't there? Yes you can actually choose what time of day it is, on the same map and same scenario,,,oh good. Even the first TW had better graphics than this pile of utter pointless garbage.  Avoid at all cost unless you have some weird fetish about playing a tiresome 2d battle over and over and over and over.....Oh look the Yankies one that time, funny it was the Confederates last time, I wonder what will happen this time, I don't f***** care, just get me out of here!

												This early access game has been holding my interest.  I like it and despite some of the negative reviews I bought the game, and I'm glad I did!  AI seems good against you, it seems to try to flank when your weak on the ends or outnumbered.  That said, if you've ever play Sid Meiers Gettysburg, for some reason it has the same AI thinking problem as that game.  If they rush up to your line and they get shot back, the line will continuously fall back and charge over and over, even when they should obviously fall back, regroup or retreat.  Meaning, AI decisions still have some pathing choices to be programmed in....but, I still like playing this in between other games, and its early access, so it probably improve more.  And, one important note, every other day or so, I see the developers updating this game.  I can't tell you how important that is.  If you purchased early access before you know some of these games clearly don't support their own games.			"

The AI seems pretty good, and I like the different settings laid out in a grid for difficulty and aggressiveness. You play tactical battles, making decisions in between portions of the battle as to what your next move will be. I enjoyed this aspect of it as your decisions drive the next portion of the battle with your results from previous battles carrying over to the next (I think).

												This game reminds you of the glorious days of ""Sid Meier's Gettysburg"" back in 1998.I strongly recommend this game, because it is such fun to play and looks so great. It looks like what you had to imagine in your head playing Sid Meier's Gettysburg back in the days, and it relives those sweet memories in an entirely new way. Having said that, the recommendation comes with a few points of criticism. The major downside of this game is that playtime is TOO SHORT. The game will not grant you enough time to conduct a decent military operation, although that is what it expects you to do. It puts your units in a sloppy position to begin with, and subsequently expects you to fight a battle of Gettysburg scenario in about 15 minutes of playing time. That's not only impossible and unhistorical, it's frustrating, because by the time you manage to get your lines organized and your operation gains momentum, the clock says ""battle is over"" and puts an end to your efforts, just when you begun to taste victory. It's also a bit of a shame that you cannot put your troops in marching column. There is no ""marching column"" command, no ""advance"" command, and no ""dig in"" command. Artillery handling is awkward, and needs a lot of repositioning before your artillery units are willing to start shooting at something.Nevertheless, the graphics are great, the sounds are great and this game still reminds you of the glorious days of Sid Meier's Gettysburg. With all its (temporary?) shortcomings, this game is a true achievement and well worth your money. "

												Very much enjoying this game. Could use some more information in the UI. For me it is tedious to have to check my Artillery units that they are actually in line of site and firing.Maybe I'm missing something but in the product pictures. Out of LOS was shaded red, not so and I find it difficult or at least tedious for the Artillery units to discern the shading and have to click on enemy units just to see if they are in LOS.I do hope you continue in the line of what TalonSoft did and we'll see a Sharpsburg, 1st/2nd Manassas as I would purchase those in a heartbeat.In your casualties reports the red coloring makes it difficult to see the numbers. I know it's not my eyesight.The AI was a bit sneaky running a skirmish unit far behind my lines to capture a victory point.There should as be next unit, previous unit to cycle through your units.Great game though.

												I really wanted to like this game. I really really wanted to like this game. As in, I've waited years for a decent civil war strategy game with an easy to get into feel (quick 30 minute multiplayer games, etc.)Unfortunately, I just can't get there (yet - the game does have potential. Not sure if still if still being developed).It's going for ""Sid Meier's"" Gettysburg or Antietam, but has too many  broken mechanics and missing features still. Poor manual, instructions, statistics. The volleys have a nice effect, but there are no unit formations. An example of the confusion is just now, where I sacrifice many, many more units in the campaign to get a ""winning"" victory point, game confirms I've captured it, yet I am still given a draw with no detailed explanation of victory points, why it was a draw, etc.. No overlay for cover, unit speed etc. Bugs also present, such as sometimes Artillery will never use the correct shot, will sit at 100% and never fire if I set to a short-range shot with units right in front of it. I did give this 6+ months to see if updates would help before writing this. There is DEFINITELY an improvement in the ""volleying"" and effects thereof making the game more playable. Lining up troops and shooting other is satifying, but more work needed around the artillery and other parts of the game (for example, multiplayer is non existent, simply because there is no lobby function like most games. You basically need to find a player off-line). Will check back in another 6 mo.			"

												The good things about the game, which have been pointed out in the positive reviews, I generally agree with.  The main bad thing about it is the developers' lack of historical research on Civil War armies and battles.  They claim (and have designed the game to reflect) that Union soldiers were better-drilled, better trained, and more effective in ranged combat with the musket than the Confederates.  Anyone who's read anything about the battles of Fredericksburg, Chickasaw Bluffs, Spotsylvania, Kennesaw Mountain, and Cold Harbor, among others, can tell you that's untrue.   Confederate infantry was absolutely lethal in ranged combat.   At Cold Harbor Lee's infantry and artillery shot over 7,000 Federals in about 20 minutes, inflicting a total of 12,500 casualties in the entire battle while losing a scant 1,450 themselves.   The developers completely miss the fact that both armies were composed almost entirely of volunteers and conscripts who had been civilians before the war--thus neither side had a real advantage in training.  Proficiency in combat came with experience, and here the Confederates generally had the advantage because instead of raising new regiments to replace losses as the Union did, they fed replacements into existing units so the fresh fish could learn their trade from the veterans in the ranks.  Finally, the developers claim that the Union had more advanced weaponry than the Confederates at the Battle of Gettysburg--supposedly this resulted in their superiority in ranged fire, both with infantry and artillery.  Also untrue.  A modest amount of reading on their part would have revealed what pretty much any student of the Civil War knows--both sides used pretty much the same weapons (except for the Union's repeating rifles and carbines, which were very small in number).  The fact is that at Gettysburg, both Union and Confederate infantry were variously equipped with model 1842 Springfield smoothbore muskets and model 1855 and 1861 Springfield rifled muskets, as well as the British model 1853 Enfield rifled musket (very similar in performance to the Springfield).  Artillery was about the same--both sides mainly used a mixture of 12-pounder Napoleon smoothbore cannon, 3-inch Ordnance Rifles, and 10-pounder Parrott Rifles.  The Union had a higher percentage of rifled guns, but this didn't prove to be too much of an advantage, as rifled projectliles had a tendency to burrow into the ground without doing much damage--the 12-pounder Napoleon smoothbore was actually better in terms of the damage it could do to infantry formations.These mistaken premises really hurt the game, as they force the Confederate player to charge in situations where it normally wouldn't have been advisable (and charging in this game is pretty useless for both sides, in my experience--the Confederates don't seem to have the advantage in melee combat that the developers advertise).  They also enable the Union player to win simply by forming an intelligent line, placing artillery, and pretty much sitting back and watching the fireworks.This is a game that wishes it could be Sid Meier's Antietam and Sid Meier's Gettysburg.  It could have been if the developers had gone into more depth with unit tactics, put more realism into the game mechanics, and done the necessary historical research.  You know there's something fishy when a single AI infantry brigade routs 4 artillery batteries in a frontal assault, uphill, with no support while taking minimal casualties, but when you try it with three brigades in a flank attack you get butchered.  There are other similar problems with the mechanics that have already been noted in the reviews.			"

												This is NOT a substitute for Sid Meier's Gettysburg (SMG). It's basically the junior monopoly version of SMG. The units are just a mass of little people with little formation and actual battle function. The terrain is a Toon Town interpretation of Gettysburg. I could go on, but I was so frustrated that I wasted money on this game. Scourge of War is the only game to equal the Sid Meier's series.			"

								That was the best 3 hours of my gaming life.The controls are hard to get used to but once you get the hang of it you understand the gist. This game has you fighting a huge battle not just on one front, but 2-3 different sides on the map (as Union). Acting quickly and timing your actions are essential to winning battles, that is why there is a pause button which helps tremendously. I love planning out my actions before hand, and then the anticipation and tension when the battle plays out.The A.I. is intelligent and it constantly anticipates my movement on the map, unlike the total war games where sometimes the units actually ignore you or chase you alone. The computer is very aggressive and can be passive. In order to win battles I actually had to take advantage of the terrain, and capture some key parts of the map. For example, there was a small hill on my left flank, so I secured it with skirmishers, then sat my artillery there, and the battle became much easier (but still intense) since I had a huge advantage. In many games, capturing 'strategic points' hold no tacitcal advantage whatsoever, but in this game, the territories you're supposed to hold are usually Hills, ridges, and areas with vegitation (gives units cover). So you aren't uselessly capturing a territory because the game makes it seem important, you're doing it because it gives significant advantages.Even with all those good positions I had on the map it was still hard to manage because your men's condition and morale will plummet if they fight too long. I actually like that. There was tension when my left and right flanks faltered because they were routing, and just in time I had some fresh reinforcements on the map. That's not the only reason why I like the morale/condition system, but also the fact that rotating your men regularly (and having reserves) greatly rewards you for your micromanagement and effort.And as much as people might say graphics aren't important. They do add an element to gameplay, and it is clear which is high ground and which are forests, though some terrain isn't as quite clear. The fog of war and sight range for units adds a unique element and it makes scouting crucial, since units can't aim or attack if there enemy is out of sight. It's a very simplistic style that really works with the game and the time setting it takes place.Do I recommend this game? Yes, if you love strategy games. There is a whole lot more to the micromanagement than just massing up forces and throwing them at the enemy (like most rts games). But be warned, this is a thinking man's game, the pause button is your friend, and you have to figure some things out yourself. It will become frustrating if you don't think about your actions or take a look at the stats of your men.			"

								Dammit this game is awesome! Excellent AI (I'm damn good at Napoleonic tactics, so a good AI is definately refreshing), realistic gameplay (where even a slight rise in elevation, as in real life, can be vicious against your forces when the enemy occupies it), and the art style is simple, but beautiful. Did I mention the AI?The men and women behind this game, notably the designer of the DarthMod series (i love those mods!), have done very well. I look forward to future patches and developments. Seriously, guys, this game is excellent. If you like wargames, this is definately a game for you! Especially, if you're a buff of this period in American history.			"

												Update - after playing and reviewing this game some time ago I have not been back to the play the game since then.  This in itself says a lot about the game. Although it has pretty good graphics and I like the concept of the game - its durabililty is limited. so on this point unless you can pick it up for a few dollars I would think twice about buying the game - end Update.This game is good value for money for what it is. Although it is not yet an epic game in the league of Total War or Civilization franchises, I believe it could be if the game was is futher developed to include other ACW battles and indeed cover the whole of the ACW campaign linking somehow the major battles and some minor battles as well.Back to the game itself. It plays quite well once you have mastered the mouse control interface in  controlling and moving the units about the battlefield. The game to a degree has an auto play function but ultimately it is up to you to move the units around the battlefield and where and when to encounter the enemy.How you choose to deploy your units and when to use them will lead to a number of scenorios playing out and perhaps changing the course of history.Overall I would recommend this game (for the price).  And hopefully it will be further developed, maybe the better word is expanded, in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								(played alot on Steam in offline mode--so ive got quite a bit more time than listed above--roughly 16 hours at time of review)I really like this game.  I just read The Killer Angels by Shara, which is a narrative of the battle of Gettysburg, so I found myself in a mood for Civil War gaming.  I came here looking for Scourge of War: Gettysburg, but apparently it is no longer on Steam (im reluctant to buy a game outside of Steam)--so after much debate I decided to get Ultimate General instead.I love it.  I played Sid Miere Gettysburg back in the day--and this is as good as it gets if youre like me and have been wishing someone would update that game for current computers and make it look a little nicer.  If that is something you desire, then Ultimate General is your game.Its fun, it looks nice, it plays alot like Sid Meier's.  The Battle of Gettysburg flows nicely as you play through it.  It did a good job of capturing the feel of the Gettysburg book I just read, and definately scratched that Civil War itch.  In short, its just a fun game.My only complaint would be amount of content.  For $9.99 you definately get enough content.  The Battle of Gettysburg itself is pretty robust and plays out in interesting ways with a fair amount of replayability--but I want more.  Its got a custom battle setup, but it needs to be a little more robust.  Would really like a proper, random battle option--where you could pick battle size, and it places victory points randomly on map, and randomizes troops involved, troop starting location, and randomized reinforcement and map entry.As far as Early Access goes--It feels like a full release to me for the most part.  I wouldn't realize it was an Early Access if it didn't say so on the store page.  I spotted some very minor issues--at one point I pushed an enemy brigade literally off the map, and yet some of my cannons kept trying to fire at this off map enemy--with the cannons landing at map edge and either having no effect or hitting my own troops trying to pass through that way.  This only occued one time, and is a very unique situation.So I recommend it.  At 9.99 it is a no-brainer.  If they have added a more robust custom/random battle system by release time--this game would easily be worth 20.00-25.00 dollars.  Really hoping to see more like this.			"

Early Access Review
								As a longtime Total War series fan this is the game I've always wanted. The civil war is the perfect setting for large army strategy games. This game goes beyond Total war style by making the game much more realistic. Honestly the best $10 I have spent on a game in a long time this game is a gem. With decisions to be made throughout the game on how you plan to defend or attack/counter-attack. All in all best strategy game I have played in a long time			"

												I've never been so traumatized in my life. the game is one of the most fun RTS games, ive ever played, sending young boys to the slaughter is quite rewarding. especially when you win a few battles, and your rank improves.  getting to the Rank of Major, took alot of tears, and not to mention the blood of a countless dead yankies.10/10 im going back to not being able to sleep, because i can still hear their screams, and cries for help.

												This game is brilliant, especially given that it was done by a Total War modder. The art style is impressive and beautiful, and feels very uniquely Civil War era-ish. Gameplay mechanics are typical RTS fare, and it is reminiscent of many classics like Cossacks II. Graphics look dated, but it suits the game's art style very well; and especially for a first major release from this developer.I've only played under an hour, but I'm addicted as is. The AI is challenging, and it is perhaps one of the best indie games I've bought this year. I can't wait to play more when I get home.			"

												An absolute joke. Paid good money for a very bloiled down Total War. Here are some bullet points to convince you to stay away:- One map. Yes, one- 2014, almost 2015 and there are no models, just sprites. Very poorly animated- AI is moronic. Need to issue the same order every 15 seconds as it keps forgetting what to do- Artillery does nothing. Misses at point blank, mid range and long range- Hills provide no cover, just longer aim- Cavarly is constantly afraid of its own shadow- Multiplayer broken- I repeat: one mapStay far, far away.As an Unity developer myself, I feel ashamed to contribute to this game, which resembles an end-of-year project and not a real retail game			"

												So, today I revisited this game. I purchased it a long time ago and it was a lot of fun! It had some issues like the confederates charges being overpowered and artillary just being plain un usable, but it was fun. I revisit it today to see what its like after the last few updates to find a complete cluster ♥♥♥♥ of unreasonable mess all over my screen. I attempted a new campaign, as the confederates, figuring it wouldn't be easy but hey, I've done it before. Ohhhhhhh no. When i finally got so fed up that I mashed the ALt and F4 keys like a hot mama making mashed potaoes for Sunday dinner, i believe my loses were somewhere around 5 to 1. Now mind you, I was being quite aggressive, but when the union an stand thier and litrally take lead to the face and just... just... whats the word... oh yea, absorb it while my numbers litrally fly down by the hundreds every volley? Holy ♥♥♥♥ it was awful. The game tells you to get in close with the confedrates as that is the only way they don't suck, but I Don't think I could get within a few hundred meters without my men spontaneously combusting! My opinion, its broken at this point, not sure if it is side baised or AI ♥♥♥♥ed, but 2/10 would not melt away again.			"

												I was very excited to play this game since I love what Darthmod did with several of the Total war games, however I was let down by this game.  I think it could be a good game, but the mechanics need more work and I dislike the interface.  When I tried to flank artillery with cavalry they just sit there and fire at range (yes I double-clicked per the tutorial instructions).  When units are in melee it's difficult to tell whether they are actually fighting or just moving.  The commands seem to be designed for touchscreen devices which is annoying when playing on a desktop.Like I said, I love his mods and civil war games in general, but I would not recommend this game in it's current condition.

												If it wasnt so glitchy it might be worth about $5. The game tends to crash about 60-70% of the battles and when it does you have to start over again. Graphically Inferior but overall gameplay is not bad if it doesn't crash. Campaign is rather short as it is just the Battle of Gettysburg.			"

												This game has given me an insight into a new form of tactic one can apply on the battlefield. If the enemy is runing away you should also run away, just to be safe. What this means is that your brave brave soldiers will bravely run away when the first shot is fired, a thing i can understand, the muskets are very loud after all. I cannot recommend this game, the moral system is horrible, or then maybe im just really bad at it, but it feels kind of weird that you army runs away at the same time the enemy runs away.			"

												I've actually owned this game before random Neo-Confederates decided to make Apple pulling it off their service their casus belli.So for anyone looking at the game and not interested in Neo-Confederate rhetoric being the driving opinion I would say buy it for the great gameplay regardless of any flag fiasco. Since objectively the game is very good and somewhat reminiscent of Sid Meier's Gettysburg! The Union has a slightly easier time due to the game making them better at shooting while the South is better at close combat and general morale. The UI is very intuitive with a simple click and drag system.One thing that should be said is that the campaign while existent does not nearly draw you in as much as Sid Meier's Gettysburg!'s use of reactment cutscenes.  Instead there's a sort of barebone summary of orders and a hidden skeleton tree campaign.Enoyable nonetheless but if the game had a bigger budget and more people working on it, it could be an obvious area of improvement.On a last note I should also say that the AI is suprisingly good with multiple personality types to match what you choose. So I highly recommend if you're fan of strategy games in general and have an interest in the Civil War period. I do not recommend it if you just want to buy it to protest a private company's decision over a flag and want the internet to witness your political leanings.			"

Not that quick and bloody  of an assault when there is 1600 guys a peice in a unit and 8 units in the brawl. so single player, i get my♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked as the rebels and i walk the fight when im the yankees.i tried MP to see if the campaign was just fluff. i couldnt find a match with my little 2 star general as there is no one online. After waiting an age i got matched up with some guy with about 9 stars and all the other decorations and expthe fight started after about 5 seconds of loading so i had no idea what the hell the mission was and i was swiftly swarmed and routed.   i really wana like this game and i probably will keep goin back to it as its still in development. But the fact its simply a tablet/phone game completley cripples it for me. i think the funds and effort would have been better applied  doing a US civil war complete over haul of empire or napoleon total war. easily in darthmods capability.

												I really tried to like this game, having been a fan of Cid Meir's Gettysberg, but all in all it's unsatisfying. The game is just so simple - whether playing as Union or Confederate it's so so easy to beat the AI no matter what the setting. I gave it another go recently since they added an improved AI ""AI Boost"" but it's still very winnable without even really knowing what you are doing - just move the men in the direction of the enemy and watch them die!As well as the gameplay, the graphics are quite simple and it lacks polish - the menus are so basic it seems like not a lot of effort has gone into them.I haven't tried multiplayer - perhaps there is a lot more depth to it, but single player certainly can't hold my patience for long.

												Intense and historically accurate game unike the bigoted southern morons who still think the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery. States rights means to protect slavery and the humiliation of another race. I'm so glad I live in the north and I don't have to deal with Johny hick rebs crying about heritage or ""it's just a flag!""... my favorite idiotic nieve line is.."" it has nothing to do with racism!"". REALLY?! It's hard to grasp that such toothless inbred sister kissing southerners play this game!! The Union won and crushed the Confederates and therefore the flag should not be waved unless it's in a Confederate graveyard or your'e a traitor who still wants the southern states to continue slavery under the weak guise of ""States Rights"" The stars and bars does look good in this game though.Love hearing Union battle hymns playing while watching the shoeless Rebs retreat into the hills. Almost like racists and republicans..talk a lot of crap but hide behind a computer or tv moniter.For those who actually have somewhat of an inteligence and are true history gamers. This game is pretty dope just needs ad ons or map packs for a broader spectrum of the war. And they do a great replication of the stars and bars..lol.			"

This game feels more like its meant for a tablet than a PCThe guy who made this was apparently behind the DarthMod for various Total War games. Honestly I never seemed to notice any valuable changes that made to the game but it did add some neat stuff. Regardless he always seemed full of himself and arrogant and its not really shocking that the best he could do falls incredibly short and is on the level of a mobile game.Still it gives you the idea of what basic line formation tactics are about and civil war games are rare. But its not worth buying. $15 is alot of a mobile game.If you really care about Civil War junk this might be worth getting, but to the vast majority of people its simply a pecularity.			"

												Fun, but kind of disappointing for $15. If you're thinking of buying this game because you remember how awesome the Sid Meiers/Fireaxis games were, STOP! This doesn't come close. I don't remember when those games came out ('97, '98?) but the graphics were about the same (or better, in the case of unit detail) as Ultimate General: Gettyburg ('14!). While the game has its moments and can be fun at times, you have no fine control over your units. For example you can't have a line wheel left or right, you can't order skirmishers to run. Furthermore this game is unreliable at best when it comes to saving your campaign. I've been able to save/resume/complete campaigns but as often as not I've returned to the game and found no trace of my saved or the autosaved progress.If this game was a $5 app on an iPad I'd recommend it highly. $15 bucks though for this...? At your own risk.			"

The controls are odd and I can't see any improvement over all the other strategy games. Its not in the same league as Total War. Doesn't have much content. I would give it a 4 and that's generous.

												This game is OK. The civil war game is really an abandoned genre unfortunately.  This game is what I would consider a ""hack and slash"" RTS with no real strategy.  You basically just line your troops up and out flank the enemy.  No real emphasis on position or cover just sliding armies over and out flanking.  Strategy beyond the immediate battle field, you get like two choices ""defend this flank"" or ""attack this hill"" which is really just their way of asking if you want 1 of three different battlefield maps they have available.

												This is basically an updated version of Sid Meier's Gettysburg! from forever ago.  I spent entirely too much time playing that.  It's a fantastic game even today.The main difference is, while this is pretty much the same game re-designed on modern hardware with some prettier graphics, a lot of the features seem to be removed.  No varying formations, unit-specific orders like volley, etc.  All you really do is drag units around and watch them fight.  It's a fun little game, though, and worth a discounted price.  Don't expect anything resembling a deep experience, or anything more than a very simple arcade strategy game, and you won't be disappointed.  But, given the descriptions hailing it as some wonderous new amazing tactical civil war game, I have to say no.			"

												I loved this game at first. It plays differently every time. The AI is wonderful.  The tweaks they have made along the way are great. It all fits well together, has run seamlesslesy, and looks beautiful. And then you advance to the next scenario. Sucks. Completely awful. You lose loads of ground between rounds. Example: On Day 2 I roll up the entire Union army's right flank. They are decimated. I basically back them down to the Round Tops, but when I advance my troops are all the way back at cemetary hill. I have had something like this happen about 10 times now.  It just makes it lose all it's fun. I am done playing until they fix this.			"

												Solid but ultimately (haha) unsuccessful attempt to unseat Sid Meier's Gettysburg as the best Gettysburg game. UMG has some great things going for it, especially its appealing presentation and elegant interface.Unfortunately there's a few really irritating rough spots that kill my enjoyment of this game. Line of sight can be very finicky and it's not always clear why your units aren't firing when it seems like they've got a clear shot. Same goes for the numerous times when your units will block one another from firing for no apparent reason. Units often behave unpredictably when they retreat, frequently running TOWARDS the enemy and suffering massive casualties. Scenarios sometimes feel like they drag on too long, especially when they go into extra time. Finally, the sound design is very flat and too quiet -- itstead of the roar of battle, it's more of a mutter.I replayed Sid Meier's Gettysburg after playing UMG and honestly I think it's a better game in almost every way: more interesting scenarios (with some very entertaining set-up explaining what's going on), better unit behavior, a viciously competent AI, more control over your units, and superior sound design. It was one of the first games I ever owned, and 15 years later I'm still enjoying the hell out of it.			"

												I tend to like these sorts of games, but I'm not sold on this one.  I played the battle on average difficulty settings and found it to be fairly boring.  This is coming from someone who liked battles in Empire: Total War, which were total ♥♥♥♥♥hows.  Actually, comparing this to ETW could work.  The battle in this game is very similar to many in ETW, complete with puzzling AI decisions and disappointing cavalry charges.The game's aesthetic appealed to me from the photos, but seeing it in action was disappointing.  The tilt shift effect is cool, but they seem to use to gloss over how poor the battlefield/city looks. It looks like one of those carpets for kids to play town on.  Buildings look drawn on with confused perspectives.  It's 2014, you can do better than this. If they tried to stylize it, they did it poorly.I wanted to like this game, because I love the period and the idea, as well as the genre.  In the end I was bored and spent more time wondering what went wrong with the battlefield map than with the AI.I'd say just play DarthMod for Empire, but that mod doesn't do anything either.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't recommend this game - not because it's a bad game, on the contrary, it's a decent game - but because it isn't what it tries to be. And that game it's desperately trying to be is Sid Meier's Gettysburg, the old and apparently peerless classic. Unfortunately, where Sid Meier's game shone, this game seems lackluster.The pacing of Ultimate General is too fast, depriving the battles of any kind of tension as crises are resolved too quickly one way or another. Where SMG was a rising crescendo of fury, with pitched battles raging back and forth as you and the AI threw more and more regiments into the fray, UGG is a sharp, brief clash where one side suddenly buckles under fire and before you can say ""boo!"" all of the losing troops are on the run. What could be a slow, considered, developing battle is instead turned into a click-fest as you scramble back and forth between the two wings of your line pushing bridages back into formations.The developer claims to have an advanced, challenging AI, which is patently untrue. At no point in any of the battles (and I've played the game on highest difficulty from both sides) had I felt that the fight was going to turn dangerously against me. He is easy to outmaneuver, nor does he guard flanks or give up a forward position to establish better lines with reserves farther back. Only the speed of the game manages to mask the inabilities of the AI, as most breakthroughs occur because you were busy managing your line elsewhere. This isn't AI brilliance, it's just frustrating. One brigade will fall back 50 yards out of range of fire, while the adjoining brigades stay online and get hammered for their trouble. If you don't catch your unit falling back and hold them by the hand and drag them back into line, your line is liable to fail. What the game does get right is the ""individual battles within a battle"" method of progressing Gettysburg (which, I might add, is straight out of SMG) through the 3 days of fighting. It provides a realistic ebb and flow of combat as the sides rest and resupply between phases of battle. Where UGG misses on this count, however, is that you can give the Yankees a crushing defeat, taking Seminary, Oak, and Cemetary Ridges all in the same battle, and with the blue-bellies routing before you and victory in sight, the battle will end and in the next phase you find yourself fighting over the same piece of battlefield. It makes you wonder why you even bothered fighting so hard. On the other side of the coin, a brilliant defense on the first day as the Union will still see you inexplicably falling back to Cemetary Hill.The big #1 miss of this entire game is that there in no multiplayer support. The fairly even-strength fighting in this battle is perfectly suited for multiplayer action. There is no current comperable title to UGG. Another ACW offering, Gettysburg: Scourge of War has a multiplay option, but the game is incredibly dense and sports a learning curve that means new players will be massacred failry easily. UGG's simple, elegant design lends itself easily to buy-and-play multiplay where a new player will be competent in a few sessions. Without any similiar offerings on Steam, UGG could potentially corner the American Civil War mulitplayer market - and it would be a great multiplayer game.Final words: UGG is an okay game - almost a tablet game in the way it looks and handles. If you're into face-value easy to play, easy to master RTS, this game could your next favourite. If you're more like me and you prefer deep strategy like Hearts of Iron, Europa Universalis and so on, you might want to give this one a miss.			"

												In 1997, Sid Meier released Gettysburg...A classic and a forerunner to the Total War series (Shogun debuted a whole 3 years later in 2000). Fast forward 17 years and enter Ultimate General: Gettysburg...I thought to myself, ""How could this go wrong?""Let's list some of the advantages:- Sid Meier's work, with   > proven gameplay, great audio, and an established narrative + 17 years of graphical advancements+ 17 years of UI progress+ revolutionized online gaming (so long 56K)+ a modder from the TW communitySeemed like a perfect formula, right? This guy will be the Christopher Nolan to our Batman, right?Within 2 hours I came to terms with the awful mistake I'd made. This is the first Steam game I've ever actively *wanted* to return after playing.- 165 cavalrymen chased down by a 2000-man brigade.- No limber button for artillery? No formation select for infantry? - 2500 men clash in a charge and NO ONE dies for 30 seconds?- Poor production value, with audio that falls behind a 1997 gameWhy not have a true fog of war? Volumetric clouds of gunpowder smoke on the battlefield. Nothing! I honestly tried to like this game. I installed it. Uninstalled it. Re-installed it. Sorry, but this is one Civil War story better lost to history.EDIT: Once Steam made it easier to delete games this joke was trashed for good.Also, every friend on Steam only played it for 1.1-1.8 hours. Go figure.			"

								Needs a lot of tweaking on the gameplay.AI just uses one regiment of throwaway soldiers to run around and capture victory points in your rear. Not through a tactical maneuver with forces to hold it, just a ninja and then they run off to cap the next one while you're still fighting the main battle.Pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you're the confederates without cavalry.Also, seems to be a little fudging of the numbers of Union vs Confederates on the first day.Seems like the devs wanted 2:1 odds in the Union favour. 3 divisions of Rebs against the entire 1st Corps?Nuff said.

The game named as Ultimate General takes the Mick to be honest. I would not recommend buying this game if you want a real strategy game to play.Poor game! what a shame could have been a great title.I just want my money back!			"

												When I read about this game I bought it immediately because I'm a big fan of this genre and fascinated by the Civil War. Also, I was exited to see the game these devs would come up with. Unfortunatly, it's my opinion that this game is extremely unsatisfying and also difficult to master. The closest comparison to UG: Gettysburg is probably Empire: Total War although this game lacks meny of the features that made Empire a great game. Here's a couple:1. The controls don't give you much of a toolbox to lead the battle. Because of these bad controls (and the fast pace of the battles) you won't have time (or the tools) to form proper defensive/offensive lines because you have to control each unit individually.2. Because of the morale feature and the controls being like they are, I've spent most of the battle time repeatingly dragging each unit towards the front as they pull back every chance they get (you have to command them to ""HOLD"" after they arrive at each location, but no player (or real commander) can be everywhere at once. This just takes away every satisfaction I would normally get when playing a game of this sort becaus I have to spend all my time doing things a general shouldn't have to do.3. The terrain is hard to read as everything looks flat. Being about the battle of Gettysburg, everything should really be about defense/attack on high ground. In a way it is, because the ridges are victory point, but there doesn't seem to be any difference between fighting in the open or on top of a hill. I can't say whether or not the terrain gives any kind of bonus/penalty like getting a bonus when on high ground. What I can say, is that it sure doesn't feel like it. The things I thought would be important in a game like this (like digging in and defending a hilltop or setting up defences along rivers and other obstacles) doesn't seem to have any effect at all.In short, I just don't see the point of playing this game and I'm quite disappointed in the results. Can't recommend it... :-(			"

												So, let's get it straight (or gay, what ever you preference is, just don't touch the cat) I'm a Total War fan, and I was really, really excited (Scarlet Johansson home video excited) when I found out that one of the best TW modders (whose mods I used) is making a game of his own. I bought this a while ago, but only today I had a chance to finally play it, and (with the abovementioned levels of excitement and 90% positive reviews) I was expecting a ""sex bomb of a strategy game). And I got disappointed, Ben Affleck is the new Batman type disappointed.I love the idea, I like the map, but, BUT, as a TW player I'm used to position my troops precisely and to have a proper line of sight. With this type of controls (and partially this is the issue of the Unity engine I would imagine) I was in pain and it really ruined the experience for me. The other major disappointment was the King of Battle, no clear line of sight and for whatever reason my artillery was always utterly slow (whichever side I would chose) while the AI would have a much better reload speed.For a first game it's OK, but I can't really recommend it to strategy lovers.One Grumpy Russian score - 5/10 -this 2d models lack the positioning and precision for me to make my vodka shots.P.S.For more reviews join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ "

The gameplay is slow and bland. I don't see why other game reviews have given this game such positive remarks.

								As much as i want and try to like this game- it just doesnt make fun and feels like any other mainstream game i have ever played!Its slow, its confusing, its boring, its simple, and i dont have the feeling, that anything i do has real impact. Where players hardly have any choices, besides moving, anyway.Just move your units around the map, which gets really stressy over time, fight, means: the number above units get lower, and all that until its over and somebody has won. Of course there are some factors that influence battles. (And yes, ive read the complete manual v0.8). Its just, as i said, that i dont feel much difference, no matter which manouver i try, which constellation i use, which terrain im in. Well, maybe the game is just too uninteresting for me, as that i would recognize fine differences.I cannot even get myself to finish a single battle. For me, playing this game is work, not fun.It could have become a great game, if real depth and a feeling of greatness had been involved, but instead, the devs decided to aim for the casual gamer, and developed a simple, basic game.The reason people still like it, in my personal oppinion, is the creator. Im sure, it would have gotten miuch less attention and enthusiasm, if it wasnt made by Darth, but names mean everything these days.Im very disappointed...			"

								I wish there was kind of a sidways thumb option cuz really Im ambivalent about this game. though since I have to choose its gonna slide to the no side.what I like: I definetly like the style and the overall attention to detail the developers have gone into. covering the entire battle depending on your choices and deployment. even to the point of showing custers involvement in the battle which most people don't know.things that annoy: theres no easy method of determining elevation on the map, Im constantly trying to find a position on the map that gives hight advantages or just a decent view. there's no way of seeing good cover on the map except moving a unit to positions and looking at their benefits. the game breaker: this is not the decisive win the battle on the first day style game that I really wanted. assaults on the weak points of enemy lines almost never have a satisfactory outcome usually ending with my troops running away from their own fleeing troops because they ran out of morale. so most of the time the game ends up being launching assaults only to be tossed back, or defending a position until the assault is over waiting around doing nothing so I can eventually start rotating troops from the front line. I was hoping for that game that would really demonstrate what I hear everyone always say about gettysburg and the early civil war in general, if the Union had some decent commanders they would have won every battle they went into. and in gettysburg for knowlegde of the battle you could play the confederates and avoid the mistakes Lee made.this is a maybe review could be something you're looking for but its just not for me.

Only one unit in the union had better than avarege morale that is the iron brigade. Only a handful of Confederate units were, green many units in the union army were green. This is due to the union habit of creating new unis to send to the army, while the Confederates sent replacements to existing units keeping the morale up.

												Seems buggy.For example I have had an 1300 man strong unit standing on a enemy position and simply not eliminate them. I have had enemy units surrounded and my units seems to be not so effective nor will the enemy units route when faced with potential decimation.  Sent in a 6000 man strong charge to no effect. Artillery is a joke still trying how to use it properly because it has a mind of its own. Quite often it's not doing anything and when it does it's too late. Placed on a hill top perfect aim on the enemy positions and taking a coffee break?Putting units in cover to protect them is a solid tactical plan but not in this game. The cover option does not seem to offer up much benefit. While attacking units in the open it seems like little to no benefit noticed.Larger units running from smaller ones for no good reason.Was there not some fooking horses in the South? NOT in this game seems they left that out even if there was 1.7 million used with the Southern Armies. Where's my Southern Calvary? Horse drawn Artillery?My disappointment is the one sidedness of this game...... It needs some work.Can I get a refund?			"

This game differs in the unintuitive controls, no real indication how tactical manuvers affect the battle, a laughably and pathetically contructed ""tutorial"" that provides no real entry into the game, and a general feeling that i'm just WATCHING the battle rather than trying to doing anything that can affect it.  Not feeling like you control a battle as a commander is a big no no for a strategy game.

For example, you have to control click to select multiple units instead of shift click, selecting multiple units is done by *drawing* a circle around them (what is this an iPad game?), rotating units is unnecessarily difficult as the direction for them to face does not snap to where your cursor is so you will end up spinning the direction box around a couple of times before you get it right.  The biggest thing for me is that there is no way to tell units to move to a certain position and face a certain direction - you have to tell them to move and then when they get there turn them around, why?  No idea but its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when you have 10+ units moving which you have to babysit because they will end up facing wherever the ♥♥♥♥ they want.The game could be fun but you will literally spend 99% of the gameplay fiddling with your units trying to get them to form a line.  Too bad Steam doesn't give refunds - horrible purchase. Great premise but awful execution.			"

												Defintaley NOT Sid Meiers Antietam or Gettysburg.  The unit cohesion is very similar as well as the over all appearance, but all similarities stop there.First there is no regimental command level.  You can not break up a brigade to send out a regiment of skirmishers.  which leads me to my second dissapointment.There is no way to change a units formation.  You can not put a unit into column, skirmishers, or refuse a line.  There are ""skirmishers"" within the game but they are stuck as such.What good are cavalry?  I understand the over all lack of fighting ability of cavalry against infantry, but seriously, some skirmishing power would be nice.  Also, if cavalry runs down a battery of guns guess who ends up running.  You certainly can not capture them.I am also not sure what the metrics are for flanking.  I had an enemy bridage flanked and fought them off when they charged yet they continued to hang around and be a nuisance when they should have been completely routed.  I know the rout is possible because I have had some of my own brigades break.Over all if you are looking for the second coming of the classic Sid Meiers then this is not it.  While it is 10x closer than the joke ""Total War"" series, it is to simple to be considered a serious replacement.  I might recommend it for $5, but not $15			"

												I loved Sid meiers Gettysburg when it came out. I also loved the light arcade styl game ""North and Souht"" for the Amiga500.When I saw Ultimate General Gettysburg, I thought it could become an true sequel to Sid meier Gettysburg, with all the great game elements I loved so much.But instead UGG is an huge step backwards, and cant compete to SMG  in any aspect. Cant Aim with artillerie, cant split up my brigades, cant change any formations--> NOTHING. Only Bulky Infanterieblobs  can be moved with one finger on the tablet, thats the  achievement this arcade style game got.UGG is an light arcadegame and more an sequel to ""north and souht"" rather  then an sequel to famous Sid meiers Gettysburg.

												This game just didn't click with me. It's an RTS and a relatively chaotic one. There is a frantic-ness in setting up your troops then there is a bunch of patience waiting for them to slowly act. This game has a bit going on under the hood but it is lost in the hecticness. AS a Civil War game it would've been much better as a TBS. I really love the old Civil War, Brigade (CWB) Series series and I feel this would make a great video game adaptation. I suffered through playing this, but after three hours I had no ""wow"" experiences. just ho-hum. 4/10			"

								It's basically a single battle scenario (I'm going to presume you can work out which battle) in which most combat is non-decisive. You wont be pulling a Victorian Caesar (Hammer and Anvil) here; rather you will be engaging the enemy, pushing them back a bit but not crushing their units. Breakthroughs don't occur in the video game sense, but rather in the realistic sense.The game also has a tendency to crash just when you're starting to feel proud of yourself, forcing you to completely restart the single battle scenario that you bought for £6.I personally don't like it, it's not punchy and decisive enough, but if you enjoy the Darthmod style of combat then I'd say you should pick this game up when it's £2.99 at most. If you're more into smashing your enemies as in vanilla Total War then you may as well skip this or buy it when it's £1.99 or less.			"

												This game is sucks. My units are runing away, even, if I trying to attack only the artillery lines with a lot of horseman and a huge infantry.On the easies level, at first I made a tactical retreat, and the attacker's infantry tried to hunt my infantry down. After I succesfull reach my secound defending line my reinforcements arrived and I was able to hold the line. But the attackers made a mistake: they are left his cannons deffendless behind, so I've made a tick, and I've sent 2500 men(500 horseman and 2000 simple infantry) and a commander(they were the fresh reinforcements) to destroy the artillery. After I caught them(i mean i've reached them) my entire attacker army simply just run away, and I realy don't know how, because before this happened they doesn't tried to shoot my attacker units. So maybe I'm a fool, but I'm sure, if 2500 man infantry and horseman fighting with 200 man artillery in a very close distance, the 2500 will win. Usually I'm using this tactic in the Total War games too, and I realy don't understand the difference.			"

												First, there is a bug where you cannot load a saved game, at least not an auto save game. This hasn't been fixed in almost a month. Something like this should be hot fixed and not require us to wait for a full patch. Second, various things in the game just don't make sense. I had 2,000 troops charge into one cannon unit of 100 men, and they didn't wipe it out. Literally 2,000 men surrounding an artillery unit and they don't wipe it out. They didn't even wipe out 10% of them. That makes no sense. Artillery caught out in the open by 2,000 men are just dead. There is no hail mary save for them. They are D-E-A-D. Not in this game though. I took more damage then they did. Makes no sense. It was at that point I stopped playing. I honestly have no idea why this game gets all these awesome reviews. It lacks basic common sense.			"

												First Impressions of this game were great. Everything looked so fluid on the battelfield, even the little lines indicating troop marching direction. The little sounds of trumpets and drums were cool too. I finished the first battle, ""hell yea"" I thought, ""I am the ultimate General"". The men celebrated our victory, proposing toasts to their heroic leader. ""To the next battle"" I declared. Upon loading the second battle I was rather confused... I had just fought this battlefield, why am I back here... after a momemnts confusion I went back to the main menu and reloaded the second battle. YET AGAIN SAME BATTLEFIELD.... 'Okay', I thought, '♥♥♥♥ this ill get one of my friends to buy it so we can play MP. Surely thats better'My friend fortunately bought the game and we commenced our first battle. I thought to myself that this would be an easy victory, considering I was the ultimate general, and he was but a mere plebian forced into command. He began by charging in his troops, all at the same time, up a hill towards me. HA, i thought, he does not truely understand how valuable it is to have the higher ground, and has no true understanding of flanking. ""FIRE"" I called to all my musketmen... there was a pause, ""FIRE GODDAMIT, FIRE"", he was getting closer... ""WHY WONT YOU FIRE YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S"", he was now almost in contact with all my muskets. Within a few meters of them interacting all my man began to flee. Wtf is going on, i thought to myself... how could this be... Not a single one of my troops faced the oncomming charge, but instead, fled for the lives. THIS MADE NO SENSE. Next battle, I have cav, charge cav, they run, everything runs, everyone is a ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game. I figured the way to win is to simply put all your troops on charge and charge right into the heart of the enemy, GG.tl;dr♥♥♥♥♥♥game, dont buy. If you do buy, tell one of your friends to buy it so you feel a little better for buying it yourself.			"

								Needs some work on tactical. Without this being done the game will remain a slugfest for it does not allow for the complete concept of battle, As it is at the moment, it has potential but that potential is either to be realised or not. If not, the game may be satisfying to most because they know really little of the complete concept of how battles are set up and how they are won. The generals at Gettysburg itself were not as knowledgeable in the concepts as they should have been. So, until it becomes a fully conceived game, meaning battle set up and how battles actually get won, then, if these mechanisms are not both part of the game then I cannot recommend the game.			"

												So the basic premis of the game is as this... csa is only good at charging nothing else.  The union army have better shooting moral and cannons. The game is highly unbalanced and even from a realism aspect confederate troops at this stage of the war were less likely to run in combat than their union counterparts. Far better shots and their cannon fire was still very effective. I watched 7 cannon batteries of 70+ unload point blank into a union formation and it only ticked 10 units off. Meanwhile. 1 union battery took out over 500 men from one unit with shell fire. I expected more from the creator of darthmod. If there was a way to get my money back I would take it. oh and yes i played the union side of it as well and the above comments remain true.			"

												This is my first review ever. written in anger. so there will be a lot of writing/grammar errors. live with it.now over to the game. it is... well.. nicely put, Sucky...  I had the computer on easy, flanked around with a unit, took out all his guns.   I  held the points on the map. I did flanking manuvers. one in front, two comming in at the  back sides. on every enemy  unit.   it should be shooting fish in a barrel. but noooo. he just stood there, took it all with minimum casualties.  took out 1/3 of my units. and retreated.  and then we did it all over again. I even tried to hold the high ground while flanking. same result. and my cannons ... ah.. yes. they did nothing,. one of his units stood for half the duration in the bombardment and he hardly noiced it when it came to casualties. when all was said and done. I ended up with a minor defeat, even tho i had managed to take out 1000 more troops than he had. and  held the points on the map that I was supposed to...if you like a game that is bloody unfair. or you somehow got some magic tactics brain that comes up with strategys don't involve flanking. then  go for it, its not very expencive. but  its not realy worth it, even if you are somekind of rainman with tactics.

												I bought this because it was cheap, and low on system requirements. I needed a TW fix, but couldnt stand the FPS drops I'd get, not to mention it total war being unplayable on my surface 3 pro. Well it delivers on that. While the graphics aren't spectacular, the art style is beautiful in its own right, and at 1080, the FPS counter was stuck at 60, even with massive armies on the screen. As for gameplay, I must say it's quite good. Took a bit of getting used to, but I learnt to appreciate it. The controls system isn't typical, but very intuitive. There are a few clunky issues with getting a proper formation with your units, but otherwise the controls are good.Mechanics seem simple. I am not a huge PCwargaming buff, so can't say how well it compares to TW deep under the surface, but it was very simple to pick up.Overall, it's worth a play. I would recommend it because I think the devs have done a fine job and reasonably priced, too.			"

												*Edited review at bottom due to new 1.6 patch*At first I wasn't sure what to expect.  I've grown up playing various games depicting this era of warfare, ranging from old Comadore 64 games, Amiga 500 games, etc etc.  Most of which focused purely on body count over tactics used, or went more of a goofy style (IE North and South).This game has quite a bit of focus on 'good ground', something you hear alot if you watch movies/read books on warfare from this era.  While moral/endurance/cover severely effects combat, both ranged and melee... ammo/supply is strangely not an issue.Battles are in stages, each step is based on a part of each day of the overall engagement.  You get to choose initial combat style (For instance if you are doing well on first day as union, you can decide to try to push rebels away vs hunker down), but the AI likes to severely change the flow of combat.There are 9 different types of computer AI, each having different types of combat styles, as well as a random option to basically give it a completely unexpected battle.  The AI feels alive, but makes mistakes much like a player would, something I enjoy greatly.While I would have loved to see supply/ammo be an issue, the game feels like a nice hybrid between a Total War game and something from the History Channel, making for a fun game.Iron Brigade, how I love thee.*New review:*Before the patch I found the confederates quite weak, and while I could win (the AI had it's weaknesses and didn't really push the way it should have) as that side it was obvious which side had the advantage.But now...I started up a new match, picked hardest difficulty and ran as the union.  I pulled back and consolidated my forces as usual, expecting the good old boys in grey to uselessly charge my lines.  But yet... they didn't.  I was flanked hard to the north, they took the ridge and put imediate pressure on me. I was both horrified and amazed that suddenly what was an easily predictable opponent now was finding all kinds of holes in my lines.  It was able to counter my army's movements, each step I found myself behind it's plans, making me losing the first battle where usually I won hands down.I applaud the devs for making a FAR stronger AI, almost so that I found myself horribly unable to fight effectively.  I took severe losses in that first fight, really pressing upon me what that first day must have felt like to the officers in charge, the utter hopelessness in the fight.Bravo, sirs/madams, bravo.  This is now by far my favorite strategy game.			"

												I have to admit I was quite surprised when I played this, it is pretty awesome. It feels like Total War but it is definitely its own and not a clone. Yes it is around one battle, and no you cannot do anything other than fight. Its AI is fantastic and learns quickly, you pick the style of how they play such as Determined to Cunning. I recommend this game whole heartedly to anyone who wants a fantastic RTS from the civil war. Great game!			"

												Have only a little time under my belt, but I was very impressed with my opening battle. Yes, it is a game around a single battle, but Gettysburg was fought over three days and there are plenty of scenarios available - and, of course, each can be played taking either side and with different AI levels. Overall, a lot of replayability. Control of units is straightforward in the extreme; my initial concern at the lack of an 'involved' tutorial soon put aside by the game's implementation of controls making it easy to assign orders to units (as long as you are choosing the correct orders yourself!). The map itself is a beauty. Very clear and with easy to discern features (supported by the ability to enable contours) it does the job of conveying the lay of the land without extraneous on screen data. There are things that could be improved, such as more support information within the game, but there is a direct link to the developer's website that I haven't explored yet. For the price, this is an excellent game, and well worth it for anyone with an interest in historical battles of the period.			"

												First of all i want to say that i really like the game,but there are still several bugs that make my troops (or the enemy's) shoot at locations where there are no targets, bugs that make a routing enemy unit run through my lines causing my troops to rout all at once, a bug that makes it impossible (or take way to long causing the timer to end the battle) to capture the last vp when playing as confederate even when all the union troops are pushed way back.But even despite these bugs I really enjoyed the game !

								Super fun game. There are some people who would look at the historical accuracy and realism but they're the weird kind of person that really offers nothing to the conversation.For an early access game its very stable, lots to do in the game. I haven't had any technical issues in my brief play time so far. The battlefield actually feels alive. You can hear the shouting of soldiers and the firing of cannons. I have high hopes for this given that it's not complete yet.			"

								I bought this as I am long looking for a decent civil war game and never found one to my taste since Peter Turcan's Gettysburg.  So I stumbled upon Ultimate General Gettysburg. Still in development but developers feel courageous enough to sell it to the public and to be either loved or hated for it. I wanted to give it a try. And I am not dissapointed.The game is not finished, still not so much on how you can position your troops. Setting up an attack or defense line is quite difficult now. It is not a general alike but more a corporal who maneuvres and positions his troops. But still can play some nice battles, more entertaining then simulation but enjoyable. The graphics and atmosphere of the game I do like a lot. The menu's are clearly still under development, they are functional - just that but will do the job.The game moves plays fluently.If this game concentrates a bit more on the tactics and you get more control on what your troops should do I think this game will be a winner. Cavalry should be able to mount, artillery should be able to carried by horses. It should also include something on supply lines, would be nice if you can cut them to troops will not be resuplied (now the troops have unlimited ammo). Some supply wagon trains would be nice.In all I think this game has a good start and I hope it will finish and be more complete for instance with the suggestionS I mentions and I am sure other players have similar and very different suggestions. For instance multiplayer options.You can see the online manual athttp://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/746-online-short-guide/It will give a good idea of what the game can do already.Highly recommended if you like (for now) RTS and civil war.

								Very enjoyable, the scope and depth of the game is greater than appears as the game contains numerous 'speculative' scenerios based on how you play and the outcome of each scenerio.A major selling point for the game is the AI, rather than simply adding easy, normal or hard, you have a variety of different AI behaviours to choose from, which closely ressemble human behaviour and play styles, thus making different scenerios completely different each time you play, essentially multiplying the replay value for each scenerio by 12 (the number of different AI styles available...I think?)Although in early access, this game is very stable and is updated regularly with a very active community and development team who are always on hand. This is also a great proce for an early access game as the quality of the game is great along with the amount of content within the game. Many other early access games cost much more and are of much worse quality.I recommend this game			"

								This game brings back so many memories of playing this historic battle on Sid Meier's Gettysburg.  Though modernized slightly and made better with some fluidity with the units it makes for an outstanding nostalgic experience.  The only thing that I can say is continue improving, because the foundation is here for a great and fantastic game.  I would love to see some Multiplayer aspects brought in, though I imagine they'll come sooner or later.Great thanks to the developer for bringing this thing back!			"

Early Access Review
								I would consider this to be one of the best purchases I have ever made on steam. Be warned as this game does have a few bugs, since it is still in early access after all. When I first bought it my graphics card was not supported by the game and after a few emails with the support team I could tell that they were willing to help me with my problem instead of giving me some cookie cutter awnser like some major games would. But in the newest update they added a new alternative renderer which allowed me to play the game. My first impression looking at was that everything from the menu to the small details on the map had a very comfortable feel to it. The gameplay itself has a few things that may need to be worked on just to bring the game to its full potential. Just a few of these may be a about face command. While it doesn't take much time to order your regiment to about face using movement commands, It still would be a more useful feature for those late game situations where timing can make or break a battle. Also I would love to point out the interested difficulty settings for the game. Instead of just Easy, Medium or Hard, You can choose how aggresive the AI is aswell. So you could have a Aggressive enemy with little idea about tactics or a brilliant tactician who rather defends than attack.To summarize that whole things+ Great graphics on menus and ingame+ Good variety of difficulty settings+ Good AI (Kinda expected from the creator DarthMod+ Helpful support team- Still has its bugs- Lack of important movement commands (About Face, Wheels, Formations)- Can be hard to select units at timesThings I would like to see in future- Other important battles from civil war era ( Yes i know that game is focused on Gettysburg but could be fun DLC for future)- Some form of Multiplayer ( Either Total War-esque with unit selection or Scenarion specific army compositions)- Make it easier for modders ( Nick Thomadis of all people should understand how important mods could be to the shelf life of a game)			"

								I'll keep this short and sweet: If you played Sid Meier's Gettysburg! and are as bummed out as I am that it doesn't run on modern operating systems, buy this game, It feels like the true spiritual successor that title always deserved. At the moment it still lacks some of the more in depth orders and functions of Gettysburg! but as it is still in early access, I have hope that some day we will be able to issue orders for our artillery to limber/unlimber, so they can move a little bit faster when there are enemy troops bearing down on them at double-quick speed.

There are a couple of areas that could be fixed,  moving troops is a little clunky, there is no way to just turn your troops without moving them forward, and the artillery is a little confusing about what targets they are firing at.

								I've played this game for the last three days or so and I love it. It's a fairly simple game, and I hope some improvements are made, but this is a great ideological successor to Sid Meier's Gettysburg! SMG! was one of my favorite games growing up, and I've sorely missed being able to play it. UGG builds upon SMG, adding specific elements (like choosing your battle strategy) that SMG lacked. Both the graphics and gameplay are fairly simple, but that doesn't take away from the addictiveness of the game. The concepts are very easy to grasp so you can dive right into the game without dealing with a steep learning curve. I do hope the developers add some more features, but I'm hooked so far. Great deal at $10.			"

 So I bought this game on sale knowing little more than the fact it was made by former DarthMod-maker, Darth.  At the time, I  didn't  know it was a half-hearted port from a mobile game developed for touch screens. While it plays better than almost any other strategy game out there  V.S. AI , the original format really limits the gameplay and UI, relative to true PC titles. Pros + Difficulty settings never affect damage, morale, etc. The game is always fair, the only change is the AI.+ The AI is extremely well made, and extremely tough to beat. It's almost like facing another player.+ The game relies much more on proper tactics (flanking, pinning down, etc.) than ""rock paper scissor"" 'tactics' (attack X with Y to win).+ The graphics are simple and clean.+ The audio, overall immersion, and historical accuracy is great. Cons - The UI/HUD is extremely limited due to the touch-screen style.- Basic info on the battlefield is lacking. You can't see where and how your troops will deploy at their destination, or a list of your units, or a minimap, for instance.- Your troops tend to act on their own in every situation you don't want them to, and sit idly by when you do. They'll abort a charge half way through, and turn towards an enemy when you want them in an orderly line, yet they often won't return fire. Coupled with the poor UI and no minimap, you often find your units halted halfway across the map when you expected them to act as reinforcements.- The simplistic graphics are too simple, and units can walk straight over houses. Conclusion Save your money and buy this game for its intended mobile platform instead. Unless you own an Apple product that is. Apple went full on SJW and banned all games with the CSA in them. So if that's the case, I guess buy it on steam.			"

												I really like this game since it's different from the other RTS strategy games I played where in this you control whole regiments. The map is very well done and realistic you almost can't tell that the objects like building and trees are drawn in but can still be counted and available as cover. People now have been brainwashed and swept up to now believe more now than ever that the CSA flag stands for something that the South wasn't about in a sickening political agenda.

It doesn't offer not much variation in type of troops or terrain, but has several elements that make a great flow of gameplay:A dynamic campaign, so that not ever two battles (lasting up to 4 days) will evolve the same.It's even dynamic that losses and unit positions carry over from map to map.And the units are able to do fairly intelligent things themselves, so you don't have to micro manage.

 So I bought this game on sale knowing little more than the fact it was made by former DarthMod-maker, Darth.  At the time, I  didn't  know it was a half-hearted port from a mobile game developed for touch screens. While it plays better than almost any other strategy game out there  V.S. AI , the original format really limits the gameplay and UI, relative to true PC titles. Pros + Difficulty settings never affect damage, morale, etc. The game is always fair, the only change is the AI.+ The AI is extremely well made, and extremely tough to beat. It's almost like facing another player.+ The game relies much more on proper tactics (flanking, pinning down, etc.) than ""rock paper scissor"" 'tactics' (attack X with Y to win).+ The graphics are simple and clean.+ The audio, overall immersion, and historical accuracy is great. Cons - The UI/HUD is extremely limited due to the touch-screen style.- Basic info on the battlefield is lacking. You can't see where and how your troops will deploy at their destination, or a list of your units, or a minimap, for instance.- Your troops tend to act on their own in every situation you don't want them to, and sit idly by when you do. They'll abort a charge half way through, and turn towards an enemy when you want them in an orderly line, yet they often won't return fire. Coupled with the poor UI and no minimap, you often find your units halted halfway across the map when you expected them to act as reinforcements.- The simplistic graphics are too simple, and units can walk straight over houses. Conclusion Save your money and buy this game for its intended mobile platform instead. Unless you own an Apple product that is. Apple went full on SJW and banned all games with the CSA in them. So if that's the case, I guess buy it on steam.			"

												This game is suprisingly fun and replayable. It is well balanced and interesting. I'd love to see this game develop into all the major battles, or even a continuing campaing across the entire war. Victories and defeats influence the next battle. Worth buying!			"

												I really like this game since it's different from the other RTS strategy games I played where in this you control whole regiments. The map is very well done and realistic you almost can't tell that the objects like building and trees are drawn in but can still be counted and available as cover. People now have been brainwashed and swept up to now believe more now than ever that the CSA flag stands for something that the South wasn't about in a sickening political agenda. If I could I would buy this game again.			"

It doesn't offer not much variation in type of troops or terrain, but has several elements that make a great flow of gameplay:A dynamic campaign, so that not ever two battles (lasting up to 4 days) will evolve the same.It's even dynamic that losses and unit positions carry over from map to map.And the units are able to do fairly intelligent things themselves, so you don't have to micro manage.

												This game gets right down into it. Constant motion on the battlefield forces you to change your plan every few minutes. Elevation, morale, and cover play huge roles! If you charge hoping that superior numbers will make you win you are mistaken.        I'm glad this game will continue to sell because it is extremely historically accurate and fun.

												It is great to see games like this thriving in 2015.  If you ever played Take Command: 2nd Manassas or other Civil War-themed games, you will enjoy playing Ultimate General: Gettysburg.Not only you can lead either of the sides in the battle of Gettysburg, but you can also pick the course of action for the next battle - e.g. try to push on the enemy or wait for reinforcements.The interface is easy to follow, and you will be met with video tutorials on how to move your troops and artillery.The graphics are simple and light on the eyes.Among the drawbacks of this game I would add a fairly simple gameplay, given that the game is designed for multi-platform use. Plus it is dedicated to only one episode of the Civil War, giving it a mission-oriented feeling, rather than extensive campaign games like ones made by AGEod or Paradox. Given the fact that many of the civil war-themed games are either too old or too obscure today, Ultimate General: Gettysburg is a fresh take on one of the most favorite canons in historical wargaming.I definitely recommend this game.

												I like the fact that units have been consolidated into brigades.  This eases play as there are no hundreds of regiments on the map.  The command functions for the corps commanders needs work.  It is not easy to group and ungroup units.  It would also be helpful for more random scenarios.  I do think that some scenarios in the game rely too much on 1st and 11th Corps units.  These units are damaged badly by the third or fourth battle.  Overall I love the game.  Please take the time to make a Antietam version, Shiloh version, Chickamauga version, ect.			"

												I am an enthusiast of History, and in particular, the Civil War. Having read hundreds of first-hand accounts of Civil War experiences, from citizens to private soldiers to officers of various rank, including those involved in the battle of Gettysburg, and the memoirs of various Generals (including Grant, Longstreet, Sherman, Sheridan, etc), I have to say, I think this game really captures the feeling of the era.  I only wish they would build a much larger game to include other battles (Mannassas 1&2, Antietam and/or Shiloh would be nice), or a strategic game to include whole regions (such as Northern Virginia, Vicksburg Campaign, Atlanta, etc). I highly recommend this game to anyone with an interest in history and military warfare.			"

												Bought this game during the summer sale i think it was 7.99 and it looked interesting. I'm really impressed by the AI. they have a huge selection of different types of AI. Ranging from very cautious to aggressive and easy to hard in a X,Y axis. So you have a total of 9 different types of strategies the AI can use.The game plays out in different missions taking place during each day at Gettysburg. The troop numbers you have carry over, so if you make a bad mistake early on it could become an issue later. You also get to choose how you want to attack or defend depending on who you are playing as. All these things add up to make each game you play very different from the last. I have only played the campaign so i do not know how the multiplayer is.I would buy it again if it was not on sale worth way more than what i paid for it. Only downside in my opinion is not enough achievements. They give a bit more fun to the replays.			"

												This game is great, its looks simple on the surface but it is surprisingly complex.The game revolves around the battle of Gettysburg which was a major battle, and some say the turning point of the civil war. The map is detailed and true to life map of Gettysburg PA. The whole game consists of this one battle which covers four days. If you have ever read in depth about Gettysburg or the civil war you will immediately recognize all you commanders as they are the real commanders from the battle. The objectives you need to capture are the real strategic points from the actual battle.			"

Ill make my review short and simple.PROS:1) Good graphics-for what they are2)Easy controls3)Lets you choose different options in the battle to chnge the scenario.CON:1) Only con I have is that your units retreat way too fast, ill have a unit of 1450 men against a unit of 1200, and after my men drop to 1150, my men turn their backs and retreat(even if i tell them to HOLD) It gets very frustrating.So overall...ill have to hit the recommend button just because this game has too much positive that one negative shouldnt make you not want to try it.

												An overall excellent ""single battle, multiple scenario"" war game, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys games of this genre.  See below for Pros/Cons.Pros:1. Unit morale (courage) and equipment (condition), combined with health (troop number in a single unit) combine to make individual unit strengths and weaknesses interesting.  (As opposed to a single health and damage option.)2. 3 types of units, infantry, cavalry, & artillery, along with differing ammo types for artillery, combine with (1) to further increase ""simplistic diversity.""3. Map elevation, cover (in the form of trees and buildings), provide for strategic planning of the individual scenarios (days) of the battle.4. Different scenarios, outside of the historical ones, are available for both sides of the overall ""battle"" depending on how well you do.Cons:1. The bottom of the visible map isn't completely viewable.  As such, especially when playing as the CSA (Confederacy), the AI Union will run troops ""underneath"" my units when they are cornered.2. The controls take some getting used to, as they are made for touchscreen compatibility vs. ""only mouse/keyboard use.""  However, they are quite logical and easy to use once you get the hang of it.3. Unbalanced multiplayer scenarios, especially when playing the original campaign ones.  (As the historical battle was ""unfair"" to different sides on different days.)Overall, the game easily fits my personal rule of ""pay a $1, get an enjoyable hour of play from the game"" rule.			"

												Game plays very smoothly and has no glitching that I have found (unlike many other civil war games). I like the moral feature where troops will break and run, but more times than not, they will reform - which I think is more realistic as civil war battles were a rolling and moving affair. It is also pretty neat how your decisions and actions in one battle will affect the next one. Only issues I have seen in the game are some historical accuracy ones. For example, the other day I was playing multiplayer seminary ridge (i.e. July 1st) with my friend who was Confederate and he had a huge contingent of cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart even though Stuart had in reality gotten lost off to the east and was not present on July 1st. I would also like to see the game incorporate cooperative play like Scourge of War has rather than just 1v1 multiplayer.			"

												I'm not normally into the civil war setting and this is the first civil war era strategy game I've played, but boy it is a lot of fun. The store page claims the AI is pretty smart, and it is. Perhaps not perfect, but it beats anything from the total war series by a very long shot. The AI opponents put up a good fight and once you get used to your unit AI's idiosyncrasies you can rely on them to mostly behave responsibly without too much micromanagement, something that is very rare among strategy games (note that your units will start falling back on their own when they hit 0% condition though, AFAIK that is a game mechanic and not their fault as AI). As well the campaign mode is fluid and interesting.If you are into strategy games like total war or tactical war games this is highly recommended.			"

There are some people who would look at the historical accuracy and realism but they're the weird kind of person that really offers nothing to the conversation.For an early access game its very stable, lots to do in the game. I haven't had any technical issues in my brief play time so far. The battlefield actually feels alive. You can hear the shouting of soldiers and the firing of cannons.

Early Access Review
								Oct. 4th update - Based on the rapid updates and active development of this title, I'm officially switching my recommendation. The latest update still leaves a few things to be desired, but it's quite clear that the developers are passionate about this game and receptive to feedback from it's users.Still needs fixed:-need for the tweaking of unit casualty rates from incoming fire, seems to be based more on discrete appoximation than statistical physics. i.e.-skirmishers should recieve fewer casualties due to dispersed and often kneeling and/or prone unit formations, mounted cavalry should recieve higher casualties due to the horse/rider combo equaling a significantly larger target, etc.-3D terrain view still not very effective, I'd recommend grayscale colored topography with white being higher in altitude.-melee combat casualty rates still need to be higher, units entering a melee after the two or more original units don't seem to modify the outcome significantly, and melee units that break and run should take a discrete loss as they break and run and then be highly supsceptible to faster moving units, like calvary.-units firing into a melee should add casualties to all units in said meleeOLDER COMMENTS, MIGHT BE OUTDATED AS OF LATEST RELEASE - I don't recommend this game yet.  It's virtually unplayable as is, despite the fact it's an early release title.  STILL NEEDS MAJOR WORK to come remotely close to a civil war strategy game.Negatives:-Melee combat does little to nothing in terms of casualties, but simply displace units including artillery, making charging largely worthless-As such, artillery are way overpowered and can be left in giant groups on the field and decimate units trying to charge them with little casualties if they are actually overrun-line of sight is very difficult to determine before a unit is actually moved to said location, very important with determining artillery location ahead of time-the terrain is very difficuly to determine what is elevated and depressed half of the time due to poor topographic marking-unit AI regularly disregards your orders immediately after it's assigned-units manuevering is very clunky, including where units often try to wheel completely around rather than just a simple about face-skirmishers and calvary often require lots of micromanagement due to their ""wiggling"" all over the field of battle-unit casualties do not seem realisticly based, and are far too light when units are very close in proximity and far too high when units are in maximum coverPositives:-Computer AI is very well done, and can be very challenging and tricky-units grouping is intuitive and simple, easy to manage large groups of units in real timeAll told, I'd much rather play either of the old Sid Meier's Civial War titles from 15 years ago, considering the graphics are nearly identical, the gameplay is orders of magnitude more solid, and at no point do I want to flip my desk over in frustration, leading from the fact that everything in the old titles tends to make intuitive sense, i.e. 3000 muskets firing at 1000 guys in open ground at close range means decimation, not an occasional casualty here or there, regardless of enfilade fire or not.

								This is one of the best Civil War games I've seen in a long time. I was always a fan of Sid Meier's Gettysburg! game, but in a few years it probably won't be compatible with newer operating systems. So I was pretty excited when I saw this game. It has a simple interface and the controls are easy as well. The graphics are good, looks just like the photos, and the fact that the terrain actually plays a role in the battle is also nice a effect. This game's strong point is the A.I. though. There are around 9 different settings, each more daring and harder than the last. The game is fast enough so battles won't last hours on end, but not so fast that the battle is over before it starts. *There are a few bugs\problems as of this review, namely that morale, at least for the Union, drops almost too quickly and I noticed some unit's don't fire at the enemy. I'm not sure if it's a bug, but it is annoying. The game seems to get updated quickly though. Overall, it's a great buy. Two thumbs up!*These bugs seem to have been fixed. Unlike my previous games, the Union army held firm and didn't retreat after the first couple of shots. The units not firing also seems to have fixed, if it was a bug to begin with.			"

								It's a good game.  It is limited in scope to specific decisions made at Gettysburg, and not all of the choices make sense according to the fight you just had.  When I was a kid, I played a game called Shiloh. Was very simple, but was a first command strategy game.  I played everything from Sid, and did my time with the 'Take Command' Series.  I messed with Aegod, and followed the failed release of War between the States.  I played 'The Blue and the Grey"".  This engine has the potential to fill the void.  A kind of ""Railroad Tycoon meets Total War"" kind of thing.  I can only hope that the idea moves along to a full war campaign.  How awesome would a zoom out map be, where manouvers take precedence over army strength, and supply lines are key?  This is not that game, but is a strong battle engine with a pretty map that can keep you entertained for a bit.  Just looking for more.  Worth the money to support the designer.			"

Early Access Review
								Ultimate General Gettysburg, is a large scale American Civil War strategy game. I hesitate to use the term RTS as many of the usual tropes associated with them, such as basebuilding, and diplomacy are noticeably vacant. Instead the game focuses on a well built and historically accurate ORBAT, with persistent troops throughout the campaign. For Example if the Unions Iron Brigade had single handedly held Devils den against a full division of confederates, and lost most of its men. Then in your next battle they will be just as weak and quite likely exhausted and low on morale.   This gives a feeling of importance to each and every brigade you have, and infact I personally found myself favoring certain brigades, or even hating some (Damnit Baxter! Your supposed to hold Devils den! Why did you advance!?!?). You see, each unit has its own AI Commander who will make choices on their own unless told not too. This includes retreating and advancing to some degree, but mostly focuses on shifting their flanks to face the enemy proper. More than once, a Brigadier Generals advance or retreat has completely changed the way the battle plays, and what was initially my biggest issue with the game has now become one of its strengths.   Its not just the individual AI either, ingame the enemy AI itself is brilliant, coordinating attacks on certain positions. If your playing as the union, the second battle of day one is going to be a difficult one, as the AI completely outmaneuvers you. (I'll avoid spoilers here).  Now, despite all of this, the actual ingame UI and gameplay is shockingly simple. Its drag and release the mouse. Thats it, ocassionaly you might rotate a units facing, or check the heights of hills with the terrain map. But these are still incredibly simple things to do.  There are a few flaws with the game, the brilliant AI sometimes wants to misbehave, and doesn't always take risks. IE: In the last battle of the confederate campaign, the union soldiers outnumbered me by 9000 men, they were exhausted however and the AI decided to let them rest. By the time they had recovered, the battle was nearly over and they didn't have time to push the Victory Point. Small issues like this exist, but for the most part the game is amazingly polished, infact it feels more finished than many games I've played that aren't in early access.   In conclusion, I gotta say, if you like strategy games and like games with muskets in them, this is the game to buy. Don't hesitate, this price point and the replayability (I've completed the campaign 8 times now)  means it is a must have in your library.			"

								I've played this game for the last three days or so and I love it. It's a fairly simple game, and I hope some improvements are made, but this is a great ideological successor to Sid Meier's Gettysburg! SMG! was one of my favorite games growing up, and I've sorely missed being able to play it. UGG builds upon SMG, adding specific elements (like choosing your battle strategy) that SMG lacked. Both the graphics and gameplay are fairly simple, but that doesn't take away from the addictiveness of the game. The concepts are very easy to grasp so you can dive right into the game without dealing with a steep learning curve. I do hope the developers add some more features, but I'm hooked so far. Great deal at $10.			"

At the moment it still lacks some of the more in depth orders and functions of Gettysburg! but as it is still in early access, I have hope that some day we will be able to issue orders for our artillery to limber/unlimber, so they can move a little bit faster when there are enemy troops bearing down on them at double-quick speed.

												I have always loved strategy and tactical games, more turn based rather than RTS but this game brings me closer back to the RTS fold.  I really like this game, especially in multiplayer battles.Good things about this game:If you like civil war era type games or napoleonic type combats this game will likely appeal to you.  The map is beautifully crafted and you can see vast amounts of soldiers moving around following your orders or littering the battlefield with their corpses.   All orders given are represented on the game map in the form of movement arrows  and in true civil war combat style positioning of your units, using cover and taking advantage of the high ground are an essential part of your strategy.The game also only costs $15 and if you don't like multiplayer it's a fun single player experience.Bad things about this game:The multiplayer match finding interface is bad.  Finding games can be difficult without having one of your steam friends join.  I have added some players that I did manage to play against and can now play these guys when available however.You can setup your own multiplayer game which then allows others in the game lobby to connect to you but there usually aren't many people waiting there so you have to hope that someone will eventually join you.That's it - the multiplayer match finder sucks but the game is good.

But in seriousness, it's lacking some things, especially in the settings department.Overall, the game is enjoyable, though a bit lacking when it comes to content. The gameplay is interesting. The movement system is rather unique, and shows it's mobile origins, but it actually works. Basically, you select a unit and then click and drag a path you want them to follow. I think a PC re-release, rather than just a port, could vastly improve the game. As it stands now, I give it a recommendation.			"

								It has a lot of potential. They need to add the ability to toggle formations and directions the unit faces. That's the only thing keeping this game back from being one of my favorite RTS games. So much nostalgia from the old Sid Meier games. Excellent AI, Art Style, Sound effects, etc.So, I'll ""recommend"" this under the assumption the game will improve as funds come in. It's right on the cusp of being an excellent game, right now it feels like a promising prototype. It's missing some basic RTS commands that just HAVE to be in the players hands for the game to play right. PLEASE ADD: Co-op - each player controls a general and their men.                       VS. - self explained.                      Formations - Where my units face and how they align themselves (same thing while travelling)                      Limber/Unlimber Arty - This will speed up arty deployment and make it more realistic.                      Ability to select more than one unit.It's so close to being the perfect reincarnation of Sid Meier's Gettysberg. That is the greatest compliment you could give this game. My fear is that this game will try to be ""accessable"" for everyone who wants to play an RTS game, and it will only alienate the fans that would keep this game alive for months and years after its release.

												Excellent mini-wargame made by the creator of DarthMod. I've only completed a single campaign against the Balanced AI, but I enjoyed it immensely. It reminds me of the old Close Combat games, in all the best ways, only more grand scale.I love that the campaign follows different engagements throughout the entire battle, forming a narrative that teaches the player about the actual battle. The US Civil War was one of the last wars where line battles were still the order of battle, and this game represents them very well, with fluid battle lines and artillery breaking formations up.The AI is very good, able to respond to your movement and fire, all while finding ways to exploit weaknesses in your line. The rules of the game (reload times, morale, stamina) are basic and make sense. I like the simple, but effective art style. It has lots of personality and detail, while having very low system requirements. The units perhaps could use a few more frames of animation, but that's unimportant in the end as it's only eye candy.My main complaint would be the difficulty of determining terrain height, which is helped by using the elevation toggle button. I only learned about it after I had already completed the campaign. I suppose it's a necessary feature with any 2D engine, so I don't see it being a big drawback.Overall, I highly recommend UG:Gettysburg to all wargame fans, and to anyone who is tired of the terrible AI Total War games have gotten over the past few releases. This is the work of the Nick ""DarthMod"" Thomadis after all, who fixed so many of CA's  broken releases. I'm glad to see his game is as great as it is. I'm looking forward to the Antietam sequel!

												A very tentative ""Would recommend"", but with caveats!I debated whether to buy this game during a recent Steam promotion and the deciding factor was a recommendation with the comment ""If you loved Sid Meir's Gettysbury, you'll love this"" - well being as I was actually having a quick look on Steam to see if Sid Meir's version was here I dived in, only to be disappointed. Pros:* Beautiful map* Easy to use control system, I like the click and drag for route selectionCons:* Lack of ability to provide granular enough commands, (need company level)* Lack of ability to control formation, (line, Double line, Skirmish, Column)* Graphic image of the troops doesn't appear to be entirely in sync with their actual location, line can be facing one  direction but when you try to reposition the controls imply its facing the direction you wanted in the first place.* Artillery can't be instructed to concentrate on other artillery / troops. Also in the time I played the much trumpeted AI wasn't apparent, the enemy did some odd things that made my victory so much easier, it never once surprised me.Based on the patch notes I'm under the impression that they are still working on this game, so I still have hopes that the problems will be rectified in later version, I'll keep my eye on it and any future titles.On the whole I would say, if you are looking for a simple and quick strategy game then jump in, the price is right with this one. But if you are looking for an updated version of Sid Meir's Gettysburg then this is not for you.Heading back to Sid Meir's version on my Win 98 virtual machine, I would honestly recommend that the developers do the same and then update this with the features we have in a game 20 years older.

												An interesting and fun game that keeps you pinned to your seat for hours. A very cunning AI makes this a challenge and finding the right strategy to achieve the objectives gives this game a re-play-ability factor. Good graphics rather than steller but good enough find the game at hand. Sound is good and gives atmosphere to the game.Overall I would recommend to the average and pro strategy gamer alike and I'm pleased to have it in my library.			"

												Well where to start. In an ideal world the opposing armies would be slightly more realistic. First thing ive noticed is that the Confederate Army troops withstand very little incoming fire before retreating and i also noiced they retreat alot further than union troops. When in actual fact the Confederate Army could withstand more fire power than the union army due to inspiring leaders which the union army lacked. The reason i bring this up firstly is due to the fact that the game clearly states that the Confederate Army can withstand more than the union army. This is seriously not the case which is disappointing. I expect to have a fair chance at the game, on all by three of the AI settings its tough going but on three you cant actually win, ive tried and tried.Also ive noticed on both union and Conderate army Arty that sometimes they randomally stop firing and refuse to fire no matter what the situation of reload , moral or condition is. Other than that the game is pretty good and can be entertaining, however given the fact that there is only one mission as the game name says it does lack replayability after several attempts for the faint at heart			"

												Ultimate General has three unique things going for it that makes it worth buying:1. The arrow movement system - a revolution of RTS and something that allows many fast unit instructions to be made2. The AI - actually challenging. your units and the enemy mostly move in intended directions to meet challenges3. Outcome of battles changes the ""campaign"" - makes multiple play through's funIt took me 3 hours to beat the battle on moderate difficulty. Im looking forward to trying again!My advice: buy this game. If you like the total war series, you may recognise the developer who made the darth mods for many TW games.Cant wait for more releases!

												Good concept and ideas, however unresponsive units take away from the experience. Expect mild frustration from time to time. The ability to map out your unit's exact movements is a brilliant new idea, and will hopefully change future RTS games. While I enjoyed the game overall, I found the most difficult part being that I had to constantly check up on my units after giving an order. (I'd give an order to move over flat terrain, and they would often stop in the middle for no reason, or infantry will sit there and got shot at without returning fire, despite what is advertised) Overall good game, though. Recommend, but with some caution.			"

												This is a really neat little wargame.  It's essentially an RTS, but with a more relaxed pace than most.  Mechanically, the battles are much like those in the Total War series.  Since it's just covering one three-day battle at Gettysburg, you might think that there's only one map, but it's more like 30 overlapping maps, and each scenario uses one.  You have a limited amount of time to take certain victory points, and are often required to hold other points you already occupy.  When time's up, the game lets you know that everyone is out of ammo and needs to take a break, and you're provided with an assessment based on casualty statistics and victory objectives.  Although you will receive reinforcements at scripted intervals, casualties carry over from one scenario to the next, lending weight to each risky decision you make.You can play as either the Union or the Confederacy.  The Union has weaker officers (poor soldier morale) but much more disciplined troops (better rate of fire) and better artillery pieces.  The Confederate troops are enthusiastic but not well trained, and as such, they fare much better in the visceral immediacy of melee combat than in the smoke-choked dread of a sustained engagement at range.  If you're Confederates, charge the enemy.  If you're the Union, skirmish, bombard, and ambush.The AI seems to really earn its victories rather than cheat for them.  There are nine to choose from, arranged in a 3x3 grid with difficulty on one axis, and aggressiveness on the other.  ""Determined"" is in the upper right, and is formidable.  ""Cautious"" is on the lower left, and it mostly turtles to defend, and attacks in massed formations under artillery support, flanking when possible.  That's actually not a bad approach, generally speaking, but the Cautious AI panics easily when taking casualties, and that can be exploited with a vicious counterattack.When playing, don't be afraid to pause the game and click through your units to check on them.  You only see stats for the currently-selected unit, and it's vital to ensure that their degree of cover is roughly what you expect it to be, that they're not physically exhausted, and that their morale is holding.  Unaware of their poor condition, I sent a group of soldiers on a surprise downhill bayonet charge that would have been wildly successful if they'd been up to it, but they ended up routing so badly that I lost the whole unit permanently.  If I’d kept them hidden, they could have rested safely and charged the next threat.Some general tips: Don’t force the men to run too much.  Move mounted officers near demoralized troops.  Press M to turn on relief lines, to get a better sense of the elevation of the terrain, and seize high ground.  Check a unit’s line of sight to see who threatens it; this game does not allow indirect fire, so if you can’t see it, it can’t hurt you.  Place units at the top of the downslope of hills, not the peak, to ensure line of sight.  Don’t micromanage the artillery ammo type unless you’re really going to watch it; you want those guys switching to canister shot if they get charged.Just prior to writing this review, I was playing a scenario where I was a little bogged down.  There was a fairly long but ragged battle line, broken up by hills and forest.  The Union had some artillery on a hill, and most of my men were reloading in cover and firing at the approaching Union forces opportunistically.  Much as I wanted to charge my men right at them, it would mean crossing open terrain and taking losses from the artillery.  To the north of this, I had a fairly strong infantry brigade and a unit of skirmishers holding a victory location against a rather pathetic Union attack.  Just then, my artillery finished moving into range of those weaklings and opened fire, causing them to scatter.  Precariously leaving that artillery piece to fend for itself, I abandoned the northern victory point.  I sent the skirmishers straight south, recklessly charging the Union artillery pinning my southern forces, while the strong infantry brigade moved around to flank.  When they turned to face my skirmishers, my southern forces broke out of cover, shattering the Union advance and routing their troops.  My skirmishers and strong infantry brigade annihilated the Union artillery and fell upon the fleeing bluecoats.  The battle had been pretty even up to that point, but it ended with 3500 union casualties, while I lost less than 2000 men.  The way the whole thing turned on one quick maneuver was immensely rewarding, and I look forward to pulling it off on a harder AI.			"

												Such potential, if this were the battle sim basis for a campaign covering the entire civil war it would have no equal out there.  The battle itself is fun but it is only one battle ""Gettysburg"" done in parts and thus no matter how you slice it has very limited replay value.  Again I repeat it has the potential of being a part of a larger strategic game where players could run the civil war and fight out the battles using this sim.  I hope it can be done it would be glorious!			"

												A RTS that really works. The pause makes it much better but I find that I rarly use it. It's slow enoght and small enough to keep on top of the action. I don't much like the victory point set up. It makes it feel like a capture the flag game. The first time I played it I had the Union army surrounded and almost wiped out when I ran out of time but because I didn't take the victory points I lost the battle and started the next battle almost from where I started the last fight. I wish they had more battles.All in all, a very long but satisfying game.			"

												At this point of the game (1.3 upgrade) I think I can say it's some the best in the strategy part of the pc games world.The game is about the famous Gettysburg battle of the American civil war. The batlle is played in a row of small parts in 3 days. That's something like 4 or 6 battles for a complete campaign (or complete Gettysburg battle).Every decision that you have made in a battle counts for the next one. Units losses, the ennemies that you have killed, the important spots in the battlefield that you have captured (they are represented by victory points). Sometimes thanks to your bad or good results in the previous encounter you may be presented by three options for the next phase, sometimes you have no choices at all.The battle management is at the same time extremely easy (brigades/small skirmishers and cavalry units/gun batteries and corps commanders) and complete (arrows for units movement, orders, the terrain really counts for something)...so it's a game easy to deal with and with a lot or replay value (stand alone scenarios, multiplayer).The devs are still interested to improve the game, even months after the release.

												Really solid game.  Well thought out and has great attention to details and AI.  Great value.  Impressive replayability.This game stands on it's own, but I do think that there are a couple other games that it deserves (favorable) comparison to.  First would be and old game; Sid Meier's Gettysburg.  Obviously the battlefield here is the same, but some of the 'campaign' and unit movement mechanics appear to be an homage to this old classic as well.  Second would be the Total War franchise; the battle map mechanics in particular.  Facing, terrain, morale and other battle mechanics are modeled nicely.  The level of visual detail is not as 'Hollywood' as recent Total War titles, but the game looks great and the units look realistic as they move and shoot.  It's very satisfying to pick a good position and hold it against greater numbers!Would definately recomend buying and I hope that there are more games from these creators in the future.			"

								This is a fun game HOWEVER :  It is ONLY the battle of gettysburg. With that said there are quite a few different results and days to the battle of gettysburg. Each day determines what happens on the next.This game locks up ALOT on me and I often do not finish the third day. That is the honest truth of it all - however if you are a civil war buff, it is well worth the trouble to watch the battle unfold!			"

												As a reenactor and amateur historian, I was very dubious when I saw the early version of this game, which would have been around mid-2014, I think. That Christmas, it was on sale, and it had been overhauled so successfully that I didn't even realize that I was looking at the same game. If you are into American Civil War (ACW) RTSs, this is a good game for you. There are, IMO, a few small kinks to be worked out, but I was very pleasently surprised by how much I enjoyed the game. Once again, Darth Vader (aka Nick Thomadis) impresses. Keep up the great work!- Tangentially, I hope that versions of this game (DLC?) come out for other battles of the ACW. There are so many good ones! You could go in the direction I've been urging NorbSoftDev to go with Scourge of War; there's Chancellorsville, The Wilderness, the Manassases, Shiloh, Chickamauga, the list goes on. These battles would all make great games. Fluid battles should be the ones concentrated on, certainly not assaults on fortified positions (e.g. Cold Harbor), as fluid battles would be more engaging for the players. Aside from the Civil War, this engine would be great for moddeling battles of the Revolution, War of 1812, the Napoleonic Wars, the Mexican-American War, and the various wars contributing to the rise of the German Empire.- Constructive Criticism and Suggestions (c. Jan 2015):1) ""Hold ground"". It seems that units holding their ground either lose range on their weapons or are unresponsive to enemy threats; I have to manually tell units to attack a target, taking them out of Hold Gound stance (does it even do anything?). Corollarily, Sid Meier's Gettysburg/Antietam had a similar feature that, when used, units would actually use nearby resources to build fences and makeshift breastworks, but could not change their facing.2) Altitude perception. The topo map is an invaluable feature in this game. However, if it were not for that, and my own knowledge of the ground at Gettysburg, I would have a very hard time judging the battlefield's topography. Perhaps something can be done to make altitude more easily distinguishable?3) Unit formations and relative space. While the current formations are acceptable, it would be better if each unit took up a relative amount of space based on it's numbers and, possibly, a formation which the player tells it to assume (see 4). Additionally, it would be great if the soldiers in the brigade were split into smaller formations representing the actual number of battalions present in that brigade at the battle. It would not even be necesary to divide the number of soldiers in the brigade proportionally into battalions; even division would be fine. This effect could be purely aesthetic yet add more realism to the game. As it is, each brigade is portrayed, effectively, as a single battalion.4) Formations. It would be really cool if the player could choose from more than one formation for their brigades to assume. Column could allow faster movement at the expense of lacking firepower; Single Line would take up more space and be vulnerable to melee engagement, but allow an individual brigade to bring all of its guns to bear; Double Line would take up less space and allow the player an easy way to make a defense in depth, at the expense of the firepower of the rear-line battalions; and Assult Column could limit a brigade's firepower to the front regiment and be extremely vulnerable to rifle and artillery fire, but allow it to act as a battering ram of bayonets. These are just some basic formations that probably wouldn't be too difficult to work in and would add a new tactical element to the game.5) Uniform variation. It would be great if there was more than just a generic blue/grey unit model for each side. For instance, some Zouave uniforms would be nice, green uniforms for the US sharpshooters, and more butternut for the Confederates.6) Hording (?) There is a term for what I mean when I say that; when units stack on top of one another and fire over/though one another. A pretty classic RTS problem from which UGG does not appear to be exempt.7) Weapons and unit characteristics. To simply say that Confederate troops have better morale and officers, but Union troops have better equipment and training, is extremely generic and over generalized. I did not even see how these factors contributed to the game except in that it seems, when playing Union, most brigades will retreat at the first Confederate volley. Those kinds of factors should really be considered on a per-unit basis, not national. But now we're talking about an excrutiating level of detail which may be outside of the scope of this game. Still, it never hurts to hope.			"

												I have heard of this game recently. Actually i noticed it during the community choice competetion where it won and got 50% off. However i was already emptied out due to many bought titles during the winter sale so i could not purchase it. However i really liked the idea and bought it like a week later for a full price. Do i regret it? Not at all, game is extremely well done and fun. As a big fan of the rts games i must say this one managed stuff other AAA titles did not. It runs smoothly, units respond well and control system is nice. Also its easy to learn but quite hard to master. I had quite a challenge trying to beat the campaign as The Confederacy which is always undermanned. It is extremely fun and you truely feel like a general while playing this game. Also that feeling when you get reinforcements during the key point of the battle, priceless! Highly recommend it!			"

												This game is really quite amazing! I love every aspect of the gameplay because its really simple and has a very minute amount of controls to get the swing of. The battles feel very....REAL because of how units move and fight and such as well as the map. The map itself is really unique because of the chess set style outer frame. I can't really find any negative things about this game except that I hope in the future the developers incorporate other big battles from the civil war such as bull run and the like, as well as maybe adding a world builder function where you can build your own map to your own difficulty by making any terrain and unit disparage that you would like to make the game more open-ended and less linear. Other than those minor details it is highly recommended!!!!!			"

												WOW, I never could of imagined a $10 RTS game giving Total War a run for its money.  This game far exceeded what I'd hoped to get from it.  This game feels more realistic and intense than any other strategy game ive ever played.  AND ITS SO SIMPLE!!!  TOTAL WAR!!!  WHY CANT YOU MAKE THE BATTLES MORE LIKE THIS!			"

												After I bought this game, my grades have plummeted. I cannot believe this game reminds me of Sid Meier's Gettysburg so much. Much love to the developers of this game. It has given me the satisfaction of what a RTS game should be: Unique, the fun ""what-if"" scenarios, dynamic, a capable AI that never bores me. All in all, I have been looking for a ""Civil War"" game just like this. 10/10 would reccommend for anyone looking for an RTS or a Civil War era game.First review I had to do for a game that left me breathless and satisfied.

												I have always loved strategy and tactical games, more turn based rather than RTS but this game brings me closer back to the RTS fold.  I really like this game, especially in multiplayer battles.Good things about this game:If you like civil war era type games or napoleonic type combats this game will likely appeal to you.  The map is beautifully crafted and you can see vast amounts of soldiers moving around following your orders or littering the battlefield with their corpses.   All orders given are represented on the game map in the form of movement arrows  and in true civil war combat style positioning of your units, using cover and taking advantage of the high ground are an essential part of your strategy.The game also only costs $15 and if you don't like multiplayer it's a fun single player experience.Bad things about this game:The multiplayer match finding interface is bad.  Finding games can be difficult without having one of your steam friends join.  I have added some players that I did manage to play against and can now play these guys when available however.You can setup your own multiplayer game which then allows others in the game lobby to connect to you but there usually aren't many people waiting there so you have to hope that someone will eventually join you.That's it - the multiplayer match finder sucks but the game is good.

												I'm reluctantly recommending this game to Civil War fans. The overall experience is a phenomenal one, with remarkable immersion via strategy and AI tactics but I feel it's all weighed down by the price tag and lack of future content.I should preface this review by saying that it will be mostly negative as it pertains to the business model and future of the series, rather than the gameplay itself. I feel the gameplay speaks for itself and you'll see that when/if you partake.That said, I cannot comment on multiplayer as I have zero interest in it. I've invested thousands of hours into Civil War Generals 2 over the years and the content just hasn't dried up. For Ultimate General: Gettysburg, the current content becomes redundant, predictable and stale in a matter of weeks; at least it did for me. The game encompasses a three day battle but there are only so many ways to battle it out on the fields of Gettysburg. Either you're cautious or you're not. Either you're a Union commander or you choose the Confederacy.At $15, the price tag is ridiculous. By comparison, I purchased The Witcher 2 a few days ago for a few dollars and the amount of content I still have to dig through is staggering. A $15 price tag is better suited for an MMO subscription, not for a one-off title with no clearly defined future. Disappointingly enough, any rumored content releases (or DLC) will have a price tag as well and likely be sold as an individual title. To me, I find this disrespectful to those who purchased this game in hopes of a bright future in a niche market. UGG has never cracked the top-99 most played games on Steam and it's not likely to. Whether that speaks to the price or the content, I can't say but I'd wager it's likely a combination of the two.If you have the $15 to spend whimsically and want a bit of nostalgia, ala Sid Meier's Gettysburg (this engine is quite derivative), then I can confidently recommend this game. Just don't expect the same level of excitement a few weeks from now unless participating in multiplayer battles that are frequently rendered moot after adjustments to mechanics are made in the never-ending battle to balance the game for a war that was never balanced to begin with.If you're looking to buy a game with meaningful content that will last you a few months with no desire to purchase a new game, then I strongly recommend that you steer clear of this and just go nab yourself a copy of Civil War Generals 2 (which still manages just fine on Windows 8.1).

												Fantastic game. Excellent detail, intuitive controls, lots of flexibility. Really brought me back to how much I enjoyed Sid Meier's Gettysburg, one of my all time favorite strategy games.My only complaint would be that the conditions for overall victory aren't really made clear. Example: as the Confederates, I won most of the engagements, usually by wide margins. Yet at the end, I had a Phyric victory, and it wasn't really explained why. But I know I won, so who cares, right?			"

												An interesting and fun game that keeps you pinned to your seat for hours. A very cunning AI makes this a challenge and finding the right strategy to achieve the objectives gives this game a re-play-ability factor. Good graphics rather than steller but good enough find the game at hand. Sound is good and gives atmosphere to the game.Overall I would recommend to the average and pro strategy gamer alike and I'm pleased to have it in my library.			"

												A very tentative ""Would recommend"", but with caveats!I debated whether to buy this game during a recent Steam promotion and the deciding factor was a recommendation with the comment ""If you loved Sid Meir's Gettysbury, you'll love this"" - well being as I was actually having a quick look on Steam to see if Sid Meir's version was here I dived in, only to be disappointed. Pros:* Beautiful map* Easy to use control system, I like the click and drag for route selectionCons:* Lack of ability to provide granular enough commands, (need company level)* Lack of ability to control formation, (line, Double line, Skirmish, Column)* Graphic image of the troops doesn't appear to be entirely in sync with their actual location, line can be facing one  direction but when you try to reposition the controls imply its facing the direction you wanted in the first place.* Artillery can't be instructed to concentrate on other artillery / troops. Also in the time I played the much trumpeted AI wasn't apparent, the enemy did some odd things that made my victory so much easier, it never once surprised me.Based on the patch notes I'm under the impression that they are still working on this game, so I still have hopes that the problems will be rectified in later version, I'll keep my eye on it and any future titles.On the whole I would say, if you are looking for a simple and quick strategy game then jump in, the price is right with this one. But if you are looking for an updated version of Sid Meir's Gettysburg then this is not for you.Heading back to Sid Meir's version on my Win 98 virtual machine, I would honestly recommend that the developers do the same and then update this with the features we have in a game 20 years older.

												Excellent mini-wargame made by the creator of DarthMod. I've only completed a single campaign against the Balanced AI, but I enjoyed it immensely. It reminds me of the old Close Combat games, in all the best ways, only more grand scale.I love that the campaign follows different engagements throughout the entire battle, forming a narrative that teaches the player about the actual battle. The US Civil War was one of the last wars where line battles were still the order of battle, and this game represents them very well, with fluid battle lines and artillery breaking formations up.The AI is very good, able to respond to your movement and fire, all while finding ways to exploit weaknesses in your line. The rules of the game (reload times, morale, stamina) are basic and make sense. I like the simple, but effective art style. It has lots of personality and detail, while having very low system requirements. The units perhaps could use a few more frames of animation, but that's unimportant in the end as it's only eye candy.My main complaint would be the difficulty of determining terrain height, which is helped by using the elevation toggle button. I only learned about it after I had already completed the campaign. I suppose it's a necessary feature with any 2D engine, so I don't see it being a big drawback.Overall, I highly recommend UG:Gettysburg to all wargame fans, and to anyone who is tired of the terrible AI Total War games have gotten over the past few releases. This is the work of the Nick ""DarthMod"" Thomadis after all, who fixed so many of CA's  broken releases. I'm glad to see his game is as great as it is. I'm looking forward to the Antietam sequel!

								Coming from the guy that created the Darthmods for so many Total War games, I think I came in expecting too much. I was expecting an experience like the battles in Total War games just scaled back a bit, but I found the experience was a bit lacking. I don't like not being able to precisely position my troops and not being able to decide rank and file. The look, feel and tone of the game however totally fits the theme and pulls me into the game, but I find myself getting a little bored during the battles. I would like to see this battle style developed with a grand strategy campaign map to make a full fledged American Civil War game, but at the moment, it doesn't quite live up to my predetermined expections (which I admit are my fault, not the developers). That being said, I still recommend the game to any casual strategy gamers or civil war history buffs, as the historical scenarios and fantastical what-if scenarios are quite interesting to see played out on screen.

								I've played this game for the last three days or so and I love it. It's a fairly simple game, and I hope some improvements are made, but this is a great ideological successor to Sid Meier's Gettysburg! SMG! was one of my favorite games growing up, and I've sorely missed being able to play it. UGG builds upon SMG, adding specific elements (like choosing your battle strategy) that SMG lacked. Both the graphics and gameplay are fairly simple, but that doesn't take away from the addictiveness of the game. The concepts are very easy to grasp so you can dive right into the game without dealing with a steep learning curve. I do hope the developers add some more features, but I'm hooked so far. Great deal at $10.			"

								As a child of the late 80s and 90s, it's great to see such a simply complex game. What I mean by that is... on the front end, this game seems very point and click. All the complexity is in the engine.. which makes those points, and clicks, far more important than you would imagine. Though I'm praising that, I do wish there was a bit more unit control. Simply put, I'd love to be able to fortify.  All that being said, this game reminds me a great deal of Sid Meier's Gettysburg. Which in my eyes is extremely high praise. I can only hope that this is followed by other battles.Great work!			"

I have played one whole play through and was impressed, you do find yourself making strategic choices besides ATTACK!!!!There are controls that could use some fixes, but I never had any big issues.  I can't wait to play again.Truly a great game that actually captures the strategic nature of the Civil war and Gettysburg.  I just want more.			"

								Alright, ive never given my input in a beta before...This will be my first, i will make this as detailed as possible. This game reminds me very much of sid miers gettysburg from the late 90s....i loved that game...and as such i enjoyed this game due to fond memories it brought me of the late sidmiyers 90s game.....however the 90s version is still the better game...but it doesnt have to be. Things you got right...AI....the enemy AI is on point with the way it responds to your actions..i feel like im playing a human player. Battles being done in series over a single fight is neat to...however outside of AI there is alot of work to be done....lets start with this...if you havent played sid miers gettysburg you should...to get an idea of how to control the units. the units in ultimate general are void of ALL orders beyond move foward..things we need...the ability to link multiple units together to form a real battle line, the ability to make the cannons rotate without moving, all basic formations and commands, line, double line, column, skirmish line, charge, retreat, tactical retreat, send volley, hold ground, double time,  theres a bunch of formations and commands missing from this game.. that are present in CIVIL WAR RTS games that are 15 years old...moving on...melee...you need to add a very basic melee animation and give the ability to charge....when lines collide (by accident considering u cant charge them into one another) they just  like walk around aimlessly for a few seconds then both lines retreat...about retreats, 1500 men will route if 200 men hit their flank....morale should be reworked...or at the very least if they do retreat...a tactical retreat where they fire a volley then fall back would be good. it just seems like there is zero depth at this time...it feels like this could be played on my phone not my computer. I bought this game due to the darthmod creator...im supporting you due to the bazillion hours of fun you gave me across many total war titles...at 10 dollars....this game is where it should be..if u plan on charging 19.99 or greater after beta....you need to add some content..right now you have the most epic dynamic AI ive seen in awhile...the strategy is there..feels like a board game...would like to see alittle more options, and alittle more realism on the battlefield..specifically the ability for us  to click our units and issue commands to attack the enemy like every other rts on the planet...would like to see first rank kneel to fire  instead of all ranks stand shooting each other in the back of the head, i would like to see a charge button added..no civil war battle was fought without bayonette, and with that comes more audio like bugle horn followed by screaming and hollering, when lines collide it would be nice if melee was actually there even on a basic level. and finally TWEAK MORALE...they should not retreat so fast if flanks are secure they should be able to hold the line alot longer...my battle lines look like skirmishers because they cant make up their minds on if they are men or not and plan on fighting for more then 20 seconds at a time....i understand its not empires, im thinking of realistic ideas that i believe are within the game engine to create..anyway as it stands this is a hardcore point and click...all u can do is point and click the ground infront of you...they fight on their own, they engage enemies on their own, they retreat on their own and they do formations on their own...where is MY CONTROL to play this game??...presently this is an animated version of civil war checkers....board game part seems complete...now lets make the battle better on the eyes, and more interactive for the player....creators...please play or look at sid miers gettysburg...if you had their controls and set up with your game..your game would be a BEAST...hope my input helps all.

Early Access Review
								I would consider this to be one of the best purchases I have ever made on steam. Be warned as this game does have a few bugs, since it is still in early access after all. When I first bought it my graphics card was not supported by the game and after a few emails with the support team I could tell that they were willing to help me with my problem instead of giving me some cookie cutter awnser like some major games would. But in the newest update they added a new alternative renderer which allowed me to play the game. My first impression looking at was that everything from the menu to the small details on the map had a very comfortable feel to it. The gameplay itself has a few things that may need to be worked on just to bring the game to its full potential. Just a few of these may be a about face command. While it doesn't take much time to order your regiment to about face using movement commands, It still would be a more useful feature for those late game situations where timing can make or break a battle. Also I would love to point out the interested difficulty settings for the game. Instead of just Easy, Medium or Hard, You can choose how aggresive the AI is aswell. So you could have a Aggressive enemy with little idea about tactics or a brilliant tactician who rather defends than attack.To summarize that whole things+ Great graphics on menus and ingame+ Good variety of difficulty settings+ Good AI (Kinda expected from the creator DarthMod+ Helpful support team- Still has its bugs- Lack of important movement commands (About Face, Wheels, Formations)- Can be hard to select units at timesThings I would like to see in future- Other important battles from civil war era ( Yes i know that game is focused on Gettysburg but could be fun DLC for future)- Some form of Multiplayer ( Either Total War-esque with unit selection or Scenarion specific army compositions)- Make it easier for modders ( Nick Thomadis of all people should understand how important mods could be to the shelf life of a game)			"

												When I first saw this game, it reminded me of ""Sid Meier's Gettysburg"" way back in 2000's and how much fun I had. Funny enough, I was actually trying to find a way to convert the ""SMG"" game so I could play it on windows 7, that all stopped when I came across this game.In comparison from “SMG” to “UGG”, Ultimate Gettysburg is far superior in every category. I definitely got my money’s worth on this game. Honestly, I really shouldn’t compare the two, but it is the only game that is similar enough to be considered its equal.Even though this game is definitely worth playing, it doesn’t come without some problems (and some gripes of my own). Overall, moving your infantry around works just fine, it’s when you move your artillery pieces that can be a bit troublesome. Apparently, you have to move your artillery just right over the cusp of the hill, or general high point before they are able to shoot at the target. Once you’ve gotten some game time in, you should be able to adjust in no time. It’s too bad that the A.I. can’t just “nudge” them to the point they need to be to start firing. This can become quite the headache during the full campaign mode, when all pieces are placed for you at the start of each battle. With the exception of the very first battle; the majority of your artillery, and sometimes your infantry, are way out of position to be anywhere combat effective. More times than not, you’ll spend the first part of the battle readjusting them. I also understand that during the main campaign, the army is positioned as they were historically. Even though, in my opinion, this would be great during the custom or multiplayer battles (since troop numbers are “topped off” before the start of the battle). However, the way I see it, if I am playing the single player campaign, I am already changing “history”, why should I be confined to historically accurate positions? The order of battle each unit arrives in and when they arrive can be the same. I only wish that after a battle or two on the first day, you could reposition each army group the way you see fit. This would also solve the artillery position problem, as you could put each on in place before the next battle.All of these problems at the end are quite small, and I do see the Developers working to fix these problems, or add them as new components for an already great game. Buy it, enjoy it, and you might even learn something about American history while you're at it too.   "

There is no extra points or AI cheats that is given, but an actual AI that wants to win based on what he has, and what I have and do.  I am dumbfounded by the intensivity of the game.  the enemy actually kept me on the defensive for most of my first game, but I was able to weather his attacks due to my numbers, not ingenious deployment.  If you want to have fun, buy this game.			"

Be aware that if you play it on the easiest level and dont care about casualities you will be able to secure Gettysburg for CSA on the first day.  Every brigade that was there OTL is there in the game. Will you be able to change history?			"

												Overall the game is ok.  My main beef is the pre-planning part of the battle.  In terms of the map, there isn't really much I could do before the battle and most of my planning is done as the battle is already underway.  The briefing map is too tiny and I have no idea who's brigade belongs to which division.  I wish there was away to review the unit positions on the actual game map before the battle actually starts.Otherwise, I had fun playing it and watching a mass of little run into each other.			"

												This is hands down, the very best (U.S.) Civil War-based game since Civil War Generals 2. The controls are easy learn and the ""drawn path"" for troops to march is much easier to use than - for example- Total War's waypoint system. The gameplay is far better than I ever expected. Of course there are some nit-picks though. In my humble opinion the artillery needs some work: It seems to be designed to affect the enemy's unit morale more than anything (which was more the case in the 14th- early/mid 19th centuries.) But artilley of the mid-late 19th century was much more accurate and damaging than it is in this game. Even canister at close range from a battery of 10 or so guns causes very few casualties. But that's a small quirk and it's not a major problem. (I just happen to be a major proponent of the ""Grande Baterie"" so not-so-effective artillery breaks my poor little heart.) Speaking of centuries, the graphics are very much Windows 95'esque. But I'd much rather sprites that work well than polygonal characters that are buggy and unresponsive. And other than having to run it in ""Alternative Rendering"" mode I have yet to really find any bugs or snags. I run it on Windows 7 64 bit so I have no idea how it would work on Windows 8. But for me it seems to be very stable. I hope they can get more battles soon. Maybe less celebrated ones such as Mobile or maybe Alatoona Pass. Cold Harbor would be nice as well.			"

												The AI is better than what you would get from your average Total War game with options for both agression and skill that don't buff the enemy units like most games do, the campaign changes depending on how well you do and what you plan for the next battle, the fights are a lot of fun and the artstyle looks good in my opinion. The only thing lacking is more of the same, really. I hear the guy who made this is working on a similar game for another us civil war battle so keep an eye out for that if you are interested.			"

												It's great. Each type of general gives you a completely different approach you must take to the battle. The gameplay itself is pretty good as well. While there are a few minor issues (cannons are currently ""OP"" to where an entire brigade will route while trying to fight them, but devs have made strides to fix all issues) the overall gameplay is good. I'm 40 hours in and I've still not completed all the general types, and I am still getting to senarios that I never completed.9/10Hidden Gem.			"

												Downloaded the game today. Got the latest version which is 1.5. Have not been able to finish a single game yet. I'm on a mac. The game will freeze in the middle of battle. The sound continues as if you are still playing. All units will disappear for a few seconds then they return but everything flashes on and off and can't click on anything. The game seems fun if one can actually play. I looked at the forums for support. They want you to upgrade drivers but I don't think that's a solution for mac users. I deleted all the files and reinstalled the game with no change. Hope I can get my money back. Again, it's seems like a good game if it works.			"

												Really like this game it follows the history of Gettysberg as far as arrivals of men but the rest is up to you. The game is divided up into stages of the battle between the army of the Potomac lead by Gen George Meade and Gen Lees Arny of Northern Virginia.  I like that you start each stage with the men and positions which you had a the end of the previous stage. This means that you can effect the battle wipe a battalion out and it is gone,no going to the historical  outcome.I also like is simplicity no worrying about supplies and money, just fight the battle.Good game			"

												I was poking around the steam store, and found this fantastic gem. I've been following Darth since he modded Rome: Total War (the first one) with his Darthmod. It was one of the best games I've ever played. (I defy any general to play Rome: Total War BI with Darthmod and emerge victorious). His AI work was incredible, and it was a damn shame that he ended up pulling back a bit because the community was vicious to him. Anyway, the man is a genius. (and of course I must acknowledge the help from everyone else that has gone into this game and his mods. All the playtesting, etc). This game is amazing. Simply amazing. (You know what sucks? I remember when he applied to work at CA....and they turned him down. They could have really used his help...see any tw game and you will see a lot of patchy AI). About this game though. It is the best civil war game I've ever played. Even better than Sid Miers Gettysburg, which was not bad. This game though....the controls are simple, the map is gorgeous, and the way it plays...it is super easy to learn, but hard to master. A lot of playability comes with the new scenarios that come up in the course of your playing. You order around units on a real-time map, and deal with morale, org, cover, etc, but all in a very easy UI. The game is super-easy to play and learn.The real star here is the AI. Simply put, the AI is amazing. You can pick between several different AI's, and you can watch the computer employ strategy that will astound and challenge you. I have lost a battle because I wanted to watch the computer respond to what I did. Being fooled by a computer is amazing after playing Total War. My God, I just got flanked and hit from behind? DId you just take a hill I thought was protected? Damn losing was never this much fun. I cannot recommend this game enough. If you have any interest in civil war, strategy, or anything of that ilk, then this is the game for you. Support this team, and this developer; they are doing amazing things.			"

												I am pleasantly surprised by this title. I bought it expecting a competent but unoriginal strategy game, and thankfully I was wrong.  Ultimate General: Gettysburg [\b] is a great game. The mechanics work very well at providing a challenging but rewarding experience as it punishes you enough to keep you motivated but not enraged. Those unfamiliar with strategy games should beware, however, as the learning curve is quite steep. Due to this, I would have liked to see a greater emphasis on difficulty customisation (despite the game being based on real-world battles). Some may despise the morale system and find it too challenging, yet they cannot do anything to help it. I personally keep to the lower difficulties and still find myself frantically moving troops and crossing my fingers.In short:- Challenging and original gameplay- Cool subject matter- Mechanically sound- Atmospheric soundtrack- Runs on my laptop- Aesthetically pleasing- Fun (arguably the most important)but:- Lacks a lot of difficulty customisation- Steep learning curve- No in-game tutorial (all done in short menu videos)Overall: I love it. At the low, low price of 12€ (or your regional equivalent) you may want to consider purchasing it. P.S. As of now (according to Steam) I have only 0.8 hours on record. That is utter nonsense. I have put a solid 4 hours into this game already. "

												Great game, and a all around fun RTS simulator...I was looking for a bit more for a game that only has one scenario broken down into multipule acts (currently like around 4 breaks). You  can choose to fight as the Union army or the Confederates at the battle of Gettysburg, a huge military success for the Union, and a turning point in the war. Historically accurate to a degree, and has huge potential to be even better at what its doing now and at a badass level currently! ___Will update with more information----			"

There are complexities with moral and positioning that are not clearly laid out until you've watched a few sections of your line break for seemingly no reason (there is a reason) or your cannons refuse to fire (stuck behind heavy cover, or a hill.)All of which he's diligently set about fixing in patches... bravo!Honestly I thought there would be more of an overall campaign than JUST gettysburg, but that was my mistake and certainly no disappointment at a fair price.Truly great, concise, little game with some truly excellent 2d art.

												I would give this game a tentative reccomendation. The issue is that it appears to be a mobile game port, which means it is tainted by original sin. But in seriousness, it's lacking some things, especially in the settings department.Overall, the game is enjoyable, though a bit lacking when it comes to content. The gameplay is interesting. The movement system is rather unique, and shows it's mobile origins, but it actually works. Basically, you select a unit and then click and drag a path you want them to follow. I think a PC re-release, rather than just a port, could vastly improve the game. As it stands now, I give it a recommendation.			"

												I have always loved strategy and tactical games, more turn based rather than RTS but this game brings me closer back to the RTS fold.  I really like this game, especially in multiplayer battles.Good things about this game:If you like civil war era type games or napoleonic type combats this game will likely appeal to you.  The map is beautifully crafted and you can see vast amounts of soldiers moving around following your orders or littering the battlefield with their corpses.   All orders given are represented on the game map in the form of movement arrows  and in true civil war combat style positioning of your units, using cover and taking advantage of the high ground are an essential part of your strategy.The game also only costs $15 and if you don't like multiplayer it's a fun single player experience.Bad things about this game:The multiplayer match finding interface is bad.  Finding games can be difficult without having one of your steam friends join.  I have added some players that I did manage to play against and can now play these guys when available however.You can setup your own multiplayer game which then allows others in the game lobby to connect to you but there usually aren't many people waiting there so you have to hope that someone will eventually join you.That's it - the multiplayer match finder sucks but the game is good.

												I don't write reviews...that being said, I have to admit that I reallly liked this game. Whether you are new to strategy or an old hand, you will more than likely appreciate this title. Pros - The gameplay is simplistic and easily understood.           Control of armies is very straightfoward.            The map is very detailed.           You recieve options for battle plans based on victory point locations that you hold (leading to fights that did not                    actually occur at Gettysburg...a major plus in my opinion.)                                Casualties carry over to the next stage of the battle instead of resetting with each scenario leading you to plan                    your tactics carefully.           Can fight the whole battle in a few hours and not days making this a great time killer.           You do not need a high end machine to run this.Cons - Control over formations smaller than Corps size elements and larger than the single brigade, should be addressed                    i.e. the inclusion of Division commanders.            Gaphics leave a little to be desired, but the gameplay makes up for it.Overall a wonderful game that I hope the developers will expand upon in the future with further battles or even linking the major engagements into one big game.

												Not sure what to think, was excited to find a decent ACW strategy game, but beat it within 5 hours, seems to be all about flanking.. anyway its enjoyable, but would say it is far too quick in terms of pace.  Most of the time the units are literally sprinting across the field.  It was more like COH the way its paced!  At times found the los buggy.    it was not worth the 11 gbp .. assume the MP games are a little more intense.  The maps are great and love the graphics even though there are dated but it was so easy to pick up and play and see what was going on.  Woudl recommend purchase but when it comes down in price even further.			"

												I've played them all, and this gem is up there with the best! I have logged almost 500 hours and still cannot get enough. The very first thing I do is hit 'M', as it brings up the topographic map. This is a huge bonus in the game. I love this game. I cannot wait until the next one!!			"

												This is a great strategy game but I wouldn't buy it at full price due to the amount of content.  PROS+ Easy to understand and intuitive gameplay+ Not too simple as to be boring, not too complex as to appeal only to hardcore wargamers+ Graphics and sounds are niceCONS- Not a lot of content here for the $15 price tag, on balanced AI mode I beat both campaigns in 3 hours- No scenario editor!!!  I think a lot of people complaining about AI troops winning are not taking advantage of terrain as I very rarely lose more than the AI on the Union side.  On the Confederate side you have numbers advantage and have to push and will lose more troops.Overall, a very recommended game when it's 50% off.  I really hope they come out with more in this series or at the very least a scenario maker.			"

												A fun little game! It's a blast watching your formations move and fight, attack and withdraw.  Everything moves in real time but you can pause the game to issue orders so it doesn't have to be hectic unless you want it to be.  The learning curve isn't very steep. You can access and navigate through the tutorial any time during the game.  After a little while you won't need it anymore.  The manual is little more than a printed version of the turorial but it's okay for quick reference.  Not a lot of chess like strategy here. Like the actual battle, this is a slugfest.  Plays fairly quickly.  It looks like I logged a lot of hours playing because I would leave the game paused while I took breaks.  I definately recommend it especially to someone who is more a Civil War history buff than a hard core wargamer.			"

												First, I like this game because it is a historical game in the vein of Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat.  This game was not that impressive the first time I played and was trounced by the AI.  Nonetheless, I appreciated the beginner guidance that is included with the game and watching the enemy tactics also helped.Playing it a second time got me hooked because I realized terrain is the single biggest-factor and having very mobile lines of artillery at high altitude (pausing periodically to re-align them) is critical.  Morale is a big factor if you rely on charging the enemy and routing them soldiers - I recommend avoiding that though. Each campaign has multiple sequences of battles and the available strategies change as your army succeeds or fails to capture critical map locations.			"

												So, I have come back and forth to this simulation... I am pretty addicted to it. The push of a full frontal assualt will only give you a greviace defeat. Make sound decesions and watch your lines. Move your commanders around to boost the troop morale, especially when you go for a push. I would love to see this engine done for the Mexican American war, Rev War, and Seven Years... there is some macro management to be done, but really an awesome play. Fast pace and steep but quick curve of learning.Fix your bayonets and let's take that high ground			"

												“I’ve been ordered to take you men with me, I’m told that if you (laughs quietly) don’t come I can shoot you. Well, you know I won’t do that. Maybe somebody else will, but I won’t, so that’s that. Here’s the situation, the Whole Reb army is up that road aways waiting for us, so this is no time for an argument like this, I tell you. We could surely use you fellahs, we’re now well below half strength.Whether you fight or not, that’s up to you, whether you come along is... well, your coming. You know who we are and what we are doing here, but if you are going to fight alongside us there are a few things I want you to know. This regiment was formed last summer, in Maine.There were a thousand of us then, there are less than 300 of us now. All of us volunteered to fight for the Union, just as you have. Some came mainly because we were bored at home, thought this looked like it might be fun. Some came because we were ashamed not to. Many of came because it was the right thing to do And all of us have seen men die.This is a different kind of army. If you look back through history you will see men fighting for pay, for women, for some other kind of loot. They fight for land, power, because a king leads them, or just because they like killing. But we are here for something new, this has not happened much, in the history of the world.We are an army out to set other men free.America should be free ground, all of it, not divided by a line between slave states and free – all the way from here to the Pacific Ocean. No man has to bow. No man born to royalty. Here we judge you by what you do, not by who your father was. Here you can be something. Here is the place to build a home.But it’s not the land, there’s always more land. It’s the idea that we all have value – you and meWhat we are fighting for, in the end, we’re fighting for each other.- Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, addressing deserters the day before Gettysberg, 114 out of 120 deserters joined with the regiment immediately, with another 4 joined up later.

Early Access Review
								Oct. 4th update - Based on the rapid updates and active development of this title, I'm officially switching my recommendation. The latest update still leaves a few things to be desired, but it's quite clear that the developers are passionate about this game and receptive to feedback from it's users.Still needs fixed:-need for the tweaking of unit casualty rates from incoming fire, seems to be based more on discrete appoximation than statistical physics. i.e.-skirmishers should recieve fewer casualties due to dispersed and often kneeling and/or prone unit formations, mounted cavalry should recieve higher casualties due to the horse/rider combo equaling a significantly larger target, etc.-3D terrain view still not very effective, I'd recommend grayscale colored topography with white being higher in altitude.-melee combat casualty rates still need to be higher, units entering a melee after the two or more original units don't seem to modify the outcome significantly, and melee units that break and run should take a discrete loss as they break and run and then be highly supsceptible to faster moving units, like calvary.-units firing into a melee should add casualties to all units in said meleeOLDER COMMENTS, MIGHT BE OUTDATED AS OF LATEST RELEASE - I don't recommend this game yet.  It's virtually unplayable as is, despite the fact it's an early release title.  STILL NEEDS MAJOR WORK to come remotely close to a civil war strategy game.Negatives:-Melee combat does little to nothing in terms of casualties, but simply displace units including artillery, making charging largely worthless-As such, artillery are way overpowered and can be left in giant groups on the field and decimate units trying to charge them with little casualties if they are actually overrun-line of sight is very difficult to determine before a unit is actually moved to said location, very important with determining artillery location ahead of time-the terrain is very difficuly to determine what is elevated and depressed half of the time due to poor topographic marking-unit AI regularly disregards your orders immediately after it's assigned-units manuevering is very clunky, including where units often try to wheel completely around rather than just a simple about face-skirmishers and calvary often require lots of micromanagement due to their ""wiggling"" all over the field of battle-unit casualties do not seem realisticly based, and are far too light when units are very close in proximity and far too high when units are in maximum coverPositives:-Computer AI is very well done, and can be very challenging and tricky-units grouping is intuitive and simple, easy to manage large groups of units in real timeAll told, I'd much rather play either of the old Sid Meier's Civial War titles from 15 years ago, considering the graphics are nearly identical, the gameplay is orders of magnitude more solid, and at no point do I want to flip my desk over in frustration, leading from the fact that everything in the old titles tends to make intuitive sense, i.e. 3000 muskets firing at 1000 guys in open ground at close range means decimation, not an occasional casualty here or there, regardless of enfilade fire or not.

												  I really wish Steam would allow for neutral reviews of games instead of either yes or no but here goes. I have followed Darthmod through the Total War series and I have always been a fan of his work.  Therefore, I was excited extremely excited to learn about his upcoming game and bought it within the first few days of its' release.  That being said, I am not a fanboy and do have gripes about the game.  I am sure he did not have a large budget and did the best he could but I still see a lot of room for improvement.PROS-Feels like Sid Meir's Gettysburg-Stunning graphics, they work well for the genre and time, nothing really to complain about-Stunning map design.  I could tell alot of work went into the detail and accuracy CONS-Artillary needs a rework.  It is sort of hard to get guns in place and the Line of Sight is broken.  They units don't respond very well, if at all sometimes when you choose ammo type, even with enemy within range.  Rate of fire is fine though.  I know some of this was done to prevent artillary from panzering in games but come on.  You could even include limber and unlimber like Sid M. did-Need more details on how morale and cover actually work.  Fences and rock walls seem to offer little if no cover.-Too simple gameplay in my opinion, it felt like I was just making battle lines and hooking units around theirs on the flanks.  Somehow try to figure out a way to add more depth and emmersion into the game.  Play around with making your men volley, fixing bayonets, being able to stretch unit formations into longer lines, something like that.Final ThoughtsThe game is worth the money you pay for it and would be fun on a roadtrip using a tablet or laptop.  But overall it is shallow gameplay in my opinion for a PC game.  I am sorry but I expected a bit more.  Some of things I said may be attributed to my ""not understanding the game or being bad at RTS"" as some people might think but I have been playing RTS for over 15 years and also renacted, am a history buff  (MA in history) and love the Civil War and war games in general having served in the army, and visited many historical battle sites.  Get the game if you want but I think updates and add ons will really add to the depth of the game.  I hope Darthmod performs his magic like he did for fans of TW. "

Early Access Review
								I would consider this to be one of the best purchases I have ever made on steam. Be warned as this game does have a few bugs, since it is still in early access after all. When I first bought it my graphics card was not supported by the game and after a few emails with the support team I could tell that they were willing to help me with my problem instead of giving me some cookie cutter awnser like some major games would. But in the newest update they added a new alternative renderer which allowed me to play the game. My first impression looking at was that everything from the menu to the small details on the map had a very comfortable feel to it. The gameplay itself has a few things that may need to be worked on just to bring the game to its full potential. Just a few of these may be a about face command. While it doesn't take much time to order your regiment to about face using movement commands, It still would be a more useful feature for those late game situations where timing can make or break a battle. Also I would love to point out the interested difficulty settings for the game. Instead of just Easy, Medium or Hard, You can choose how aggresive the AI is aswell. So you could have a Aggressive enemy with little idea about tactics or a brilliant tactician who rather defends than attack.To summarize that whole things+ Great graphics on menus and ingame+ Good variety of difficulty settings+ Good AI (Kinda expected from the creator DarthMod+ Helpful support team- Still has its bugs- Lack of important movement commands (About Face, Wheels, Formations)- Can be hard to select units at timesThings I would like to see in future- Other important battles from civil war era ( Yes i know that game is focused on Gettysburg but could be fun DLC for future)- Some form of Multiplayer ( Either Total War-esque with unit selection or Scenarion specific army compositions)- Make it easier for modders ( Nick Thomadis of all people should understand how important mods could be to the shelf life of a game)			"

								I'll keep this short and sweet: If you played Sid Meier's Gettysburg! and are as bummed out as I am that it doesn't run on modern operating systems, buy this game, It feels like the true spiritual successor that title always deserved. At the moment it still lacks some of the more in depth orders and functions of Gettysburg! but as it is still in early access, I have hope that some day we will be able to issue orders for our artillery to limber/unlimber, so they can move a little bit faster when there are enemy troops bearing down on them at double-quick speed.

												The game is pretty good not the best but certianly not the worst, Union is fairly OP. It is fun to play but deeply frustrating too, for instance playing the Confederates I had Pettigrew outflank the Union at Oak Ridge and after losing 200 men (he had over 2,500 men) his men broke and routed towards the enemy even though they had freindly units behind them and by the time they reformed they only had 400 men left. In short the enemy AI is great and their morale is always better than yours. Freindly AI is about as dumb as a sack of rocks and will rout towards the enemy and get annihalated. Overall I would recomend the game they still need to fix the unbalance between the Confederates and Union and for goodness sakes make sure your troops don't rout towards the enemy. 6.5/10 worth it but still frustrating.

Early Access Review
								Ultimate General Gettysburg, is a large scale American Civil War strategy game. I hesitate to use the term RTS as many of the usual tropes associated with them, such as basebuilding, and diplomacy are noticeably vacant. Instead the game focuses on a well built and historically accurate ORBAT, with persistent troops throughout the campaign. For Example if the Unions Iron Brigade had single handedly held Devils den against a full division of confederates, and lost most of its men. Then in your next battle they will be just as weak and quite likely exhausted and low on morale.   This gives a feeling of importance to each and every brigade you have, and infact I personally found myself favoring certain brigades, or even hating some (Damnit Baxter! Your supposed to hold Devils den! Why did you advance!?!?). You see, each unit has its own AI Commander who will make choices on their own unless told not too. This includes retreating and advancing to some degree, but mostly focuses on shifting their flanks to face the enemy proper. More than once, a Brigadier Generals advance or retreat has completely changed the way the battle plays, and what was initially my biggest issue with the game has now become one of its strengths.   Its not just the individual AI either, ingame the enemy AI itself is brilliant, coordinating attacks on certain positions. If your playing as the union, the second battle of day one is going to be a difficult one, as the AI completely outmaneuvers you. (I'll avoid spoilers here).  Now, despite all of this, the actual ingame UI and gameplay is shockingly simple. Its drag and release the mouse. Thats it, ocassionaly you might rotate a units facing, or check the heights of hills with the terrain map. But these are still incredibly simple things to do.  There are a few flaws with the game, the brilliant AI sometimes wants to misbehave, and doesn't always take risks. IE: In the last battle of the confederate campaign, the union soldiers outnumbered me by 9000 men, they were exhausted however and the AI decided to let them rest. By the time they had recovered, the battle was nearly over and they didn't have time to push the Victory Point. Small issues like this exist, but for the most part the game is amazingly polished, infact it feels more finished than many games I've played that aren't in early access.   In conclusion, I gotta say, if you like strategy games and like games with muskets in them, this is the game to buy. Don't hesitate, this price point and the replayability (I've completed the campaign 8 times now)  means it is a must have in your library.			"

								alright this game is great, but difficult. the AI is smart and makes strategically movements. ive not had one problem with the game so far. my first battle, i drove the confederates straight back onto seminary ridge and flanked them with artillery fire, smahsing their morale and with a couple well placed charges down the hill, i wiped out the entire brigade. this game has fulfilled my expectations for such a cheap price3. it has so much more potential left, which is great. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANY STRATEGIST GAMER AND HISTORY BUFF!!!			"

Early Access Review
								Ultimate General's AI is already as good as some of the best Total War AI's,thanks to the past experience from Total War's DarthMod.A great AI is what makes games fascinating.  (AI is *much* better than the latest Total War, a disappointment)I also love the gameplay vs. realism design decisions made which make this game just plain fun!I'm certain this will be the next great strategy AI people are hoping for.

The AI is impressive and challenging.  The only downside is that the game is somewhat short, but it still has a lot of replay value.  I would definately buy the sequal to this game.			"

After my first playthrough, I felt like the developers did such an amazing job, I bought my own copy and a copy for a friend. This game is simply the ultimate in ""Arm Chair General"" fun. No 2 playthroughs ever feel the same.  Every time I start a game, I wonder how that first day is going to go, and what on the spot tactics am I going to need to survive until the end. Simply put, BUY THIS GAME! Torrent it for a day if like to try it out, but seriously, if you don't buy this after trying, you are simply a cheap♥♥♥♥♥that gives torrenters a bad name.			"

												FIrst RTS I have liked since FSW: Ten Hammers on PS2. Even though its top down and not meant to be visually impressive, the gameplay both challenges your strategic thinking while immersing you in action packed battles which, often, especially in MP, keep you on the edge of your seat.pros: - simple controls allow for quick learning; however, the AI can be very challenging, and multiplayer, is where noobs (like me) go to get massacred. -is not so much about indivdual unit stats or abillities, there is no OP unit that costs (x) amount of credits to field. The game hands you the force you get to work with based on the scenario you have chosen to play. there is no such thing as the ultimate fighting force, only the ultimate general that knows how to effectively use the forces he has. -it IS about holding geography across the map that provides tactical advantage (hills and ridges) and combining the use of artillery and troop advances effectively. A force of 2000 charging soldiers can be stopped in their tracks by an opposing force of only 1000 simply because the opposing force holds the high ground, and is less fatigued with higher morale, or has superior artillery in place (ps canister shot can massacre whole divisions at close range). -the menu theme song/music is nicecons: -none really, just buy the game if you like RTS games that challenge your tactical thinking. :) "

												First off, I want to congratulate Steam and Valve for not having the knee jerk reaction that Apple had.  It is very important that history, even the dark moments of it be preserved.  It is also very important to present that history in its context.  If the people of cetain states elect to have certain symbols be removed from their flags or state grounds, that  is their choice.  To remove images from art and media though is nothing short of white washing and dangerously close to violating our 1st Amendment right of free speech.  Thank you Steam and Valve for your courage and not giving in to the fear of offending someone.That being said, this game is pretty amazing.  It is easy to learn, the AI is customizable, the Map is spot on to the historical Gettysburg, and best of all, they do not just end the battle with the events of July 3.  They give you July 4 to either follow up on you victory or to get the h*&% out if Dodge before you lose everything else.  I would have liked to have seen more options with the infantry though.  Historically, Infantry units were able to deploy their own skirmishers and in this game, they are already picked out.  Other than that, if you want to test your military strategic skills then check this one out.			"

												I played the old Side Meir's Gettysburg when it came out and loved it. I've been playing Ultimate General for a while and feel that it is superior is someways, but the old Gettysburg had some advantages. I think Ultimate General blows the old one away in graphics and fluid game play. I like the way you can group units and move them as one. I'm very impressed with the live action, but think the old game was better in the following ways; 1. You could march units in column form and then deploy at a designated spot in a number of ways (wedge, refuse line...) 2. You could manipulate individual units. Say deploy 3 reg and have one as skirmmers watching you flank. 3. You could deploy a whole brigade as skirmishers 4. The calvary was more versitle. Able to move as calvary and then deploy in line. 5. The old units had experiance points which could be added to by where they were in line, location of Division commanders, cover....etc. 6. If a unit was in line they would automaticlly start to fortifiy,All in all its still a great game. I would highly recommend this to anyone into real time combat games. Def worth the price. If the good people at UG would take the above into consideration it would be a perfect game.			"

												Game is too basic and looses it's appeal after 30 hours or so. Too little depth and buggy AI. Not worth $15.00. Buy it only when on sale. Only one scenario and lots of single missions that always play the same. There is no variety or randomness as to where AI units enter the map or are positioned at the beginning of the battle. The AI also sets up your units for you at the beginning of the battle and sometimes puts them in the middle of enemy batallions ensuring immediate slaughter.			"

												When I first saw this game I was reminded of Robert E. Lee: Civil War General one and two, which I played an insane amount as a child. In reality, this game pales in comparison in almost every way. This game has next to no content and very little replayability. This game is laughably overpriced. Unit commands are reminiscent of the Total War series; however, they feel clunkier and worse in practice. Unlike the total war series, commands are often entirely ignored. At first glance it’s easy to chalk this inaccuracy up to communication issues or morale issues; however, after only an hour or two of gameplay it becomes clear that unit commands simply don’t work well. Rotating, falling back, and “holding” are particularly buggy. Troops will often just wander off a few hundred yards in a direction, sometimes not even in the direction they are facing. “Hold” will not prevent this behavior. This makes defending a fortified position such as cemetery ridge, Culp’s Hill, etc a nightmare since you spend all of your time micromanaging your troops so they don’t wander off away from fortifications to go frolic in the open fields before being cut down by enemy gunfire. Again, at first I was willing to chalk some of this up to the breakdown of communications, humar error, glory hounds, etc; however, after a bit more time with the game it becomes obvious it's just a bug. It doesn't make sense for troops that are actively engaged in fire to consistently leave their fortified position behind a wall to walk willy nilly into an open field to be massacred. Troops don’t alter their lines to actively take advantage of cover. If a wall isn’t perfectly straight then the units won’t use it effectively, lowering the unit’s overall cover rating. Cannons don’t work well at all and will often refuse to fire regardless of visibility, line of sight, etc. The largest problem seems to be that if any friendly unit is even remotely near your cannons then they will refuse to fire. The computer solves this problem by putting cannons in front of, on the flanks of, or far behind their lines. This weird positioning often means a single unit can take out 3 or 4 units of artillery usually unopposed, which brings me to my next point.The computer doesn’t seem to really react to your actions. You’re often allowed to move and position your units on their flanks and start wreaking havoc for a few minutes before the computer even begins to react.The game lacks the ability to get detailed statistics about the ground you’re defending so it’s often impossible to tell important characteristics of terrain such as height, roughness, cover, etc. Determining where to move your units for visibility is a crapshoot, and particularly frustrating when dealing with cannons.  The “tutorial” (if we’re being kind enough to even call it that) is mediocre given its length and lack of integration into the game. Minor: Units that are under fire have their unit numbers fall slowly while in combat. This makes sense for two units actively engaged; however, it does not make sense when being shot at by cannons or when massing fire all at once. This makes the game and certain tactics lack the “bite” they would truly have. It also sometimes feels like it has incorrect gameplay effects. Multiple cannons firing canister shot on bunched up enemy units should cause an immediate, drastic drop in men and morale, likely causing a rout. In this game both slowly trickle down and battle continues on merrily as if nothing happened. All in all, my time would have been better spent playing one of the original Robert E. Lee: Civil War General games which have excellent campaigns, historical battles, better persistence between battles, better decisions, and better gameplay. Alternatively, if retro games aren’t your style then I’d recommend picking up Total War: Shogun 2, Total War: Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai, Napoleon: Total War, or Empire: Total War.  "

												Great game limited scope. 9/10Fairly simple and intuitive, it's similar to what I think total war would look like if you handled 1000+ man units. i would love to see this sort of battle system/engine as a part of a larger game or grand campain.  With the focus on a single battle (granted it is gettyburgs) don't expect more than 20 hours of play or the same amount of play throughs.  Over all HIGHLY recommended, excited to see what else can be done with the engine and ideas.			"

												I do recommend this game, but my one gripe is that the formations will literally walk through each other, instead they should clash and fight until one of sides breaks.My other complaint is that I've had too many troops break and route when they obviously have the upper hand.  Too often flanking the enemy with a second formation won't do that much because one of your two formations becomes too demoralized.If they fixed those issues, this game would be the best tactical Civil War game available.

												Amazing game, the largest battle of the civil war on a grand scale, there were a lot of scenario's to mess around with, or just play everything to the most historic detail. Everything in the game is very balanced, the confederates have outstanding unbreakable morale, but don't have the skill for sustained firefights. And the Union has much more experience, but waver easily. To me, the only downfall to this game is the 15 minute timer on any battle, this can be increased by capturing points in game, but only by about 2 minutes. Highly recommended if you can get around the timer.			"

												Picked it up in HB and I was pleasantly surprised by this game. Very tactical and fluid gameplay, competent (and quite customizable) AI, fantastic maps; all adding up for a very entertaining game. Topography is the king: elevations win or lose your battles. With this said, the UI could have been improved somewhat, contours of the topographical maps definitely need more labels, and finally the exact line of sight of units -especially artillery- and what other units they can target needs to be indicated more intuitively. Anyway, I really hope they make sequels to this, such a game would work great especially for Napoleonic wars.Note: don't charge artillery from the front, who in their right mind charges artillery from the front and expects to survive you fools			"

												Really solid game.  Well thought out and has great attention to details and AI.  Great value.  Impressive replayability.This game stands on it's own, but I do think that there are a couple other games that it deserves (favorable) comparison to.  First would be and old game; Sid Meier's Gettysburg.  Obviously the battlefield here is the same, but some of the 'campaign' and unit movement mechanics appear to be an homage to this old classic as well.  Second would be the Total War franchise; the battle map mechanics in particular.  Facing, terrain, morale and other battle mechanics are modeled nicely.  The level of visual detail is not as 'Hollywood' as recent Total War titles, but the game looks great and the units look realistic as they move and shoot.  It's very satisfying to pick a good position and hold it against greater numbers!Would definately recomend buying and I hope that there are more games from these creators in the future.			"

The user-selectable AI provides not only an adaptable learning curve, but will occasionally produce surprises as any human opponent would.The art design alone is enough to bring a smile to those that spent happy hours studying the wonderful David Greenspan illustrated battle maps from the American Heritage Illustrated History of the Civil War book.While not without a few quirks, UG: G 's team deserves thanks and support to continue to improve and expand their work on this marvelous effort.8/10  "

												i LOVE this game , if you are a RTS fan or interested in the American civil war then stop reading and get it , even though the graphics arent amazing but the game still looks beautiful , you have to think  and use certain tactics to try to defeat the enemy , so the game is worth it , and its cheap , only 14.99 dollars so absolutely worth the money and if you are afraid of getting bored , there is multiplayer so i recommend this .

Early Access Review
								This is a fun game HOWEVER :  It is ONLY the battle of gettysburg. With that said there are quite a few different results and days to the battle of gettysburg. Each day determines what happens on the next.This game locks up ALOT on me and I often do not finish the third day. That is the honest truth of it all - however if you are a civil war buff, it is well worth the trouble to watch the battle unfold!			"

												The art style in this game is my favorite of any strategy game I have ever played.  Also the game difficulty is no slouch and requires a good bit of tactical finesse to achieve victory.  It is true as some other reviews state, the interface is somewhat non intuitive but the art style, branching battles, and solid difficulty make this game a must have for strategy game or civil war fans.  Recommended.			"

												Game is jacked up, I hoped it was going to be a new Robert E Lee: Civil War General, it does not live up to that, most frustrating are the technical quirks still readily apparent.  Nothing more frustrating than watching your elite infantry unit that youve spent alot of money equiping zombie walking into the enemy line. Why? Who knows? but those veterans  and shiny new rifles aren't cheap to replace.  If this was a finished product i'd give it a thumbs down, but i am giving it a thumbs up hoping that they'll fix the quirks.			"

								wow. this game is pretty detailed.like really detailed. if you want good eqipment but low morale soldiers you pick union. if you want strong high morale soldiers but weak eqipment you pick confederate. but the charges witch the confederates sort of depended on do a negative on your part almostt always when confederate. but it still in development so do not matter much yet "

												I have to say i would give it a 7.5/10 great game for that over commanding gameplay. Pros:Has fantastic gameplay with friendsGives it a realistic feel where units won't hold if there out gun'd and out-man'dThats pretty much it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:Units dont stay together and move out when they feel like it.Units move around when they are fightingUnits dont all fire, so why not let the second line fire why only the first line fire?NO MODS I WANT MODS, like a revolutionary war mod for this game would be fantastic!I really want the units when you tell them to move to atleast stay somewhat together not just all spread out			"

												I have played for the past week. I can say that it is very engaging. The union campaign is not as hard as the confederates but that's historical, since the union plays defensively. The game runs very smoothly even on a laptop(which i play it on). the only game that could out match this for a civil war tactic game is scourge of war. This game also does not take as long to play, about twenty minute battles for campaign. Custom battles are around 20 - 40 minutes long.			"

												I have loved strategy games in the past for many many years. Some of my favorites were the Total War series, and the Take Command/ Scourge of War Civil games. Ultimate General: Gettysburg brings a whole new feeling to the table in this phenomenal game. It honestly feels like a mix between Total War and Take Command: 2nd Manassass. From the very first day that I bought this game, it was instantly one of my favorites. Well done to whoever has made this game. You have made a game that Civil War buffs and strategy gamers will love for many many years.			"

												The game is pretty good not the best but certianly not the worst, Union is fairly OP. It is fun to play but deeply frustrating too, for instance playing the Confederates I had Pettigrew outflank the Union at Oak Ridge and after losing 200 men (he had over 2,500 men) his men broke and routed towards the enemy even though they had freindly units behind them and by the time they reformed they only had 400 men left. In short the enemy AI is great and their morale is always better than yours. Freindly AI is about as dumb as a sack of rocks and will rout towards the enemy and get annihalated. Overall I would recomend the game they still need to fix the unbalance between the Confederates and Union and for goodness sakes make sure your troops don't rout towards the enemy. 6.5/10 worth it but still frustrating.

												Ju8st a simple great game , I picked this up a year or so ago played it played it played . both sides are a blast to play .as well  the Ai settigs are intresting since they are a block of 9 settings all varring in dificulty of offensive /defensive  moves . if this is not enough hit random .  It is easy to pick up play hard to master . On line played few time while back you may not get the army battle YOU want but going as randon any jump in , less then 5 minutes . they have a new full game out on the whole war but that is another story . I have to say graphics  are not for close up man verse man ,  I have seen this on sale for as little as 5.00 and worth every bit the 5.00 even 10..00 , reatil is 15.00 and if you are well to do then may be worth it for you as well . It was one of my favorite playing games of 2016  just beacause I jump in play a single battle set the random AI and have fun for a hour or two . yes there are some short fallings but the price makes up for it , if looking for a hard core send a messanger with delays smoke  dead bodies go with the scourge of war serise but you will need a lot of computer /and money . this here you do not ecuse my  writing skills I was muigged in 2004 with a permenent head tramua so the spelling grammer is messed up			"

It's easy to play.  Easy to find multiplayer games, average wait is like 1-2 minutes tops so far.Tip: Play the small maps first.			"

												Admittedly a new norm in strategy. The IA and post-battle-decision making, based on the outcome of the skirmish / battle the player just fought, gives the game a incredible replayability. The possibility to pick a random IA, and to boost it - meaning it'll play better, not get a mere buff to its troops - make UG:G a lot of fun to play.But the better part, perhaps, is the difficulty the game poses. It's not really difficult because of its IA - you can pick an easy / defensive one anyway - but because its mechanics, despite looking very simple at first glance, actually hide a lot of depth to the game. At first, I didn't understand why my brigades lost the firefights. How the morale or condition really worked. For instance, in Total War games - of which i'm a veteran, player since medieval first of the name, and admitteldy the franchise has become a reference in terms of wargame / strategy - exhaustion doesn't really matter. Mostly, troops will get tired very quickly, neither player nor IA will keep reserves, or if so, no more than a couple of units. Mostly, everyone gets tired at the same time, at the same rate, and the battle plays pretty much the same regardless. Well, in UG:G, conditon matters BIG TIME. If you got tired brigades, and infantry can get exhausted pretty quickly after walking up some woody hill, you'd better delay your attack.To put it simply, the game is one of the best, if not the best at the moment, historical strategy simulation game. It's not arcade. Truth be told, I've recently come to understand it all a little better - how to use your artillery properly, how to time your attacks, how to prepare for your assaults, how lines of sight really worked - and I'm still learning. All those negative reviews bring a smile to my face : only one is above two hours of play. I had no goddam clue about how the game really worked after ten hours, let alone after two. Ultimate General : Gettysburg is a game which requires careful planning, reflexion from the player, and won't just reward you with immediate pleasure. Darth never hid that.On a personnal side, I say having such an innovative game, especially since it is so challenging, and thus so rewarding once beaten, is a blessing. I bought it straight away when the early access began, and my only regret is to have left this to rot in my library for so long before returning to it. Not having taken the time to dig, to understand, to discuss with other players, and figure out what I was doing wrong right from the start.A mandatory purchase. A new era for strategy dawns here.

												Being new to the strategy sim genre, I wasn't sure what to expect - this game has me sold on the game style in general and on the Ultimate General series over all.  I tried Sid Meyer's Gettysburg once and while good, its not as good as this title.  The interface is intuitive and was very easy for a non-player to jump right in.  This is a very accessible game.  Only thing I wished for was some kind of warning system when I made bonehead moves or something wasn't going so well - maybe a warning that could be turned off as you get better at the game.			"

												Ive pretty thoroughly played this game and can honestly say its a very detailed, realistic tactical take on civil war combat. It reminds me a lot of Total War game battles but presents it in a more artistic (less-advanced?) way, the details however, could possibly put that game to shame and were you to compare the two, I would say UG:gettysburg is the more realistic combat and general sim. Not just due to the fact that this game is historically accurate to a large degree (keep in mind your performance changes the course of the battle) but the actual fighting between units holds a large appeal to me as despite its rustic-look the game holds true to a complex and artsy combat system involving you watch your men load, fire, and die in regimental order, attempt flanking maneuvers, waver under withering cannon blasts from the hill across the way, or brandish bayonets in one final gallant charge for God and country against the enemy lines. It feels authentic and thought-out. Decisions or particularly hard fights the day before can have a unit reeling at the start of the fight the next day. Is the game as smooth or graphically crisp as say a TW? probably not, but it wasnt claiming to be.			"

												The South shall rise again!Sid Meiers Gettysburg lives again.The game is really enjoyable. Honestly.Graphics detail is good for the level you play at. The controls are simple and with the ability to pause the game and issue orders its really handy.   For the Union I'm glad it asks you after a fight how you wish to proceed. Do you want to hold that ridge line or compact you line down rather then forcing you to hold everything. I like that the fact you did not hold all the Victory Points does not mean you have to try again. Its historical but it follows how you are fighting the battle.  Just one point.It took me several hours of game play to realise that the bluebellies cannot stand a charge by the boys. So since this I have simply bundled the Yankees from Gettysburg all the way back to Washington.So think Napoleonic French assualt tactics and as the Confederates you are on a winner. "
