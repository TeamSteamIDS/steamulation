Early Access Review
								Steer clear of this one unless you want to pay real money for game content which is already boring, dated and not a fun experience in any way.   Cons:-  in-game purchases gates content despite already paying $13 for the game. -  Low budget dated graphics.-  30 second unskippable warning screen every time during launch.- ""Early"" access to a game that's been worked on since 2010 and is a chore to experience.-  Extremely long loading times accompanied by obnoxious music, even on an SSD.-  Bare bones options.  A resolution and Quality setting.  Nothing else.-  Extremely unrealistic underwater movement breaks any possibility of immersion. -  Only ONE map is included in the game price.PROS:- Steam's refund policyAn early warning sign of the quality of this game is on the Early Access description section of the store page.  ""“Completing the in-game store is very high priority. Past that, we want to add new gear....""   Yep.  The developer's priority of In-game transactions is very clear.Want more scuba gear?  Pay $2.50 of real money.   Want suits, fins etc?  Pay real money.  Only one explorable area is included in the $12.99 asking price and the only other map I could see required in game currency to purchase.Upon purchasing the game on steam they actually do give you $5 worth of in-game currency (clams).   Problem is, this will not buy you much of the game's content.  They ask 200 clams for a wetsuit, 200 Clams for fins, knives, gear sets...  After that they expect you to pay a further $5 USD per 500 clams from their website.   How about no, I've already paid you $13. If you are going have content gated behind in-game purchases then make the base game free.  This is just distasteful. Even when ignoring the micro transactions, the game itself is bland to look at and not enjoyable, so I will be asking Steam to refund my ""Clams"".Edit:  A 30 minute timed demo is available on their website and on the Windows store.  Something I wish I had known before I purchased. "

Basic InformationTitle:  Infinite ScubaStatus:  Early AccessDeveloper:  Cascade Game Foundry SPCPublisher:  Cascade Game Foundry SPCGenre:  SimulationRelease Date:  12th of January, 2017Type:  Single-playerGeneral ImpressionFor a game that’s priced almost as much as its subgenre competitors (ABZÛ, Depth Hunter 2 and World of Diving), Infinite Scuba doesn’t have nearly as much content or polished details to compare itself or even stand out. Not to mention the chance of softening the blow from the premature implementation of microtransactions in an Early Access title that is obviously far from completion. The game’s developer made some amateurish mistakes which I will describe in detail below.First and foremost among Infinite Scuba’s many sins, has to be the lack of proper diversity as far as the diving locations are concerned. You just have two such places and in a twisted sense of irony, one level has to be unlocked with “clams” (the game’s idea of currency). So indeed, you can visit just one stage if you choose to spend your initial and so far only amount of 500 clams on diving equipment instead of unlocking the Mesoamerican Reef level. Naturally, I had to make the only smart choice available in this case and I unlocked 50% more “content”. You cannot gain these pesky clams in any way during gameplay. So I think we can either expect the developer to proceed with his intention of selling the in-game currency at real world money value or take the decent way out of this mess and at least offer a way of gathering some of the clams through the activities you perfrom as a diver. But they probably won’t do that since the prospect of earning even more cash than the game’s price tag is too enticing to pass up, right? Bravo, gentlemen!While the Belize level offers just the opportunity to explore a large coral reef, the game’s main location is the Chuuk Lagoon from Micronesia where you can delve into an actual historic shipwreck. Sadly, the Gosei Maru cannot be examined as thoroughly as you’d expect since Infinite Scuba’s interior exploration hasn’t been implemented yet. Just like its wonderful clam gesheft! So you may ask, just what exactly CAN you do in this simulator? Well dive, of course. I have to admit that the diving mechanics themselves as well as the information provided (and a pleasant amount of trivia also) gave the impression that the game tries to take itself seriously enough and I wouldn’t be able to rate it any lower than I did.Honestly, I really gave it a fair chance and took nearly a dozen dives. It’s unfortunate that they have to last so little (not even 10 minutes per single dive) and the oxygen tanks seem to have the capacity of a plastic bag. If you don’t move a lot and your depth is just a few meters from the surface, I guess you could prolong the underwater trip but what’s the point of standing still, in a simulator about seafloor exploration? Infinite Scuba actually marked some of my dives as “unsuccessful” since I had less than 500 oxygen units left in the tank by the time I resurfaced. You start out all your dives with 3000 units which rapidly decrease if you swim below 30 meters. The grinding required in order to complete all your tasks, cannot be estimated at a number lower than 25 dives per location. Absurd.The wildlife is nicely detailed and simulated, though there is never enough variety when it comes to larger cartilaginous fish (such as rays and sharks). And I’m certain that no one would risk deep dives just for the sake of fifty different coral shapes and sizes. At least there are also objects scattered on the seabed for you to collect or catalogue. You can take pictures of certain areas of interest on the shipwreck and get awarded with in-game achievements (which never result in actual Steam achievements or at least some wonderful clams to unlock new gear).The simulation itself ain’t half-bad even with the mediocre oxygen tank capacity. You can enjoy the game and relax while swimming and exploring but I cannot tolerate this title’s particularly abhorrent form of microtransactions. A malicious practice to gaming in general, in Infinite Scuba this is only made worse since you can’t obtain the so-called clams through simply playing the game and thus there’s no real gain even from grinding the two areas (or just one, if you didn’t spend all the clams on the Belize level). This isn’t a reward system. Just pure greed!Strong Points+ Decent looking & sounding.+ Comprehensive diving simulation.Weak Points- Overpriced and with future implementation of microtransactions.- Early Access with just two diving locations (one being initially locked until you “pay” for it). - No Steam Trading Cards nor Achievements.Rating 55/100  This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews, through the generous contribution of RedHill.

								The screenshots for this reminded me of what it's really like underwater. Sometimes there is nothing at all going on. Sometimes You only think there is nothing going on but it is simply out of view and there is no noise to alert You. Sometimes it is clear and othertimes it is too dark to see almost anything in the distance. Infinite Scuba captures all of this. I saw quite a few different types of fish. Two dolphins were watching me one one dive. Another dive showed me lots of seagulls but I do not know if any other above ground animals exist. Not that they need to exists since this is a scuba simulator. The 1 shark I saw swam too fast for me to foolishly catch up to it. It looked like a white tip but I know nothing of the shark demographic of Belize. You can explore wreckage and coral which both have very interesting things happening in and around them just like most real life sea wreckage and coral. The attention to detail is borderline insane. I have almost ran out of air a few times due to wanting to keep looking around. I recommend this to anyone interested in marine life and it's beauty. I also recommend this to anyone who has/is getting/ or had a scuba license. I also recommend this as the overkill upgrade for those of You with that fishtank screensaver. All jokes aside, scuba simulation is here.

								So far, I'm really enjoying this game. I've always wanted to SCUBA dive, but I've not been able to. This game is realistic enough to give me a small taste of what it might be like. It simulates important effects of depth such as nitrogen narcosis and the need for a safety stop after a deep dive.So far, the game includes two maps: Chuuk Lagoon and Belize. (The Belize map is 500 clams, but you start with that much at the beginning.) Chuuk Lagoon includes the wreck of the Gosei Maru, a Japanese ship that sank there in World War Two. Belize includes the Mesoamerican Reef. The player is given a list of ""Things to Do"" at each site, such as swimming to special areas, finding underwater caches, spotting different kinds of wildlife, finding artifacts, and, at Belize, cleaning up trash. I thought the activities were interesting, though some of the collections are very hard to complete.The swimming feels natural, though it took me some time to get used to using the camera independently of the swim direction. The player can hit ""N"" to orient oneself, but I wish that there was also a button to just reset the camera. Also, the ""H"" key gives help for the keys but doesn't mention the ballast vest controls, CTL and SPC. A player would have a tougher time playing without that information.A couple of nitpicks: The Belize map has water currents, but they seem to flow randomly and without a pattern. I could be mistaken, though. Also, a sudden surface from a very deep dive still counts as a ""Successful dive"" even though in real life it would cause decompression sickness.The game does have microtransactions, but except for extra maps (in the future) it all seems to be cosmetic. There doesn't seem to be a noticeable difference in how the extra gear works. While some people hate microtransactions on principle, I personally have no problem with buying extra content.For the price, I would recommend this.Edit: My remarks to another review were deleted by the reviewer, so to answer those points again here:""30 second unskippable warning screen every time during launch"" and ""Extremely long loading times accompanied by obnoxious music, even on an SSD."" This is only the first time you play the game. The long loading time is because the maps are downloaded from the Internet when you first load it. The other reviewer must have just started the game a single time and then immediately deleted it.""Only ONE map is included in the game price."" It comes with one map and 500 ""clams,"" and then you can get the second one for 500 clams. I have two maps, and I didn't buy anything except the base game.			"

								Great SCUBA simulation game. It's pretty realistic for a early access game. It's worth the $12.99 price tag. Real life destinations , and with sponsers such as SCUBAPRO and Henderson you can't go wrong. They also donate a portion to Mission Blue.			"
