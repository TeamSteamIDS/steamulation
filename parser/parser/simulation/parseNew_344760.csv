Early Access Review
								I know what you're asking yourself: ""Is this game worth the $20 gamble?"" At the current state of this game, I'm going to have to say no. No, you should not buy this game, and here's a short explanation why you shouldn't.First, let me clarify that I'm not some squeaker that bought this game last week with daddy's credit card. I've played this game since alpha 5. I've witnessed the rise and fall of trolling hackers with admin-like abilities, and I remember the beginning of the Asian Invasion of torch jumpers. I've played/enjoyed/wasted over 1000 hours on this game.Reasons Why You Shouldn't Purchase This Game:1. Scenario: You play the game for 4 hours building a modest base with sound security. You log for the evening. The next day, you find that you are dead and your base is completely gone. You deduce that your base was raided while you were offline. You are angry, but you decide to build another base. The previous scenario happens another 3 or 4 times over the next week. Base building starts to seem trivial.The Devs solution to this problem is some sort of totem system that protects your crest and a small portion of your base while you are offline. That's almost akin to putting a bandaid on a broken leg. The problem lies with who is playing on the server, and by who, I mean region or more specifically, time zone. For example, if people from a completely different time zone (think China) play on a North American server consistently, the vast majority of people will be offline when the vast majority of the opposing time zone(r)s are on. This creates a raid imbalance of sorts. The solution would be region locking the serves. The Devs are trying to solve this is a round about way by booting people with high pings, but i'm sure there will be ways around that which leads me to my next point.2. Combat System: If you and the person you are fighting have a ping of 100ms or less, PvP is quite enjoyable. But, if you're fighting someone with a 200ms + ping (and yes this happens on a daily basis - that whole region thing again), the player with the high ping has a great advantage over you. Imagine getting headshot from 20 meters away.3. Seige Equipment: At this point, siege equipment no longer seems balanced. An average person with a trebuchet can destroy a decent base with thick walls in about 5 minutes. There was a time when a good castle could last a week or maybe 2. Nowadays, a castle usually doesn't survive one siege attempt.4. Player Base: Any way you cut it, the player base is shrinking. Thus, servers have been shutdown. If seems that if this trend continues, this game will not survive. I'm not sure if it will make it our of early access.Devs, if you are reading this, shields and bucklers will not protect us from hacks or lagging players from other regions. That is what is choking your game. Wake up before RoK is DoA. "

												362.7 Hours into the game and I will say that I love it. It's great. I love building things, I love raiding, I love fighting in PvP. The game has a long way to go but it's a blast. HOWEVER. This game is plagued by hackers. A problem that their Anti Cheat does not help with, nor do the developers really seem to care about the hacking problem. One day I was in my base organizing my resources and I hear my chests opening, it was just me in my base, I saw nobody. So I knew something was wrong, I check my chests...and they are all EMPTY. Next thing I know, I was insta killed. Everything was taken, and soon after the rest of the server was crying out that a hacker was killing them. All that progress, weeks of progress....lost. Another instance, is I was farming Iron, a man in full steel tries to kill me though I am much faster since I am naked and I actually got away. I was watching him though and I see him stop running, a few seconds after he stopped running I dropped dead and he proceeded to my dead body and looted my resources. Another isnta death. The hackers ruin the game, therefore I would not recommend this game in its current state UNLESS you plan on paying for your own server, which you shouldn't have to do to enjoy this game. You will lose hours and hours of progress to someone using a cheat and typing in an admin command that they should not have any access to, all in just a few seconds. I hope one day I can come back to this game, and maybe when the game isn't plagued with hacks and exploits I will recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Reign of Griefers and HackersWhen I first saw the trailers for this game I thought it looked amazing. An island with a throne. An objective of becoming the King. What I expected was a Game of Thrones with guilds of players working together to capture territory and to install their leader as King. Backstabbing and intrigue. And lone wolfs just trying to survive amidst it all. What I actually got was Lord of the Flies reenacted by the inmates of Aylesbury Young Offenders Institute.I started off, found some abandoned half destroyed ruin in a forest at the edge of the island and started building it up. Repaired the walls. Built new facilities inside. Got killed finding resources but I learned from it. Built iron doors. Built a stone outer wall. Things were going great!You use crests to mark territory, and I had a basic leather one in my base. This makes it so players cannot remove blocks from your house so if they want in they have to force entry.I had acquired the resources for an iron one which marks a wider amount of space so I could have a big thick stone wall around my base for protection. Unfortunately you can only have 1 crest at a time even if it's in your own territory so to replace the crest I had to remove my previous one and place a new one, accepting 10 minutes of complete vulnerability until it remarked the territory.So I remove my crest and put the new iron one down. At that moment 10 (not kidding) japanese players in iron armour came storming over, tore down my walls and took my items while I hid in my panic room. Stepping out I noticed the devestation and ina fury ran out in my steel armour with ym steel greatsword. Naturally this didn't end well for meI was then informed that these people are hackers who ruin the game for everyone and scrolling down through the reviews I noticed that this is a common problem.You know, up until that point I would have given this game another glowing review. But the destruction of hours and hours of my hard work have left me in an understandably bitter mood and the developers attitude towards the hacking problem doesn't help.So 8/10 before the hack and 0/10 post-hack due to the game being unplayable. DO NOT BUY!Edit: Against my better judgement I decided to give this game another try. Spent hours building a new base and then a new patch was released, wiping the servers and destroying my work. So I spent many more hours building another base, had to answer the phone while I was out finding resources and since your character goes to sleep in the game when you log out I logged back in to find I had been killed while I was away having a life. Got back to my base to find 2 lovely chaps had not only taken over my base but had also built a prison outside and put someone in it. Now my base was made out of wood with a top tier iron door outside. For a new player with limited access to resources (and since the stone quarry is swarming with heavily armed players looking for newbies to kill) this is basically the best I could achieve. I even put my crest inside the walls so they would have to tear them down to find it if they wanted to take over. Naturally this didn't stop these 2, whether it was hacks or high level equipment they somehow got in, found and destroyed my crest. Since the walls seemed intact they either rebuilt them exactly or they simply hacked it, most likely the latter.Tried to force entry into my own home and they both came out. My attacks passed through them doing no damage and eventually I died. Please for the love of god DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!Final Edit:So after I pulled myself together I decided to give it one final try with two objectives, retake my base and be crowned as Queen!I made a new base nearby my old one, gathered my power there then forced entry and retook it, leaving the miserable gits who took it handcuffed and sealed in a cobblestone box.With that unpleasantness out of the way I turned my attention towards the throne at which point the server promptly shut down, one of about 2/3 of all the servers that were shut down!So I joined another server, built a new base, then when I logged back in later all traces of my base had vanished and I was now playing as a fat bald man....Sensing a pattern I decided not to bother building anything anymore since between server wipes, game breaking errors, servers shutting down and high level players you are lucky if anything you build lasts a few hours.Someone had built a cobblestone wall on the bridge to the castle but I was able to get around it by building a skybridge. Passing through there I was immediately ganged up on and killed by 2 steel clad people. The only other 2 people on the server. Apparently they just wait there with the patience of the ancients for someone to log in, get through or around their stone wall, and then get killed by them both.So I jumped servers and found a castle with a massive wall on it and a lot of player activity. I decided to get around this by gathering many cheap blocks and building a staircase behind the castle up to the top, no mean feat since the rock the castle stands on must be about 200 blocks tall! Fortunately I didn't need to waste much time on this because I ran into a bug where every approx 5 minutes my screen goes black forcing me to log out and in again, and if I was in the sea I drop to 40 fathoms below it and drown before I can get back up againNext server had nothing on the bridge but a couple of steel clad foul mouthed kiddies. After getting massacred the first time I came up with a plan. I made a bed and ran past them, placed it down behind a rock then did an Obi Wan and lowered my club as they slaughtered me with cries of noob and nigerian.So they ran off back to the front of the bridge to await their next victim while I respawned at the bed. I then spent 45 minutes clubbing my way through the wooden wall they had built to block entrance to the castle and seized the throne before they could get back to stop me! At that moment I felt something like overcoming an especially tough boss in Dark Souls!I think I know now why the game ended up so far from it's vision. The game trailers give a fair amount of attention to the presences of ropes, shackles, cages and torture devices, which are clearly present for the sake of bullying and griefing. Of course these things do exist in the Medieval era and I gave it little thought. But when a bully watches that trailer they will be drawn to the game by the promise of these griefing tools.In practice they lack the patience to craft the necessary facilities to produce these things, and simply travel in gangs attacking lone players and destroying their work with their clubs. What's more the game artwork displays caracatures of bloated troll like men acting like monkeys and the in-game character customisation option not only allows for exaggerated anatomy, but the pvp meta is of a pitch black midget with maximum size arms for the smallest target to hit with the longest reach. In the end the game advertising appeals to exactly these sorts of people who drive away everyone else and leave the community a toxic cesspool.So I suppose in the end this game is like Dark Souls meets Lord of the Flies, except the hollows are obscenity spewing bullying ganging adolescents, and the bosses are server wipes, servers closing and game breaking bugs. That all said, I'm glad I can finally uninstall this ordeal with peace of mind that I didn't let it break me :)			"

												I don't write reviews for every game I own, like or dislike.        However, in this case, I feel it is only fair to let people know a thing or two.What ROK is right now, is the end result.      In that point, the dev's have been honest when they said they won't be adding or changing anything from now on. This game has been abandoned.       The dev's will try to tell you otherwise, which just makes them look delusional.This game had potential,  but was let down big time.      I can safely say the game was running better in Alpha 6 than after ""Release"".For peope finding that hard to believe and want to know more;  read on.    -I won't mention cheats, eventhough it was the dev's fault not even thinking about any sort of anti-cheat for a CLIENT-based game.  Hacks were running hot in this game and made many players quit, but almost every online game out there gets those.-- The only things added during the 1 year Early Access Alpha worth mentioning:    +Ping protected Servers: ( important as this game runs client side based, which basically means,  the higher your ping, the more you lag, the more advantage you have)+Siege damage adjustment: (So building which took 30hours to build won't be shot to pieces in 15minutes)+ Crest Totems: (so people can't destroy the totem if crested, and therefore not just put the entire base in their pocket, instead of raiding)Time between server wipes increased to around 1 Month, from previous 7days.+A second map.+A very small change to the guild system, which still is useless.-Fishing and Farming  ( Fishing being very important for a PvP-Building game apparently)Thats it.    Also worth mentioning these things have taken close to a year to be added. And there has been no improvment to the King System, or any end game content added.Everything else, like flute tunes and flower dresses can hardly be called content.None of the game mechanics or end game content the EA playerbase wanted and suggested was done.The base game still is the same as at start.  Nothing other has changed from EA launch.  Just more lag.You say ""oh wait they are still doing bug fixes and performance updates every other month""Game breaking bugs and glitches have taken more than half a year to even be addressed (Like the popular ""bag on head wall glitch"" )There still is game breaking glitches in the game  (item duping for example)These often don't get fixed, just altered.   And every time there is a patch, new bugs appear and performance gets a little worse.I myself had some great fun with this game and hoped for improvment until ""Releas"" announcement.   But after it has become clear that the game will never improve, (when they announced months before ""Release"" that Fishing and Farming will be the only things they will implement)  there is nothing that would make me install this game ever again.    Waste of time at the best.In my personal opinion and from what I have seen here, CodeHatch are a bunch of amateurs.Not even the top pinned forum thread ""Community Suggestions"" has been unpinned or deleted.  After close to a year saying nothing will be added anymore.       - This isn't just laziness,   it is to make people, checking out the forum before buying the game, think that it is still being worked on.Only a matter of time until this low populated game is fully dead.Great potential turned into great failure.Edit: Still the same mess and the only people getting banned are the ones who mention the dupes still in the game.   Also there is still the community suggestion thread pinned at the top.			"

								Did not buy this game, it was gifted to me.I do not trust devs to finished thisThey're other game seen on steam ""StarForge"" was claimed to be finished (wouldn't even call it an early beta release) in late september 2014.StarForge was no where near completed and the dev's have a reputation for releasing unfinished material.I would not recommend this game. If you are looking for a medieval combat game, I would recommend Chivalry: Medeival Warfare. And if you are looking for a survival game with base building and very similar features to this, I would recommend Rust (even though I have not put many hours into Rust since that major update while back)edit:The fact that you need at minimum a 64-bit computer with an Intel core i5, a full 6GB of RAM and a GPU that appears no where near as low as I would expect for something that looks visually this unappealing. My computer is well over the recommended requirements and I got horrendous amounts of lag when looking at certain areas (not even on the top graphics settings).ConclusionI would not recommend this game or any of the developers work.This game along with many other survival games (often made simply in unity, and with assets taken from the unity asset store) has ""POTENTIAL"" and with what Steam is becoming now, potential just doesn't seem good enough for anything in my opinion.Warning this bit starts to rant more on what gets into steam!There are a large amount of games being greenlit as jokes e.g. Grass Simulator. (Who at steam allowed that crap to get into steam after it being greenlit???)VALVE, WHERE IS YOUR CONTENT MODERATION?! Where have your standards gone?- Sinister Sloth Minister (John Key of New Zealand)edit 2 (if some of this does not make sense read comments):I will now point out, survival games would not be my favourite genre (my favourite would be story rich and in-depth games), I do however continue to play the DayZ mod for ArmA II (I would compare Reign of Kings to Rust but I have not played Rust all too much sinch it's major update a while ago, so I am not in a position to compare the two) and for me Reign of Kings does not live up to the same enjoyment, exploration and accomplisment as DayZ does.Yes Reign of Kings does have very unique features (the taxing system and it trys to bring a large amount of roleplay to the game, but unfortunatly I was not able to see this), these bring the game a great deal of potential but unfortunatly it just wasn't executed as well as it could have been.This is entirely my opinion. Feel free to share yours, but please don't go all fanboy on me though ;)edit 3 (so many edits :D. Some positive points! Also this might be messy as I am tired and hungry :P):As MrJoe has pointed out in a comment, I was incorrect with some of my claims about game updates and content updates (there was one a few days ago).MrJoe also points out that Reign of Kings is in a much better state than other Alphas on Steam (main reason why I am not so fond of Steam's ""Early Access"") like DayZ standalone.As I have not played much of this game [Reign of Kings] for a while, I have been told this game has been changing in each update.I may not recommend this game in it's current state as there are other survival games that are in a better state than this. But I will revisit this review much later to determine whether this game deserves my recommendation or now.Also there are many negative reviews based around their experiences playing the game (e.g. blah blah, base raided and everything lost, blah blah), I would like to address these reviews. These people are all talking about gameplay issues, in this games state this is going to be an issue for some people due to the game not being fully balanced (gameplay issues with safe zones, clan flag (I think it's called that, can't remember the name off the top of my head) and other bugs). These reviews are mostly ignorable as I would assume that these would be some of the dev's concerns.- Sinister Sloth Minister (John Key of New Zealand)p.s. there will be no more edits :P			"

								With almost 200 hours in game I'll say that the concept is great and very fun at times.  However, unless you are online 24/7 or have an international guild, you cannot maintain a base.  My friends and I have build good multi layered cobblestone+ bases that are completely leveled when we log off and go to sleep.  A steel crest with 6 layers of cobblestone will not prevent it.The developers need to come up with a solution for the middle of the night base destruction.  For instance, in real life if you were asleep, and someone attacks your base, you'd wake up.  But when you log off the game and go to bed, you're screwed.  There is no balance for this.  It's simply not fun to spend a week gathering stone, iron and wood to build one of the strongest bases in the game just to have it all wiped out because someone else doesn't go to bed the same time you do.  Ideas:1.  How about Once a person logs off, the block hit-points are incrementally increased by a factor of 120.  Each hour you are offline they decrease by a factor of 5.  So blocks with normal hitpoints of 3000 would have 360,000 for the first hour - 180,000 hit-points 6 hours later and 3,000 hitpoints after 24 hours.  This would help both the legitimate seasoned players as well as the new players defend against griefers and midnight attackers.  2.  Implement a killcam so if your base is leveled in the middle of the night, you can at least see who did it and how they did it.  I have a sneaking suspicion the last base level was not legit and possibly a hack.  My friend said they used gunpowder kegs (which is currently disabled in this version of the game.)  But there's no way to know because there's no telling what happened.  Hint: even in medieval times people would know who leveled a town.  Why not in this game?So unless you like gathering resources and building bases just to have them destroyed immediately I can't recommend this game in it's current state. "

												I do really enjoy this game, i love the building aspect, i love the raiding, i love the pvp, i love the idea of a king. This game is great.BUT.... SadlyThis game HAD soo much potential, soo much going for it. The game just died. Mostly the reason that this game died is the so called ANTI-Cheat, as far as i'm concerned this ""ANTI-Cheat"" doesn't even exist. It is simply terrible and easily bypassed by every hack ever created for this game... You spent hours upon hours on your base, you get the feeling. Phew, all this time has gone. My base is done, it's looking GREAT!! Now let's get to focusing on raiding... However all it takes is one ""Chinese ♥♥♥♥er"" To join the server you are playing on and ""Walk through your walls..."" Why do they do this? They do it to WASTE your time... They have unlimited access to every recource they could possible want yet... They still feel the need to be♥♥♥♥♥♥head and destroy your whole base, all your work, all you hard efort, all your time... GONE, no getting it back... I've experienced this personally... Was in a guild with my friend so just 2 of us.. We played on an official server... We put around 150+ish hours into a base on the stormwall map, it was a great achievement for us, we were proud of what we had achieved! We raided everyone that talked smack to us. We loved to farm, we just fired trebuchet and trebuchet shot from our base and we had a blast, we were loving it. Having the most fun we've had in Ages! One person by the name ""Haha You're Dead"" Stood outside our base and waved at us, we waved back and said ""Hiya, hows it going?"" The reply we got... Was recieving packets to make us freeze (DDOSS) When we stopped ""Lagging"" we were both dead... We started to panic at this point, respawned on our beds... Got to our war room, and got our gear for fighting... While doing soo, the guy walked through our walls, he came directly towards us and said ""Your time has come... Time for everything you have done to come CRASHING DOWN!!!"" He was histerical... Laughing his♥♥♥♥♥♥off... We were devastated... He turned his DDOSS back on and killed us... By the time we regained control, our base... he had destroyed our crest... and placed his own... At this point we were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ we rage quit. We logged on the next day to take a look to see what he had done... The base GONE... He had won, the game, the developers had FAILED... This is honestly pathetic, they rushed the game into BETA, never mind RELEASE!? An overview to the paragraph above:Do NOT buy this game, UNLESS you want to have fun with it, explore the GOOD aspects of this game and ENJOY it.. But when a hacker comes strolling along to your base, know, if you read this review you've been warned... I would really love to start playing this game again... But i don't think my mind will ever recover my will to play it. Thanks for reading if you did, hope this helped you if you were thinking about making a purchase on this game.-Liam			"

								This is what codehatch does... they take your money in early access and they run off with it. The reason why the roadmap for this game is so foggy is simply because its codehatch, the same developers who promised so much with Starforge and by the time they gave up and stamped V1.0 on it, it became the biggest regret of any gamer. That being said, they can stamp V1.0 on Reign of Kings whenever they feel like it because they tried so hard to avoid promising us anything.♥♥♥♥ codehatch #idgt			"

								First Spawn:I find myself on a beautiful beach. I see a campfire and some dancing figures in the distance. I run towards them, hoping to make new friends and explore the world together.I approach them, cautiously. My time in DayZ has left me a little gun-shy in these survival games. They spammed a few wave emotes, so I came in closer and thought I'd join them.Queue Admiral Ackbar, ""IT'S A TRAP!"" One of them tossed several spears into my chest while the other clubbed me into submission. Well played, you savages. Spawn 2:Decide to completely avoid the beach area, and attempt to find shelter with the high king. Surely, he would not deny shelter to a loyal citizen of his kingdom. I run to the bridge, not seeing a single soul on my way there.I hop over their little hedge fence with little effort. It was cute though. So, +1 point for aesthetically-pleasing, but -1 point for lack of actual defensive-usefulness. I was greeted by the king's loyal guards, fully decked out in metal armor and weapons. I un-equip my club-like-thing, and yell into my mic, ""I am here to serve my king! Long may he reign!"" One was walking around me, judging me, and seeing if I would be a problem. The other one equipped this long, brown item into his hands. ""My word, good sir, that is a fine rope you have there!""Next thing I know, I am a ragdoll, completely left to the whim of my capturer. The laughter I brushed off early, should have been my early warning. He took me to their stockade, and locked me in. I was helpless. More laughter. Then, the one guard equipped the largest axe I have seen in game yet. And proceeded to chop my head off, despite my pleas against such an idea. I then heard them say, ""Leave his body, as a warning to the rest."" Before I respawned, I saw the king apologize for his guard's poor behavior, and said he was ""new"" and ""still in training."" Followed by a strange term that must be for the upper echelon's of royalty in game. He used ""lol"". Surely, he meant ""Lots of Luck"" in my future lives. God bless him. Long may he reign, indeed. Spawn 3:Spawn on beach. Run inland, not towards castle. I find a huge wooden shelter that must have taken hours to build. I find a stray block on one wall, and jump into their base. Nothing fancy inside. But wait...A man in inside this base. He is sleeping. Had this been one of my first 2 spawns, I may have gone, ""Oh, my word. This is your fort. My apologies."" And then promptly left. But this was not my first spawn. And this was not my second spawn. Third time's the charm, eh?I equip the beginning club, and proceed to bash this poor man's head in. His blood had lined the walls of his establishment. I loot his corpse/bag thing.Jesus, this man was packing. Armor, food, water, weapons. He had it all. Unfortunate that he had to die this way. Oh well. Should have checked to see if he was truly safe before bedding himself. I took all his stuff. I equipped the armor and sword, and then hopped back outside.Another armor-equipped man came running past shortly after. He complimented me. ""That's a nice house you have there.""Why yes, yes it is. I am learning.I am evolving. Soon, all your bases are belong to me. I am Sir Gruffles, and this...This is only the beginning.TL;DR: Died horribly in first 2 spawns. Learned from mistakes, killed sleeping man, and took his loot in third life.10/10: Can't wait to play again.Update 1:Spawn 4:My knowledge is growing. I ran to an open field, built a hatchet, and began farming wood.Built a workstation and a campfire, and let it be open to all who approach for their use.Met some nice peasants, who seemed friendly enough. I taught them the ways of the craft.We built armor, fed on the meat of sheep and rabbits, and defended our little plot of land against several attempts of savagery. It turns out, they were no savages. They were knights in disguise! Sent by his royal doucheness to stop any and all attempts at overthrowing him! It was this, that sparked the revolution. We were a peaceful unit, thrown into the hell that is war. And he would pay dearly. We formed a guild, with me as its leader (probably cause I had a bit more knowledge of crafting than the others, and I was tallest). We were known throughout the land as, Band of Sirs. We upgraded our benches and fires, until we could work with iron. We crafted better armor, and real weapons! The revolution was at hand!We waited for the cover of nightfall to make the approach on the castle. With weapons in hand, my brothers and I stormed the bridge! There was no resistance at first....until we were faced with the worst enemy possible...a wooden wall and gate. We started striking the door with all our might, in an attempt to break it down.Apparently, the king was right behind it! Because he and his 2 guards were laughing at our attempts to get through... The next thing we knew, they were on top of their post and their defense began. The rain of the javelins! My main were getting pierced with their wooden spikes of death. Our blood was creating a lake of death and despair the likes of which this realm has never withnessed. But we also planted some of our own javelins firmly into the nads of our dear king! But he got cocky after that! With the king sword in hand, he jumped from that safety of his gate, right into the middle of my guild!Apparently, his highness' sword is rather....long....and hurty. With one swing of his weapon, the first of my men perished. He fought to his dying breath. The other 2 of my men yelled out in pain, yet continued to throw spears into the king. I unsheated my iron sword and engaged!I parryed the next swing of his sword, and took a swing of my own. It connected! The king was bleeding! We had hope! Until his highness ran past me, and cut down another member of my guild. The next thing I knew, the last member of my guild was also dead. It was just me and the king. I lasted longer than I thought I would. I parryed many of his swings. Alas, my stamina was too low to maintain a proper defense. I would fall, alongside my brothers. Upon death, the king declared he was one more swing from my sword away from death. He honored our brave attempts at overthrowing him, but making taxes 0% for a day. Well played, your majesty. For now.Spawn 5 in comments :DWhile Spawn 5 story is def worth a read, here's a TL;DR:Said F IT to strategy. Ran to gate again. Found traitor from guild as gate guard. King saw us with nothing, said we werent a threat, and let us in. Bashed another sleeping guard's head in. Took armor and weapons. Started usurping. One guard and traitor came to stop me. Traitor yells out ""ITS A DOUBLE CROSS!"" And attacked other guard! We double teamed him and killed him! THE KING WAS HAVING CONNECTION ISSUES! I usurped again and I became the new king!ALL HAIL KING GRUFFLES!Long may I reign.I thank the men of Band of Sirs for their loyalty and sacrifice. You will not be forgotten.(3/24/15) Uploaded 2 highlights to Twitch channel and YouTube. Spawns 4 & 5 are shown. Hope you all can get a few more laughs from them ^.^. Look for ""Attempt at the Throne"" and Sir Gruffles.			"

								- Spawn in with a wood stick- Befriend a pack of wild midgets who claim themselves as the ""Ungos""- Travel with the Ungo Tribe until one of them screams ""REVOLUTION!""- Go to the King's Palace and somehow take down a guard in full steel- I pick up his armor and weapon- Go to the throne where the king is sitting- The Ungos try to kill the king, but they are no match for his mighty sword- Scream ""YOU TYRANT!""- Get into heated battle with King- Right before I slay the tyranous King, he jumps off of the ledge trying to fall into water- Spills his royal blood on the rocks and falls into the ocean where he drowns- I go up to the throne with my newfound pride- Claim the throne, and name the realm ""The Ungo Lands""- The Ungos reunite with me, and for their loyalty I give them taxed equipment to make them my royal knights- Ungo Tribesmen start building defenses for me- I tax the citizens 20% (highest amount of tax)- A revolution spurs to which my Ungos put down immediately with the swift action of their steel battle axes- I recruit 4 more people to be my knights and I dress them in full steel armor- Become an evil king and pillage my people's lands- Loyalist group arises favoring the previous king- ""The War of Two Swords"" occurs- Destroy their castle and lands while freeing their PoWs and putting them into my army- Get assassinated in my sleep, the Ungo Leader assumes the throne and exiles meI now wonder if my revolution was to put down a tyrannical king, or to make another one.UPDATE:Originally, this game was the bee's knees; exactly how I imagined it to be. However, as the game's age went from a day old (bought the game on day 2 of release) to a week old to two weeks old...people started cracking the code and made *dun dun dun* hacking clients.To be honest, even though this game is Early Access it doesn't give the developers an excuse to not implement an anti-hack system. I know that they didn't expect this game to blow up as it has, but on the same token if I were a game developer I would add VAC or EAC before releasing.I haven't seen many hackers (quite frankly only speed hackers) but I have gone AFK to find my home that I spent 3 hours on (people that say they spent 10 hours on a house are overexagerating, 3 hours is sufficient for a good home) and my inventory completely ravaged and destroyed. This was due to a hacker.If any of you that are reading this are very well experienced into video games (i.e. 4+ years) you would know that ""hackers"" are 12 year old kids that think they're anonymoose for searching up ""reign of kings hacks"" on Google and downloading something off of ♥♥♥♥. Well, the real hackers (the ones who code the hacks) are usually 20 years plus, and probably make those downloadable files full of trojans, so fear not; the prepubescents and little kids are probably ruining their Dad's desktop. However, with the many hacks available, and not every single one being malicious, it's hard for all hackers to see problems with their computer in the future, so no justice will come their way. There will always be hackers if there is a malfunction in the game. The fix? Don't play the game for another week or so. If Code}{atch doesn't implement anti-cheat within the week, drop the game and never buy from them again, as this would be their second strike. I will personally be wiping my story above and making my review negative if they don't add anti-cheat.To the hackers out there, hacking a video game and ruining another's good time and $20.00 is usually a sign of extreme insecurity, boredom (means you have no friends if you're hacking a game like this), and jerkking off for the rest of your life. Just don't. Play the game like the rest of us, you'll have more fun. TLDR; hackers can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves			"

												Hey, you want to know how devoted these devlopers are to their games? Check out Star Forge. It was a game getting crowd funded on Indie GoGo. It got funded and was releasing alpha versions and stuff. There were gonna be entirely persistant worlds, customizable bases and guns and ect. Then after a while the entire development for the game and everything got dropped, and it fell into darkness. Then out of no where, Reign of Kings appears about a year later. It was made by the same developers, using the same god damned engine. Except they just didn't include the stuff that was too hard to build. They just reskinned their game and made some quick cash. They just look for money and they are the bottom scum of game development. Do NOT give them your money. They aren't fixing any of the bugs on this game, they just say they did to get more cash. NEVER buy this game.			"

												Well now that the games out I will write a review. I had been holding out wanting to see the final vision of this title and as of today here is is. If you don't want to read; would I recommend this game? No. Is it a bad game.... well... yes and no. The game has a very nice concept and that is what attracted me to it in the 1st place. The building is simple (mine craft style), combat can be fun (think chivalry but a dumber version of it) and it looks ok enough for the price. Problem is the game just feels incomplete. Hackers run rampant across the worlds, combat is buggy at the best of times (hence the “can be fun”), there are many exploits that have been around since the start and it is over all unbalanced. On a more personal note the development started taking a weird turn towards the last 5 months when they though it was a good idea to add things like fishing and farming to a castle build/siege and sword fighting game. There are many other glaring issues and features that could have been looked at. Also there is no real benefit to doing either of these when you can kill and cook wild animals or just live off berries (which I did constantly). At the end of the day after the population went from thousands to hundreds they slapped a done badge on it and called it a day. This game could have been good, but fell very short I'm sorry to say.

								Been playing it for 14 hours now. What I like about it:- Pretty graphics- Some nice ambient sounds --birds chirping, the ocean, thunder (think DayZ)- Build castles- Claim Territory by placing a banner in your building -- others cant build in your borders (nice so people can't hop your walls)- Survival - forage for food, get water, hunt animals- The King - one person in the server can be a king by claiming the throne - they can be overthrown of course. The king gets to set taxes that other players pay as they gather materials, high taxes really motivate people to overthrow the king, but also make it a lot harder for to collect materials.- Proximity voicechat- When you log out you turn into a ""Sleeper"", ie your avatar is replaced with a guy in a sleeping bag and people can kill you if they can reach you. So log out in the safety of your territory or find a really good hiding place.- You can tie people up with rope and imprison them or send them to the gallows- You can make crossbows, bows, siege equipment- Weapons, armor, and blocks are all tiered (wood, leather, stone, iron, steel | dirt, grass, clay, wood, stone, stone slab)What I don't like about it- The combat is like Chivalry - good thing is you can block and there is a stamina bar. But many fights end up as run around the person hitting or kiting. You can choose which way you swing horizontally, but it's purpose is more so you don't hit a wall or tree while you swing. No directional blocking.- Very little inventory space and the containers chests are quite small too.Not many negatives. I've only had one game breaking bug occur in 14 hours. A couple smaller bugs. It's a fun game and for $20 bucks I've already got my moneys worth.Today two knuckleheads tried to break down my gate. I stood on my wall shooting arrows at them. One guy managed to doublejump (it's possible to do against blocks) on to my wall and began running around my base. I ran behind him slashing him with my 2h steel axe. After he was dealt with I went back to the 2nd guy still hacking away at my gate and asking him to leave. He demanded a fair fight so I obliged and engaged him in a duel. After a few well time blocks and swings, he was dispatched as well.Went back inside and made myself a chicken leg. Good game.			"

								Day 1. Spawned in, chopped up some sleeping guy on a beach, got full steel amour and a steel sword. went and killed a helpless moose, logged off in a bush.Day 2. Spawned back in after a nice poo, spawned in dead. Some little freak killed me in my sleep... I then logged off for the day enraged.Day 3. Came on a lovely populated server with some nice thoughts of my life, met some nice young lads who invited me to their guild, after hours of fun, they enslaved me and threw me in a cage (I felt heartbroken)Then 3 or more people come running down from the hills screaming 'Allah Akbar'. I don't even know what that means, but they killed the people who enslaved me, and then roped me up and took me for a walk. After they got to their base, they asked if I would like to join them, I had slight trust issues at that time, but I decided to listen. We got along quite nicely, and killed some randoms for fun! So that concluded my day, so I logged off.Day 4. Spawned in with a giant hole in our base and 5 of the members repairing it, apparently a 'Treb' blew a hole in the wall, but my mates killed them all, which I missed the action... sadly. We then went to pay the king a visit, the King, Unknowingly, placed a bounty on our guilds heads, and the next minuet there were HEAPS of people from EVERY angle shooting rubbish at our base, trebs, balistas, it was fully spooky man. Long story short, we all died.Day 5. Spawned in, rode a lovely rocking horse, and got roped secretly by a naked man, and thrown off a bridge.10/10, love the game, would write more, but honestly, no one cares anyways, cheers lads.			"

												TL/DR DO NOT BUY THIS PEICE OF CRAP....Changing my review now as the game has passed release stage. To be honest they have made some improvements to the game. Not really anything groundbreaking or worthy of being mentioned, but they changed a few things.But that being said the game is filled with cheating issues still and with only 2 maps that don't even have random recource generation it's kind of pathetic.Good luck enjoying the public servers. 1st 2 hours, I build a nice little camp, have some walls started and out of no where 3 guys appeared and killed me and then proceeded to tear down my entire place and take everything I owned. But determined to persevere I pushed on and started anew, convinced that I was in a location not many would travel through. I'm minding my own business when I just die. No one is nearby, just die. So I try to contact an admin, next thing I know I'm banned. No reason given, just banned.Well determined to still enjoy this game a little bit more I move to private custom servers. They are a little better, some of the servers honor the non kos rules but some don't even have admins in game so many are running amok and the larger servers are pretty much entirely russian so no chance of communication there. So I start my own private locked server and after getting it all set up I set out to build a giant castle in the middle of the new map... I get about an hour into it and the game drops to the desktop and the server disapeared as well... I then decided to sumarily uninstal the game and write this review.-1/10 for basically everything.

								PROS:1. When everything is working as it should, the combat is extremely satisfying, especially for us gore lovers. Want to lop off your opponents head? How's about their arms and legs? Even after all that is said and done, anything that they were carrying is now yours for the taking! ( The friends that I do play with have told me this game's combat is similar to that of Chivalry's, so if you like that I'm sure you'll enjoy this )2. I'm not one for long drawn out executions, but if you are, this game has just about every tool you'll need to make your enemies wish they'd never messed with you! Once you've captured your opponent, you'll have a list of humiliation/torture/execution devices to chose from. From the gallows to the guillotine, you name it, they've got it.3. Perhaps you want to play some music before battle or just insure that everyone knows of your presence. If so, you should go and craft yourself a long horn, and maybe even a drum or two. That'll keep em on their feet!4. Although I'm not much into roleplay, you'd have to be blind to not see the amount of potential this game has for it. If you're into rp, you'll find an abundance of community servers just for you.5. The character creator is incredibly goofy. ( Which isn't a bad thing in this case ) From the tallest, skinniest, big chin...iest person you've ever seen. To the most pregnant, hulkiest, shortest guy you'll never meet. You can really make just about whatever kind of character you want.CONS:1. The video shown may include large scale ffa combat, but you'd be hard pressed to find a single situation that doesn't involve a 10v1. ( Unless you're with friends ) 2. The combat itself is incredibly inconsistant, especially with the hardcore desync issues that are still present within the game. Even in servers where my ping is below 10, it can get pretty bad. It's basically, ""Whoever is laggier wins"". ( And that's after all of the updates leading up to version 10 )3. Despite the recent efforts from Code}{atch to stop cheaters from ruining the game, they can still be found in just about every server you join. That being said, there have been several instances of people being banned for using modified dll's.4. The engine isn't the greatest. ( Or rather; they're use of the engine isn't the greatest ) You'll find people double jumping and sometimes triple jumping directly over your walls. From boosting onto another person's head, to making siege workshops and hopping clean over a 15 block high wall. ( Even if they're within your crest's borders )5. Fighting anywhere near your opponents base is almost always fruitless. If you do any significant amount of damage to them, they'll simply run into their base and instantly close the door behind them. ( Sometimes having two or more doors in order to trap you inside ) Most recently people have been excluding doors from their builds entirely. Simply removing their own blocks to enter/exit the base, then replacing them.6. The building mechanics can be and most often are, abused. Have a trebuchet and want to tear down someone's walls? Too bad, they can rebuild everything you've destroyed faster than you can reload. ( Unless you have several people helping you. Even then it's tedious ) Lest you have an unimaginable amount of ammo for your trebuchet, good luck making any progress.7. This game is riddled with performance issues at the moment. Code}{atch has been releasing updates to try and fix that, so hopefully this shouldn't be a problem in the future.TLDR;If you can't tolerate the sometimes inconsistant combat, bad and occasionally horrible mechanics,""hackers""/cheaters, several glitches present in each update ( Often seen in Early Access games ), and in most cases a terrible community ( Based on which server you join ), I'd stay away from this game until it's had some time to progress.Keep in mind; this review is based on the current state of the game ( Version 10 ) and things are bound to change in the future!

								I have to say im starting to see what those that bought starforge were warning us about, i bought this game almost 1 week ago and i must say i love it. Been running with 5 friends and we're doing well. And then the hackers hit, Steel crest (prevents others building near your base), 4 thick t6 wall(currently the best wall) that runs 10x18x16 and yet the King and 2 of his men not only get on our roof but into our base which has no entry points (all stairs are bricked off).We had made a few raid attempts against the king and lost which i assumed was him simply being a well combat versed player. But now i realise on almost all occassions we have had the upper hand during combat the server crashes (Widely known to be caused by dupers now)(including when they raided an ally and one of our members snuck up and stole the throne, no suprise server crash). Im hoping the devs will get into this asap because while one failed start may be accepted by most (Starforge) i guarantee you will be washed up if theres a repeat and no future attempt will get so much as a second glance.Guess we wait and see if the devs actually bother to do anything about this major game spoiler.Sad to say but if too much time goes by with no changes consider this game lost all.

I'm sorry but I'll have to downvote this game, hope you understand it.I've been following this game since the earlier stages and always watched it grow up and it's doing really well, but the main reason why everyone is getting upset at the game is the Chineses. I'm sorry, but, it's true, for some odd reason every single chinese gamer likes to get in American servers and bring their 90000 ping and hit you from 800ft away, some ppl say they're hackers, a few of them do indeed hack but most of them are just lagging really bad, the best fix Code}{atch could do to this and get the game's popularity higher (and also get more ppl to purchase) is to region lock EVERY official server for China so Chineses cannot join. Yes, they should do this, before complaining keep in mind alot of games do not allow ppl from some countries to play, deal with it.EDIT: This game is Donald Trump simulator, building server walls agaisnt China.

												This game has a ton of potential to be something awesome. I had purchased it when it first released into Alpha. I have had some great times playing this game. The Devs suck, they have basically abandoned this game and cut their losses. They don't care whatsoever about the community. There has been literally no changes since the day I bought this games year(s) ago. Love the concept, hate the devs and their lack of updates, communication, really anything for that matter. Sell the rights to someone who will actually work on the game, ffs.Summary:Devs are horribleGame has been abandoned by devsGreat conceptChinese Hackers everywhere "

												 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is going - slowly but surely - the same way as Starforge did; abandoned by the developer, with substandard game mechanics, and populated by hackers and other such filth. Be wary of this developer, as they tend to do this♥♥♥♥♥♥often.   "

Early Access Review
								I'm going to put all the developers past issues of other releases aside before I critique this game. I do however recommend you do your research on ANY developer before personally supporting them in an Early Access title. If their past issues put a huge red flag up for you I do not blame you and I recommend you look elsewhere regardless of the games current state.That being said let's critque the actual current build of the game. I am writing this on 3/11/2015 and have had press access for around a week now.Crafting: Crafting is really well done and the amount of things you can craft right now is honestly amazing for an early access title. Pretty much everything you see in the world alive/dead can be used for some sort of recipe. There is siege weapons, torture weapons, and a decent selection of major building blocks for castle/house creation. Another HUGE plus is that crafting stations like fireplaces and benches are able to be picked up which makes moving very easy.The World: Although quite small the world does feel well thought out. There is some absolutely beautiful scenery in this game and I find certain parts of the world hold rarer resources (for example one side of the map may have an abundance of rocks but no flax to be found). I like that it makes moving pretty much needed.Combat: Having only tested combat once I am definitely not a guru on this subject but it did feel quite decent, latency definitely affects projectiles quite drastically and might be an issue for some people expecting super smooth combat. Overall with melee I had no major complaints but it can be improved.Building: Building just fine, my only complaint is if you misplace a block theres no delete option and you have to sit there for 5 minutes whacking it to get rid of it so take you time placing them. This would also make rearranging a nightmare.Politics: Politics atleast right now seem very basic with one king ruler who can impose a tax and claim the land name. You also get a crown and very decent sword. I did not see any way to form a guild so I cannot mention much about that now.Gathering: Gathering in this game is very well done. Upgraded or gathering-focused weapons yield more per hit and the way trees fall and break is very rewarding, you visually can see how much is left in a resource and it makes gathering kind of enjoyable.Survival: This is where I think this game went a little wrong. I don't see the need for survival mechanics personally. It is very hard at the start unless you have a good spawn point with an abundance of berries. I would rather see future developement focus on political warfare and creation aspects, I feel survival will feel more like a nuisance than fun for most casual players.Sever Size: Currently the server size is EXTREMELY small to keep with the map size I assume (I think it's 28 players). This is a huge downside to me, when it comes to medieval warfare you want huge battles with 100's of people. I definitely hope they plan on expanding the map and increasing the server size in the future.Overall I really enjoyed my time and I think this game had great potential but it's very hard to judge in it's current state how it will play out as a political controlling type game. I do recommend this title but I warn of the risks associtated with this companies past games.Here are some videos of my experiences if you prefer video format.

Early Access Review
								Day 1:- Created character with similar looks of a Potato- Named him Spudicus- Spawned on a beach with nothing but a handy stump and g string to cover my potato parts.- Started hitting tree for wood but I was captured by naked man with wooden mask.- Dragged through the ocean and across beaches onto an island and put into a cage.Day 2:- Forced to sing songs and play Darude Sandstorm on a flute for the tribal savages.- Was beaten if I missed a note or skipped one.- Every now and again they would tie me up and drag me to a pillory and begin whipping me and calling me a dirty spud.- Soon realising I was slowly dying by starvation since they only fed me water I begged for mercy.Day 3:- As the tribal men were off in the woods a tiny skinny black man randomly appeared.- I instantly got the small black mans attention and began begging for him to let me out. - As the tiny black man was attempting to break the cage which held me a tribal man came out of no where and began fighting with the tiny black man.- Tiny black man won the fight with wooden spears and then broke my cage.- Soon after another tribal man appeared and began to attack us, our tools were unmatched and the tiny black man ran out of spears.Day 4:- After running through forrest which seemed like forever I had lost track of the tiny black man and was still being chased by the tribal man.- Came across a knight in steel wearing a crown and wielding a mighty swirly sword.- After one blow at the tribal man delivered by this crowned knight the savage was dead, off with his head!- The knight introducded himself as Werthin the king of the realm.- I pledged my life for the king and in return would always be by his side until the end.Day 5:- King Werthin had made me his royal knight and I shall never leave his side.- I was given the greatest steel armour and weapons made by the King himself.- I am now known as Sir Spudicus.Day 6:- Together King Werthin and I began fortifying the Ancient Thrown to keep back the relentless savages below.- After many and endless attacks all attempts to protect the thrown seemed futile.- The end was near and now myself and King Werthin had many spears embedded into our bodies.Day 7:- The raids appeared to have came to a hault for a while however we could see many lights on the bridge heading our way.- Realising we were running out of bandages I gave my last to King Werthin.- With the last of my strength I gave one last almighty charge towards the savages.- Upon my first swing I beheaded one of the savages and cut down another.- Swing after swing the savages fell upon my blade but one of them got past and through to the King.- I chased down the savage who had now put King Werthin in ropes and hanged him from the bridge.- I begged the savages for mercy as they relentlessly attacked me, beating me with their wooden clubs.- As I watched my King being hung over the ledge I knew my time had come and with one last swing of my sword I beheaded the savage that held my king and plunged over the bridge to my death with the King.Day 7: - We survived after smashing against the mountain sides- Killed one last savage that jumped down after us.- He had bandages.- We lived.- King Werthin however is now Lord Werthin.11/10 Would kill savages again.

								First off, if you're here to read fanny comments that all end in 10/10, stop that. This game is a cruel, cruel mistress. You will spend hours on end making the perfect base, walls, castles, you name it. It will be everything you ever imagined, or maybe even better. All the while you will have scars and experience that will stay with you till death. And despite the hackers, the people basing next to the main resource spawns, and the autists who roleplay and yell at everyone else to roleplay (despite the fact that they build floating bases instead of castles cause they don't wanna get raided) you will ultimately have fun. Should you be playing with friends then there's a good chance that you will become the kingpins of the server. And then, out of the blue, you will raid the wrong group of people, and their one salty friend with hacks will slay everybody on the server hundreds of times, destroy your base, and fly away, without getting banned and with no way to report them because they kept changing their names. Bottom line is that this game is good. Buggy and filled with hackers, but good. Should they add something like VAC and fix some of the problems then I could see myself coming back to it.Oh yeah, and you're gonna end up staying up till 3am a lot.			"

												""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.""Yep, twice I've bought ea titles from this dev (previous being StarForge), and twice I've been burned. The game itself can still offer hours of entertainment and fun; but overall it's just not finished. Movement has always felt clunky to me; performance is sub-par with frequent pauses\hitches during play, and fps is all over the place.Hackers are also more common than I'd like; but luckily if you find a good server with good admins, they shouldn't be a problem.Only get if on sale and you have friends that already play it...otherwise save your money.6\10On a side note: Avoid games from these devs. I gave them the benefit of the doubt when they released StarForge incomplete; saying they've ""learned from their mistakes"" and they ""know what they're doing now"" bla bla...pretty much lies to customers faces. It's a shame because if they would simply complete their games, they could have had some real gems; but right now they don't seem to know how to do that properly.			"

												This game has potential, but it's almost impossible to play at the moment.  Hackers run amock.  Try to make it anywhere?  Hackers spawn on you and take your loot.  Want to try to build?  Hackers have taken over the king's castle and raised the tax to the maximum.   There needs to be some kind of anti-cheat system in place that actually works.			"

Early Access Review
								I held out on buying this game because I'm suspicious of Early Access games--most times it seems they are just half-hearted cash grabs. A lot of YouTubers were posting fun gameplay videos so I broke and bought it.The world is beautiful. The landscape feels like an actual land, the trees and shadows are well done, the foliage and shrubbery looks and feels great. There are ducks, sheep, chickens, elk, deer, wolves, bears, and ""werewolves"" (spiky mutant wolves) to fight/kill and harvest fangs, leather, wool, meat, fat, etc from. Crafting is your standard crafting: collect enough resources and pick from a menu. There is a kind of technology tree in that you upgrade your work benches from basic -> +tanning -> +stonecutting, etc. Chopping trees is strangely satisfying as they fall over then you keep chopping them to pieces. Mining is boring - there are only a handful of static nodes that respawn after a few minutes. Building is great. There are a lot of options and different materials with properties like some are more durable obviously but some others (like stone and metal reinforced wood) can only be damaged by siege equipment. I honestly really, really enjoyed harvesting resources, upgrading my tools, and planning out my little base and defenses.That said: This game is a total piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can spend hours working on a base, literally hours (hours), only to have it destroyed and lost in ten minutes. There is only one map that's just a small island that you can run across in a few minutes. The neutral wildlife AI just runs the opposite direction from you when you attack and the hostile AI is borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... they ""slow motion"" straight for you and swing at the air in front of them a few times once they get close enough, after they've slid down hills and gotten stuck on any minor divet in the terrain. You can hop up on a block and they can't even touch you as you poke them to death while they swipe harmlessly at your feet. Combat is abysmal - You never know if you're going to hit or miss. Even if you feel like you're going to connect, the character animations pivot and lunge weirdly as you're strafing each other and you can't really gauge the reach of your weapon. If you're decent at landing shots, a fast weapon automatically beats any powerful weapon, because hitting them first interrupts their swing. People wordlessly attack 90% of the time and a majority of my interactions were running for my life while having javelins thrown at my back. Some will give up after a short distance but a fair amount will chase you forever. Seriously. For 20 minutes. Up a mountain, into the ocean, doesn't matter. Another joy is being captured, which sounds fun until you're on the receiving end and minding your own business when suddenly your character falls helpless on the ground and someone drags you away because you weren't listening closely enough for footsteps. Now you're in a cage or some stocks and at the mercy of some 12 year old as your character slowly starves to death and you debate about using the sharp stone you've hidden in your butt (yes, really) to smash your own face in.. but you have all this stuff on you that you'll lose. IMO the king is pointless and typically ignored unless he raises the tax rate enough to irritate people. There's no reason to be king other than to be king and it's hard to get resources because people try to kill you, so you have to use the taxed resources but if you raise the tax too high they'll all band together and come to kill you. A few servers I've been on actually went several hours without ANY king because no one even cared. Hacking is also rampant, since this is a client-side game. There have been flying people throw javelins from the sky and spawning a half dosen werewolves right on top of you, invisible people one-shotting players then deleting their houses, and more.I had a game going on a public server, until I logged in yesterday and every house on the server was gone--deleted by hackers. All of the forges, chests, workbenches, etc were still there floating in the air but the houses and structures had been deleted. So tonight after working all day I started a new game on a fresh server. Over the next 8 hours I chopped trees and tried to catch ore veins everyone was competing for while dodging person after person trying to capture me (because the admin put a ""no kill on sight"" rule in play but said capturing was fine). For eight hours. Until finally I had a decent little base going, made of metal reinforced wood so people would have to use siege equipment to break in, and I had the base split into three different rooms separated by strong metal doors so if they did break in, hopefully they wouldn't be able to get into all 3 areas and clean me out. I was on my way back with some resources when I discovered three guys using a ballista at point blank range to smash down just two blocks, enough room for them to squeeze into my first room. I didn't know there were three and jumped in after them swinging my swords, but ducked back out after seeing I was outnumbered. I figured that's fine, whatever, they'll get my resources, who cares... but after healing I came back again to find the one smashing my crest which gave me ownership of the area, then all they'd have to do is put down one of their own to steal the entire thing from me. I jumped in again to try to stop him but got overwhelmed again, so I took off into the mountains and this time they chased. I ended up in a 3vs1 fight, two of them throwing javelins and the other with a large axe, a hole in the side of my base, my resources gone, and soon the entire base gone. Within 15 minutes.No thanks. I'm done. Buy this game if you want for lulz, but each time you log in, everything you had could be gone. Another thing I heard pointed out is that this is the same company that made Starforge, which they left completely screwed and failed to deliver on any of their promises. We'll see how much hope Reign of Kings has in the future. For now, I'm done.			"

								I've played this game for about 13 hours now.  That time has been split up into about 4 or 5 sittings.  And every sitting I have completely lost everything that I built.  I bought the game because i thought it could be fun, and it actually could be.  But so far, I have been wiped out by hackers on my first night, had a fresh spawn break into my house while I was using the restroom and murder me, been decimated by guys in full steel while I was naked, and then had the last happen to me by the king and his goons.  It could actually be a fun game but the community kind of ruins it.  A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community.  My last sitting lasted about 20 minutes.  I spawned, chopped a few trees, and the same king that murdered me with his goons waited outside of my house for me, captured me, and then dragged me for 10-15 minutes and danced on me, then threw me off the kings bridge.  So that's my experience, and i'm sure that most other people wont have a very different experience.  But I cant get armor without being murdered, or someone destroying my things for the sheer pleasure of doing so.  Its just not my kind of game.  At least until people stop being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

								How to get support from developers? No way, forget.Hi, there. My name is Dmitriy and i'm administrator for Reign of Kings Red Sky Server Pack. You can know me or my servers as PUBLIC, DEATHMATCH, RUS RP and others. We always take 1st places at player count list of community servers.I started to host our first server at 5th of May and host it till today. Since this time i had problem with voice chat. Every time I tried to talk into a microphone - was a very high chance that the game will throw me from any server in the main menu. The same problem was once next to me says a voice chat someone else.Of course, I've created a few topics in the discussions which described in detail the problems that arise, but so far no reply has been received. Moreover, so far I have not received a reply on emails sent to e-mail support@codehatch.соm August 8 with a detailed description of several problems and accompanying screenshots. Most of the problems encountered by the players have to deal with the players and OXIDE plugin developers. The problem of the presence of cheaters detail paint will not, affected only one sentence - there is a problem, and in 3 minutes the presence of cheater on the server, it can cause irreparable damage to the economy or destroy key objects like chests king.On the problem of serious checks and freezes the game also mention - after 2 weeks of playing on the development, the popular server game world oversaturated blocks so that the only true solution is a complete cleaning of the world every 2 weeks as further comfortable playing without this action is simply impossible. Regardless of the power equipment used to host a game server, the problem remains the same.In this connection, I consider it necessary to declare that the game developers are not interested in communicating with the community, are not ready to help players solve the problems with the game and as a result are not interested in the development and promotion of the game. Result - 491 players in the game at the time of writing the message. The result - 66% discount on the game, and such discounts are placed only for obsolete or useless games.Unfortunately, the developers due to reasons known to me have missed a great opportunity to make candy out of the game, leaving a very unfinished product every 2 weeks under the guise of a formal update, which brings extremely (sarcasm) a lot. The fact that the game has moved to the beta version, suggests that players should not expect a fundamentally new content in the near future.At the current stage of the game I and our community Red Sky (over 300 people) do not consider it necessary to recommend this product to new players before the policy makers to rethink communication and support for players and further plans for the game. Those who wish to buy the game, I recommend that users pay the most popular view projects in this genre.(The author is responsible for the reviews posted every word.Preparation of the text was carried out using the service Google Translate.)Author: Dmitriy (ingame nickname - Beyond Kayne). If you want ask me any question - my skype beyondkayne69, welcome.			"

Early Access Review
								To start, I love the game. Its fun and engaging. However, I've read that there is no VAC support for it yet, and while its pre alpha, I feel like it's a necessity for a multiplayer format. Me and a friend spent twelve + hours gathering materials, and constructing our base. It took less than two minutes for two people to blow into the the strongest gate in the game and destroy the whole place. I have hopes for the game in the future, but I wont pick it back up for quite some time. Fixing the rampant hacking/greifing is a MUST.			"

												After hosting the #1 North American server for 3 months. I came to the realization that the devs do not give a single♥♥♥♥♥♥about this game. There are tons of hackers that will come in, specifically between 10pm and 6am. The country block mod keeps alot of them out but when they use a VPN, you're totaly screwed. I can't tell you how many times I had to help people rebuild and give them resources from being hacked. If you have some really good roleplayers, the game is fun. If not, you will get very bored.The whole ""king"" system is dumb. It offers absolutely no real advantage at all other than getting ""taxed"" resources from people gathering. If people dont actively roleplay like theres a king. It'll be screwed up.Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT buy this game. I wish i could return it, but now it just haunts me.			"

								A great survival game, It has a wonderful building system with Structural itegrity, Variety, and the game is alot of fun overall. However like all survival games the community is poor, even on PVE or RP servers, it is and will always be KoS gameplay.After being killed several times by a rogue player, I attempted to speak with the admins and was banned from a popular RP server. *** A further update on the game, Considering it had an update to patch some of the clipping, lag, and finally some more Optimisation. The combat is alot smoother, though even with this advanced clipping in place, Online I still had a player 'lag' or clip through my homes wall, and suddenly kill me without my knowledge untill I was gurgling on my own blood. Needless to say, The Admins of the server seemed disinterested, and when finally seen to with some intrest, the issue was put down to 'Lag and general bugginess of the game'. Even though this game is fun, and somewhat worth its money, I cannot reccomend it, due to the amount of Hacking (Atleast what I consider it, Taking advantage of lag and bugs.) Or a game so buggy, you lose 100% Of the time in combat or sieges..Alot of Potential, very little progress.I become stuck making a rating of this game, especially one out of ten. I have had many hours of fun and enjoyment from this game, but it always seems to leave me with a bad, salty taste when something goes out of your control, like a hacking player or power abusing admin....What do you think?

Spotty development, the game is as polished as a fresh turd after all you can eat Mexican food night, and the ""developer"" has a history of non-performance and game abandonment with no change in Modus Operandi. Ive sunk 41.1 hours into a this game, gone as far as to rent and run a server for a month to see if more enjoyment could be pulled out of it and no dice. The fact that someones going to come along and drop 19.99 on this trainwreck expecting a finished playable game is just sad. Its not what Steam has strived for and I wonder who the hell is vetting thier storefront to have this come up.			"

												Hackers ruined this game. My friends and I used to have an amazing time running around RPing and PVPing. Then one day we saw the first hacker. He was super jumping around the map and killing everyone. From that day forward we saw hackers every day. I stopped playing just short of 100 hours. I would have sunk so much time in this game, but the devs couldn't get control of the hacker situation fast enough. This seems to be a trend now. A game comes out early access, and then hackers destroy said game. It's almost like its corporate sabotage. Makes you wonder.			"

												This game has been abandoned!!!! It had all the potential in the world to become a really fun game but it was just abruptly ended.  The only ""updates"" are bug updates and honestly they don't seem to fix anything.  Hackers do whatever they want in the remaning servers as the population keeps dying.  DO NOT GIVE THEM ANYMORE MONEY.  The game itself was and isn't a bad game other than the developers pretty much bailing.  Yes they have some annoying bugs and glitches but overall it is a decent crafting/harvesting type of game with a medieval theme.  Overall I enjoyed the game up until the hackers swarmed in and the developers couldn't ""fix"" it and gave up.  Haven't touched it since.  Sad because I racked in a lot of hours on this game.  Simply loved building and upgrading and trying to survive from other people.  Sad that the game is pretty much dead.  Only real fun is playing in private locked community servers that have a good community.  Public servers are pretty much trash at this point and many people complain that there FPS are completely horrible.  I personally do not write reviews but feel like anyone reading this should know not to buy the game and give them more money.  The developers pretty much went from Alpha, Beta, added a few things to ummm game is released and only updates from now on are bug fixes and patches.  Like really??? Trust me do not buy this game.  Look for something else with developers that actually care about their community.			"

Early Access Review
								When i saw Reign Of Kings or RoK, i felt in love.For an early access, this game is excellent.THE LAYOUT:Clear and simple: they've mixed Chivalry: Medieval Warfare and Rust in a beautiful package.You are a survivor who ended up on an remote island. With nothing more than a club, few berries, torches, bandages and wearing a loincloth.You wake up on a beach and after a nice character creation your adventure starts. You have to survive: drink, eat, find a shelter and protect yourself from other survivors that might be agressive.But soon enough you will discover that the huge stone colosseus which is located at the end of the island is a stronghold where lies the throne of the island's king.Strong enough you can claim it and decide of a percentage of tax that will be deducted from every players gathering on the island. From 0% to 20 %.To get the throne you have to create a guild with a banner (you can choose familly members to give access to doors and chests), build a fortress, gear and set up an army of allies ready to storm this place of power.You can also slay beasts and monsters, like the corrupted humans who roam the plagued village in the center of the map where loot is abundant and powerfull.Building is easy and physic is present, to sum up it is like in Starforge where buildings are composed of blocks and needs a small set up time to be dropped. Crafting acts around upgradable automated stations. Such as the fire camp, where you can add stones to create a furnace. Item are commons, clubs, axes, swords, armors, lights, ect... The really funny aspect in crafting is the fact that with enough components you can build siege weapons, cells and torture tools.Because capturing is the most appealing aspect in this game. With a rope or shackles, you can take a character and drag him into your prison. if you get caught, you can hide a stone or lockpick to give you a chance to escape. But if you can't, you may be whiped before being executed by décapitation ,hanging, ect...But you won't be always a victim.The fighting system is really nice and acts like Chivalry. First clic for attack, second for blocking, mouse scroll for 2 others attacks to cut enemie's guard.The most interresting are ranged attacks, where javelins, arrows and bolts (when they hit) slows characters movements.When you shoot, if you hold right clic, you can follow the projectile, making your next shot more accurate.RoK in general is excellent and brings fresh air in a genre dominated by poor games such as Rust itself.So why i don't recommand it ? Again, even with a good look and content, this game lacks balance.Siege weapons.They need work, like the explosiv barrel for the trebuchet wich has been removed.The balista is usefull against blocks, but the overal feeling about siege weapons is that they are only fit for destructing blocks. If you want to set other defenses than better walls or doors... you will have to wait. You just can't kill enemy foes with this kind of weapons. Oil cauldrons, spikes or even fire would be a nice addition.Close combat.It is still very difficult to handle some times. Mainly because blocking is very punishing especially when you have a one handed sword. That's why many players asks for shields because at the moment 2 handed weapons are overpowerfull.Add to that the lack of variety in armors and the movement reduction related to it's efficiency:the heavier, the slower you will be. The problem is that you can negate this reduction by using lower level boots. So if you have a steel armor, wear iron boots and you will run without any major speed reduction.Resources. The most important ones are iron and stone wich are located in the center of the map around a vast plain. In general if the server doesn't have rules, players build on theses spots. I'm not ranting about the way developper forced pvp but iron and stone are so rare that when few factions have claimed theses locations you have no chances to gain the upper hand especially if you consider that you can mine a collected spot by hitting the ground where the mineral spawned...Of course its location never changes.Hacking. The game has no protections against hackers. Even if you can use a password, it will destroy you player pool and is not a perfect solution because you have always somebody who speaks to the wrong person...Hack is a real plague and should be the main issue developpers have to fix.Servers and admins. Many servers are roleplaying, the problem is that guilds options are too limited and chat window is too basic to give a correct roleplay experience (even if you role play on your forums, be able to private message somebody is necessary).Even administration may be a problem because they can destroy everything in a matter of hours just like in Rust especially with the explosiv kegs (wich has been removed few days ago my update of this review).If you played Rust imagine these admins (and hackers) can brings to rubble any buildings in 2 or 4 hours at max. So it's not loosing your stuff, it's loosing everything, especially if some players uses arrows to scout the land with the right clic ( to be simple, don't try to stay low, you will be discovered anyway due to theses stupid arrows) or goes in your guild and acts as spies to find your location (of course it is part of the gameplay but guild rights are too basic to be really protected, add to that hacking and you can imagine how quick you can loose everything when you are disconected)TO CONCLUDE:So if you play this game be ware ! Try to find a good community where admins are not focused on being on the throne and with interresting rules (and a password !).Try to find structured communities instead of player slots and lack of lag.Because you won't have any ways to progress in the game or even discover everything it has to offer.Because this game is still really good and have a real potential.N.B: i will change my review as the game progresses.Review updated the 3/24/2015			"

												Started playing R.O.K since its release and was a huge fan of the game when it was at its prime, well at first I was . After promising claims made by the developer. The game was all fun and games until hackers and exploiters came along , the developer did not handle this problem at all and instead just let it slide off the desk while they lie about ""improving the ban system"" in each update as hackers and exploiters were increasing and not decreasing. I wasn't really bothered about that either. But after an incident which changed my view of the game completely"" , I stopped being a ""fan"" of this game.So heres what happened , I did what I normally did , joined an official server , killed more than 20 players , 8 of them got sour and claimed I was hacking so they all reported me since I pawned them at their game. The so called ""staff"" of the game didn't even check if I was hacking and just banned me from the server thinking that I was hacking cause I was savaging them like a beast. I honestly though that they would improve the system whereas they are actually just banning all players who get higher reports than average . This showed how unfair the system was and for the first time I was angry at the game.It was also first time after hundred's of hours playing the game that I was banned for ""Exploit"" when I didnt even exploit anything.Overall , the developer said they were improving the ban system on exploiters and hackers , but honestly theres still tons of exploiters/hackers out there and they just simply ban people. Worst developer/staff I've seen in my entire life. Definitely would not recommend anyone buying this game thats in this current state , its a rip off so better left untouched and save your $15 . I doubt this game would ever be fixed as the developers I found out was the one who made Starforge which had the same issue.3/10			"

Again and again this developer has proven to be incapable of delivering a game experience thats was worth gamers and casual goer's their money and time. There was once a hope that this game would have really pulled off a true medieval sandbox experience, but the end result was a half baked buggy mess infested with a very immature community and is rampant with hackers of an oriental nature. Code}{atch will dissapoint you again and again from what their history shows, and you would be wise to not purchase or endorse products from this developer.			"

								I've put some time into this game, and the complaint I have is much the same as anyone else's: There is no moderation on public servers, and people will pretty much always wipe your base the minute they find it. The longest I held onto a base was over a week and a half or so. I had hidden it away, and was feeling pretty clever. Then it was gone. Once I tried a system where I banded up with other players, and we were neighbors, but had our bases out in the open, and kept an eye out for each other's stuff. Chinese showed up on the server, and hacked everything away, as they have been doing pretty much since I bought this game. I've watched this game go from being highly recommended, to mixed feedback. It's a pretty fun, addictive game. I just wish there was a better option to enjoy it correctly than to join a private server.			"

								This game depresses me.I love this game, so much. It is so fun and creative and is the first game that has addicted me in over a year and this is why It hurts to not recommend it but I cannot recommend this game to anyone.The reason I give this game a thumbs down is its community. Never before have I seen such a vile cesspool of offensive, homophobic twelve year olds. Some guy in full armor attacks you when you have nothing? dont worry, he will tell you how sh--it you are at the game after he killed you! Guy attacks you and he fails and dies? you are now a ""fa-g--got"" and a ""hacker"" For example, today I had a fight with a guild of 5 while I was by myself, the reason we had a fight was they caused me to lose some land I claimed. I hung one, killed 3 with an axe and 1 ran away injured. I was then verbally abused over chat by being notified that I am a ""fa-g---got piece of sh---it"" and then I got accused of spawning them items and that I hacked the items in for them, they wanted me to be reported. I also witness a lot of discrimination on this game, while building my own house I saw the chat fill up multiple time with racial slurs and people being called cu--nts all because someone died. Its terrible. Another reason to not buy this is the hackers. With no anti cheat or server admins hackers can go about freely on what they do oh and trust me, they do. Want to be king? nope, hacker will slay you as soon as you are crowned. Built a good base? hacker can delete blocks! Having a fair fight? nope, expect a speed hack, 1hit kill hack and god mode! I also witnessed a hacker block the entrance to the throne today so no more kings in that server till restart. Oh and also, considering there are 30 player slots per server, expect at least 4 of them players to be hackers.And finally, its all fun doing all this grinding to build an amazing house and collecting all items but at this current stage, its pointless. When watching the trailer I imagined a game with a few large guilds with a nice big village/fort/castle but no. Guilds consist of maybe 2-3 people because you cant trust anyone and there are multiple guilds. You will never feel safe enough to leave your house because it will get looted. No ones neutral, there is no politics or alliance. Everyone just wants to steal. This is a waste of time, yesterday I spent 10 hours grinding, I built a small 2 story house deep in the woods, I was a neutral player, I appeased the big guilds to keep them happy and only captured and executed players I saw murdering noobs. So you can imagine my dispair as I saw the guild of 8 members roll up with what I can describe as the most overpowered Trebuchet ever and knock my 10 hour development down in less than 5 minutes for no reason but just because they can. EDIT: *Today I joined an RP-PvP whitelist server, basically you had to be allowed into the server and there are rules as to what you can and cannot do, I am now loving the game as I have found a good community and server to play on*Whitelisted server with rules9/10Fun gameGood rulesNo hackersGood playersOffical server/community server without rules or whitelist6/10Fun gameBad communityHackersEnd result is not all thatWait like 6 months till hackers are more rare and price goes up so kids cannot buy.

												Tried to return to this game today, after noticing that its been labeled as finished thought id try it out again, First time i tried it several months ago it was ok, had its fair share of problems (early access yo) which is fair enough. an to be fair it had some really intresting stuff, and was quite fun. So how did trying it out again today go, well, wouldent launch code,  19 error, after some digging around found out that i needed to disable my anti virus and firewall, (ermm kayy) which did indeed get it to launch. upon trying to connect to a server i was faced by a black screen. had to control alt delete and end process, as it had stopped responding. so take 2, launched, tried to connect to server, froze, then a weird graphical glitch across my whole screen, then BSOD. This obviously is not a issue with my rig as everything, and anything else works 100% fine. To add insult to injury, upon deciding i no longer wanted to back this game steam decided i was not aloud a refund, why? well because i have played 1.4 hours over the aloud refund policy agreement , even tho i waited several months to give up on this as i actually dont mind backing early access games and always hope devs will end up making a great product , an there for decided to stick by them untill now. So somehow by showing support by not immediatly requesting a refund , an actually sticking out the early access phase, i get punished, but the devs slapping a finished sticker on a game that CLEARY is not finished is totally fine by steam, and any early access backers get screwed an to top it off thats just the tip of the iceburg, never mind all the hacker/cheating issues. GO STEAM Whats worse is the steam refund makes you THINK that your somehow safe from getting scammed by cashgrab games, but your obviously not, An this is the second title from these ""devs"" that has been classed as a finished product but is very very far from finished, however i learned this information after purchasing this game but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, more fool me.

Early Access Review
								Reign of Kings is an action adventure sandbox survival game developed by CodeHatch. We all know of CodeHatch from their past blunder that is known as StarForge. Broken promises and missed opportunities galore with StarForge. Took forever in early access, didn’t make real on half their promises and lets be honest. Their kickstart was a scam. That is highly unfortunate for anyone who backed them. Their game had a ton of potential but it fell hard on it’s face and left a lot of gamers, customers… Very, very, very… Unhappy.So now we have Reign of Kings. Another early access title by CodeHatch. Should you be careful with your purchase? Absolutely. Since the start of their original Kickstarter for StarForge there has been a slew of survival game releases. So now they have an example to follow. Sure it seems fishy they put this title into early access the same time as Medieval Engineers by Keen House hits, but the two games aren’t really aimed to be all that similar. So lets go to it. The main focus of Reign of Kings is to survive. To do so you must harvest materials such as hay, flax, wood, sticks, iron, stone, food, water, and other materials. At the core of the game is the crafting system as this is needed really to do anything. The goal is to survive. As most survival games you need to find food and water. We have to eat and drink right? That is after all a trope of all survival. Makes sense we find it in this game.  However look at most survival games crafting is a second hand thing. There is world loot in those games. Not in Reign of Kings. It is all about the crafting. Which really brings the game down in my opinion. I feel the game could benefit from having random generated world and having one or even two “kingdoms”. Having two castles. The two kingdoms could go to war. Then also have the whole civil war within.  The fact that there is one designed map with next to no points of interest aside from the castle and a “ghost town” really kills it for me. I don’t get a good sense of immersion because everything is player built. Honestly… I would just stick to Rust if I knew this was the case.There is one really cool system to the game though. That is the King system for all intensive purposes. A player can sit on the throne and become the king. If there is already a king the king can be killed. To become king you can go to the castle and sit on the throne. Now there is player structures so a good solid group can fortify the castle pretty well. The design for the castle/island is fairly cool however It would be much more entertaining if the castle weren’t a citadel/throne room and was a tad more customizable. The person who becomes king can rename the kingdom and can also set taxes. I am not to sure what the cap on taxes is but it stands to reasoning if you want to stay king set the taxes high so that the other citizens are starved. It works even better if your community is willing to roleplay.  Still this is the one feature of the game that stands out above the other survival games.The combat is similar to Chivalry, but it is the weakest point of the game at this point. Perhaps I am not a hardcore player in this sense but it feels clunky, it is very glitchy, and I have not played a survival game with worse combat. The one cool think that is combat related is the ability to capture a person with a rope and drag them around. You can also put them into catches hang them from the gallows, put them in stocks, or chop their heads off with guillotines. There are also siege weapons which will be a ton of fun. The overall look of the building blocks is dull and boring at this point and everything is very blocky in terms of player building. I would love to see some refinement as the game goes through it’s stages in early access and more so a option to add in crosshairs for combat.The character creation is pretty fantastic and you can build all sorts of crazy looking characters. However at this point there are no female characters and… The hair of the characters is about three generations behind in terms of appearence. The game is visually very appealing but the faces and the hair breaks all sorts of barriers and the graphics become extremely inconsistent in that term.As time goes on we will see a lot more survival games. Each that have a unique appeal to it. Reign of Kings does indeed have a few things that set itself apart however If your on the mend of a broken heart, or wallet from CodeHatch’s last title. I suggest you wait for development.I got to play on Gaming-Asylum’s Roleplay server for Reign of Kings and it made my poor experiences from other servers way more entertaining. If you don’t know of Gaming-Asylum they have several Arma 3 RP Life servers and recently had a successful kickstarter for their upcoming game Identity. They know roleplay and have a great community (for the most part.) Check out their Roleplay server by clicking Community and the server browser and search for Asylum.http://thedrastikmeasure.com/2015/03/14/reign-of-kings-pc-preview/ "

												Alright, this game is one of the reasons I hate Early Access Survival games. The developers always screw up at some point.There are tons of hackers in this game, and usually indie developers like these never finish their games. I enjoyed the 31 hours I played with my friends before our base was looted by hackers with absolutely no armor that we couldn't even damage.I would not recommend this game to any of you, because it's just filled with hackers, and you'll have little to no fun playing it. A solution to the hacker issue would be hosting your own server, but that is almost impossible, because it costs extra money, also you need someone on 24/7 to moderate it.In this game's current state, I can not recommend it.

Early Access Review
								Played since release (aus/nz). I want to reccomend this game so badly but i cannot.The community for the game is actually really cool if you aren't a complete spud. I made heaps of new friends playing. To bad everyone ive ever played with has left. Every new patch they ask, ""Hey man whats new in RoK worth playing again?"" and i remember back to the very first week and theres literally no difference. Every new patch they add a bunch of useless stuff. They add things like instruments, masks and flower outfits. For 2 seconds its HAHA LOL FUNNY OMG ROFL. Then its old. I think they added them for role play and diversity. But everyone just wears steel armour and carries steel greatswords. Theres no diversity. It boils down to:Why should i make a mask and wear it if it just means ill get 1 hit in the head. I should just wear steel helmet for best protection. Why should i fill my base with furiniture, when im going to get raided or hacked anyway. I should just invest in more blocks. There are only 3 items that have been added that i regularly see people use. The tabard, crossbow and shield. The devs seem to create bugs/exploits everytime they try to fix an old one. Heres a great example: If you use to log out in a small area, you could spawn back stuck in the floor. So their solution was to say: "" If you spawn in an area too small, your character is placed back on the spawn beach"". Well, i just trapped guys in my house because they were raiding me. So what do they do? log off in the corner. When they log back in they spawned free on the beach with all my loot............... It just seems like an endless cycle of bug fixing and raid balancing without any worthwhile content. The devs have implemented some ideas from the community, but there are so many better suggestions that they ignore:2 kings which tax half the land each. Pre designed wall structures and buildings which save on resources and get a proper castles going faster. Farms. USEFUL outfits with unique perks. Bones, fangs, feathers should be able to be added to armour for diversity. Instead, they made a boring new map which promotes hoarding and offline raiding.Offline raiding is why i stopped playing. 15 minute raid destroys a whole week of constant work.  Is it that hard to implement something like: ""If no players from guild have been on for 30 minutes, then all structure health within your crest is trippled""?Once you have base and armour the only thing left to do is raid. There is no places to visit, quests to do or high level gear to strive to.I do like the combat. It's like chivalry but without the ridiculous spinning 360 backwards crouching overhead headshots. That being said, combat goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when there is more than 2 people fighting. Lag and ping take over.TLDR - ""I could've been a contender. I could've been somebody.""			"

Early Access Review
								This is a super frustrating game. The actual gameplay is very boring, you spend hours just farming resources and farming and farming, and when you finally have a base made, it can be stolen from you very easily. Destroying someone's base is way too easy as time.My time spent on this game was entirely wasted, as was my money. Maybe if the community wasn't trash, but most players just run around trying to kill others and take their things. Garbage game and garbage people who play it.Edit1:I gave this game another chance the other day, spent hours making a base only to have a few people exploit the fact that they could jump on each other to get over my walls. It takes hours to make a base that is not only big enough to protect all of your equipment, but also tall enough to actually defend against stupid exploits like this. THIS GAME IS AWFUL, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ITEdit2: This game is however incredibly addictive, I find myself coming back to it regardless of how frustrated it made me, so many times.Edit3: Seriously though, this game is rampant with hackers and a very awful community. Also the servers seem to be weird because foreign people appear very often. I made a glorious base after returning to this game for.. I don't know how many times, and then left for a minute to collect resource, and my base was captured while I was gone. The people there managed to kill me in a single hit. So hackers are very alive and well in this game......JUST DON'T GET CAUGHT IN THIS GAME.			"

												Reign of Kings had an infinite amount of potential attached to it upon release, an exciting and innovative PvP system that utilized similarities to Chivalry provided fun fighting, accompanied by interesting building and siege mechanics offered Reign of Kings players a fresh new perspective on survival oriented games. I honestly believe this game still has the potential to be a contender with the likes of Ark and Rust. If I am being candid, the two aforementioned games have stale, dull, and mundane features, but offer certain gameplay aspects and mechanics that make them more attractive to players than Reign of Kings currently is, for a multitude of reasons.Reign of Kings short comings include:          A: Official servers are virtually unplayable because of the ubiquitous and pervasive Chinese hackers and dupers that flood the servers with colossal citadels of bases that are made out of the best quality building blocks, and encompass the Kings mountain and various proximal areas, which make contesting the King's throne impossible, because you either get killed by one of them hacking, or can not penetrate their duped walls. These official servers are rarely wiped and have no admins moderating play either.          B: Community servers are mostly run by middle aged men who are incredibly self-aggrandizing, and who exhibit astronomical amounts of bias towards their friends/guildmates that lead to spawned in bases and ill-gotten resources/items that individuals playing the game normally would not have access to as readily. The owner bias also leads to individuals being wrongfully banned as well.           C: Developers seem to have jumped the proverbial ship sometime within the past year for reasons unknown, and stopped providing updates to this game to deal with the tremendous optimization and lag issues. Item and weapon balance changes would be nice as well, considering the only viable weapon in PvP are the halberds and the iron-star mace.          D: The amount of hacking that occurs regularly on this game has gotten so out of hand it is becoming patently ridiculous, by now, one would assume that any respectable game whereby the developers give even minutia amounts of cadence to would have already installed a better anti cheat system that would be more difficult to circumvent than the one currently in place.All in all, Reign of Kings is an amazing game with untold amounts of potential, but that potential in itself is not nearly enough to excuse it's short comings. ~Earl Hooker  "

												The mechanics of building are a blast, combined with the social elements it creates a fun atmosphere.  However the combat is utter trash and still as glitchy as it was in alpha.  Combine that with the average player being small children who camp beaches and kill nakeds.  The game is not worthy of ""released"" status, they are simply throwing it out to start their next money grab.   A tragedy because the many parts of the game are fun. "

												This is a LEGITAMITE negative review. I have actual complaints that affect alot of players.On the store page, the trailer looks pretty epic. However none of that organized seigers/defenders♥♥♥♥♥♥happens in the game at all. The game needs serious optimizations:-The combat system is NOWHERE near Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, and the core of it is latency. If you have good ping but youre versing someone who isnt even close to your ping (i.e 60/130, 200/300), you're going to pop a testicle trying.-The community is salty, but honestly it all depends on where you land and what server you ground yourself to.-At least 20% of the servers and their admins are way too Liberal and they'll make you an admin right away (because chances are they have zero help, or don't have a clue in the world what to do - DONT GET ME WRONG, ITS COOL TO ADMINISTRATE STUFF), but also make some really unreasonable idiot one too and wreck the server to hell. Previous experiences.-Subjectively, the game lacks endgame purpose apart from just looting and getting more stuff to supply yourself, so you can loot again and repeat the same neverending cycle over and over. If you REALLY want a medieval game thats relatively similar (sort of, but not really), hop on over to Mount & Blade: Warband's store page where it has OVERWHELMINGLY positive reviews and you will not be disappointed for the same price as this game of which I'm reviewing.At the composing of this thread i realise I have 255.0 hours on record, but I'm strongly thinking about erasing it. Its that cancerous and toxic even.			"

												NEVER SUPPORT THESE DEVELOPERS AGAIN! THEY ARE JUST MONEY GRABBING SCUMBAGS!This is the SECOND game with a huge amount of potential they they decided to abandon once their time in the limelight was finished. They will end up making a third game at some point in an attempt to ""rekindle"" with their fanbase, when in reality they just want more easy money! Hands down, the next game they make will also be abandoned in the same way that this one was.I used to LOVE playing this game with my friends. We would always come home from school back in the early days and hop on to maintain our kingdoms. The fact that this game was abandoned does not surprise me, but it still hurts just as bad as a sucker punch to the gut. I don't understand why the developers couldn't just open up their games to the modding community. What have you guys got to lose? You're already♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in everyones faces and stopping maintenece on the game, and without help it will become just as much of a buggy, dead, piece of crap as Starforge. I remember reading the raving reviews of when this game first came out. I had no idea it was the same company that had run Starforge into the ground, but one person pointed out that this would happen. That person made a review that was completely washed out by the tons of positive reviews from people who bought the game either out of self interest, or because their favourite youtuber at the time was playing it. That review explained that the companies were the same, and that this exact day would come. That one person was right. All in all it's a shame that this company even exists. In my opinion, they are right up there with the makers of Infestation: Survival stories (Formerly The War Z), and Romero's Aftermath. Two of their games that were not only met with disgust from the community for lack of support for the game, but also for the overall quality of gameplay as updates slowly began to vanish. Now guess what! They are on to a third game, which in my mind, without a doubt, will be met with great community feedback. That is exactly how they end up sucking you in. Infestation was great at a time, believe it or not. But their Shattered Skies has a bad omen around it, and I can just see it tanking as bad as their other two. Now, many of the people who bothered to read this far might be wondering, ""Now why did he just go off topic to talk about another game that (At this time) hasn't even been released yet? It looks amazing!"". Well, allow me to explain. The two developers that made these games (RoK and Infestation for reference) are extremely similar. They seem to get behind a game, make an amazing product, and then once the money begins to dwindle, they tank the game and drop support for it. If Hammerpoint Interactive makes a third game on the same thesis and look of the other two, what is stopping Code Hatch from doing the same thing?Please, make an educated buy before ever supporting EITHER of these developers ever again. They aren't in it for the gamer, they are only in it for the gamer's wallet.TL;DR Never buy another game from Code}{atch or Hammerpoint Interactive again. They are a disgrace to the gaming community.			"

								Well, what to say?If youre interested in a full game experience; DO NOT BUYIf you wanna be part of the work in progress thing then you can buy it although i do not recommend it.The island is insanely small, so youre bumping into others constantly and trying to find a quiet spot to build is not available.The resources are extremely scarce on busy servers because they all spawn at the same exact location (in the middle), so everyone is farming there.These things aside (which have been promised to change), i simply wonder where this game is going. There is no survival, sure you have to eat and drink but theres food and drink aplenty, so no challenge there.Then youre left with building. It is fun, as all other similar games are. But it quickly loses any form of interest and becomes a huge, tedious grind for resources. Especially if your King sets high taxes. If you want to build a castle of more epic proportions be ready to grind an insane amount of trees and stone.And then comes the question, to what end?  you build a castle and siege weaponry and hang some useless baubles in your newly fetched stone home.... and then go out kill your neighbour?Im very curious what the devs are intending to accomplish with this game. As it is now, theres no point. After having built your castle, formed a guild and taken control of the island with your clan, there is nothing to do. Why would i want to log back in? I cant be arsed to build anything else (which is the main feature of the game), Being King is not really rewarding in any way (oo i got the best sword and i can get taxes).It really is all a matter of endgame. This piece of work has none. Since there is absolutely no survival element and that building requires you to grind endless amounts of materials (unlike minecraft), you get stuck with fighting other players. And the fighting mechanics are, to say the least, not the best around.So unless the devteam (which is credited for a similar game which has dramatic reviews for not finishing their product) comes up with something great to lead this project towards sense. I fear this one is going to get stuck in the limbo.Im gonna put thumbs down for now, because i cant recommend buying it at this point, ill come back in 6 months to see what has happened and where this is going.

												Reign of Kings seemed like it had potintial when I got it in alpha, but then they moved it to beta for less then a month, then pushed it to a full game. I understand all games have bugs, exploits, glitches, optimation problems but this game has had more then others I have played.At first I though this game was great, some of my friends told me about it and I saw some youtubers play it, so I thought ""why not try it"". I was happy with what was there becasue it was still in early alpha and knew things would change, but when they moved it to beta they still had many problems to fix and many things they could of added.All that Code}{atch does now is add to the EAC. I know not everything people ask for can or could be added, some people don't understand how hard coding and designing is. Truthfuly I don't play this anymore because I think it is a good game, because I don't, I play it because there are still a few RP servers that have a great community.Anyone who thinks they could single handidly make this game better should download Unreal Engine, Unity, or some other program and try your hand at it, if you actually are able to make something then good for you. Sell it or give it for free but don't complain exesivly about how you don't like things in this game.I will let everyone know that most people who play this are either RPers, PvPers, or hackers/cheaters. I recomend this game for RPers who are willing to hunt down the few good servers left, and would recomend PvPers to find a game with a better combat sythem, and would like to tell hackers to find a more constructive way to use their skills. My opinion doesn't mean much but please take it into consideration.			"

								The tale of the land full of dark colored dwarfs.I first started playing this game when it launched on steam. And took a break due to it's bugs until recently. Me and my friends picked the game up again, since there where promising news. We joined a large player group and started playing on a server.First the good. This game has good graphics in general. If you slam up those sliders many areas of the map look great. The combat has a learning curve and the recent update added some nice features, if you kick a blocking person with a shield for example, you can now break his block and hit him afterwards.The building is in my opinion the greatest part of the game. You can build your own castle and roam through your halls. They have drawbridges, furniture and many building items supporting your creativity to the fullest. I spend hours and hours placing blocks and items, thinking about how i would raid my base and how to prevent this. Awesome stuff I tell you.Which leads me to the next part, the raids. Raiding is more difficult and way more expensive then in the early days, making it even more rewarding if you succeed. There is nothing like standing on a freshly raided castle and taking their loot, since the raiding is a core and essential part of the game. On the other hand there is nothing worse then your base being gone the next day you log in. But this is the game this is what you singed up for. Don't complain try again and make it safer next time. They now have these things called totems which can protect your base from being removed completely. I know this is early access, but since this game is on sale more people should know what they are buying. This game has bugs. You can avoid many of them and many have been fixed in the past. Another thing is the engine. With my gtx 770 I get 60 fps if I don't run the game on ""ultra"" settings. The game is pretty but not very well optimized. If you walk towards a huge base you get massive frame drops, leaving you with 1-5 fps sometimes. I doubt they will improve this by a lot in the beta. The servers lag a lot. It's great that this game is growing more popular since it leads to full servers. And I have no problem waiting in a queue and to wait until I can play with my mates. The issue I am having is the lag. A full 40 people server is awful. There is no other word to describe it. The nice combat suddenly feels like a stop motion movie and is not decided by skill anymore.However all these stated things won't keep me from playing the game. The biggest issue are the hackers. We had 3 on our server just yesterday, raiding our chests without any effort. And this was not the first time this happened. This game has little to none cheat protection. And the game being on sale made it just worse.I really hope they improve this protection in some sort, until then I'd rather recommend to stay away from this game. So you can join the game once it is in a decent state leading to a great experience for everyone. "

								in the short time I have spent playing this game I can tell you it is amazing the concept the gameplay its just so much fun, to build your own home that would take more effort than its actually worth to tear through, for example i built a house with nothing but false rooms, and false doors and 1 room with all my good stuff, hell i went as far as to make a fake treasure room, so they thought they found everything. at one point a midget tried to tie me up and drag me but i had a sharp stone, so i cut the the rope then with 3 swings from my halberd i be-headed the poor soul. he brought his friends the next time around then like out of a movie the king strolled along with 3 friends and killed them all for me. why did i give it a thumbs down you ask? hackers hackers hackers hackers are ruining this game, and there is no viable security set in place, they literally hop on for a moment take the blocks from your house take a few other things then leave, i wont be playing again until there is some sort of security system in place and i cant advise anyone to buy the game at this stage.

												I RARELY make any reviews, as i don't really want to spend any time on it, but i believe this pigish move that Codehatch has made is not right. I urge anyone who is thinking about buying this product to think twice and read on:This is NOT a finished product. Hackers are still roaming, the game is not optimized, combat system is not even nearly as optimized and responsive as ""Chivalry"" (which I believe they intentionally have copied - probably because it has awesome mechanics). I enjoyed playing this when i bought it, and the game can definitly give you some good laughs, but I have never felt like it was a completed game, not even after pre-release. Don't expect a flawless game, you will be disappointed. It had some original gameplay, which I personally loved it for, but to call it a finished game is robery!			"

								I mean the game was nice until this morning when someone in-game decided to ♥♥♥♥ing hack, they first went to make us green, look like Shrek, he then proceeded to delete every base on the map and rope people while flying and invisible he put us in gallows and killed us. When we returned the whole base which has full stone walls and was huge! Could fit a 40 man guild, was gone. weeks worth of game-play was destroyed by this stupid hacker. He killed all the sleepers then left. Everyone then left the server, I uninstalled this game. And now am typing this up while I think eagerly. Instead, I play with myself more often than this game gets updated.			"

Early Access Review - Will edit in the futureFirst impression watching videos of the game was that it looked really odd but the concept was awesome.I bought the game and did not expect much of it but i later came to notice that the game .. while buggy was really well done in terms of an alpha game.While many claim they see hackers everywhere i have only ever seen one and that one got banned quicker than Husein Bolt running for fried chicken, if you choose to play on Official servers you can not expect more than idiots, hackers and ruleless content... however if you join a community server like mine own 'The viking saga', you will not only experience no lag, no hackers , no dupers, no abuse you will also enjoy the first game experience you have if you are new to the game.Old gamers can join too and hopefully rekindle the joy of this game, i now have 140+ hours played and counting, i must say that this game is the most fun i have had in a long while. You can RP, PVP, PVE, Build, and its all done in a open world enviroment.Problems with the game currentlyLets face it, there is issues... however they are being worked on as patches gets released.Do not listen to these ""hacker infested"" reviews, mostly butthurt people who can't fight properly due to their lack of skills. Instead, give the game a chance to evolve if you decide not to play it now. Check back in 2 months and see if most of the issues is not resolved by then.. well thats your choice.Otherwise if you already decided to buy & maybe even have bought it, i strongly encurage you to join my server if you are feeling like the game is no longer fun. Give me a chance to improve the experience for you.Again - The Viking Saga is the servers name.Thanks for reading!			"

There just aren't enough resources distributed around the map to make anything viable.-lone wolves are ♥♥♥♥ed over because of how expensive♥♥♥♥♥♥is.-terrain is unbelievably spastic with super flat areas as to say ""HEY GUYS BUILD HERE AND ONLY HERE."" with those areas being taken over by big clans and screws over lone wolf players to go build on uneven terrain.-SO MANY HACKERS. WHY? -lol guys its erly acezz don wurry itull get bettur in 6 years-devs dumped their old early access game to come make this one.-only 20 players on main servers. some community servers have 40 players though.-only ONE KING at a time, and they force a tax on all the players for god knows why. it should have been guilds could claim land and their leader becomes king of said land. A hacker became king, couldn't be killed and we all sat at 20% tax for 3 days before he got banned. -A LOT  of community servers suffer from admin abuse. -graphics are about as exciting as a stick. -has so much potential but just got screwed over because of cash cow devs.			"

												Hello everyone!!!Do you like watching your male toon run in a thong? Do you like crap community, and grinding for several hours, buiding a nice base to log in every day to find yourself dead and your base leveled? Do you like innacurate hitboxes and combat worse than games released a decade ago (i.e. Mount and Blade, one of my favorite games)?Then reign of kings is for you! If you plan on trying to solo it will take you at least four hours to grind a decent base and resources, armor and weps if you dont get ganked first. 1 in 10 people wont attack you. Apparently crests (thing you stick on your inner base to keep it  protected for a duration) are bugging so when you log people can get pop a hole in your base, level it, and take everything, and thats not even mentioning the invisible, speed hacking, stamina bar infinite poopy hackers.

								Edit : PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. So the game just went into beta.... Classic Code Hatch, these developers are just in it for the money, The game is a huge steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Try ""Out of Reach"" x100 times better Started on a public server, was a little too populated for me as I was new to the game. Seemed like a lot of just KOS and craziness going on. Switched to a community server which seemed to work out. There were usually 10 on at a time, you could tell which base belonged to the admin because he basically had a giant tier 7 castle. The gameplay is plagued with too many bugs, the combat is ugly and not responsive, armor makes absolutely no difference as do the weapons. There have been so many times I have seen a new spawn wreck someone in full steel armor and steel weapon. The game as it is right now is just one constant goal of grinding materials and then sitting in your home with nothing left to do. Be careful going to the kings castle because there are so many spots where you sink through the ground and fall to the water below. I know the game is in alpha but knowing Code Hatch and how they did with StarForge (look it up) my hopes for this game are extremely low.			"

								I've had a love/hate relationship with this game. If you're looking for something to sink some extra hours into then this game is a great choice. Unfortunately through several updates hackers plague the servers. You can spend multiple hours/days collecting materials to build your dream castle only to have a hacker come along and destroy it in a matter of minutes. Codehatch needs to implement a sort of 'steam-id' list in order to identify who is on the servers(/list means nothing when they can change their in-game names) to deter hackers. I would not recommend the $20 this game costs at the moment with all the other issues people have stated such as performance and questionable in-game mechanics.			"

In the time I played I couldn't even start, I kept having to restart due to spawning under the map, dying from other players because for some reason you just suddenly stop moving, and a lot of other bugs are just down right annoying.And givin their history (Starforge) I wouldn't trust them to finish this game, so I'm getting a refund and I'll buy it if they actually finish it.

												I will put it simply. Game is fun. BUT if the hackers do not ruin the game the admins in the commuity servers will. I am edit this review after finding FPS and game optimization is still garbage same issues from the very beginning. With an I7-4790k and running Two gtx 970 in sli forcing alternate frame rendering and 32 GB of ram this game runs at a solid 100 fps with lowest settings.... At only 25% gpu usage. Meaning I should get 400 fps, if the game was properly optimized. Sure I have read that this game is CPU-heavy but with this i7 the cpu usage stays just as low as the gpu. To top that off the servers cannot support the game after a few days of people building bases causing FPS tips and a few seconds of lag periodically making combat suuuuuper fun.			"

								Game CAN be very fun in its current state, mostly on private servers. However, in it's current state there are many bugs which can ruin your gaming experience. For instance people can become invisible when you close a door on them. Doors can also appear as open/closed when they are in the other state, so you can lose all your items. I suggest not having any doors.They are constantly fixing these types of exploits though, the ability to steal items through walls has apparently been fixed this patch.The lack of optimization at the moment is also kind of crappy, BUT this appears to be there main concern at the moment so we will have to see how that goes. Could be amazing but in its current state I could not recommend it to anyone simply because it is not in a finished state and could remain this way (broken) indefinitely.However, if you are not bothered about the price it is a great addition to your gaming collection.Kill the TYRANT KING!

								The game is a ton of fun, if it didn't have all of it's flaws. This is a horrible shame of a game. Not because it is bad, but because of the exploiters and hackers. Like you will see in many other reviews the game is plagued with hackers.. They may not be on your server everyday but it only takes once to wipe out hours and hours of work, if not days if you have lasted that long.The game without hackers is a ton of fun. The world could be just a smidge bigger. In fact I would give at least a 9/10 if it didn't have them. If they put a cheatblock into the game it will be great, if not then its a flop.			"

								I'm no critic so I'll start by venting some steam.To Steam, please cut back on Pre-Releases, only allow a few games to go alpha because this has become a bane.  90% of all games are unplayable pre-releases and most stay that way forever.  There should be a punishment system for developers who take too much time to release a game, like paying back people who bought the game, at least 25% of what they paid.Now on to Reign of Kings.This game is pretty much a rip off of Rust.  Same crafting mechanics, I mean, identical.Game is pretty much unplayable.  Every now and then, you get this weird fart/puke sound (I think it's the sound you make when you die) then you freeze, you can't move.  Then you press F, which makes you flex?  I don't know.  Then you can move again (yes, really) but you can't change weapon/access inventory.Now I understand that it's not supposed to be 100% playable BUT shame on you for releasing a game that requires us to relog every 5 minutes to clear whatever bug makes the game so broken you can't even play long enough to enjoy.  Alphas, at least on steam, should be at least stable and playable because if the goal is only to test, know that there are companies out there who actually pay people to test their games, not the other way around, what's the point?So right now this game is not worth 20$ only because it's heavily flawed and people shouldn't pay to test a game, they should only pay to play.  Steam should force developpers to make sure their game is stable enough before they allow it to go live.On the good side, once this game is fixed, I can see lots of fun.  Rust was fun right up until hackers started to show up and make it unplayable.Right now, this game is not worth it, don't buy it.  Wait for them to fix 90% of what's available right now before you get it.			"

								I own Starforge so I sat looking at this title wanting to buy in but having that gut feeling that these developers didn't deserve one more dime of my money. I caved, because I wanted a medieval rust to play. Amazingly the game actually doesn't seem that bad for early access, not very laggy, the fighting can be a bit wonky but is playable, and the building is enjoyable. However, less than an hour into the game I requested a refund and returned the game. My reason for this is simple, if I want to be killed before being able to accomplish anything, I already own two games that give me that experience, Rust and Ark. The player count is dropping, those left have nothing to do but kill anything that is not in their guild giving fresh spawns very little chance to build up. Updates are slowing down, and being one of the unlucky people who bought into Starforge, it looks like the writing is on the wall to follow the previous titles path towards the sewers.A real shame, because all I want in the gaming world is a medieval rust with a focus on making survival an actual challenge, rather than a small micro task for your first hour. I recommend you stay away from the game due to the nature of the devs history, nature of the community in these kind of games, and the current gameplay options. However, if you are like me and just really need a medieval rust experience, keep a stopwatch going so you don't miss your refund window.			"

												 In the time I've been playing on the NA servers I have seen many MANY groups of NA players quit/go to clutter another server due to the what seems immovable hacker threat. The Chinese have chased everyone off of the server with their indestructable bases(building inside of boulders) and infinite blocks/items. YES, i said INFINITE. I spent days mustering up the resources to raid two of the Chinese bases and guess what I found once I got in? crates of 1k stack t6 blocks, items that DONT EVEN EXIST in game. Countless resources in max stacks. It's sad to see NA players reaching out to save their servers but nothing what-so-ever being done about the growing threat to the community, or should I say the FOUNDATION that your game is built on.. what will you do once all of your players leave and you have yet another failed project on your hands Codehatch. Try to remember as developers that you are not the only people with time invested into the games you make.. I guess one mans trash is another mans treasure.. But you should be more vigilant before everyone realizes that your game is infact trash Codehatch. "

If you're too lazy to read this the summary of it is: HAX FOR DAYS.My playtime should tell you I've played enough to know what I'm talking about.So netcode is still really dumb... I've got alot of hours in and met some awesome people on a no KoS server but the game has far to many trolls that just want to destroy your crest and deconstruct your home.I got permabanned for putting an admins friend into my pillory and he started ♥♥♥♥♥ing.Every one raids when you're asleep,at work or at school and theres NOTHING you can do about it you can triple layer your walls but a trebuchet is so broken no block matters.Every one thinks they are really good (lol.)They failed to add a working ban system you can literally do one thing to instantly get unbanned from every server ( not gonna say how.)Hackers have increased ten fold with incredibly disturbing hacks such as teleport,item spawning, godmode, one hit kill, noclip & invisibility theres probably more but those are the few I saw.Edit: So they fixed it so you can longer use a pirated copy and play online YES THAT WAS POSSIBLE. review remains the same.I do enjoy the combat the reason being is that its simple ANYONE could do it as long as no one finds exploits on how to kill some one quickly or they change the combat to chivalry I think it'll be good.Edit #2: So I haven't played recently and probably won't especially from what I hear on how the hackers have gotten even worse...if you truly wish to know how bad ill tell you that a source code has been released that allows hackers TO ACCESS ADMIN COMMANDS obviously not all admin commands are usable but some primarily a ""Give all"" command that allows the admin to give himself EVERYTHING in the game + 1k of it even the ability to spawn NPC's.Hackers can teleport people into the sky and cage them thats apparently a thing now and have ACCESS TO WIPE INVENTORIES? WTF? isn't that serverside? damn.Gameplay I'm sure is still the same, work hard & spend hours only for a hacker to come on and you guessed it. or you go to sleep after spending maybe 12 hours with a friend grinding and building a glorious base to wake up dead & your base no longer being there (they destroy your crest and place their own which gives access to pick up the blocks you placed down.)Characters are still trolly and abused alot of people make the dumbest character which surprisingly abuses the hitbox from what I'm aware small people are harder to hit but have a smaller weapon reach however small people with large arms MAY have long reach? honestly I don't see why this effects the hitbox...so if this tells you anything it means people are going to abuse every game mechanic possible to win.BE WARNED THE ONLY SAFE HAVENS ARE HIGHLY CONTROLLED COMMUNITIES GOVERNED BY A LARGE QUANTITY OF ADMINS MAINLY THE ONES THAT DEDICATE 100% OF THEIR TIME TO BEING ON. (I've only seen this on an RP server which I'm very interested in to see how it works.)(more edits coming otherwise its still a fun game just filled with douches,cheaters & poor netcode.) "

												Was looking forward to playing this game when i bought it, and enjoyed it at first but was soon let down thoroughly. First went to an official server which was terrible, full of hackers and couldn't build for 10 minutes without being attacked by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Then went to an ok community server, not bad, built a couple of good bases, left, came back online and found some guild of losers half way through destroying my awesome fortress that I'd spent like 12 hours building. I haven't felt a more crushing sadness and violent anger since. Tried to contact admins saying they were breaking the server rules, 1 week later, nothing done about it so went to another server. That server was even worse, claimed to be heavy roleplay and no kill on sight but still players were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, breaking rules and raiding and killing me out of roleplay context. Finally, I decided that since I couldn't have fun online on this game, I'd make a private server so I could play unbothered by idiots. Didn't work, spent like an hour trying to make a server with the help of youtube how to's  and the server appeared on the list but wouldn't load. So basically this game was a failure. I wish someone would make a game just like this but offline, or at least with an offline mode, because I just can't stand ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, selfish idiots destroying servers any longer, it makes it impossible to get any enjoyment from this game. Seriously, unless you're willing to commit about 2-3 full days of play time making a full size raid proof castle without logging off, don't get this game, because all that's gonna happen is your gonna spend all this time building something cool just to log off and log back on to see some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ has killed you in your sleep, destroyed your base and stolen your stuff.

												Over 800 hours in the game.  While its merits lie in team-based combat and raiding, those ultimately became its undoing.  From horrendous lag (unless a handful of people are on the server) to countless bugs, exploits and the occasional hacks, the game is just not playable--especially for a full release status.  It was interesting to see Sir Fairnore (the head developer) push for full release by Christmas in order to throw a holiday sale on it and push it to as many kids as possible before abandoning the game.  Yes, this game has been abandoned, and there are no planned updates for it other than the occasional server wipe.The game plays more like an alpha-stage game despite having gone through beta and now full release.  Uninstalled. GG.			"

												In my eyes; It's not the devs' fault that this game went to balls. It's the community's. I'll tell you why--Hackers, DMers, trolls, and all sorts of other nasty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s running up in your grille, just to mess with you.You could be building the house that you spent two hours gathering resources for, guess what? Someone's gonna' run up, stab you in the back with the King's sword, and steal all your gear, because they got a band of friends together to take the throne, stab the first King in the throat, set the taxes to 100% and run around the server destroying everybody's♥♥♥♥♥♥The devs can't counter that.You could be running around as a new spawn, minding your own business, and somebody could fly across the map and hook you with a rope. They take you to their house and lock you up in stocks just to whip you and laugh about how you couldn't fight back.The devs could probably counter that; but they haven't.You could be squaring up to your friend, a stranger, or a hostile, and you could be evenly armed in every field-- except hit detection, it seems to go one way or the other in a completely unbalanced fashion. Either you kill the guy really badly, or you die really badly.The devs could probably counter that too; but they haven't.There are moments, though, where the community shines a diamond in the rough at you.A hacker flew out of nowhere, offered me a lift to the castle-- I reluctantly agreed, and he picked me up with a rope. Off we went to the castle. Next thing I knew he was battling the King whilst I was settled on the throne, taking his crown. Slowly and mockingly, as the hacker spurted some RP nonesense about him being a tyrant ruler and how he's ushering in a better age in time. In reality the guy had taxes set to 5% and the hacker wanted them to go down.Or when I was a lonely newspawn tossing about on the beach when a group of friendly fellows in full iron armor waltzed up and asked if I needed any help building a home. They chopped down trees, mined rocks and ores and did all of the work for me, to build me tools to help them get more. We eventually built me a small castle to live in, complete with furnishings, weapons for defence, and armor for survival.It could still be worth a shot to buy this game, but... you'd best bring friends to combat the loneliness of empty servers, or the trolls.

												This game is like a girlfriend who you thought was going to be the love of your life and your forever, but then turns out to be lazy, uncaring, and flat out cheats on you.Basically Codehatch decided to spit in everyone's faces and rush through another early-access game to draw on the hype and make as much money as possible. The worst part about all this is its a fool me once shame on me scenario. Wasted hype, wasted potential and if you give your $19.99, its a waste of money. Proves that Valve should reset playtime once games fully release so people can refund games that are ""completed"".			"

												Overall:This game had promise. I purchased it when it was in early access and the game still just isn't finished. Laggy combat is one of the worst of any game I have played. I was hoping for Chivarly-style combat and it fell far short.Postive:Crafting system is nice. Graphics are pretty nice even with low-level settings. Concept is unique and fun.Negative:Server Lag - Players teleport around while in combat. Bows are useless due to this. Combat is pure luck if you can hit someone. Mostly consists of getting the longest sword/axe you can and just swing until you hopefully catch them as they lag around. Tried many different servers. Latency to various servers was great, there is just some issue with how the game is designed. Servers have to perform frequent reboots due to other problems with the game running for more than a few hours. "

I have great internet, I have a great computer. I am not here to complain about FPS I have silky buttersmooth FPS. From here on I will go by bullet points on whats good and bad about this game.                               |||BAD|||*The Nedcode- Its early access blah blah blah I get it, but when I literally can't hit a player who is standing still there is an issue when the game is a strictly multiplayer game that relies on that, thats something that should be at least halfway decent when a game like this is released.*The Servers- Community servers are laggy its to be expected, that being said the official ones are either just as bad or laggier, This paired with the netcode issues is a complete nightmare.*Game Breaking bugs- Just an example in version 3 you would die before even getting into the server and get stuck in limbo making you relog or go find a new server as there isn't a ""Respawn"" button for whatever reason.. Anyway that bug was fixed in Version  4 right? No or well kinda, now the bug has evolved to where you now control 2 bodies constantly, you can even switch the POV with C toggling cameras between the bodies XD. Anyway this is early access and early alpha im not complaining toooo much I know what I was getting into.*The Castle Bridge or Sword or whatever- Building on this is toooo OP, I understand the creator wants you to make raid weapons but FFS I was on a server where one guy got on when no one else was and built a wall and encased himself just to troll, this needs to have a fix.____     \\\GOOD///*The Crafting- I love it, I don't know what else to say, the crafting is one of my favorite aspects of this game.*The World- I like how it looks definetly, its also just the right size. I honestly can't even think of something I could critisize about it, its perfect at what it is for.*Updates- Game released a few days ago and has had 4 updates, definitely something I can praise.*Tons of things to do- Kidnapping people, being a hermit, being a king, do whatever you want!**Potential- I see myself addicted if what I stated above is fixed, I really do.. Day 1 it was great and now its a hell literally. It's very sad. Anyway this game has potential to be the game people refer too when talking of a game in this genre, beating out its main opponent 'Rust'TL;DR- 10/10 potential, fix the game and my real rating would be a 9/10. As it is now I do not recommend, wait until the game is fixed.			"

								The so called Anti Cheating Software they ask you to install is in fact a keylogger. And you cannot play this game unless you install the keylogger. So just avoid if you do not want keylogging software on your PC. Also they never finished their last game before they gave up and left to do another game which is this one. They have never finished any game they started making. So I say do not buy until they remove the keylogging software and just add another Anit Cheat system like VAC.			"

								Future not looking too bright. First let's talk about the combat, absolutely terrible. Not even mentioning the character sizes, it's running in circles trying to hit eachother with uneven hit boxes. The whole balancing of characters is very off too. If you choose the smallest your character can go you're set. That being said if you choose anything above the smallest you automatically have an unfair advantage in pvp. The game does not look too great for the performance it runs at aswell. Rendering in is rough and makes me want to jab myself 9 times with a rusty spork. The building is not ideal and I challenge anyone to build a castle as the ones in the screenshots show, goodluck. Community is pretty not swell, most being jack***** and everyone KoS. No making friends in this kingdom thats for sure. I could go on with more specific details but no reason to waste your time. Bottom line is just dont buy, devs not doing much does not help the cause either.			"

Most sandboxes try to make a good melee combat system but it always turns into spamming the one attack and praying that you'll hit your opponent "

								This is an alpha and I realize still in development but this game has huge flaws which I doubt will be overcome by these developers.  -  There is no realistic ability to maintain an enjoyable solo experience.  You are pretty much forced to join a guild to survive and not lose your gear upon every logout.  -  Zero immersive factors.  It's grind grind grind for materials and lose lose lose said time and materials...nothing more.-  Horrible melee fight dynamics.Honestly the only enjoyable part of this game was building structures.  And those structures can be easily destroyed with seige weapons.I really don't think anyone in this development team has an ounce of creativity to add enough content to be worthwhile or enough outside the box thinking to resolve the balancing issues for mutiple playstyles or add any immersive enjoyability.

								Do not let the hours deceive you.I have played this game since release and to be honest, I thought it was a farely good game. I would 100% recommend this game to anyone if one thing was fixed.Imagine this: You and your friends are excited to build an amazing structured, thorough and defensive base. You spend all week gathering materials, armour and food to survive and strive with. You begin building the base. You structure it carefully to make sure that it is reinforced well, so that no pesky raiders can get in. oh no, that's in an ideal world. i forgot the part about where when you log off overnight your base is no more.The main flaw of this game is logging off. If you want to play with friends, it's useless. Your base will be gone as soon as you are, your items, everything - gone. I can't say it's the players fault, because for many servers, the concept is to capture and overpower others - but ask yourself this, is it really fair that, in a map so small, as soon as you log off, anybody can target you because YOU and your BASE will remain. Oh also, imagine walking down a path, charging your bow, firing then being launched into the air and dying with over 5K stone, Iron etc.That has happened twice now.There needs to be something implemented to fix this, this game may then have better reviews and provide a better experience for the constantly dying community.tl;dr - this game has everything ready and waiting, it's like they have everything but don't no how to put it together. No real execution.I feel really bad for writing a negative review about this, but really, I can't have much fun in a repeating cycle of grind, make base, die, base gone, repeat.Now for my Positives and Negatives.Pros -No russiansDecent / Good graphicsA good game concept.Provides a simplistic but realistic medieval concept.Good game mechanicsLots of servers and different styles.Constant updates and item additions.Cons-Your base will be gone if you leave.Map could be extended a little.You die so fast from thirst / hunger.Lots of 'bloodthirsty' people.Notice, my pros are in a larger quantity than the cons but that is not the point; the point is that there needs to be some fixes to this game before it can be a 'real' game.Fun to play, but overall I would recommend this game but not yet, do not buy yet, wait until further updates to fix some of these quite important problems.Reign of Kings, I give you -6.5/10 "

Early Access Review
								First off this game is early access so I undertand there is a lot of development left in the game. If you truly like to aid or be part of the development process then this game might be for you. The idea of this game is great, but nothing is balanced. There is no sense in building a base because it will get destroyed. If you build a granary you are a fool if you think it will last. All the cool equipment you can build,  water wells, granarys, soon to be saw mills, are just pointless at the current state. You build what you feel is an impenetrable fortress, go to bed, get on, and it is gone. For awhile that was part of the fun... trying to build something that is not destroyed in 24 hours. My friends and I would grind a day out building a base and then boom its gone. Of course we want to be able to destroy bases but the seige weapons are OP at the moment. If you do build a base you better build it floating in the sky, but come on, this is not an anti gravity planet as far as I can tell. Because of the pointlessness of gathering resources, it promotes you to just go kill people and take their resources and their bases which can be fun, but really kills the ability to achieve anything great and put on any epic battles. Fighting can be fun but once you get all that cool armor you will likely just get raided and have everything stolen in 24 hours or attacked by a group of naked people throwing javelins which is pretty funny at first. If this would be your primary interest then this game is for you. If you are wanting to build an awesome self sustaining compound where you can suit up with your friends in epic armor fighting epic battles... well its not going to happen. Also, there are frquent server wipes where all your work is wiped clean, but that is part of development so I can understand that.  On the other end of the spectrum you have the non fighting RP servers. They are great if that is your thing, but there is just no good middle ground.  It's trolls or carebares. This game is fun for all the crazy little experiences that happen, but once you realize that it is grossly unbalanced, and its just an endless grind with no real payout, it begins to lose its luster. With this said I am excited see this game develop and I am going to revisit in a month or two to see how its evolved. I wrote this review to add my 10 cents and hopefully aid in development.			"

								I like the game very much i like every game where i can build bases the only problem i have with this game is currently when u build a base of any size or tier block strengt it doesnt matter the base will be gone when u come back. U will be killed and everything will be gone exept your workstations.If they cant get into your base with swords u can get a trebuchet in like 1h of playing the ammo is also cheap. They will knock down your walls and destroy your crest place down a crest of their own and take all of your building blocks.This happend to me i spend 1 full day on a server got a nice keep with tier 5 stone walls and walls surrounding that 2 blocks thick a combination of tier 6 and 7 blocks.I came back this morning i was dead and everything was gone all my building blocks and chests looted.This case was the most extreme but i have had the same situations on other servers. The game is fun when u log into the server for a first time get some gear have some fun with being the king, protecting the king or being a rebel as for the base building its is a fun idea but u cant use it because pp will just kill u and steal everything while u sleep.And for just the king vs rebels aspect i find it not recommendation worty so i give it a negative like.

								This game was a lot of fun. It falls into the trap of public servers. Where people are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because it's fun for them to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I've wasted my last night building a stone protected building with my friend (stone requires siege equipment to break in), with a 3-tier door enterance. just to wake up the next morning dead. It's like starting again every day. Buy this if you want to play on a private server with other people. I can never recommend a creative sandbox game which has public PVP as its main driving force ever again. Especially when there's no real protection for people starting out, so the players who have the time to play and get everything way before you have a chance to protect yourself will walk all over you because it's fun for them. Either have a lot of time to waste in a game so that you can keep everyone below you dead.. or play on a private server.. or dont get another Creative Sandbox PVP public server focused game again.

								The combat is unbalanced, you could spend day after day gathering and crafting resources, have great armor and weapons only to be killed in under a minute by a freshspawn with a woodenclub. It's a battle of the ping. You could be a great figbhter but get roped and hanged. You can be killed by doors, you character could die randomly. Sure exploits are gone, but glitches are plenty. it's an Alpha, I get it, the craftinjg system is phenominal. You feel like a king building his kingdom, but the general community is sickening. People from across the globe would enter the server with countless hundreds of ping and beat you everytime. It's a pay-to-win system on whos got the best PC, or the luckiest, theres no skill. I will play this game only when its finished. You could get it now for the ride, but I think your money is best saved by waiting until you know this product is worth it.			"

								Okay so if you haven't heard, this game is AMAZING. So, here's a classic steam review story! :) *REAL REVIEW BELOW~Spawned on a beach, looked around and didn't see anyone. I then discovered I had a club and decided to run around.~Stumbled upon two lads in sleeping bags. ~Killed two lads in sleeping bags with said newly discovered club.~Spent about an hour running around until I finally reached the far end of the map...WAAAAAY away from the kings ~Spent another 4 hours building my base. After I fortified my cabin with a few walls of logs I decided I was safe and it was time to recruite a teamate! So me and this guy met up near the castle and I lead him back to the base.~On the way he sees a guy, captures him, throws a dungeon on the ground and tells me to place it so we can capture him. Now, at this time I had no idea you could even do that and I pretty much♥♥♥♥♥♥myself when my new recruit put this guy in the cage and he came on the VOIP screaming for freedom and mercy. Yeah, we left him there LOL. ~We FINALLY get back to the base, build his house on top of mine, build a tower right next to that and place a dungeon inside. We then gear up in iron armor and equip a few ropes.~We run waaay back to the castle to look for a couple of prisoners and what do you know! We spot a guy and as soon as he sees us he bolts up the hill towards the bridge so naturally as predators we follow him. Unfortunatly for them he leads us to his friend and we end up capturing both of them. ~Long story short, me and some stranger spent about 30 minutes dragging these guys through the forest back to our base on the other side of the map with them spamming the voice keys the whole time and occasionaly demanding we kill them. Eventually one got away but we locked the other in the cage. 10/10 Would capture people again.REAL REVIEW!Reign Of Kings is a medieval themed sandbox game with crafting, building, and much much more. You start as a lone peasant living in the king's land, paying the king's taxes. From here you can pretty much do anything right away, although you do start naked with only a wooden club so you might want to get started with chopping those trees. Pros:~You can capture people~Yes...literally, you can drag them around the map by a rope and when you feel like it lock them in a cage...or kill them~This game has ♥♥♥♥ing guillotines and death traps to kill your prisoners in! >:)))~Beautiful game, great lighting and foilage. made for some great sunrises~Combat is good, nice and smooth. If you get your range right and kite you can win most fights. ~Tons and tons to craft. Various building materials, upgrades, weapons, tools, etc~Weapon choice is decent, both meele weapons and projectiles are in the game~Plenty of wild life! Finally! A game that got it right! So far every time I've went out to hunt...guess what? I've hunted. To many survival games cant balance that, you either run out or its too easy.Cons:~Trees are a bit glitchy because sometimes they fly away but hey, its ealy access. Actually, for an EA game this is one of the most polished.~My prisoner escaped is rope! D: how!? he wasted all his rope escape things! :'(~None.GET THIS GAME NOW!!!!			"

								Has the potential to be one of the best pvp suvival games out there. Pros: Awesome enviorment! Lakes, streams, grasslands, well implemented rain and thunderstorms.Minecraft similar building, fast paced and fairly simpleGallows, guillotines, holding cells, lasso's nuff saidI like the King implementation, you can name your kingdom and impose a tax or no tax. No tax Kings are generally nice and just, while there are some kings who want 20% of your harvests, those kings better watch out :)Claim implementaion: Awesome no more noobs building stupid stairs on the side of your base to get in like rust for exampleNot a ridiculously giant map, but decently sized. Dont you just hate walking for 2 hours to find nothing or death like h1z1?Siege WeaponsFood and water are not used as placeholders you still have to survive but you can easily focus on other stuff.Lots of character customizationGuildsChivarly similar combatAwesome Music!For the most part im getting 60+ fps on an entry level gaming pc. X9650 cpu 16 gig ram R9 270x gpuCons: Server side issues that lowers fps, expected in a new aplhaHit boxes for stuff like doors etc need polished Edit: Hitboxes seem to be much better now on alpha 3Combat needs polishedOverall I can definitely recommend this game its great, though beware it is alpha and you will encounter bugs, server issues etc			"

								Honest review (Alpha 6) after a couple of hours played and trying out over 20 different servers with low ping.PROS:+ The game has a unique gameplay offering a lot of things to craft and build in the game world.+ Big roleplay elements already existing in the game and working pretty ok.    Example:     1) You can tie someone with a rope and then drag him with you.     2) You can hang someone, which is great looking with nice ragdoll and animations. + Majority of the game objects are good looking.CONS (a lot of them atm):- Always atleast one or more hackers/exploiters in every server (ruining the gameplay totally since it's an unforgiving game when you die)- VOIP working like♥♥♥♥♥♥ it works perhaps 10% of the times.- Only a global chat which makes it so hard to understand if someone is rather communicating with you or not.- Very hard to spot a players name e.g. player has to press ""G"" to show his name and banner. Quick solution.. add nameplates (in the real world you would easily spot someone by the looks, but in this world everyone looks the same so add nameplates...)- Server performance issues after being up a while which is causing major lagg in e.g. chat, voip, crafting, etc...- The characters need a rework in animation and mesh. They look and feel bad unfortunatly. - The melee blocking system needs to be improved both in radius of blocking and animation.For now i don't recommend this game. I will keep playing it from time to time to keep this review updated and correct.			"

												I've played Reign of Kings off and on since launch. Until they fix the combat, there's seriously no point in playing it. People blocking from behind, shorter weapons having longer distance due to desync/horrible hitboxes, and the horrible fact that groups of people who have zero skill with hold down left click - and probably still win.Bring back the combat/attack slow. Fix hit boxes for players and weapons. Make this game take skill again, instead of holding down left click, and crouching like a crab.Combat was much better patches and patches ago. Seriously, revert back to the build when desync, hitboxes, and weapons worked. Before the client change. - LameyUPDATE* 4-6-16. Combat is still full of lag, desync, etc.			"

								The game's mechanics and concept is great. The level of optimization is not. Server lag makes combat nearly impossible. For some, the game crashes every 5 to 10 minutes. In addition, the community is less than reputable for kindness and I've run into several hackers despite the installation of the anti-cheat. Furthermore, I've heard the developer does not put his games on top priority and most likely will not fix these issues any time soon.I have nothing against the game's concept and how it was put together, it would be a very fun game had these quirks been worked out a little sooner. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but that is my review.			"

								One REALLLY Important thing you need to know:Servers are owned by players. This is great for a Team Fortress Server where you invest 30 mins in a match rinse and repeat. For a sandbox MMO this is scary as hell. Examples.1. They dont pay the bill. Wipe.2. They have 15 beers and just decide to run around gozilla style and destory crap.3. Thier son that is 8 goes on a rampage.* the point here being there is a lot of time and effort to build your castle. Hell I spent 5 hours yesterday getting my small house set up 12 x 12 x 4 entry hall with 2 doors to slow down someone going through doors. I slept for 5 hours and woke up to 6 blocks missing from a wall in a spot I can tell did not get beat now manual. I have no clue how they destroyed my wall but they cleaned out my 30 items i had stored including a starter club, ax, pickaxe. Guessing since they didnt take the easy way in... The 1500 hp door but instead descroy 21000 hps of wall that they used seige or hacked. Not sure. I digress from the point.** I see no point in playing this game unless you buy a server and run it because otherwise you will eventually lose everything when the owner gets bored. I recommend going in with 2 friends and play 10 dollars each and get a 40 person server and find a few people you trust from other games to pitch in for admin. *** Do Not Even do that until there is a sure way to ban people and keep them banned.Pros:1. FUN   - Minecraft style building blocks for housing lots of cool stuff to make.  - Fun combat when not roped and drug all over the place and dealing with speed/invis hackers2. Beautiful.  - I like the world itself the art is good. (with the exception of char design which is blah but funny)3. built in voice4. Very hostile game. 3/4 people that find you are going to try and kill you. Con:1. Private servers (every 30 days you wonder if the lights are going out).  - I'd rather the game designer rent the servers through a hoster so if one is abandonned someone can pick it up.  - You'll really need to spend some time trying to find good/honest admins before you move into a server.2. Too many hackers/cheating admins3. built in voice4. They have a lot of work to do to beat the hackers. **example** no real way to keep people banned.5. Very hostile game. 3/ people that find you.... this is a huge issue when you spawn and get killed over and over before you can homestead and figure out the map at all.It all boils down to, IMO, you cant do a sandbox MMO with private own servers/admin. SWGEMU is about the best of that lot that i've seen so far, and anyone that has spent any time on those servers can see how the admin even of the best servers ocationally go off on rampages. With the much smaller investment of 20 to 70 bucks a month the server owner abuses will just be out of control on most servers. And even when they dont abuse very few servers will have the admin support to keep hackers out of you home at 3 am. The current Gen of gammer will eat this game up. Spend 20 dollars once, go to a server hack and steal  a week of someones walls and build a fortress in hours. If you get banned (even if they make it stick) move on to NA E C34 and do it there until you get banned. They have no investment in money or time so what is it to them that they screw up some poor players month of work.			"

												Reign of Kings has a simple plot and that is gather, craft, storm the King's castle, execute the king and finally claim the throne. The concept is bad, but could be better if they actually tried. Not much thought process in terms of gameplay and execution.Reign of Kings has been released for going on a year now and in its current state is still an Early Access title. My 1 hour playtime is more than enough to see how Codehatch works. Yes, let's not forget the amateur development team is Codehatch. Remember when they release Starforge unfinished and abandoned Starforge afterwards? I still remember. Codehatch made me realize that I don't need to be so trusting with Early Access titles, and I thank them for being nothing but scam artists. You might ask, ""Then why are you here buying another one of their games?"" - Well, this game is dirt cheap, so dirt cheap it is worth $4 or less on certain websites, not $19. Still trying to think of reasons why Reign of Kings is $19 when this game is worth no more than $6~$9 in its current state. Not sure who would pay full price for Reign of Kings in the first place, not me!My first impressions when first logging in is my character (camera) uncontrollably started spinning. I'm sitting here like, ""what?"". So I searched to see if anyone else had the same issue and they did. Apparently having a controller plugged in will cause this and you have to unplug it for it to stop. Ultimately that is no solution if you didn't want to unplug your controller.After I had to be forced to unplug my controller, I joined the same server with my friend. We were farming and all of a sudden some laggy chinese guy on a US server started coming after us fully geared. He killed us both. After that incident he started camping, killed my friend again whilst I'm avoiding him. Don't forget we're new with no gear. Afterwards my friend gets stuck, and with no way in becoming unstuck he had to be forced offline and we haven't played since then.During that time I found out that gathering, you start off with a crappy axe to gather wood (and other resources), but gathering other things is basically running around pressing the pick-up action button. Items like clay, wood and other certain resources have to be gathered with a tool (I never tried unarmed). Crafting is just a big scroll menu with categories and there's no search bar in the said crafting menu (if there is I missed it).I honestly never got to try the ""fun stuff"" since we could never get that far. We'd either be killed by a higher tier player and camped, become stuck with no way in getting unstuck (unless we were killed) or we cannot find certain resources because they are very scarce for some reason. Yes, we could go on servers with 0 players, but what's the point? It is a multiplayer game and a pretty dead one.OverallReign of Kings probably had potential when they were very actively developing it or when it first announced. It appears this game had a nice spotlight on it at the start where everyone had ""fun"" in it, but those days are over. The game's current state is awful, especially when they had plenty of time to make it better than it is; not much content, gathering, crafting and combat are VERY simple and safe, servers are almost always empty or very low populated, and it feels, yet again that Codehatch released their own game too soon since Reign of Kings should still be in Early Access.Rating: 2/10.It might appear that I'm very aggressive, but Codehatch has always been a disappointment. They are such a disappointment, I'd rather write a positive review about No Man's Sky and praise Hello Games. Avoid Codehatch in the future.			"

												Games Rubbish. I know that my time playing this is shorter than what people like to see. However i must say the game was entertaining at first. I played for 24hours the first time i got this 3months ago. Raiding bases, community wasn't as toxic as csgo or dota, base building was decent, and hackers were few. (In my region anyway)Built a base which took 10 hours of my life, but it was worth. (Playing with a m8 btw)Comes back on 1 day later, sees it destroyed. You know what i thought....Fair enough. My dissagreements back then were the fact that people blocked of the palace for themselves so unless ur not in there group you couldnt become king or get the loot. However i had no intention of becoming king so i wasn't that mad. Played yeasterday. Spent about another 10-15 hours on the game. Made a better base, much more solid, can't be raided without a treb. and even if you did it was hard to enter the base. It was a great base btw. Nearly was able to make a siege works. (Which takes forever.)Come on today. No base, im dead but i can spawn in my bed even though its gone. i go to where my base was, no debree etc. There is a small sign. ""I delete ur base♥♥♥♥♥""So i ask in chat, peeps tell me that a there bases were also deleted. Now ik what u think. Sever wipe. But bridges in the water etc were still there. So now im♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Some hacker deletes my base that i worked on forever.Read online this is a re occuring problemR8 game 7/10 for funBut overall r8 2/20 for devs input in stopping this problem. Its a no from me.			"

								Great game concept and the fun gameplay.  Its got a minecraft open world building style, but with simplified resource gathering that is limited to nodes that repop fairly often, I really enjoyed building castles, and upgrading the crafting stations to build better and better items.   The pvp combat system is pretty cool, but can be difficult with lag.   I enjoyed defending my castle with guild mates, but never quite got to the point of trying to be king.   Im not a great PVPer, so the full loot drop can be annoying, but that is part of the game.  No problem there. The big problem comes with griefers.  Getting attacked while you are in the game is part of the game, but logging back in after a day away, and fining ALL of you stuff gone kinda ruins it.  Im not sure if there are exploits that allow some people to pick up your stuff, or if they really spent the time to smash every single item, but on our server several people were shocked to find everything that they had built gone.    There is no safe storage, and even when you log out, your body stays in game, and can be killed and looted.   I was on a ""NO GRIEFING"" server, but it still happens.  Also, there is no way to identify people until they waive at you.  So you cant tell friend from foe unless they happen to be wearing different armor.  So if someone kills you and takes all of your stuff, you dont even know who to to get revenge on.   So at this point I am done with this game.  I will watch for updates, and I will be glad to change my recommendation to Yes if they come up with a way to stop griefers.			"

								I wouldn't recommend this game until it is finished or the content of the game is changed to a point, where you can actually play it without being online 24/7.Pro:          1. it is fun to build your castle/base and it is pretty easy to farm ( for ages )         2. the pvp fights are fun and easy to handle, you can kill anybody with the starter kit, if you know             how to grind and block ( even a man of ""steel"")         3. the graphic is really good. overall the sound and ambient are pretty neet (animals, gras etc.)         4. you can interact in various ways with other people: befriending, beheading, capturing them,                play music, form a guild etc.         5. berries         6. zombies and werewolfs         7. you can create your own male ""survivor""Con:           1. due to it is an alpha game the game is LOADED with hackers who: teleport the zombies to              the starter region, can destroy every wall with 1 hit, can have god mode, can empty the               inventory of ALL players on the server, can make serves invisible during the ddos attacks and              everything you can imagine (probably former starforge owner's, no heartfeelings =))         2. it takes pretty long to harvest enough resources to build things ( like stone, wood and so on)              because you have to compete with others on the resources you need to gather, which leads              sometimes to fights or even you being caught as a starter by others who wait near the              resources ( that is a con,  because there aren't enough resource points over the map, just              central more or less next to the castle)         3. you think your conquered area is secure? nah, nevermind. why? anyone can enter your              ""base"" with a trebuchet and find your beloved ""crest"", will destroy it, put his/ hers on the wall               and will totally rip apart your ""beloved"" base. meaning, you gather 2 days worth of resources,               take at least 3 hours to build your stuff and a kid of 10 years will destroy everything within an                hour of not that much work or you just stay on 24/7 to protect everything.          4. glitches and bugs everywhere ( ok that is normal for an alpha, but never seen it that ""much"")          5. community consists of a. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s b. hackers c. a hacker♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d. proper people which get               ♥♥♥♥ed up by♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥or hackers e. newbies which get ♥♥♥♥ed up by anybody          6. updates are frequent. you think that is a good thing? Sure it is, if there wasn't the ""wipe"". it               sounds like an urban myth, like a monster from beneath, but it simply means this: you build a               base for 3 days straight? It survived the hackers and little kids who want to destroy your               stuff? GREAT. Here comes an update, which leads to a total server wipe and ALL your Stuff               is gone. You wanne try again? Sure, wait for the next wipdate... oh update. Btw. don't play                on official servers, because they are always get wiped with a new update and restart every               15mins.          7. the character creation of your ""champ"" is server based. so you have to create on every              server a new champion with a new name, appearance and banner. Sure it is fun to create               something new on every server, but why isn't it possible to bind like three champs onto an               account (like on champ per profil in 7dtd), which can be later ""modified"" via potions of               apperance. Why? You can't figure out friend or foe, because on every server the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;               from the last server can be another person on the next. It also helps the hackers =)           8. if you are able to get ""steel"" it isn't a warp jump from iron, as it was for stone to iron.                Meaning: your steel weapons only get a +1 dmg more than an equal iron weapon,                sometimes even the range is worse than with iron. I would a expect a better outcome of                using ""steel"" as +1dmg and a little more damage you can take. ( you have to have charcoal,                oil and iron ore and an upgraded lvl 2 anvil to produce steel)           9. You want to log out? Sure. You want to keep your stuff? Not so sure. Why? If you log out on                the field or somewhere not safe, someone will find your ""sleeping"" body, slaughter you, get                all your stuff and the next time you log in... guess what, starter beach :) Which also can                happen, if somebody breaks your crest and steals all of your base and then still slaughters                you.          10. Someone killed you or harassed you?  Wanne see his name? No can't do. Well that is my                  problem. There are only three ways to see somebodies name:                 a. he writes in the chat and admits that he or she enjoys slaughtering newbies at the beach                     or capturing them                b. somebody, actually is a decent player and waves at you with ""g""                c. you are lucky enough, to punch that idiot in his/her face and his/her name is shown for a                       brief moment on the  lower right side of your screen conclusion: I bought this game and played it a lot. It is fun at stages, but more frustrating until a point you don't want to play it anymore. I won't play this game until following things aren't resolved:a. to easy removal of your crest by others which leads to removal of your whole base after putting their crest upb. anti hacker tool ( vac, sure)c. closable crest (with locks) d. a fixed amount of champion creation per accounte. better feedback of codehatch in regard of their ""server wipes"" and handling the thingsf. a better balance between steel and iron, because steel is nearly useless in comparison to the jump from wood to iron ( if someone actually uses stone/wood)g. the name problemPS: I don't mind errors I mad while writing this.

								I do NOT recommend this gamethe hatch in codehatch is located on the rear of the developers bottom which is where all their code comes fromsave your money and buy Dying light and see what a real AAA game is like, it will run 10,000 times better than this will, and it is 10,000 times betterdo not be fooled, this is copy pasted code from thier last game starforge, which they never finished. this code has not changed it is horribly unoptimized, it is the equivalent of a stick swinging simulator, nothing more, one plane of water, one plane of terrain, a bunch of nodes you can swing your stick at, to make a better stick, to swing at other players,the building system is joke because it causes so much lag., what we got from starforge was a bunch of stuff thrown together, what you get from Reign of kings is a copy paste of that, with a minimal facelift, minus infinate voxel terrain, minus vehicles, and you are now locked into a single multiplayer game mode where not the greatest of things can happen to you. this is not gaming people.please double read the early access warning:Note: This Early Access game is not complete and may OR MAY NOT CHANGE FURTHER If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development.in code hatches case this game will not progress any further, they will call it done in a few months and on to their next excretion from their backdoor hatchI Implore you remove this from your wishlists! be warned and do not support this developers practice. i have purchased many early access games and spent a decent amount of time playing them, some are great like 7 days to die, i have spent nearly 200 hours playing and they really put some work into that game, they listen and interact with their community.

								I played for an hour and saw people running on their sides and in mid-air. Too laggy to stand next to a friend without one of  us flying away for no reason. The official server I was on also allowed everyone to take control of other peoples characters by pressing 'c', which allowed us to kill whoever we wanted.  Just because a game is early access and not complete does not mean it should be given a pass and not be criticized, if the makers of the game are confident enough to offer it up for sale than it should atleast be a functional and playable game which for me it is not.  I believe that people who defend poorly made games such as this one are helping to set a scary new standard for game development.I would not buy this game if given a chance to do it over, hopefully it improves in the future.

I love the game concept, which is why i purchased it but the game is just not playable ...1/10 DONT BUY THIS EARLY ACCESS GAME .. i know that its Early access game and it contains lots of bugs .. but Early access games should alteast be  PLAYABLE ..  this game is far from being playable ..---- edit : the official server im playing where i used most of my time in this game disappeared .... ♥♥♥♥ this game			"

												I installed the game, full of hope for building and roleplaying. I read the complaints, and I thought to myself, ""Well, I can deal with some hackers, whatever.""And I was right. Hackers were never a problem.Unfortunately, the frame rate was. I went to the server with the best connection possible and set my graphics as low as they could possibly go. Even with all this, the game still ran at 15 frames per second or less. The menu screen itself was laggy. I use a pretty new, nice laptop computer. I can run Skyrim with 50+ mods at medium quality with almost no issue, but this game at the lowest possible settings refused to work for me.All in all, my experience was terrible, and I refunded Reign of Kings within an hour to get Oblivion instead.

												Okay, lets start this off simple. Reign of Kings is a Medieval Sandbox Survival Game, where you scavenge a vast world filled with various ressources. You do all this under the Ancient Throne, which you can claim as a Player and become King.The Game comes with a combat system that reminds me of Chivalry (only with more spamming & jumping), and a small Community. There are about 15 Official Servers you can play on.Now to the Fun part. There is no Fun in this game, this game is frustrating at best. Unless you have People to play with you  will grind 6h+ atleast to have a solid founding. Then everything is luck. While some ressources are easy to obtain, for example wood, you have to find specific spots for farming things like stone, iron, clay etc. while you have no Map (not a con I'd say) this can be quite tedious sometimes. With enough ressources you can build a ""crest"" with which you can claim land. In this land your buildings are protected from ""block decay"" and other player can't trespass as easy.Now, did I mention luck before? Even after grinding & farming there are many bugs that can kill you or give you an huge disadvantage. I've seen players pushed into walls, flying loot, fatal game crashes and enemies that teleport. This game has them all.To summarize the game, it is as good as its artwork. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but sometimes Funny... but mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥.Oh, and don't get me started on the huge FPS drops that happen from time to time.Only buy this game if you plan to play within a community server, or have a group to play with.Thats about it.

								This game is an awesome experience with a close niche private community. If you intend on playing this solo or on a public server get ready for a long dreadful experience in a hacker's dream of a horrible developer creation of an amazing medieval world. If you know anything of these developers then you know they created the alpha starforge and abandoned it after more than a years worth of false promises to backers and its community. However, if your like me and are a stupid fool who doesnt learn after getting bent over once then join me in the stupidity of alpha access games. Where developers make tons of money for making a great initial release of a game hype up its community with promises to come then after seeing sales plummet after a couple months of the initial release decide...hey lets just make a new game instead of pouring hundreds of hours into a game that will make us less in the long run...The direction this game can go is endless, the devs can redeem themselves by creating the best indie game of the year if they just stick to improving the game's engine and adding more content to the game. I do not believe these amateur devs have it in them though. For one, make a good lag free engine game, if these devs were capable of making a decent coded game then this game wouldnt be hacker simulator 2015; starforge and reign of kings are both extremely horrible coded and optimized games. Two, stick with a game that will not make as much money as it has from initial release rather than just making another good initial game with high hopes and promises of future content. Three, atleast change your mom's basement of a company's name from ""code][atch"" to ""get bent backers"", eventhough it wouldnt be hard for people to find out where you came from before... still would look better on steam store page. If by some miracle these developers decide to stick with supporting the game with further content and optimization then I will take back everything I said about them and their company, but I just dont think these independent amaetur game developers have it in them to deliever on the longevity of their partialy completed games.

Early Access Review
								Love this game already. As you can see from my playtime, I'm playing this exclusively since it came out. This is my 4th edit, editting it each day of alpha. TL;DR - Yes the game is very much worth your time, and at 20 dollars it's a steal. I would recommend it up to 40 dollars tbh.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------MOST IMPORTANT IMO - SANDBOX FACTOR: Obscenely high! Everyone wants to make a sandbox game these days, and almost all of them fall short of the most important thing: something to DO that feels meaningful. With these other titles, you start the game, you make your fortress/grind out top end crafting, and you're done. The game is over. If PVP is a thing you defend it, but it's live or die and respawn. In this game, you have a king who constantly taxes you. That guy is the worst. All of your activities as a little islander peasant are constantly accompanied by a sense of something more: either you're working towards gearing up to take on the king, or you're working towards making your little shack in the woods to gank people at, or you're building an impenetrable fortress to house your max level crafting tables and hoard of materials.There's no other way to put it: with the perma death, loot loss, always-existing (when you log out you're just laying there in the game, asleep and vulnerable)  and the options for imprisoning and such, the game feels meaningful, and not like another empty sandbox. As far as gankfest goes: On a server with a large popualtion of new players, the ""spawning beach"" rapidly devolves into a Rust-style ""beat people with sticks senselessly"" idiot-fest. However, on servers with stable populations, people ratehr quickly evovle past that. Ocne you get some armor on, I woul say 1 out of every 5 or so people you encoutner will kill on sight. Most are just trying to build their little home and don't wanna fight to the death over some berries.Which brings us to the real glory of this game. The sandbox is so real. remember how ArcheAge offered us player housing? Remember Star Wars Galaxies, where you built wherever and made it home? This game has what you want. Build a structure and hang a crest on the wall, and no one can build within a certain radius unless they breach your walls (which requires siege equipment at higehr tiers, and a double thick wood wall would take 45 minutes to break a one-tile hole through) and take out the crest. No one can minecraft-style build a little bridge and hop your wall if you have a creat up and you build intelligently. You can absolutely have your own fort... and once the server grows, everyone is eyeballing their neighbor and thinknig about what some siege equipment would be like...COMBAT: Intuitive but currently not that deep. I think it needs a man-at-arms dodge a la Chivalry and that alone will add 90% of the needed depth. I say this because the combat currently boils down to attack and block, since there's no quick-step and overhead/jab do not alter the damage you deal. Very promising, but not quite there yet. Ranged is where it's at, mostly because the melle is definitely not at a Chivalry level of depth, but since they're aiming to model after Chivalry, I have high hopes here.CRAFTING: Incredible. Upgrade workbenches to unlock better/more complex items to craft. Resources are scattered and scarce enough that it's not as easy as making a little fort and investing time to unlock everything. You're going to have to wander out and find where each thing spawns, gather and come back, it's that simple. Adds to the meaningful sandbox feel.SURVIVAL: Food and water are a thing, but this isn't Project Zomboid levels of survivalism. The primary risk is players/wild animals, which is how I feel it should be. The hunger/thirst are tuned in such a way that you can spend 80+% of your game time doing things other than gathering food/water, which I feel is a great balance. PRICE POINT: It's 20 bucks man. That's dirt cheap, and considering that the game feels like a full game already, 5 hours into launch, I think it's an extremely solid investment. Updating now on day 3, and I would gladly have paid 40 dollars for this game as-is now. I'll be very surprised if the price doesn't go up as the game develops, as I can see this being a big hit. ---Updated for Day 3 of Alpha release--No wipes, and there have been patches. Devs are actively working on this title. According to McDuderstein in the comments, the devs are posting on the RoK Facebook page when they are taking servers down for testing, which is great.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bugs I've Heard of:I've heard that sometiems doors will be closed client side, but register as still being open server side. I've never experiecned it, but I recommend building multiple doors at your entrance just in case.Bugs I've experienced:Sometimes you'll try to itneract with a workbench, or attack, and nothing will happen. Logging otu and back in usually resolves, if not close the client and re-open.Sometimes you'll attack an enemy and not see any damage markers, they won't die, etc. You're probably de-synced; again, close the client and re-launch and it should resolve. It's a good idea to whack an animal every so often to check for this: I had a 30 minute excursion of gathering earlier, attacked a werewolf on the way back, didn't do damage and realized I was bugged. when I re-logged, I was back at the base, and my whole excursion had taken place in de-sync land, meaning it never happened. Not too brutal, but a bit of a waste of time.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Those are the only bugs I've experienced! Again, I think at 20 dollars the game is a steal, and I would feel perfectly fine if I'd paid 30. Highly recommend the game, and the only things I see needing improvement are combat depths, server stability, and lag (you get serverwide lag spikes every so often when the server is close to full). Server stabiltiy seems to be their primary focus right now, which is quite alright with me!			"

												I've played the game at several different times throughout the early access and have to say this is far from a ""Final Product"". The patches they would update never added much content to the game that was desired in ways of new: building, seige, weapons and armor. Instead would update things like a new type of vegetable or decreese the amout of recsources gathered per node. With the updates I've seen and this being the launch release product, in the state it is, I do not recommend buying it.			"

												Reign of Kings has some interesting ideas that make it stand out from just another run-of-the-mill Crafting/Survival game. The only problem is utilizing these ideas so that they actually have impact and make the world feel real and unique.I think it would be interesting if you did not have to pay the King's tax, but doing so runs the risk of the Kingsmen/a tax collector coming after you or putting a bounty on your head. It would also be great if you could become say a Merchant, and sell/barter goods from a stand. As well as if the King could do good things too, like plan cities and organise the people to improve the land on which they all share.The character creation and voxel building are good the way they are, and I enjoyed the combat when I played as well. The maps are cool as well, especially the procedural ones.All in all, I think Reign of Kings is at an important position in the crafting/survival world; They have all the means to make their game THE definitive medieval crafting survival game, but it is currently stuck as Medieval ""Kill-the-man-with-the-ball"" and I fear that will not change any time soon. It is for that reason that I cannot currently recommend this game, but if they add some more structure to their already great concept and decent execution, I believe they can become a front runner of the genre, or at least medieval gaming enthusiasts.As of 12/16/2015 I will be looking into future updates for RoK and will change my review based on how those updates improve/damage the game.

								You know, I wish I could give this a positive review, I really want to, It is a really fun game, especially with friends and i do enjoy playing it, but it got to the point where the only way you could have fun was running your own server so that you could atleast attempt to kick the hackers who joined, but that meant somone staying awake and on it 24/7 to kick any hacker out.and not to be racist but all of them use chinese lettering, or some sort of kanji , so they are asian, all of the hackers, literally. I do not understand why they do not have better protection on this game  , they really need to .other than the insane amount of hackers ( spent 4 days building a wonderful castle enclosed in walls with my friends, there was about 5 or 6 of us, one guy came in and killed us all, everything we attacked with did zero damage as he was hacking and put himself in godmode he literally just walked through our iron doors and everything, we were kitted out in steel ..so yes the hackers are ridiculous and ruin it, other than that it is a great game, great concept, there crafting system and building system is pretty good, only other issue i could say there is is cutting down trees, you gotta hit it in the right spot or it does nothing .

Since Steam's users love the funny story-like reviews, I'll tell you the story of my RoK experience so far:- Choose a new server, after losing all the hope I had in the last one (and in the game) because my ""inexpugnable"" base was destroyed and hours of work lost.- *insert Star Wars A New Hope poster here*- Spend hours to find the perfect place for my base, and gather all the resources needed to build the BIGGEST AND SAFEST BASE EVER!- Here comes the only funny and creative part of the game: the building part. You actually have a lot of possibilities and stuff to build.- Base: Done! Now It's time to defend it! OOYAH! SWORDS! CLANG CLANG! BOWS! ARMOURS!- Kill stuff and defend my base: Done!- I had a great day! Time for some rest and quality time with GF and friends.- Zzzzzz...- ???- Profit? F*** NO!- My castle has been destroyed to the base in a few hours...but how?! It was the biggest and safest base ever!- Lose hope.- ...- Repeat.Reign of Kings...you disappointed me. I trusted you, and you failed me. *insert Alfred crying scene here*Should you buy this game for 20 bucks? Nope.Should you buy this game for 5 bucks? Maybe...but prepare your soul. You are going to fall in a never ending nightmare, unless you play the game 24/7 with like 20 freaking full-steel kids.Good luck, and have fun.			"

								Riegn of Kings The highly addictive Medival rip-off of 7 days to die (literally has sounds and rabbit/deer modules from 7 days to die) game were you spend 90 percent of your time getting stone and dirt wich is rare and iron wich is less rare then dirt to build your castle and have massive battles with other kingdoms. Well thats what you thought in reality the other kngdom will attack your castle when everyones offline and kill all of your friends in there sleep (yes when you log out the players body stays i think its a cool feature but thats just me) most of your deaths wont even be fun battles were you fight you will mostly get roped and killed without a fighting chance ,rope mechanic needs to be removed from the game period its broken and allows 2 naked fresh spawns to kill a fully armored player who has been playing for days getting real weapons.Honestly this game has potentiol but right now its a waste of money the maps are small the stone you need for castle is rare even though the map has mountains of just rock wich for some reason you cant mine ... What this game should have stolen from 7 days to die is the random map generator and the mining system from that game.    -1/10 would not spend 16 hours on building a house and getting resources to be killed by 2 naked midgets who shoved sticls up my♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Im going to be honest this game had so much potential when it first came out.when i first got this game i had a lot of fun playing it with my friends, they where adding more content and fixing bugs. But then a coupple of monthes later they just kinda went under the radar. we didnt know what was going on till a coupple of weeks later that they were ABANDONING THE GAME i was so angry because i had spent money on this game that had so much potential and then they just smack us in the face and run of with the money. Now let me tell you a story about the asian hackers after everyone herd about this the worst thing happend the ASIAN hackers came out of hiding and just destroyed us all some people tryed to defeat them by hacking and forming the anti asian squad me and my friend in a war with them but they were to powerful with there god mode. soon after they killed us all and we had no idea what to do and then we just decided the quit because the devs are not going to do anything about it.So to sum this up don't buy this game its full of hackers and has been abandoned just like another game i played *cough* H1z1 *cough*.

Also, a hacker turned on flying, I flew into a wall and died instantly, then I got banned from the server. 10/10, admins are the best anti-cheat.

While this game boasts some very interesting features, the servers are primarilly filled with players who simply grieff new players; Dragging them around with ropes, and beating them, then locking them in cages for amusement.

												The Principe itself is pretty fun. i found myself spanding multiple hours farming recources and building up a base. But that is where the fun ends.Movement and fights feel way to clunky,The game is not even close to being done right now,The Community makes this game too frustrating, because after building up a base for a few hours and then actually leaving the game to go to sleep its where the community shines. Had a base? Well not anymore. Your on a Roleplay server with no KoS? Well ♥♥♥♥ that. Want Admins to be active? Wtf is wrong with you?Just like Raiding ""badasses"" you can find a lot of hackers around. Even though i just played for a few hours, i can already tell that this game has been the most frustrating thing ever. Real Combats like in the trailers are oftentimes never the case. Combat mostly is limited to laggy peeking with a sword or getting stuck in random trees. If you have the luck to get a combat that means.If you ever feel safe enough to go offline youll find yourself respawning at beach, starting at 0 because someone raided you.Maybe if the game brings features to denie things like that and actually does something against the amount of hackers that ruin the game completely, i will find myself spending a few more hours but until that day, i will never return for this game and suggest you to not buy it right now.TLDR: The game itself is ok but not even close to being done.The Community ruins the game. Hackers are common and most Servers are just Kill on Sight nomatter what the rules of the server say.Wait a few more months until you pick it up because right now, its not worth the money.			"

												well the game seemed like it would be fun at first, so i paid my five bucks as did my entire clan we made out our materials and worked really hard to make great looking castles and structures. not even a day later the castles were raided all of our stuff was gone and we started having problems with hackers (dispite supposedly having software to stop hacking) would i reccomend this game? not unless your willing to put in 100 hours to have to do it all from scratch again and again and again. pvp was horrid and glitchy. the overall game mechanics are like an overglorified minecraft with all of the fun elements of minecraft lobotimized out of it. for a game that promises building and exitement it falls short by a long shot. if i was given money to play the game i still wouldnt play it because it's a god damned waste of time. there is nothing fun about spending 30 hours crafting only to have all that hard work♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥away by some ten year old with no respect or sense of humanity. to sum up. game is completely unbalencedthe game community is the♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥of humanity waiting to grow up and start Breaking and entering. 100 hours of my life wasted on a game that is a piece of wrapped in gold foil. Devs I sure hope you are paying attention because i just want you to know this is by far the worst game ive played in 20 years. it brings out the absolute worst in people I give a rating of 1 out of 10, congradulations on your griefer's rendition of a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor minecraft with no digging and no fungame art was horrendous. about the only thing i can see that is good about the game is you paid a child to spend six thousand hours to draw at 4 dollars an hour. lastly there is no steam community modererators for support issues and questions. go back to the drawing board when you have a game with better rules instead of making the server moderators do your work for you. this game is a complete waste of time, money and energy			"

								I don't really recommend this game for a few glaring reasons.Combat system- A dude with a club can kill a fully kitted player just by constantly swinging the club. No skill at all is needed as the club stuns you and resets all combat animations. I have tested this several times, and even as king, you can be rekt by a single dude swinging a damn stick against a man in steel armor and a 7ft flamberge. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Siege equipment- takes a ton of resources to make and to make ammo for. On the up side, you can load the stupid thing with so much ammo that one shot can take out an entire wall of stone (and no I don't mean cobble, I mean the top tier stone) that is 4 thick. I can literally spend a day getting and crafting 500 shots, and then go to the biggest and baddest base, and 2 shot it to oblivion. Woo friggin hoo.Lack of any anticheat or region locks- this, this right here, is the biggest detriment to this game. The fact that I , along with 13 others, held the throne on a server for 2 weeks, just to have 4 asian hackers fly in and remove all of our crests, made me give up entirely. 4 people was all it took to kill a server.. 4. I saw these 4 ♥♥♥♥tards on several other servers, with much the same result. They came in, removed all the crests from player bases, spawned in trebs and ammo, and ♥♥♥♥ed an entire server. We held them off for four days hoping that they would just get tired of being owned over and over, they could have cared less. And so could codehatch.Overall- don't get the game. Official servers are rife with hackers and griefers. Private servers are rife with morons and rpers with stupid rules. Do yourself a favor, if you feel like getting this game, bash yourself in the face with your keyboard. YOu'll feel like doing that anyways after a few hours on an official server.			"

This is not a case of opinion or misunderstanding...it's just fact that Code}{atch is basically run by a scam artist who knows exactly what he's doing.  They shouldn't even be allowed to upload any more games to Steam.If you've been watching funny YouTube videos of people playing this and you want to experience it for yourself, you should know that your experience will be nothing like that.

												First of all. Do not support the developers. They were obligatoried to make it into a full release. So they ""Did"" as it seems. The game is still in Alpha state, which means it lacks a lot of content. They abandoned the game, and f****d the fans. Don't support them. Really. It's like paying somehow to punch you. That is how buying this game feels like. On the other hand, one of the mayor aspect of the game, is combat. Ofcourse it is. Why, I hear you ask? Because this is PVP Medieval, including Raiding game. By all means, you might just get destroyed, because the blocking sucked, or the hitbox failed. It is simple, yet Clungy. Take a hit, block or just spam. No different ways of attacking, and no different ways of blocking. Mount and Blade is perfect combat, just mentioning. This is not. But anyway. have a good day.

								Well after playing 15h on couple Official servers i do NOT recommend to buy this at this stage, Imagine ur roaming around, killing breaking into other people houses garthering all this loot, just to find ur self Freeze suddenly... and it lasts forever untill u relog, or someone run to you and kill you ( u cannot do anything beside loggin out, and within 15h of gameplay it happened 6 times ) after that, either when u log out or ben kiled, u land at your base, with doors n stuf assuming u got one, doesnt matter if u died, or just relogged, all the stuff u gathered is gone, sometimes even stuff in chest u gathered 1 day before is simply gone. You make urself iron armor, go out, lets say u die, u respawn naked in ur house, make yourself a new armor, lets say leather, u go out and you desync, relog, u land in ur house in a IRON PLATE, all the resources you used for leather armor are gone, all you picked up and put inside ur chests past 2-3h is GONE... well enough about game play, its♥♥♥♥♥♥atm			"

								You spawn on the beach. You go inland for maybe a minute. Group of two sees you and its clear as you're partially naked you just started. They chase you. They rope you (Which there is no chance to miss if you aim right. and NO struggling out of). They put you in a stockade. You Cannot suicide. You cannot respawn. You cannot escape at all. They leave you. Enjoy waiting an hour for your character to die of starvation. Balancing is required. Especially if somebody can chase you for half an hour and leave you for two in a stockade. Game needs work. Enjoy the lasso of bordom.			"

								""Note: This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development.""    I understand that this game is new, and that there will be bugs and everything of the sort. I can tolerate the bugs, and the glitches and the framerate because it -is- an Early Access game, I can even deal with the people who KoS. It's not going to be perfect from the start.   I picked up this game because I liked the premise. I'm a huge medival game fan, and a game where you could literally become King? Heck yeah! I held off on my initial purchase and watched videos on YouTube just to see how the game would be. And I instantly liked it. So I bought it, and gave it a go myself, and I had a really good starting experience.I found a server that I liked, and began playing. And I wasn't instantly killed by some naked man, which made it all the better. I found a nice spot to build, and spent literally all night building this house surrounded by a stone wall. I made friends, killed a couple players because they tried to steal my stuff. And was eventually in full steel armor and steel sword. And this is where things went south.I was returning to my home base, and found a man in full steel building blocks to jump into my base. I tried to communicate to him through the VoIP, to no responce. My house was fully locked up and there wasnt anything he could do that wouldnt take serious time and me preventing him to. Then I discovered he was a hacker. And in the span of two minutes, my base was demolished, I was dead, and all the resources I had spent time to gather were gone.That was my biggest problem. Hackers are literally running free and doing whatever they want to whoever they want with no repercussions. I've read the reviews and I know I'm not the only one who's had this problem. And I know i'm just another person writing a review and complaining about hackers being the sole reason for a negative review. But it's something that needs fixed. I will continue to try and enjoy the game, but I don't think I could take another situation that took me all night to get accomplished, just to have someone come and ruin everything in two minutes.

								Great game but the hackers and exploiters ruin it. Simply put, save your money for now and come back later. Hopefully come future beta stages they obtain some kind of better anti-cheat engine. Untill then you can play and enjoy yourself but once you own a true castle you will find yourself hacked eventually. No damage to the base but all your loot will be gone. One time too many.			"

												I like how the survival, building and crafting works into the game, but the combat is terrible. I was having a fight with someone with the same armor and weapon as me. I hit him about 17 times in the chest, he hit me about 3 times. He then hit my head and 1 hit me. A headshot that does 15x damage? For ♥♥♥♥ sake, in this game if you dont get headshots you cant kill anyone in combat. Also the animations for attacking are very strange, as they seem like the person is crouching and slamming their sword on your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Makes it harder to hit headshots while they are striking.			"

												This game had plenty of potential when I bought it in early acess over a year ago. The company is known for creating very substandard games. The monstrosoty starforge was a very big cash grab for their audience. Never the less we gave them a chance. After a year of development the game is still extremley similiar with barely anything added. The game is ruined by bugs and hackers and the developers don't listen to the community. I will never purchase anyother codehatch game again. I've put many hours into this game and I can't believe I've wasted so much time on such tripe. If you want to waste time in anger then go ahead and play it.			"

												I actually bought this in the early days when I first watched FrankieOnPcin1080p's first video on it which really had me pumped for the game. The game had great potential and was a unique concept. I jumped straight in and played and the game was fun. There were many bugs but I really enjoyed playing the game from building, to raiding, harvesting resources and even the fights or in my case, running away from fights. I tried the game more recently after a very long absence and the game has been butchered. Hacking and cheating is everywhere with nothing in place to stop it. Raiding is exctinct, the devs thought that an unkillable crest was a good idea, which lead to multiple sky bases where people hid their items so high in the atmosphere, that it became impossible to raid. It really has become a complete trainwreck and lost alot of the fun elements which there was in the past. There is still a good RP factor involved, but the rest has been ruined.I came back to play a game which I really enjoyed and was hoping to see improvements. Instead, I saw a game that was butchered and released a worse game than what I played in the original alpha. I would not reccommend this. The original alpha had hope and enjoyment factor, I guess that was back when the team actually cared about the game.			"

								I understand the concept of ""early access,"" but in it's current form, which I paid 20 bucks for, this game is not playable. A game in which you can spent several hours building structures and collecting resources could lock up and roll back the server at any moment, erasing any progress you may have made. In my 5 or so hours of play time, this happened 4 times. Combat is so laggy that hits to you or enemies can take 2 or 3 seconds to register, people can loot chests through walls, and there are already several hacks and exploits that are being implemented on several of the servers I've been on.  I wanted to like this game, I really do, the idea behind it is great. But in its current form this game is a freaking mess and more of an exercise in frustration than fun.			"

												There are two types of servers in this game: Community and Official. Official is as its name official server by the makers. But Official servers have several major disadvantages. 1: No rules so there is no mercy and nothing to restrain everything besides the crests which only provide a less than moderate protection. 2: They are almost always super crowded and every good base location is taken. With this many people with no restraints basicly everyone is a bandit and you will be killed A LOT unless you put hundreds of hours into this game.                   And then there are the Community servers which people who bought servers can make the rules and have admins to keep order. Seems like a good idea right? Well as a person who had lots of experince with these servers here is what i can say: 1. After a while on the no Kos servers with your epic base you realize: you have no enemies and this base is nothing. If you wanted to play a building and collecting simulator than play Minecraft. Yah because all of these games have are there raiding and fortress building to prevent raiders. 2: The admins are (ussualy) super strict and give no warnings to when they are going to ban, hell they ban if they dont like you.                 This game could be so much more and can be a good game if it were a game that could be atleast a bit inviting and one way they could do this is probably making offline raiding harder. The crest protection thing costs so much that it only benifits big guilds who have lots of things to protect themselves. So bassicly the people who play this game are those who make this game bad (and of course bad game design). I will probably play this game agian when these problems are fixed. But you cannot fix people so Screw you people			"

They lag all around you and kill you. you wont even be able to do any damage to the opponent. By the way nice update with the ping limit. it doesn't work at all. there are still on every server so many asian people with a ping from 500 to sometimes 40000 it'sridiculous.

Early Access Review
								Okey, so i've had fun. I've enjoyed the game, im a mediveal loving guy, i enjoy both Game of thrones and Tolkiens Fellowship of the ring worlds.So it isnt without surprise i loved this game for its massive immersive world, having tons of options to capture and punish or imprison another player.There are a big range of weapons with their own statistics, however the PvP lag is always looming in the back of your head. My favorite weapons would be Bow and arrow & Axe or mace.Building takes forever but its well made in my oppinion since it makes sense that one person shouldnt be able to build a massive castle within a day. so bring friends :)This game if you're planning to play on Public servers... are somewhat KOS. however joining community servers gives you a better experience since they usually have some kind of rules that are enforced by admins.. usually active ones but not always. so dont quote me on that.Now....This will summarize my first 2 hours in this game..I join into a server with my friends, it had a nice ping of around 44 so i thought hell yea!Well in, im confronted with nice pretty graphics and a stick to beat down trees with if i need to wich i do since its the only way to progress unless someone gives you stuff or there is a /kit function on the server.I happily cut down some trees and explore the Crownland map and i see a yellowish field infront of me.. i run to it and think this has to be some kind of desert or something. (actually Hay field).Im now around 150m away from said field and my computer freezes.. ALL STOP IN THE ENGINE ROOM! basicly.. Im like.. what the ♥♥♥♥ happend? did something happen? did another program all of the sudden soak up every bit of resource i can muster to do this?NO, IT WAS ♥♥♥♥ING RENDERING BUILDINGS! THE GAME HAD BEEN RUNNING FOR ABOUT 120-170 FPS (At around high settings) ALL ALONG UNTILL I GOT TO SOME BUILDINGS!THE rendering mechanism in this game is so bad that if you dont have a highend computer it will freeze you up.. usually my computer restarts itself since it cant recover. Do NOT buy this game, do NOT support this piece of crap development team.Unless they shape this♥♥♥♥♥♥up with the PVP lag, Render issues and other bugs i've heard stories about then dont even buy it, If u want it? then wait for the finished product. Thanks for reading.  "

								So, before I even go into any variation of explanation / input, it should be noted that this game has no angle of PvE. At all. If you intend to play this game alone, in a non-competitive manner or simply want to build castles in a medieval sandbox game, look elsewhere. This game and everything about it is, well, competition. If you cannot deal with loss, whether you had opportunity to deter it or not, don't bother. Fair warning given.---Combat: Simplified / not as polished, Chivalry-like combat with a limb and parts health limitation. That said, I'm not complaining. Blocking, countering and general combat is simple and easy to grasp. Gear makes a pretty decent difference but a skilled player can and will easily out do a person with superior gear.Map: It's actually perfect, for now. The resource nodes for important materials are in locations that actually demand eventual conflict. The map itself actually looks pretty damn good and the map's size isn't anything that I personally can complain about. Players should have no problems establishing castles or hovels around the map.General Gameplay: As I said with the paragraph above, it's all competitive play. People will screw you over and given the opportunity, you can, should and probably will do the same. Don't come into the game expecting to be untouchable and don't come into the game alone. These things considered, it's a really entertaining game to play with friends. A few bugs do exist here and there but, it's Alpha. The hell do you expect?- It should be noted that they've begun arming admin staff with methods of effectively removing players that are using hacked clients. If you are genuinely having issues with hackers and the sort, I suggest NOT playing on official servers. Instead, look into a community server with generally active and competent admin staff.			"

								With early access games, you either find a game you really like, or you find one you really don't like. For me, this was one I did not enjoy.The graphics are really nice and the concept is neat, but this is about the only positive things I have to say. Let's star first with the fact that you could work for hours building your fort, crafting weapons, and gathering resources. When you log back in, all of that could be gone by either other players, or the server shuts down. And the combat system is horrendous on top of the constant lag the game has from time to time. I was willing to think ""hey, this is an early access game. Maybe there will be improvements?"" I deleted the game from my computer, but it seems that they are still working on this game. I appreciate that the developers are still trying, but for now, I will not be building up a castle and praying that it won't be gone when I go back. I value my time too much. For $20, there are better games out there.			"

								After a few hours of digging around in the game, I've found that Reign of Kings has lived up to my expectations for these ""early access"" titles.  The game itself is far more frustrating than fun, but it certainly holds the potential to become something fun once it actually finds some stable ground to stand on.Pros:-Interesting combat mechanics (Thanks Chivalry)-Decent graphics-Interesting game mechanics (Minecraft, rust, and perma king of the hill)Cons:-Regular crashes (Graphic and Server)-Teleporting animals/players-Frames drop considerably when it matters (combat)-Glitchy buildings (easy to just glitch into a players ""home"" without having to break blocks)I want to like this game, it's full of some of my favorite gaming concepts.  The biggest sticking point for me has been the laggy combat and the fact that players managed to glitch into my compound while I was in the bathroom.  Once they fix that.. and the whole crashing mess.. I'll definitely try the game again.  For now, it's nothing more than a $20 headache. "

								Very good game and very high fun rate with friends or solo.But why am I giving it a negative review? Because of one, game breaking bug.Some times when you log off then log back in you will come back to where you logged off. But you character model will be the default one (Fat, Bald, Ugly, big) and all your gear is gone and you are stuck with it till another server wipe or play on another server, but then the bug can happen on that server as well rendering the game unejoyable. And you can not fix. (Yes I know about name thing but they fixed that in this build. It's still broken).The game over all is an amazing experience but this random bug, you don't know when you will get is very game breaking.Till this bug is fixed it will have a negative review, if the above bug does not bother you then you are in for one hell of a awesome game.

												Look, I tried to like this game. Midieval Era games are my favorite, however, this game has poor reputation for a reason. So many bugs exist, and exploiters are abundant. In the begginning the game was swell, but as the development continued, a rise of hackers also came in waves after every update, some brang joy and funny play, but others are really out there to ruin the game, and it deffinitely hurts the game still today. I might return to the game soon because I want to give it another try for its money, but I doubt many things have changed.

Super buggy, plays terrible on GTX 900 series cards. Hacker issues.  Going to wait for more patches and hope it turns out well. The crating system is pretty good though, lots of recipes/stuff to make. Everything from armour, weapons, traps, buildings. No need to learn recipes. Graphics looks pretty nice cranked up. Walking/fighting physics seem a bit ""off"". It is your typical survival game... Play with friends or get ambushed. Has great potential.			"

												If you want medieval PVP and base building you might not want to get ROK. Aside from the community of the game has devolved greatly, and it can take some time to find a server with a decent player base. The game runs for♥♥♥♥♥♥so you can end up lagging around and this sucks when you end up in combat. Speaking of combat, if you play Chivalry Medieval Warfare, it's the same system as it was copied, works and feels the same. Getting gear is rather easy as long as you know where to look and remember the map well enough, some servers just have commands for gear like leather and iron swords. Now on to the throne, this is basically a way of saying ""Here I am, I'm the King, kill me"". People with either petition for lower taxes, I prefered lowering by just .01 percent(5%-4.99%), or just try and kill you because they wish to be King. One of the pluses to the game is it really encourages RP play and if you find a good enough server it can be fun. If you want to play you will want to have 2-3 friends at least so when you're out and about you won't get dominated by larger groups.			"

												I've had this game since at least Beta, played many many hours, but always had the same bug, I haven't come across anyone else with it so this review is based entirely on my own experience.The game has a great concept, capturing and imprisoning others in an open world farm/build/survive style.Grouping up with others is definently the best way to go to survive, create a clan and rule the land! You can even become the King and raise taxes and claim some tribute.My problem is that the game times me out of every server after about 5-10 minutes of gameplay, hard to explain but it's like I lose the x,y,z coordinates of every other object in the game, other players can still see me but I cannot see anyone else. I then have to quit the game wherever I am, and relog in, (usually this results in death). This ruins the game.  I was hoping that since the game is actually released this would of been patched.  Alas same issue.So overall score 1/10			"

												First i'd like to say I really want to like this game, it used to be my favorite game, its the reason I keep trying to get back into it. Unfortunately, i can't because this is a shell of what this game was and used to be, all that potential and the possibility of pouring hours of my life into it are completely gone. The magic that this game was has faded away with one patch after the next and I can no longer enjoy or even stand it. I remember back in mid-alpha when me and my group of friends got this game and wasted days of our life playing, and playing. We had finally found a game that we could sink hours into and still have fun, and look forward to playing everyday. But everytime a new patch came, we found ourselves less engaged, with the slew of hackers and glitches that started to plague the game as time went on. Soon came beta and things got even worse... They started ""rebalancing"" items. I say it like that because their rebalancing was and is a complete joke. If they felt a weapon was too OP, they would ridiculously nerf it or shrink it to a quarter of the size it was, AND on top of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, there were still complete oversights on certain weapons way after the game was out of beta. For example, armor pretty much no longer matters, because if you have maxed gear (steel) armor and weapons and you happen to be alone, two or three guys can bring some wooden spears (which are also OP in my opinion) which take about one tree each to make (they dont take long to get) to reck your♥♥♥♥♥and take all of your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sorry about the long review, but i felt i needed to write this to try to convince anyone looking to buy this... PLEASE spend your money on something else, almost any other game, and you'll probably get atleast triple the enjoyment you could even possibly squeeze out of this joke of a game that i used to love, and it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks to say that, but its true. There are so many other issues like optimization that will destroy the experience, but i'll leave it at that.			"

But if you have an imagination above the average dead sloth, you can have a lot of fun.-FPS is terrible on lower end machines (Constantly improving optimization)-Sometimes random things will glitch out, its so random im not gonna name themNow here for a little story about how talking♥♥♥♥♥♥gets you rektMe and my boys are trolling down the road, gathering stone and doing cocaine. An insane man runs up to us and starts beating himself to death with a sharp rock. So we commented on his massive glutes and he felt better. even danced for us.

We proceed to take his goods, and we give him back everything except the holy grail (a steel greataxe). He chases us asking for it and we pull out our pokers to scare him off. Friend proceeds to tell him some very offensive things, and I add a bit about offing himself again. He says ""Have fun with your house being gone tomorrow"". House actually is gone the next day. 11/10 would talk♥♥♥♥♥♥again.			"

								A game centered around destroying others and being in charge. Making guilds with people you don't personally know is dangerous. You can either give them no rights in which they are useless, or full rights, with nothing stoping them from stripping down your house and resources and leaving in the dead of night. The combat barely works, many situations with me hitting allies that are behind me. Easy anti-cheat disallows things such as the razor game booster from launching, but since launch I have not seen the end of hackers. And if you don't watch a specific person doing the hack, the report system is all but useless. And now with the game planning to be realeased from Alpha to completion in 2015, it seems this is another project code Hatch is ""finished"" (Given up on.) If you want to know how to play this game, collect no resources, that's for scrubs. Just go find someone, break into their home because no matter how they build it, you can, and kill them and take their stuff. Or hack. Because that still works. Even though the game launches with an anti-hacking client. 4/10 would not buy again.			"

Early Access Review
								Overall it´s a very good game and you can actually have lots of fun, mostly when playing online with friends. The biggest problem is not related to the game´s design or programming, but the RIDICULOUS amount of hacks that players are using without any restriction. That really makes the entire experience become annoying and unpleasant. The game designers should also look forward to make buildings a little bit harder to invade because all it takes is a easy to do catapult. Besides all that, I really liked the game and I hope the fix this cheating problem soon and minor bugs.			"

												Lots of potential, very little execution.The most problematic part of this game is the 300+ ping players on public servers (many Chinese folk playing NA #2), the frame lag, and the hit detection of the combat is absolutely atrocious. If executed well it would play out much like Chivalry:MW in the combat but because of all of the above it turns in to spam your LMB and pray that what you're seeing on your screen is real and not the afterimage of a person who is soon going to teleport 15ft and then hit you for full damage completetly out of range.For $5...meh.For $20...oh hell no.

												Once upon a time in a small kingdom, there were players who would work together to survive. Their survival became the top thing and because of this there was peace. Then everything changed when the game was on sale. New users bought tickets for the boats that take you do this island even though they didn't know what it was like. These new survivors had banded together and started waging war on the old survivors. The original survivors won the war and scatter the new ones. Their defeat caused the new survivors to start mining a strange mineral called Sodium Chloride(salt). With the addition of this new mineral they prayed to the darkest gods and were granted evil powers of destruction. They used these powers they called ""MLG HAKS BRO"" and took over the realm. all the original men of the island were destroyed by this disease of cancerous people.(long story short, the game used to be fun but the devs stopped updating so hackers became unstopable)			"

												Fun game, great concept but not completed due to the cancer that early access is. Early access needs to stop existing. Stop allowing devs to get all the money and quit on games before they even can be called beta. This game is alpha, filled with bugs. Some of the worst game physics I've seen, so many obvious features not in the game such as horse, battering rams, siege towers, ships, maybe a proper auction house style trading system and much more. Being a king in this game is really pointless. You log off or aren't near the throne and someone goes to sit on it. The king has no real meaning other then raising taxes to collect taxes from the tax tree and if you raise taxes you just end up getting killed for it anyways. The devs are a joke and sickening money grabbers. This game could of at least sold a million copies with proper development and still have a player base currently. These devs are bad for the industry as well as the valve is bad for the industry with the creation of early access feture. It shows no care for the consumer and I can't wait for the day when these companies bankrupt due to being so not trusted that nothing they develop gets bought. Save yourself the money and don't buy this dissappointment of a game and stop feeding devs that don't deserve anything other then unemployment.			"

								The game is a very fun game to play. One of the only problems that I have with game is that the game is very unstable with lag issues. Another problem that I see is the fighting mechanics. About the lag, if you even have a gaming pc/laptop, the game still lags and has flaws. I think that you could fix this by finding a way to make the game a little smoother with your framerate.I don't reccomend this game to newcomers while the game is in it's Beta Phase. Hopefully you can find a way to fix this.			"

								Alright this is the story of my multiple lives..I spawned in and got killed by a group of naked green midgets with big swords so when i respawned i moved a bit inland and found the kings castle.alot of people were rioting about how he is taxing us %20 so i decided to join in.The king destroyed us all...however the king decided to befriend me so i set up base a little way away from his castle..I visited him one day to find he had alot of prisons and things like that....He asked me if i would go with his men to collect some slaves so i went with him...we befriended a guy called Shrek and he helped us get slaves.When we got back to the castle however he dragged me of and hanged me..after i respawned i went to my base got a bit of gear and went to the kings place...He invited me in and i was put as jester...he gave me a flute and told me to make jokes so i decided to..After that Shrek and his buddies came to our castle and started atacking it...i was quickly armoured and geared and told to fight with him..when we got out it was chaos..Until one stroke...The king was dead...one of the guards quickly pulled me away from the fight and sealed me in a room saying that is hould stay here...it was about 10 mins when he got me out again and i saw outside...there were loads of bodies some the people that were friends i realized that it was just the guy who hid me that survived...He then became king and made me second in command and to this day we rule together.that was my story no lies at all..overall the game is really fun to play but can be buggy sometimes itt has loads in it and it is a combination of chivalry:MW and rust so a good game...i only ever met one hacker and the crafting is good..so i think anyone who likes this sort of stuff should deffinatley buy it			"

												--------------DO NOT BUY--------------Reign of Kings is a game where you are washed up on an island, unable to remember of how you got there and why, but you will quickly establish and create a home as you harvest the land, living up in a medieval world of Battle, Clans, and Guilds as you build up a mighty force to sieze the throne and take mantle as king! Or will you?Even in your factions beware of treachery, for even your trusted guild members can TURN against you, deciet and treachery is a common cause in the Fight of the Clans, just because you and a comrade faught together doesn't earn their trust to turn you back to another Clan's capture.Taking the title of King (Including the risk of getting overthrown, which, probably not intended, happens ALL THE TIME.) Means you can use certain bonuses like Taxing, but be advised, the Community is more ""Overly Tactically Stupid"" Resulting even in the LOWEST tax causes everyone to wanting to OVERTHROW THE KING. So the Devs must have thought differently to this feature.Combat is not very good, it's all the matter of ""Who hits first"" And dies instantly, it's a poorly made system but the Developers tried. There is also a CONSTRUCTION system that allows the building of BLOCKS (Minecraft Copycat much?) Either made of wood, cobblestone, etc.There is also a Ghost Town, haunted and cursed by the Old Gods that you should beware, but it's contents may be worth it, taking the crown is also a matter of... some tricky business.The King's castle, more, a GIANT STATUE and the knight's bucket helm BEING the KING'S TOWER, has a pit which can be used to trap people inside, a perfect tactic to keep people inprisoned, so do beware that trying to overthrow the King is tricky.Since this castle is only reachable by a small bridge, to do so requires STRICT tactics. Overall, the game was SPOILT ROTTEN by the community itself.-They Instantly said to overthrow the King even if he didn't set ANY tax, unintended by Developers.-Players are always jerks and always have alliance switches in clans, overall, stupid.-The community is WIDELY toxic and will spring out at you if you give any NEGATIVITY to the game.-Hacking is COMMON, yeah, COMMON, and it's almost FLAWLESS as everyone GETS AWAY WITH IT.This game, mind you, is made by a young, one-trick group, so be note that To buy so is your own risk, i warned you. Many did.			"

												I really do enjoy this game. The concept is great and would make a perfect survival game, thats if it was executed properly. I love building things, I love raiding, I love fighting in PvP. But, there is severe problems with the game. This game is plagued by chinese with over 300 ping which makes the PvP in the game a joke. Half time I am fighting someone with a high latency and they can hit me when I cannot even see them. This makes people with full steel gear lose to a naked. Not fun...Another huge issue is the fps. Even with an extreme gaming rig I seem to drop to 10 fps on the lowest settings, making fighting almost impossible. I have no idea why this is happening, but most likely to do with the renderer and the awful engine.If the developers actually listened, maked regular updates to the game, fixed the horrible servers and brang in ping detection to get rid of all the chinese, the game would be great. Hopefully one day we will recieve the true RoK.			"

								I haven't run into hackers yet, but I cannot recommend the game at this point.Pros:Good game for ♥♥♥♥ing around.Building is fun.The King system, and taxing is a cool idea, and is executed well enough.Cons:The combat system is interesting, but server lag makes it extremely difficult to time things properly.Hackers. (Even though I, myself have not run into them.  Try to play on less popular servers if you do end up getting this)Still very buggy atm.Not much to do other than, collect resources, build, raid, get raided, etc. Not worth playing on your own.Ultimately, Roleplaying servers can be fun, but I would recommend Rust to anyone who wants to buy this.  Rust essentially plays the same as this but is much more polished.  Perhaps with a few updates this game could be good but as is, I cannot recommend it. "

								Even as an Alpha this game is riddled with bugs to the point where you would be lucky to even connect to a server. Then, when you get finally get on a server and work to make a guild base/home there is no guaranteeing you will have it next time you log on. Nearly everytime I have logged off and back on the next day raiders or griefers end up destroying everything. There really is no fun in having to rebuild and restart your base from scratch every single time. I'm sure that someday they will make everything more secure and optimize the game but until they do its no worth buying this game.			"

												This game has a great concept, in theory.  I can't say that I havent enjoyed playing it.  The environmental graphics are superb. The background music is very nice as well.  That being said.. lets focus on the bad for what its worth.Firstly, since the beginning the hackers have destroyed any semblance of fair play in the game.  It really is sickening to create an impenetrable abode, and find it in ruin the next day.Hackers arent really the fault of the developers and they have made strides to counter the pieces of @$#% that choose to exploit. But its an uphill battle with no real end in sight.Secondly the pvp in this game is attrocious. Essentially, its frantic button mashing and jumping around like an idiot.. and in the end its rarely about skill, as much as it's about your equipment, and dumb luck.Thirdly even if hackers aren't involved there always seems to be douch bags on every server that are able and willing to raid your base at night and take or destroy the hours and hours of work, you put into your creation. As this really is part of the game, it just seems a glaring design flaw to expect players to keep coming back to try again and again everyday. And you do come back, with better plans everytime.. but after time the frustration becomes too much.And lastly, and this might just be me, but.. The developers have just announced that they are going to try and do a monthly wipe on the first of every Tuesday. So if you are finally able to get any semblance of a base and supplies stockpiled, you definatley wont have it for too long. Because after the wipe.. you start all over ... from scratch... nada.. zippo.. ziltch. . not even a toon to call your own.This last point is the most frustrating of all to me. All the other challenges I take in stride. Trying to overcome them is almost a game in and of themselves. But now It's all pointless to me, because I know any struggles I overcome will all mean nothing once they wipe. Whats the point..			"

This game is not finished, while not a terrible loss (I only paid $12 for it on sale) I just wish these devs would realise they're killing there image. (Go google some of Codehatch's other ""games""). The engine runs into serious trouble when on populated servers and next to big structures even on beefy PC builds. Speaking of populated servers, there's not really any left. Which as a multiplayer game is a death sentence. Plus the fighting and overall polish of the game leaves alot to be desired, and will never be fixed since they jumped from alpha to release.			"

												i'll give the game back if I get my money back. I don't think I need to elaborate further on the reviews already given. I had to start my own server to play with friends because hacking was too much of a problem, and the PvP isn't at all balanced. Steel armour only protects against 1 extra point of damage than iron which are two of the three worthwhile armours in the game. With three people it's boring as all hell but that isnt the dev's fault. There is literally nothing to do but gather resources for 40 hours build for 40 hours (resulting in a house about the size of a small cabin), and then after your 80 hour time investment if you log off for more than 15 minutes then all your hard work is a pile on the ground.It's unfortunate, this game had such potential but the developers just got discouraged by the fact that they actually had to do more work to polish it up a bit, and I suppose they figured ""I have the money now, heres the game - we don't want to spend more because we like profit."" I guarentee that the next game we see from these devs will be funded by the revenue from this game, and when that pool runs dry they will abandon it too and move on to the next one.			"

Early Access Review
								I was king for a few hours. Made a really good friend, went exploring, collected supplies and then got attacked by a midget yelling your taxes are too high!!! (They were at 2%). Killed him, ran back to my castle with my new friend while being chased by about 15 guys. Took all of our supplies, tossed them over the cliff and then jumped off together.All in all this game is loads of fun... sometimes. Its very laggy, even on official servers. The combat is extremely good at times but when it lags it makes it almost imposible to hit or even see where somebody is. In my story above whilst i was fighting the midget, he would be hitting me even though he was way off in the distances to the point where i could barely even see him.There are many glitches aswell... although that is to be expected out of a early access title. But some, if i may mention them here, are when you press c to toggle between 1st and 3rd person you will sometimes teleport to a new spawned person somewhere on the beach. When chopping down trees, some of them will fly up into the air and then disapear, animals like dear or moose will do the same thing aswell. Also, one major thing that i found was one time i was building my base near the stone nodes and then  randomly teleported onto the thorne. Lets just say the king was a bit suprised... LolBut you get my point that this game is not perfect. There are many other glitches to be found like people flying, falling through the map, to randomly dying and loosing all your stuff, getting stuck in one spot and not being able to moove and the list goes on.But all in all it has the potential to be a really great game and with some fixes this could be amazing!!Also one thing i think should be added is horses that you can tame and ride around on. As well as be able to make armor for them and so on, you get my point. Would make getting around a lot easier :)			"

Hours of work destroyed in seconds by thugs repeatedly does not make for a fun game. Even in small groups you'll be destroyed. Yup, I suppose that actually IS Medieval life.

 As I have been predicting on the Forums, and on my previous review of this game in Early Access, the Devs seem to have given up further development into this game  Like their previous title. Poor Optimization, laggy combat, ruined sieging system, hackers still galore, and much, much more still seems unfinished. My quick Summary Please, just please. Don't buy this game, or any further games released by this Developer, they are NOT to be trusted to finish optimizing, and fixing the issues with their games! I sincerely regret buying this game when it was Rated ""Very Positive"" and it was all the talk on YouTube.The game is horribly optimized, you will need a strong computer to run anything above Low grapichs for a solid FPS. Combat is still just as laggy as it was during EA. The Siege system is utterly ruined, especially with those Totems... And Hackers, the Hackers are still at large. There are a TON more issues with this game.Apparently, a 900$ Computer can't run this game for Sh*t. To prove how unoptimized this game is, I can run games like PLANETSIDE 2, ROME Total War II, War Thunder, CSGO, Minecraft, Garrys Mod, STALKER, Skyrim, X-Rebirth, on atleast MEDIUM graphics, and get around 40 FPS. I mean...  WHAT!?  How poorly Optimized is this!? I can't even run this game on it's lowest Graphics!? The Graphics look like PS1 on the lowest setting! So please tell why the ♥♥♥♥ can't I run this on the lowest Graphics without my Framerate DYING!? Similar games you should definently check out, they sure are alot better then this unifinished mess. I suggest checking out Ark: Survival Evolved. If you don't have a good computer, it will soon be coming out on the PS4, and Xbone. Unsimilar games South Park: The Stick of Truth			"

												This is a yes and no game. This game is really fun, where you get to first customize your own character and clan banner. You are then instantly spawned on a island to survive as long as you can with the other players and ai's about. It was really fun making a house but would take forever to build. But when you get raided everything goes down hill then. Once you are raided you will have to restart from scratch which is so annoying. But then you will get raided once again. This game begins to get slowly repetitive and then eventually it just becomes repetitive. You will be doing the same things all the time.The other issue with this game is that when i chase a animal for food the animal eventually just vanishs off the island, all of those spears i made all for what, nothing.Its hard to recommend this game at the moment but i am hoping they will make more better things for this game soon so it wont be so repetitive, and fix the bugs. 4/10			"

												You probably saw a youtuber play this and thought it looked fun, that you might buy it.Don't.This game is pure and simple youtuber bait. It has a lot of funny moments when you're surrounded by people who are fans of you, with options like the gallows, cages, lockpicks, etc. But what it has in funny moments value, it lacks in basically every other field. Gameplay is boring, whether it be fighting or farming. Social interactions boil down to Kill you, run from you, or get tied up and killed later.In summary, it lacks in every aspect that an online survival game should excel at.

I still tried to play it after that, but now every server lags like mad. You can have 20 ping and still rubberband across the world. It amazes me that a server can still have 30 people playing at once. Why would you try when someone can be talking to you, end up lagging, and you'll be dead within 10 seconds, with no player interaction? You don't see a single swing from your enemy, only he or she looting you. This game is the first to actually disappoint me on steam. It was great, simple, fast.

												I retruned to check out the game's progress, and I'm disgusted.The anti-hacker programs haven't done a damn thing! If anything, the problem has increased dramatically. If you're not being one-shotted, constant report spamming will ban you for life.Seems, Codehatch, has given up on fixing the bugs people report. They just take the offending program code out, and that's it.The whole PvP core of the game, seems non-exsitent. Other than players killing each other (including one-shot hackers), the whole castle-raiding thing just isn't there. No castles collapsing into a pile of rubble. You just create holes big enough to get inside, steal what you can, then run back to your castle before your opponent is done repairing theirs. There hasn't been anything from the developers for months. No update or bug repair reports, answering the concerns of the players, just nothing.Please don't buy this game, even if you plan on renting a private server. Youtubers and other live streamers dropped this game a long time ago, and I believe there's a few 100 players still loyal.I've reported this game, and Starforge, to Steam. Hopefully, they'll understand my concerns and remove both games. Codehatch ran, abandoning both games and their respect players, only to profit from the cash people are still sinking into them. "

Early Access Review
								I loved this game. It had incredible potential, had great mechanics, a skill+gear dependent fighting systems. But the developers bailed on it. Its an Early access game, its missing the fundamental systems to make the game complete. A faction system where you could ally different guilds, an integrated shop system so you players could actually set up a marketplace that was backed by mechanics, a war system to motivate combat, etc. This game had great potential, and its not a bad game. But it's not a finished one either, and unless someone creates mods to fix the the gaps and even create new content, I don't think this game will survive the long hall :/			"

												I have never been so actively repulsed, frustrated, and ultimately angry at a online game.For starters, there are constant issues for the optimization of streaming data in this game. Expect your connection to buckle under this game, for playing this game while on teamspeak proved an impossible feat. It was impossible to connect to any server - official or community, local or overseas - while running any other program that used any considerable amount of bandwidth. Most every other game I have ever played can handle teamspeak 3 in the background in addition to music streaming and other things, but this game is not up to that task.Onto what little gameplay I experienced, it is lackluster. Gathering resources is an abhorrent, boring task. At the rate of collection and simply finding resources to collect, this game is worse than most other survival games in many regards - even those noted for their occasional sparsity of resources. The gameplay itself, in what little was experienced, was terrible on all fronts - especially the receiving end of 'combat', which is a complete disaster. The combat combined with the latency and bandwidth issues made it possible for me to be attacked with a six inch dagger from over twenty feet away, ruining any chance of response and making fights entirely one sided.But the community -- oh, dear lord, the community. If you for some reason purchase this trainwreck of a game, stay away from official servers. They are plagued with people who are playing on the wrong servers and have horrible ping, scream in voice chat and fill up with text chat with intelligible conversations. In addition, this game is worse than DayZ with regards to the KOS mentality, with the combat system contributing to the problem due to its non-parity and numerous engine problems.The only possible positive this game can muster to draw from its♥♥♥♥♥♥crusted pile of dung is the graphics, which are good for the intensity they place upon the user's system and the tradeoff of apperance. But it numerous drawbacks with a sort of pseudo-motion blur being pervasive, even after disabling motion blur itself, with pixel dragging and visual distortion on numerous levels of graphic settings. Save yourself the money, and just go buy Rust.			"

												from someone who used to play this game.to go from E/A alpha to full realse with no beta phase and no attempt to bug fix is a very bad idea.with your rep from your previous title you would have thought to have been extra carefull to not be seen to be making a huge balls up again.this being said, you have made no attempt to optermise the game, nor have you added features to add stability and you certainlly havent delt with the huge amount of exploters/hackers to make the game balanced or enjoyable at all.add to this the very nature of grinding for basic matirals to craft it gets very anoying that someone can spwan high end gear and butcher you stood naked. in reflection this game was a good idea but failed majorly to deliver.

												There are so many reasons to hate this game,-first of all: the players, every server has at least 1 hacker on it who just ruins the experience. and to top that only a few players actually communicate instead of trying to kill you and steal your stuff, the couple that communicate will end up betraying you anyway. its even hard  to play on a server with 10 people on it cause it will still happen frequently.-second of all: the developers, the game has so many bugs that dont get fixed and every single month all the servers get whiped, the things you worked so hard for are basicly gone.-Third is kind of the same as the first, but youre never safe because of the players, each time you log off you just got to hope you dont get killed and raided in your sleep. there is basicly no fun in this game anymore, every time you get around to making something beautifull, someone will take it away.

Early Access Review
								So this game is a lot like legacy Rust, which is why I bought the game in the first place. The graphics, build system, perma-death, and sleepers are all very similar to Rust. The combat, just like the trailer mentions, is much closer to chivalry. Other features from promising failed EA titles like The Stomping Land, where you can trap and cage other players. One thing that immediately stood out (please don't ask why) is a certain slot you are able to use. Most FPS games have quickload slots to quickly equip a weapon by pressing 1 2 3 4 5. This game has a slot 0, labeled ""orifice"", in which you can put sharp objects into in case you get yourself into a sticky situation (captured by another player for example), you can then remove your sharp stone from your orifice and cut yourself free.After playing for a couple hours, I then went to tell my girlfriend about the orifice slot, she seemd really into it. 10/10 "

Please, don't give these ""Developers"" money for unfinished, trash games. DON'T GIVE INTO THE HYPE, OR THE POPULARITY BIG-TIME YOUTUBER/STREAMERS GIVE IT.

Announcement: StarForge Post Release Patch #4 - V.1.0.4 
StarForge, Nov 26, 2014

			We've released another patch for the game today. In this patch we focused on bug fixing and design changes. Please keep in mind, due to our changes to our saving system, we had to wipe servers.		


^ The game hasn't been updated in a year...""What a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ No updates in a year like JustSluipere said. Terrible terrible terrible.""""STILL INCOMPLETE AND UN-FINISHED PEOPLE LIKE YOU WILL DIE IN ACID :)""""the forge input box disapeared this update""""i hope you enjoy my money, sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s""""i would have thrown less my money to fund neo-Nazi parties""""i still think this game is not finished and i got ripped of by your company. wont ever buy a game again from you.""""You guys lost track of what you were fighting for. What happened to the first playable prototype release? That's the game we wanted. Not this.""""I purchased this during early access and this game alone is why I barely ever buy early access games anymore.""""Guys, you say this game is ""complete"" then go ahead and make game changing ""design changes"" that wipe servers?!?""""RIP Endless mode, RIP reason to play""The developers are ruining steam, and ruining other developers in turn, due to their previous actions. People are buying less and less early access games, causing games to simply stop being produced, and usually, ones of lower quality. Their actions, are ruining steam. Please, just pirate this game and get it over with. Don't help the problem, control it. Buy something else like Rust, or Nuclear Throne. Those games are more entertaining.AND ONTO THE REVIEW!This game's gameplay is repetitive, and boring. One day, you have a base. The next hour, it gets raided due to the small size of the map, and how easy it is to get siege tools. The game is utterly unbalanced, and people simply block the bridge so others can't get the crown. Making everyone get %90 tax. The customization is also broken, if your character is the smallest midget ever, you can dodge EVERY attack. This is WORSE THAN TEMPER TANTRUM. It's broken, and it's buggy. It's also optimized horribly, I had to fix the damn game MYSELF because it won't run that well on an $800 computer. The graphics are poor, and has the gameplay of a walking simulator.1/10.			"

												Just like most of these survival type games, Reign of Kings (RoK) is... alright.  There's nothing innately wrong with the gameplay or the style, and the character creation is downright hilarious, which is a plus.   But there is something to be said about the fact that this is just another survive and build game, very similar to rust, but with the twist of a ""King"" that resides in a castle (on the original map) and is able to tax the people of the server.  This is interesting, and gives some forced role play which can be somewhat interesting even if you aren't usually into RPing.  The main problem with this game is it's optimization, which can and hopefully will be fixed, I have a reasonably strong computer that's able to deal with many games that are much nicer than this, but just like DayZ and to a certain extent rust, this game has some optimization issues.  Survival Building games like this truly cannot be played well without a team of friends to play with.  If you are alone you'll probably survive one to three nights before getting raided and essentially losing all reason to play.  Survival Building games like this also call for some insane amount of time to be spent playing them, so if you are interested.  Strap in as it will take a long time to get just about anything done.I'll break it down easy peasy below so you don't have to read all that if you don't want to.Pros:  Hilarious Character CreationEasy Learning CurveSimple MechanicsFun if you like to build and survive (in video games)Interesting Forced Role PlayCons:It's just another builder survival gameOptimization is horribleRust is probably better overall...You basically need a group of at least three people to strive.I wouldn't recommend it to be honest, but it's really not horrible if you think you'd like to pick it up and have some friends to play with.

												I would not recommend Reign of Kings to anyone unless the developers change, this game was great in the start and I actually enjoyed it, overlooking the previous reputation of one of their games it seemed like they were progressing towards creating something fun and unique, many hours passed and many friends made later the developers ditch working on the project.They have done the exact same thing they done with starforge although this time around they actually started making progression until they decided that they had enough and announced that they will be abandoning development on the game.Buy at your own risk of supporting these type of EA Developers, I would recommend looking up their previous game Starforge and reading the reviews about Code}{atch, I can assure you these are parasites to gaming industry that are feeding off Early Access games and giving developers who really do try through EA a bad name...

								This game has a bit of potential but they executed it in a terrible way. The game starts off very buggy with your character animations. (If you jumped in the water you would know exactly what I'm talking about.) After I got passed that laughable presentation I got a glimpse of my first out of many invisible hackers who would walk up to me and either kill me instantly with a 1 DMG item such as the whip or take me hostage over and over again until I decided doing anything but this would be a better use of my time. I 'MIGHT' try this game again if they ever get control over the hackers, but then again, I probably won't. Yet another game released in Alpha that ruins the experience for the player. GJ sellouts.

								Gets bored quick, for several reasons:  Hackers, Kings (due to the fact they make it near to impossible to make progress by camping resource sites, making tons of walls between you and the castle), the terrible PVP that makes it near to impossible to team PVP without dealing damage to your friends, like honestly this team PVP is honestly so terrible that some people can 4v1 because the more people, the more friendly fire.If your going to get this game no matter what, please keep in mind it gets boring quick, due to these reasons, and please get it at a stable version, this way your not supporting the game in the condition it is now, forcing the developers to clean up their act and get their shi--- stuff togethor.

								Me and my clan of iron-clad friends had just built a small base. We had full iron weapons and gear, there were about 4 of us. All was great until one terrible evening. We had just heard a horn sound in the distance, we thought it was some war between 2 random guilds... we were so, so wrong. Before we knew it, our camp was overrun by a tribe of naked black Santa Claus'. They had come in a storm of wooden spears, raining from the sky. There were seven of them and four of us. As they attacked, they shouted in some primitive language. We held our own, killed about two of them, but it wasn't good enough. They. Just. Kept. Throwing. Spears. Soon enough only two of us were left. I was quickly dying, and by the time the last wisp of life left my body, I could see my friend being dragged away to their camp by rope. All I could hope for was that he had a butt rock. 17.5/10 Would shove sharp objects up my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ again.			"

								Irent a rust server because I like the game but it is far from being solid.For one do not even bother to play on Code Hatch servers ... they are not admined nor will they do anything aboutthe hackers or exploiters on the server. It's sad to say but with 88 plus hours in game it has alot of potential but balce and exploit issues are common. When reporting the hacks and exploits found on a Code Hatch server nothing was done - FAIL - . So that given there was really no point in trying to stay on that server. Basically we have a group of Asians that come on the server early in the morning and wipe out everything utilizing exploits and or hacks. Since the development team does nothing to fix the issue ""the game play"" on the official server is basically dead.Few updates the devlopment team is moving too slow on the project - Huge ♥♥♥♥ing FAIL - the player base is dropping like flys.Dev promised exploit fixes back in March but nothing has been done and yet again this week of July they promised this again. The devs say report hacking but what is the point they have not followed through - FAIL -Maps are too small and tax servers heavily the game needs optimization.Resource nodes too few and poorly placed making building a tough job.No balance to trebuchet build or function, basically it destroys everything in seconds flat so days of work are gone in one shot. - FAIL -Crests ( your territory marker ) cannot be encased properly and light glows and sound goes  through walls allowing you enemy to know exactly where everything is at - FAIL - By holding a building block you can find anyone's base on the map - FAIL -PvP Hit mechanics are spotty at bestPlayers can create super small avatars to avoid being hit.******* Conclusion Buy Rust *********			"

												Everyone I encountered seemed to be out for blood. I tried to make so many friends and they all cut me down without a word.So I adapted.Every living thing had became a threat. Until I met him.He was on top of a dirt mound on the beach, pounding at it. I cautiously approached him, ready to strike, but then he turned around and said hello.I wasn't used to such kindness.So I did the most logical thing I could think of.I ran. Once I knew I was hidden, I watched and followed him.He was a small man, just trying to build himself a house with a garden. I stayed on him for what felt like days, until I decided he had to die. So I waited for night.He was tending his cabbage garden when I approached him from behind. Something inside me told me he needed to live.So I stood there, club in hand, frozen.He turned around and just starred for a second, and then said hello again in a friendly voice.Something changed inside me. I knew I had found a friend.So I followed him. I helped him gather resources, I protected him as he built our house. I was his silent brute. I kept him safe. Until one day he asked me to go tend the apples. It was dusk. I walked the path to our apple trees.Until I saw him.I tried to duck into the brush, but I wasn't quick enough, he approached me and said hello.I thought he was friendly. I asked him to follow me.But then his sadistic partner jumped out of the brush, striking me with his axe.I tried to fight back but they were too strong for this mere man. I ran for my only ally.He didn't understand. As I ran down the hill to our half built house I lit my torch and jumped wildly. He did the same. But then he saw my pursuers. He pulled out his club but we were no match for these men.I was struck down first. He knocked me to the ground and smashed my legs and continued to beat me.As I laid in my own blood and♥♥♥♥♥♥ I watched my best friend become nothing but a lifeless corpse.And I knew I'd never see him again.RIP: PoshyA Master, A FriendActual review: I really enjoy this game, it runs really well on my pc and overall is pretty fun. I haven't seen any hackers yet that everyone has mentioned (Don't get me wrong, I'm sure they exist)7/10			"

								Reign of Kings, while in early alpha, shows a lot of promise to being a game that I could regularly play and want to play with friends. That being said, there are a ton of mechanics that should be implemented to make the game what it could fully be instead of the base outline it feels like right now, as well as a ton of things that need to be changed in order to make the game more playable and fair.First of all, what I liked. The learning curve is not too bad. It gets harder as you progress, but there's a friendly community and a wiki page to help with later game crafting and building. Not only that, but the building in this game is so satisfying. The hours I've sunk in have resulted in some of the most badass looking fortresses and castles I could ever have imagined. And the feeling you get after hours of mining when you put on a suit of steel armor like the knights of old is one of the coolest moments in the game. Now, on to what i hated. This game is frustrating. Like, Dark Souls level frustrating. The amount of materials you need to acquire to get basic building blocks is a bit ridiculous and really stalls out the building process. And the blocks that you can build quickly are so weak it takes any new character 10 minutes to break in and steal all your stuff. The character creator has little to no variability, with deformed, creepy looking characters being the majority of what you see and taking away from the gameplay experience. Combine that with the glitches that characters can do based on their height and weight, it makes the game unfair and forces you to have setbacks that shouldn't really be there. I've lost tons of bases due to midgets hopping on each others' backs and boosting over walls or going under rocks that normal sized people get stuck on.The combat is sticky and buggy at best. I don't have a high end rig, but every battle I get into ends up with me lagging out and ending up dead within seconds despite having better gear and armor. The ranged mechanics are average at best, but with little to no hit detection on other players, you can't really use a bow on someone. Oh, and armor is useless in this game. All it does is slow you down. People with starter clubs can beat down people in steel suits of armor like its made of aluminum foil. You're better off avoiding anyone at all than risking a fight.Lastly, the resources are so stupidly placed. You have to run around to find a dirt ""node"" to harvest dirt when you have been running on nothing but dirt for hours. Iron and Stone are always surrounded by either a lot of players or hostile wildlife, neither of which will let you get away with hard earned resources. I've ranted for a bit, but like I said, the game shows promise. If the developers added in RPG elements, it could be a fantastic game that rewards the time you put into it. As of right now, however, its simply not a fun experience for invested Roleplay players or passive players. If/when these issues are addressed, I will be happy to play the game to my fullest extent. Until then, avoid it.			"

Early Access Review
								Hello, Features: Free building, sandbox, crafting, open world pvp, fps, full loot, medieval, ""King of the hill"".Well my analysis:The game is early, as always be careful, bugs are real.Map and slots: is small (but not too). I think that the players limit will be  80 people no more. Currently 0/60 servers. Logically no mounts (yet). This very good for now.Sandbox: trees, water, shrubs, minerals, animals in general. (Destructible objects). Free building: You can build freely everywhere. It is simple and fast. As a note, there are domain objects (3x levels) that allow dominate an area and can not be built near by other players, more than 1 domain object by player. This closes pretty spiral sandbox. 6 levels of building blocks, the last one damaged by catapults. Can not modify field. Crafting: About 3 lvl per station, not too big but not too small, it's ok for now.Open world pvp: pvp exists wherever you go, no safe zones. Pvp (combat): Ok, people this is FPS and three factors are determined: Ping + FPS + Hitbox. As pvp player, for me it's pretty ok but need fix better. Spears, bows, crossbows, stones, swords, axes, hammers, knives, 2h sword, 2h polearm 2h, 2h ax .... differents damage, attack speed and animatios (Please include shield when you can !!!). ""Skills buttons (for example)"": 6x differents attacks, parry 1x, 1x run / walk, jump 1x, 1x food, water 1x, 1x bandage, 1x range weapon, fast melee weapon 1x, 1x 2h weapon. Amputations are massive. In general is little buggy yet but funny. Full loot and build destruction: Full loot is total and build destruction depend of the tier of voxels, defense / durability grow with level, last level only get damage with catapult damage (they are real expensive).King of hill: This mode is funny and create a special role playing. Actually i am in court of king and the life is wonderfull :D, I go down to the valley to gank my vassals, tax system (1-20%), so funny.Clans: Family system,it's ok but poor for the moment, nothing to worry.Player Creation: I can only say is the Machine creator of trolls, laughing. It is very complete. (Please add Girls and more content in general to more laughter)Enviroment: In general i like it. Dawn, day, afternoon, evening, night; Lighting is so good but I think they should make more long transition for example 2 hours, at the time is too short like 30 mins. Rain and fog very well implemented.PVE village: Exist 1 npc village with monsters. Not experience yet, monsters are strong atm and need a special potion for go inside, the air is poisoned.Capture system: I still have no experience preferred direct killing. But it sounds fun especially to maintain controlled enemy players that are good in pvp or simple trolls.All this sounds very nice but there are things I do not like:1. The general beach respawn should control more (cooldown??), and even put it further, (Currently exist respawn system in beds like rust and is perfect).2. General optimization server: keep in mind this is a free building with ""good graphics more or less"", is a challenge for companies, but i hope that they can control and optimize the maximum. I think they could put a limit of voxels construction by player.3. FPS combat, is ♥♥♥♥ing funny but need better fix the hitbox, and 2nd point influences this point. Animations and jumping movements should also improve.4. Possible Upgrades: + large map + players per server + content + another king and create two regions.In General sandbox is close and very funny but need optimization.**Sorry for wall of text and my gispsie english.

								I really, really wanted to like this game. It had an amazing idea, but failed miserably when trying to execute it. Usually I don't give games flak for their technical issues (unless they are wide-spread issues and not limited to a minority). But this bug is so common that I will not be surprised if a lot of refunds are being processed at the moment; Australian's can't join the only two Aussie servers. I've had to joined 250+ ping servers. It's unplayable. The lag is too great. I have a great rig (4770k, 980Ti, 10gb RAM, etc) and I can't even 60 FPS on Medium graphics. The crafting system is okay, the King system is okay. The game is okay. I am refunding because it is literally unplayable for me. I hope to buy again if they fix these bloody issues. Unless you're okay playing with 250+ ping, AVOID AVOID AOID.			"

								REVIEW UPDATE OF 12/13th MARCH 2015:  Game's a bomb! Creative, varied, oppressive, dominant, completely crackhead in the soul! BUY IT! FIRST REVIEW /11th MARCH 2015:  This game is good fun! Smooth and playable at most, i bet it will become addictive in the future, at the beginning i was playing in an empty server, but i realized that is way more fun in a full one, that holds at the moment around 20 players. TO BE AN ALPHA THIS GAME GIVES A GOOD APPROACH AND APPEARS TO BE WELL THOUGHT:The character personalization looks fun and quite complete, compare to many other survivals where you are constraint on a standard model. Gathering and Crafting are easy to understand and not stressing at all, you start with a club and you can collect already wood and several plants in order to craft something. Wildlife and enemies like monsters are varied and very challenging, PvP combat is interesting and requires some skills, cause i got killed from a freshly spawned guy for example while i was equipped with a full wood armor and a better club, as well as some throwing stones, yet i died, maybe he was hacking, who knows, this is just a VERY FIRST IMPRESSION of the game, but i find it polished enough to be at this state, a really good start indeed! I will upgrade the review as soon as i play a bit more, thumbs up at the moment!			"

												This game sucks. I played almost 70 hours, hoping that, sooner or later, upgrades would have improved it. They didn't. Developers just added a bunch of useless stuff, instead of changing what really matters, for me and for the other players: optimization and, above all, an effective anti-hacking system. I changed many servers, worked for hours and hours, trying to build a safe base. I collected a lot of materials, harvested entire forests, and what I obtained was always the same things:- base robbed by some whiny kids (they came to my home saying: ""give us all you got, otherwise we'll kill you""...then I said them to go to f*** themselves. They stayed awake all night long, destroying every single block of the base.). - no help from administrators- lag, lag and...mmm....LAG.This game had a great potential. Do not buy it. Even if it is on sale. Even if it is free.			"

												At first I liked the game, Played with friends for a few days, Etcetera, But the playtime I've got told me enough. First of all, Combat here is COMPLETELY client-sided, So if you hit someone on your screen, It will count as a hit. That makes combat really glitchy and sometimes unfair. Second of all, Some weapons need rebalancing. I got sick of getting killed by some midgets that have a steel halberd and wasting my precious metal on armor that is completely useless. This game can be fun at times, But I won't play it for sure just because of reasons mentioned before.			"

								At this moment in time the game is broken(A10) and honestly i dont think it will be heading anywhere soon. -The engine is horrible with combat feeling like your swinging your weapon in the air praying u hit the other player. The jump mechanic can we unblievable sometimes where you can triple jump over walls or simply just build blocks in thin air and get in 4 block thick walls. Ranged weapons feel like your shooting the slowest arrow ever and javelins feel like your a special kid throwing your toy in a tantrum -The community is pretty horrible. Its very rare to see someone who will actually talk to u instead of killing you on site or chasing you around the map till one of u dies of boredom and gives up.-Every server has obvious hackers who sometimes will just grief everyone on the servers for hours on end without any admins support (community servers are a little better but soon as the admin gets off everything turns to♥♥♥♥♥♥-Theres no point in even building a fort or grinding out resources, while your offline ur fort will prob get trebucheted or hacked into and all those hours u spend building it and smelting iron and steel, gathering resources and robbing other players makes you feel kind of stupid for wasting your time. I give ROKs a 7/10. Its cheap but it kinda feels cheap			"

								Honest Review.I thought I was going to get something super boring and buggy. I got something opposite. Yes the game isn't optimized as it could be later on. Just play with low settings. The game is still awesome with lower settings! I started building a base and no armor and random people keep trying to fight me but i've died only once and killed 2 people so far! I'm jinxing myself cause as soon as I log in, i'll die most likely. I recommend it because I feel my 20 dollars is worth what i've already put in. You could go to the bar with friends and spend 20 easily on drinks or have endless amounts of fun killing and building a base! "

I am putting this review here to warn other people that once they get your money they do not care about you anymore. They dont care about making it playable. Mabe someday over the rainbow they will make it serverside. Or even make their server double check their client. Until then, save your money. They dont deserve any more.			"

								Gameplay itself, when actually as intended is pretty fun. Building and combat are both great in this game. What's not so great is the community. It was never huge to begin with, and now it's pretty much dead. Great idea, decent graphics & engine, however what largely killed the community is the fact almost EVERY patch requires a full map wipe. This basically means your literally starting the whole game all over. There are no stats to retain, everything is built up piece-by-piece. This also means if your base is destroyed, you're back to square one.I've had this game for a while and used to be on a great RP server. Arguable still one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. The server died as people moved onto other games. Unless you're going to host your own server for you and your friends, your only option is public servers. When I played months ago this meant extreme hackers. Public servers are still terrible and full of Chinese who seem to have nothing better to do than hack a washed up game, or chase you around the map for literally an hour until they can chop off your head.Played this game again for the first time in 3 months today. The new map is fantastic, the group of Chinese that logged on after I played 8 hours today and hack: 'wall climbed' into my base ( 10+ blocks high) naked with haliberds, killed me several times, didn't ever bother to take my loot, destroyed my bed & crest and are probably still dismantling my base just for ♥♥♥♥♥ as I write this, not so fantastic. Should have heeded the warnings, 30 minutes earlier someone was complaining in global chat about 'wall climbers', asking how it was done, to which I replied 'hacks'....I doubt they'll be returning to RoK either....Probably won't ever play again, which is a shame, because it had potential. Save your $20.			"

								One of the best survival games ever made, despite still being in early access.  My first day we spent all day dealing with a king named ""Jesus"" on our server, he had his kind moments, and his angry moments.  On several of our visits he killed us, captured us, tortured us, and even intended to whip to our backs while we were bent over and bound to pillories.  The final time I tried to visit him he tied me up, threw me in a cage, and tried to stone me to death as I pleaded for my life.  When he raised taxes on the land to 20% he finally gave us the fuel we needed to inspire and rally an army of common folk to finally storm the castle, and slay him once and for all.  It was then that I sat on the throne, and looked upon the land, only to realize that I too must manage the people well, or else be assaulted by force just the same.This game is awesome, and has a ton of potential.  Buy it!Gameplay -

								I would recommend the game. It's fun and has a way of keeping you hooked for hours.However it is so poorly optimized that it freezed and crashed nearly every time your movement requires a new area of the map to load with more than a few hundred blocks on it. On servers populated with more than 5 people, this is literally every  150 yards. This is unacceptable even for an open alpha game. I would advice anyone to not buy this until the devs make more of an effort to fix this problem that has persisted since the game launched.			"

								This game wasn't bad starting out everyone was friendly and a lot of chatting. After about 2 hours in everyone was killing people that where working together taking gear saying sorry that they would return their stuff just to kill them again. So after that I decided I would find a small area hidden from everyone to just get my feet wet. Everything was going well and durning that time frame about an hour or 2 people kept killing the new king and they would raise taxes to 40% or more. That slowed me down because it takes I beleive 40 wood to make one block for your house. After I finely finished my house and a bed to sleep on I decided to get off for a while. I decided to log on before bed just to be on the safe side to make sure no one broke in. Well there was two blocks missing from my house but they did not kill me or loot my place since I really didn't have anything that they couldn't gather in acouple of mins. so I decided to be tricky and double block my house and hide my loot crates under the floor so I could sleep at night not worring about anyone robbing me. The next day was my day off from work so I deided I would get a early start to building a wall and traps around my place to be extra safe. Well I logged in dead and my bed was broken so I had to spawn on a random spot on the beach half dead (not really sure why since when I fisrt logged in every bar was full.) Ayway I decided to go find my place and when I got there half of my base was gone and replaced leaf blocks and in the front there was a sign that said China #1. So I got into chat since everyone hates the Chinese I asked them to help me take my base back but no one answered me they was all to busy trash talking every other. So after a while I broke in and killed everyone inside and their beds. They had a lot of rare items I knew I wouldn't be able to defend by myself so I asked if anyone wanted to team up and take all their loot and everyone just talked trash to me. I then decided to throw everything into the ocean so no one could have it and then quit. The game itself isn't to bad they had a great idea.  I guess you can say the community ruined the game. I would not buy this game unless you have at lease 5 people or more to play with that will be on at all times of the day. It's just to easy to lose everything meaning... To build an okay house and sig you need to claim land it would take about 4 hours or so. Once you log off someone can come and break down your door or wall in about 10 mins or less and then break your sig in about 5 mins and then claim then they have a nice base and you have nothing. Think the game would be better if they had pvp servers and a hardcore pvp. Meaning in pvp you can kill anyone that is in the open but you can't break into their base it's like a safe zone in normal MMORPG's. Then in the hardcore pvp you aren't safe anywhere.  Just an idea though.			"

								Reign of kings is a great game to play alone or with friends. It has everything shown in the trailer, and every single feature is a perfectly working. Crafting is simple. You gather wood, stone, metal, etc and make better crafting tables and other crafting items which are simillar to rust's crafting. Game play is absolutly fun, go and become king go around as a midget slaugheting people or just explore. The map is quite empty at the moment but with a large ammount of players there will be alot of raiding to do. With the chivalry-like combat system attacking people is quite fun when you have a small malitia to a large army. I do have to say, the game does not feel like a 20$ game, but it sure is fun. In its state, there are quite a few bugs. They are nothing agnoying  but they can happen at random times. One of the bugs that I found was me getting launched into the air (I think i might have met God) and splashing down into the water. The physics system is pretty good at its state right now. As I said before the flying bug is one of the only problems in the game. The character  customization feels alot like oblivin when you crate the strangest character. It is not that complicated and can edit your characters full body. You can be a averaged joe, or be a giant, or just be a little person. Reign Of Kings is a great game for anyone who just is a casual gammer or just wants to mess around with friends. I did forget to add that the community is great there are no screaming children, or people who just call you curse words. 9/10			"

If I'd known this game was like that, I would never have bought it. Its fun, and it can initially suck you in. But the game is so ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥poory, laughably optimized, that any combat quickly devolves into a slideshow.Seiges are ♥♥♥♥ing worse, any amount of seige equipment or people around, and the game drops so many frames its blatantly impossible to play. You can't even close doors, because the frame lag is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad, that whenever you try to close a door, you automatically open to doors 'settings' for holding the E key. And this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is aside from the PLAGUE OF ♥♥♥♥ING HACKERS IN THIS GAME, that the developers have utterly ♥♥♥♥ING FAILED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT PERIOD. I would like to sue these ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥over emotional distress, and I highly recommend that no one buys this game ever, and I would fully support this game being pulled from steam and every, EVERY OWNER OF THIS FAILBRIGADE OF LIES, BEING FULLY REFUNDED FOR THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T LIE OF A GAME.Do not buy this, it will inevitably cause you unnessisary distress.

You wont find open RP like this anywhere else.

												Reign of Kings (RoK) is almost like a tragedy; what's present is the making of a good game, but the tragic part is the developers have ""released"" the game, and appear to be finished with it. It seems their intentions are no longer on developing and supporting game content. At this point, the game feels like it's in a Beta state - movement, animations and character models are clunky and unrefined. The content available in the game feels shallow, and also in need of refinement. This is terribly unfortunate, because, despite the state of the game, there's plenty of fun to be had. If more time and effort had been put into the game's development, it would feel much fuller, vibrant and even more fun. What RoK offers now is a stable, albeit shallow and clunky, medieval sandbox survival experience. While it offers a fair amount of variety in resources, materials and crafting elements, it doesn't offer, or receive, the same developmental support that will ensure a lasting (fun and interesting) game experience. Furthermore, the combat, while serviceable and modestly entertaining, is in need of work; animations are horrible, and both armor and weapons could use balancing (to make the system more interesting, example being: the speed difference between fully nude and clad in full steel armor is roughly 6% - essentially, there's no pros, or cons, outside of armor value between armor sets).But, again, RoK isn't a wholly bad game, and, in fact, it's pretty fun for the most part. It just feels unfinished. That's the best, tl:dr, way of describing the game: unfinished. I paid $5 for the game, on sale. At that price, it's worth the money. However, for the full $20, I just don't think I can recommend RoK. Ultimately, it's an unfinished product, that while fun, isn't worth the price of admission. If you can get it for $10, or less, then I say, ""sure, go for it.""Again, TL:DR - Fun game, albeit feels unrefined and unfinished. Only worth it on sale, not at full-price.			"

												This is the second CodeHatch game I've thrown money at. Once again the brilliant people at CodeHatch leave us with a steaming pile of sh*t. Do yourselves a favor and stay away from this crack pot of a studio. I've given them a second chance and I paid the price. Here are some problems: 1. Buggy (this is the first requirement for CH to release a game) 2. Poor performance (Again, lack of optimization is another core value at CH) 3. Grind (lets f*ck with the players even more and make everyting nearly unobtainable.)			"

												Here is the thing, I recommend this game to my friends all the time. But let's be realistic, this isn't a 20$ quality game. EVERY friend of mine has unamiously stated 20$ - NO WAY. However many of them would have joined me for 5-10$. So the ROK community is dying, ROK has mixed reviews yet still charges 20$. This means no new people are playing this game which is slowly and absolutely killing the community. This means less renewed interest. This is a dying business model which a Steam sale will not cure. Lower the ♥♥♥♥ing price already and maybe just maybe you can save the ROK community with renewed interest. Jesus Christ I am so damn tired of playing alone, I am so tired of having ZERO friends who will invest 20$ into this game. Lower your prices already. I'm about to say ♥♥♥♥ it and never play this♥♥♥♥♥♥again. Never recommend this♥♥♥♥♥♥again to anyone.**UPDATE** I typically play on private servers but I need to add this in. OFFICIAL ROK servers have zero admins and are run by Chinese hackers. Me and a few of my friends spent the day building a TIER 5 base which is strong. We took a hour break and then logged in and everything was gone, every single Tier 5 block. Even if you remove a land claim, T5 blocks take a long time to remove one by one. This base was massive and it would have taken days, but this base was wiped out in minutes. There are no admins to address this issue, and if you are not Chinese don't expect them to play fair with you. IE: Your name is not writtin in chinese or binary then they will teleport to you merc you and then wipe your base with ZERO intervention. Their EAC anti-cheat is garbage. Do not use official servers, they are like the wild wild west when it comes to duping, cheating, and unless you can code - you don't stand a chance. The developers give zero ♥♥♥♥s.			"

												To be fair. This can be a good game. Good for roleplay ect.. Very nice. However I cannot recommend this game to anyone for the simple fact that the players on this game are 40% 10 Year old children with anger problems. 20% hackers. and 39% people who make their character scrawny african children as to have the advantage of dark skin for night camoflauge and small torsos so they can get avoid getting hit by any of your counter attack.The Players are complete and utter savages with no morals what so ever. No one can be trusted. Profanity and Hate is spewed from all spawn points with people in Iron or leather armor. And the point of the game cannot even be accomplished due to all of the hostile activity and high demand of resources (which can only be found in certain locations). Perhaps you will enjoy it if you make yourself and your friends a private server; but other than that= you will have no fun on this game. Only frustration. I'm a very chill guy~ I don't get upset easily, I don't get temper tantrums over small mishaps- but this game put me to the brink of madness and skin tearring. Devs need to fix character♥♥♥♥♥♥ Reduce long-ranged weapon damage like spears (or increase sword damage) and add voices that weren't made from an ameture voice actor.			"

I will definitely be playing a lot more of this.Some things to expect: Hours of fun Hilarious character customization Building mechanics of Minecraft Survival aspect of RUST Combat system of Chivalry (As of 4/20/15) Some hotbar glitches that can be fixed by relogging (As of 4/20/15) Some menu glitches trying to join servers Randomly being roped and kidnapped You can store sharp rocks in your butt And much, much more "

Death by beheading.I was lucky enough to be spared and instead, was brought to the gallows, to be hung.The gentleman propped me into it, and asked if I had ""Any last words?""I asked if I could feel the wind grace my little arms during one last wiggle.He allowed it, and let me out.

												This was my first survival game, and with that I can say that I had many hours of enjoyment building bases, raiding bases, and roping people while having my team beat them to death. All that aside, the honest truth is.... It lost its charm with the direction the devs took the game.... It saturated the servers with a gigantic map and more time wasted just seeking people to interact with. I don't want to be anti-social in a game that is supposed to be ""survival"" - that includes surviving other players.In any case, the gameplay feels hindered, and the method of raiding has changed drastically. Everything shifted from being too easy toward being a waste of time. I just don't want to spend hours gathering materials and searching for people... I hope the reviews convince the devs to construct a better solution for problems rather than patching new content in and ignoring current issues. Hopefully I made some persuasive points with this review, thanks!			"

								Do not buy this game. You will spend a lot of time building things which is great, but there are so many hackers on every server that its pointless. The Devs must have not taken any mesures to deture hacking nore dose it appear like they are planing to do anything about it. Hackers will just turn on your ""flight mode"" ? so while you are running you will fly into the floor by mistake and then they turn it off right after and you die. They do speed hacks where they run around really fast and break into your walls really fast. Even on offical servers, no one appears to be monotoring, no way to kick a hacker its pointless.			"

								 Game is very entertaining but in it's current state is near unplayable.  Hackers run rampant and unchecked. Unless this problem is addressed the game and any hope of seeing the devs vision come to be will be extinguished. I'd give it a week or two at most until players just give up if nothing is done. Server stability is sorely lacking as well. Hope something is done soon so I can write a real review... "

								I may change my review but I don't think it will be any time soon.. How about we start with all the Hackers... Spawing Bears from the sky, killing everyone on the server, banning them, and the list just goes on and on... FIX YOUR GAME!!!!  Great concepet, was fun for play until the trolls came out.  But I will not be playing this game till it gets fixed.  The only reason I'm writing this review is so no one wastes their time with it till it is fixed.			"

However, a pro of the game is that sometimes the character jumps without me asking it to as well! 2.8675309/10			"

								This game is like minecraft, chivlary and rust combined. They've been rolling out updates for this game as well. So all the people saying ""Don't get this game because it's buggy."" What the hell were you expecting? You already know that early access ""pre-alpha"" titles are going to be buggy. Stop complaining and don't get them if that's what you're going to put into each review of each pre-alpha that comes out. It's so not necessary and annoying to say the least. This game is really fun to play. If you like Rust and Chivlary. I give you an 80% chance of enjoying this game. It's definantly worth the twenty dollars to buy it. And at the very least, just watch reviews on YouTube. Watch out for updates and other things of that nature. Keep in touch, and follow this game. You don't have to buy it. But at least see what it's about by watching videos and reading reviews. Rating: 7.5/10 Would I buy it again assuming I didn't? Yes.Is it worth the twenty dollars? Yes.Should I get this game with my buddies who want copies as well? Yes, if you have the money and some buddies who want the game and can't get it for themselves.			"

								In the last few years I have dealt with early access games less and less, and there is a reason for that.Most early access games, at least it would seem, are just trying to snag some money and dip out, or lure people in with facts about their current version of the game, when in reality the level of content is months, if not years away.This game, IMHO, offers a huge amount of content, especially for being a early access game. It is great to see a price tag of $20 on it. Of course it has its share of bugs and performance issues, but DAMN is there a lot of content.Most of the content is player driven. Do you want to tech up and go steel 2h sword crazy on everyone? AWESOME! Someone will prob gonna get a few buddys and hunt you down.Want to create a small camp in the middle of the woods? That's cool too! Just wait for the asshat trio to show up and wreck the place.Great game so far. Insane amount of potential.Current state: 9/10			"

								Would rate 8/10 for content and design.Would rate 0/10 for debugging, connection issues and poor development.After you spend a good 13 hours trying to find out what is causing your game to not be able to join one server or at least get past character creation you lose hope for a game. When i bought ROK i was looking forward to playing a great looking game, meet new people and have a great survival/ medieval experience. Instead i got 13 hours of restarting the game and STARING AT A BLACK SERVER PAGE. I have had connection problems since i bought ROK (alpha 7) and not only have they not improved; theyve gotten worse!!... With the addition of a firewall that looks like the developers downloaded it from internet explorer in three minutes and the worst connection problems ive had with games ever, im disappointed. Looks like history is repeating itself...And anyone that tries to justify this with 'its early access, all early access games have bugs' that does not extend to 'its early access, anyone who spends £20 on an early access game can expect to not be able to play it at all'.

												absolutely terrible game, not only is it not optimized but the game has 2 banning systems, one that detects actual inconsistancies in the .dll files and what not, the other being sort of a ""vote to ban"" system, even on official servers, where there are no admins, if a single person gets enough reports, they will be banned, so if a large enough clan hates you, you will be banned even if you arent doing anything wrong.I have been banned at least 10 times, because of my fighting skills, and ive appealed to these bans but i never get a response back from the developers.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you want to build something, collect resources, and then be banned if you are even moderately good at the game.

												This game was released in alpha state, it is a really good concept but lacks a great deal of fundemental aspects. Example, mesh collider of the map is off in some really obvious places, the rag doll physics are way off ""ei swimming feet foward?wat, sliding down hills/mountains w exponential speed"" combat with weapons is way off ""can swing a weapon and it go through someones head taking no damage, but be 6 cubes away and get hit""Game needs a tonne of work, which it most likely will not receive it and these issues have been there since alpha.  Best case scenario, the Reign of Kings game gets bought out by EA games or some other major game company and make the necessary changes or dismantel the game completely and rebuild it from the foundation up.  800+hrs and disapointed			"

As time went on the game became worse and worse until the devs eventually stopped caring. Australian community was killed by a lack of a ping limit where people with 300-400 ping would raid our servers and be unhittable/hit you from out of sight. Hackers are rampant with servers having massive buildings across the map. Patches are few and far between.If someone came to me now and asked if they should buy this game, even with my 588 hours played I couldn't recommend this game.			"

								Really fun if you find the right server to play on. Otherwise it's frusterating and pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game is beautiful until you walk 25 feet and realise all anyone knows how to build is giant boxes and floating boxes with a pole holding them in the air. However, you can't blame them cause any good looking house is usually easily raided. Hackers ruin the game and there are only American and British servers so other cultures (mainly Chinese) come on with different languages. No one understands each other so they just KOS and treb the other houses. I'd only reccomend this game if you're lucky and find a server with good admins, some sort of rules or rp, pretty clean (no random blocks laying around) landscape, only raiding when the other player/guild is online,  and killing is allowed but not on sight.

The graphics are what you'd expect from most Early Access games, but you could do a lot better with $20 than this game. I suggest if you haven't bought yet to just skip on this game in general, because it's not worth the investment.

I put in about 5 hours and had a very nice setup. A naked man wielding a club shows up and starts throwing spears at my base. Three of us run out to dispatch him, wearing Iron & Leather armor. We all have Iron weapons. This man proceeds to hit me and my friends, with a wooden club, from about 50 ft. away, never missing, & kills all three if us in seconds. He then enters our stone base, which is 100% blocked off with stone block and Iron gates, instantly and camps us. Shortly after, I go run around the corner of the mountain and this same guy has a giant T7 block base. He did this in 3 hours? I was logged on 2 hours b4 he was even on the server.I can not believe Code}{atch is just letting this game go to♥♥♥♥♥♥ So many people enjoy it and they do literally nothing to combat hacking.  The game has so much potential, but their lack of effort has left it in an unplayable state. I wasted 5 hours of my time last night to rage quit. It is absolutely ridiculous that they have done nothing after all the input they have been given regarding this. Just read the rest of the comments and forums! I would not recommend this game to anyone until a solution is found. Thank you Code}{atch for ruining what used to be one of my favorite games. Do you not care about your reputation? Or fans of your game? It would appear not.    "

												In short, the only way this game is fun for me is if you own and mantain your own server, wich is not easy to do with all the bugs and programing involved in creating a server. In every other senerio, server I found no one friendly in the community servers. Most admin/moderators/servers will wright the rules for other players, then blatenly break the rules. Most community servers just kill and rob you after hours of work put in to their server. I have yet to figure out how to make my servers available to the public. Programing is difficult language to learn without any valid instructions anywhere on the net. Overall, my experience in Reign Of Kings has not been good unless I am offline in my own server wich can be boring with no other players in the game. This game seems to be for rich people and computer programers that knows the unique bianary codes you need to play on your own server. No one in a years time has given any info on this game, had to experiment with the bianary codes to try to figure out the language, wich is a royal pain in the rump. I do not reccomend this game for the reasons explained above.			"

												This could be a really awesome game, but it has a ton of issues. I fully understand that it is an alpha and understand the problems that follow, but the dev's just dont care. Not to mention the contant bickering and drama I can see why it is so hard to find the answers that could help with in game issues.I had started a dedicated server so I could enjoy the game with my friends and that all came to a stop once a patch came and now I and my friends are unable to connect to the server. Asked for help for awhile, and searched the guides and net to find a solution to fixed this with no help. NOT ONE WORD FROM ANYBODY. The guilde that was posted didnt work asked for help on said post never got a response back. Well from that moment on I just uninstalled the game and everything with it.I would love to say "" yes this is an awesome game trying it out.', but with everything going on with this game DO NOT GET THIS GAME. Even the youtude videos make it look awesome. Just dont. same your money. In the long run the Dev's are just going to take it and you will not get your moneys worth. That is just my opinion and reveiw. "

												No way to control hacking.  Chinese players hack on NA West Coast Servers.  Nobdy can do anything; nobody cares.  This game is a joke.  On every server I've tried people have already strategically blocked the King's Tower and all important resources.  Werewolves guard the iron.  This game is a disappointment.Why pay real money for a medieval hack simulator?  The mechanics of the game are cool, but the placement of resources and inability to stop hacking makes it a struggle just to enjoy this game.DON'T LET HACKERS RUIN YOUR GOOD GAME.			"

								Not even worth 2 bucks US.Terrible game. Core combat system blows donkey♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Absolutely everything about this game sucks.The only positive is the average latency optimization isn't as bad as that pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ark online.But this is still equally an unbalanced product.If your in pacific, even if your a big fan of the medievel genre ignore this game as there is like no community playing it.At most you get half a server of 20 or around 20 players.I reccomend buying chivalry medieval warfare for true leading medieval combat with the most innovative fighting systems that are skill based, and 7 days to die or rust for shooters with very good crafting/building.Why? because untill 2020 or 2025 having a game that does both of the above as a sandbox will be impossible with decent lag. Systems still aren't optimized enough to run a game like what these guys are trying to do on any game engine full stop. And if it is possible on a small scale not with a crap engine like the one these devs chose.2/10 Regretted buying this on a sale for 5 bucks.I would trade this game to someone for 1 buck us.Its that bad.

												This game should have never of been released it is far from being released any time soon. It is poorly optimized and pretty unplayable when you get in a fight with someone. DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS FOR $20 IT IS NOT WORTH IT. I recommend you buy it while it is on sale now or when it is again for $5. It has potential but they are probably lazy♥♥♥♥♥developers that are gonna take the money and run for example dayz's devs and Infestations devs. So overall it is just an investment to see if this game turns out to be actually good. 8/10I should change this but it is true. The offical servers of this game is so bad it causes the lag i recommend people try out community servers cause on my friends server there is absolutely no lag at all. Combat is smoother and more enjoyable.			"

								First of all, thank you for building up such an entertaining and great game.As a gamer the most important aspect of a game is ""playability"" and if it has this, it will have a long-lasting play time.The good things about the game are, it has lots of things similar to our life. There are lots of stuff and things to make. Building part is really nice since it provides the player a wide range of materials and creativity. The voice and mic thing is really nice for Role Playing.However, there are too many parts in game to be improved for stable playability. For instance, at first, it is not so much important to have so much items and so much graphics. In alpha version, the game could be more suitable for older computers (which I have one right now) so that more players can join and test the game without lagging and ""paralyzed-screens"", and freezings etc. What I mean is that the game MUST be fluent to play. This is the most important thing for many gamers. The graphics can be altered and improved later on.Secondly, the very first thing to improve is to OPTIMIZE the game engine as soon as possible. There must be more graphical options (Medium textures i.e.). Additionally the game takes too much RAM to run, so this must be, again, fixed at the very beginnig. I also played ROK in a more advanced computer (My brother's computer and he also has the game) but the problems are nearly the same.To conclude, the game engine MUST be optimized so that the game can run on most of the computers (even in the older ones). This will make your game suitable for the top numbers (players). And there can be more options in character creation screen. But this is not so necessary for now.I think this game will start a new era for ""free-world type"" games and when those improvements above are done, it will reach a wide number of players around the world. In my country, Turkey, I heard about the same complaints from many players. So your team should focus on the optimization.In the future if any help needed for ""Localization"" ( I mean if you need Turkish Language option) I gladly help you with this.Looking forward to see most of the problems solved in BETA!LATEST NOTE: The game is open for hacking. So this MUST be fixed at very first so that players do not leave the game FOREVER.Regards			"

								A game the devs will probably bail out on, insanely unbalanced items. you can literally take down a clan of 20 people with full steel armor and trebs with a rope.         Base building is more grindey than getting 99 Fishing in Runescape. The game is too time consuming for the little entertainment it provides. If the devs were to release a patch where your base cannot be destroyed unless atleast one of your clan members is logged into the server, I wouldn't have a problem. If you're not in an international clan where people in your clan play all throughout the day, everyday, it's not worth your time. When someone notices your clan is asleep, they'll just destroy your base with unbalanced trebs, steal all your stuff, kill you, and you and your clan will be forced to start over.			"

												So I made a review of this game long ago when so many twitch streamer were helping to make this game big. However through time of course there are always going to be hackers no matter what game but the devs try to fight back. These devs didn't!!! At least it took them over 2 quarters to fix some bugs, ban a few hackers, but never really tried to patch the game to fix actually anything. Many graphical errors were in the game so long,servers had latency isses, so many bug on getting inside people hard worked bases which was not fair. I am going to say this though. IF and I am going to emphasize if really big. IF the devs actually tried or actually GAVE A ♥♥♥♥ and didn't take the Popularization of the game from twitch streamers and viewers this game would not only be alive but prosper more than the STUPID game Hurtworld which I personally thought was a♥♥♥♥♥♥Dev team over RUST Facepunch team.  I Honestly SEE, actually saw a lot of damn potential in ROK, more than Hurtworld and RUST. Reason behind that is the music, the graphics simple and classy look, environmental aspect made you actually really feel part of the Era. BEST Crafting EXPERIENCE EVER HANDS ♥♥♥♥ING DOWN. So what the hell Devs? u guys could've made so much more capital . Dumbasses			"

												Don't get me wrong, its an amazing game and i love it when you can actually walk around when there are no hackers.I have only 17 hours on the game and my friend and i have been raided over 10 times by hackers. now i know people will say ""oh but you are still new to the game they werent hacking"". well thats where you're wrong. Reign Of Kings doesnt have an option where you can sprint across the entire map in a few seconds and teleport through stone walls, therefore allowing the person to take all of your hard earned items. I am actually infuriated by the hackers. They take all of the fun outof the game and crush your experiance of the game. If the game could look at the reports you put on players. I payed $19.99USD for this game, and i use AUD so i payed an extra $6.65 to be greeted by hackers.			"

												Started out to be fun then hackers took over and people left servers in droves. Some came back and some left but overall it was a game that had limited enjoyment as there was no progression that kept my interest. The crafting is on par with this genre. Don't know how the game is now with its new release on steam. I'm guessing offical servers would be ok but be wary of player run servers as the person who runs it might just dominate the server and employ admin abuse on its users.			"

I play 7 Days to Die and Space Engineers pretty much exclusively so I know what I'm talking about when I say this game is just freakin awful.Here are my main problems with the game (compared to other survival games I enjoy past and present):The UI is hideous, the game is buggy, the servers are full of angry 12 year olds, the graphics are nasty, the controls are clunky, the armor might as well be made of paper, the enemies are over powered, player movement speed is super slow, you can get roped by a naked guy and hauled off to stocks and there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO!Read on for review and updates...<August Update>New update, Thought I'd try again. Still awful. In fact worse. A naked guy was able to grab me with a rope from real far away and haul me for ages while I could do nothing. He put me in stocks and axed me to death.

That is pretty much the mixture for this game, and it's GENIUS!Even with FPS drop, server perfomance that affects combat, etc. You can have an amazing and hilarious time playing this, it already has a good variety of custom servers, if you're looking for RP, PVP, Creative, etc...With a bright future ahead I think we'll be looking at a pretty unique and amazing game here that I will definitely sink many more hours into.

								This game was fun for about 50 or so hours, and then when I ran my own server it was fun for another 100 hours... But once you build your base (which has to be limited because the servers will bog down and/or new update comes out forcing server wipe 100% of the time. Why has ARK managed to update their game without wiping servers every freaking time?) there really isn't anything else to do beyond base-building but sparring/fighting (which is at best a discount Chivalry), raiding other bases, and whatever ""RP"" the server admins happen to be enforcing. This game had so much potential but instead the devs just want to wrap this game up quickly and move on, thus we get a bunch of useless items every patch that end up not being to any effect in prolonging the life of the game.I think my biggest pet peeve with the development of this game is you cannot dig underground like in 7 Days or Minecraft.  :(RIP RoK			"

								This is a very fun game, my friends and I kill a lot of time playing this game and it has a lot of potential. I understand the game is early access and there will be little bugs but this game DESPERATELY needs an Anti-Cheat. Currently every single OFFICAL server I join has a hacker in it. I spend a bunch of my time buidling up my base and raiding people and then all of that just turns to nothing when a person joins with hacks and ruins it for everyone. I would turn to the community servers but they are no better and they also have admins that abuse. Like I said earlier, I understand this game is early access but an Anti-Cheat should have been added earlier. It is a given that people will hack on any game. Until the devs add a proper Anti-Cheat I cannot reccomend this game as it just wastes your time.			"

								Best survival game since the original Rust.  Very close to being better with some slight improvements in glitches/performance, the sort of thing youd expect in early access. However, dont waste your time doing anything other than logging in and having a walk around the map to see what others have done.. any time you spend building, crafting or role playing WILL be wasted when hackers fly through you and grief hours of work.  I've had significant bases and games on 3 servers and have left a dozen others, all due to hacking and admin abuse. If you have a private server with plenty of friends to play on, then do that, otherwise the game is a waste of time. Best 6 days of gameplay I've had in a long time, doubt I'll put it on again until I read the games fixed.			"

								Not gonna give this game a thumbs down but if you have a laptop I would recommend you to not buy this game. I ran this game on a AMD A10-4600M APU 2.30GHz with 16.0 GB of ram and was I was averaging about 10 frames. I thought I could get away with the specs I have but this game is really resource intensive so people with mid range to high end machines should be fine.			"

								GREAT Concept. Horrible mechanics.. I bought this game the first day it came out. i loved it. Kind of ran smooth, super fun gathering and building your guild and trying to take the kingdom. Beautiful landscaping. Then comes the combat. The combat is so pathetic it is unreal. I get on lowest ping server i can and fighting is laggy. So laggy the fights are just pure luck of who wins. No point in blocking just 2 people running in circles hitting a player they hope is still in that spot. GREAT GREAT GREAT concept. but they have gone from alpha 1 now to Alpha 21 and if the combat isnt fixed yet it may never be. They should give this game to torn banner and let them make it the combat based game it should be. I would totally recommend this game if it wasnt so frustrating working hard then losing in some fight that is just a lag match. Invest your time and funds elsewhere cause this is a joke.			"

								If you ever thought wow I feel like giving myself a brain aneurysm, this might be the game for you.This game looks at all the good parts of  h1z1, rust, dayz/ any survival game and says ""♥♥♥♥ IT, LETS NOT DO THAT"" and whats left is this piece of garbage.  I don't think i've played a single game this bad, and i've played Tree of life early access... The server list? Forget it, you will be placed with chinese, euro players and their lag will destory any fighting chance you have against them.  It takes you maybe 5 hours from the starter (1 hour if you're experienced) to get to end game gear, but guess what once you're there it means nothing 2 people can come in with a starer club and rekt your face, as lag and numbers mean everything.The way this game makes my FPS drop is insane, I have a brandnew computer that has some of the top of the line hardware and it still can't handle some of the things this game throws at it.  Optimize pls.In all, if someone said I can pay 20$ for another copy of this game or pay 20$ to get my balls waxed, I would pick waxing....0/10  "

								Ok firstly I love this game but at present, in good concience I just cant recommend it. Like the early days of RUST, the hacker problem is currently completely out of control, going to such extremes that not only can they fly but teleport everyone on the server, spawn stuff, wipe everyones inventory on the server... and I'm talking about official servers here!!Just today Everyone on the official server  I was on had their inventorys wiped twice. Apart from the hacker problem there seems to be constant issues with Rollbacks and crashes that just kick everyone off the server. Apart from its huge problems with teh forementioned the game its self is incredibly fun. If they fix the server problems and teh hacker problems (which may very well be the same thing) then this game will be good.  I kind of consider it a shame that they did a steam release while such serious problems were still going on because all that ever happens when developers do that is they lose a crap load of credibility and their game gets largely written off by the steam community even if they do fix it. The early access thing in its current form needs to stop really or at least there needs to be a minimum standard of security/stability which is enforced by Valve.  "

I tought this game would have a community like rust's community with the whole kill on sight thing but that's different here, people want to meet other people and work together to get the throne or build a base.

												On the right server, this game is a pleasure. I played most of my five hundred hours on Moon's whitelisted roleplay server and my own server. There are plenty pieces available for a great medieval rp experience. This survival aspect of this game is good, but the rp was the core aspect that kept me coming back.> pros <▪ Building is fun, lots of potential for great architecture.▪ Combat is decent and skill based when there is no lag.▪ Fun rp items like jester hats, whips, cages, etc.  You can let your creativity flow.▪ Survival aspect is pretty solid.  Many different style options to provide and survive.> cons <▪ If you play on a public server, the community is pretty garbage.▪ Cheaters, cheaters, and cheaters.▪ Devs made major UI and game changes in the last few weeks of beta before fully releasing the  game that had yet to be fleshed out and tested.▪ Many ideas and possibilites with a lot of potential will never be added - (horses, fur clothing, etc).All in all its a solid game, most of the complaints stem from the garbage community, which is not the developers fault.  Find a solid server or make your own otherwise you're probably gonna have a bad time.			"

								First 5 minutes of gameplay.>Spawn on beach.>Walk around beach.>Find bag with loot in it on the beach within minutes.>Get a few upgrades.>Start chopping down tree with a bone axe I found.>Suddenly an invisible hacker with an axe (I could only see the axe in his hand) starts wailing on me, hitting me each time until I die.>That was my first 5 minutes of gameplay.I realized going into this there would be hackers. I knew good and well what I was getting myself into. But when I log in and I'm immediately dropped by a hacker then there's problems. I'm still going to give this game a chance still but in it's current state I suggest NOT buying this game for a few weeks or months. At least until this game's security against hackers is improved a ton. Don't let your opinion of this game get too warped before it even has a chance to grow just because some manchild decided he's going to try and stop yet another survival game from being able to progress in a healthy manner.

								This game has great potential.  Like a lot of failed Alpha games do.  Playstyle is also pretty fun, although damned tedious if you are trying to solo play or have a small group.  All of this could be overcome, except for the stupid hacking and exploiting taking place on 5 of 5 servers I playtested on.  As it stands, this game sucks.  It simply isnt acceptable to spend a few hours collecting to have hackers show up invis, with freeze capability, who kill you and move on.  Or who blow through your walls with one hit.  Or who fly around.  Developers made a game with absolutely no plan to deal with hackers, that all is being attempted now, with sad and sorry results.  It was so bad on all the servers I tried, I requested a refund from steam for the game because it is simply not playable as is.  I will take a look again in a few months to see if things are better.  We shall see.Reaper			"

By which you will rule the kingdoms and any peasents who wouldnt dare cross the king! HOWEVER, the game is in alpha which means that every week a new update comes you lose all progress and are sent back to the prehistoric ages (Literally) because a new skin was added. THE VERDICT!

								My Early Access Launch Day Impressions Video:


YouTube™ Video: Reign Of Kings - Let's Play - Episode 1 

			Views: 542		

			In this video, I talk about why I had a complete change of opinion since the early access launch of this new sandbox multiplayer survival game.		

Okay, for the second time now, this is a game that has completely reversed my review from an original 'two thumbs down' review that I posted on it's early access to a positive 'two thumbs up' review just a couple of days later.Why?Well, I admitted in my original review that I loved almost everything about this game from the graphics, crafting and even the Kings castle how who controlled the kings throne could set their own tax rate and collect that percentage of taxes on all other players collected resouces.  My problem came with the core of this game on that first day, about my first two hours of game time where the combat experience was laggy and suffered from extremely slow framerates.Since then and about 20 hours of game time later..  I'm sold that this game is not only a two thumbs up, but the most fun, best multiplayer survival sandbox game out now.  It's incredibly fun, period.  Yes it has bugs and glitches and things that make you scratch your head like deer that run from you and fly through the air against logic and physics.  It doesn't matter.  This game is so much fun that it's easy to overlook these little problems and glitches that make no sense.Granted, I havent put all those hours in myself, as my son's best friend has been using my account to play with my son these past couple of days.  But both of them agree that this game is loads of fun after going on a five hour adventure in the game just this afternoon.I will be posting videos on this game soon, because covering everything fun and great about what these developers have created with this would make an insanely long wall of text that few would read.  Let's just say though that if you are an existing fan of similar games like Rust, Seven Days To Die, and the Forest, then you will probably love this game.  I have over 500 hours into Rust, and this game so far offers deeper gameplay, better graphics, and more fun then Rust.It's not perfect, but it IS a helluva lot of fun, and these developers (who completely missed with StarForge) have both surprised and impressed me with RoK.  My biggest fear and reason to tell people to hold back is my fear that cheaters and hackers might take over and ruin this great game.  But it also might be a good reason to tell people to jump in NOW before that happens and experience all the fun it offers while it lasts.  Maybe the developers will continue to impress me and actually support and make this game even better and be able to control the cheaters and hackers.  {crosses my fingers}With over 40 hours of game time in already between my son and I, this game has already been worth it's purchase price, and I suspect there are hundreds of hours to come.  The medeival style crafting in this game is already about 10 times that of what Rust 2.0 offers now, and we've only crafted about 15% of everything possible with all the hours we've already played.  ..Awesome.Any serious fans of Rust should not pass on this one right now.  For Rust fans particularly, this game is a definite and serious ""MUST-BUY"".  Wait, unless you are one of those weasel cheating, hack-using losers from Rust... then you should sat far, far away!  :-))-  Zaxx			"

												Found a nice community server.  No griefers, hackers, etc.  Nothing like that... Contrary to most of the reviews, the community is not the problem... it's the game... Wurm Online is free and the same thing,  It makes Reign of Kings look like some kind of pre-alpha prototype.  The game sucks, plain and simple. The graphics are terrible, the building system is even worse... i could go on and on but it's honestly not worth it.  Believe the reviews, terrible, terrible game.Also, need to play on med-low graphics with a  970 to get 40 fps?  Garbage.  That is completely unheard of... I can play Ark on epic... Overall, a terrible game and i got it on sale for 4.99... still not worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								RoK is a great concept and actually a very fun game at its core but it is currently riddled with exploits, bugs, and an incompetent development team who have a very shady past with their first title, Starforge.The game gives you the freedom of Minecraft building with Chivalry-style medieval combat, although a little rough around the edges. The ability to free-build a castle and risk losing it all provides hours of fun. This fun has been RUINED by an influx of Chinese players who lag, exploit, and hack the North American official servers day and night, driving the legitimate players away.CodeHatch have failed to acknowledge this as even a problem and CHOOSE to develop the game in ways that it doesn't need right now. They chose to spend almost a month designing shields instead of pouring all their resources into releasing a working ping-limiter and auto-kicker system to get rid of these lagging and cheating Asian players. The game actually is more broken with this latest Patch 18 than it was weeks ago. CodeHatch continuously claims that the ping-limiter is not quite ready yet and delays its release every passing update. 99% of their community forums are actual LEGIT players begging for them to fix this...yet they can't/won't do it.DON'T get sucked in by the 50% off - Let them earn players by releasing content that helps the game.

												Its a really good game, it has a lot of good stuff in it. but i have one MAJOR issue that makes the game impossible to play. fps. i have an AMD FX 4100 Quad Core Processor 16 GB of ram a 64 bit op system and an AMD Radeon R9, and i get on average 20 fps and about every  seconds it spikes and the frames drop to 2, no to mention if i do anything relating to combat the game will do 1 of 2 thing. 1. the game will freeze for about 2 mins and when it stop freezing ill be dead. or 2. the game freezes, and outright ♥♥♥♥ing crashes. mind you this was on a freshely wiped server with only 20 people on. ther is no good ♥♥♥♥ing reason for this to happen, and i get it. its early in development, but devs. i cant test your game IF IT DOESNT WORK IN THE FIRST PLACE. so if you're sane, wait. wait until the sorts its♥♥♥♥♥♥out. if you have 20 bucks to throw away and a comp from 500 years in the future with enough power to run this game, then go right ahead. but by dont misunderstand, i still think its a great game. everything is really well done, its just the crippling FPS and crashing problem that completly ruins the game.Edit: I Still have almost all the same probles listed above TO THIS DAY.But it doesn't even matter because the devs basically gave up on it, they got to to what they think is a ""full release"" (which its not) & have done nothing since but fix minor bugs instead of actually adding more ♥♥♥♥ing content. 0/10 get rust instead.

												I have the game on an external hard drive.I was walking through the map when the game freezes (usually does this with games on my external drive because it has to spin up or something)This time, it actually froze.This time, alt-F4 wouldn't close it.This time, task manger wouldn't close it.This time, ""Reign Of Kings.exe has stopped working"" window wouldn't close it.I had to restart my PC.Reign Of Kings: Not even once.2/10 for giant horns though.

Early Access Review
								I wasn't sure what to think of this game at first view. However after playing it for a total of 1 hour I was hooked and played it for 8 more hours on the first day.However information was being spread  about the company making the game. They botched on another game and people feel they were ripped of. Inspite of that for twenty dollars, I feel I have gotten my moneys worth easily. I've spent more on games that only have 20 hours of gameplay and very little replay value. However I'm well over 100 hours into this game and I still have not gotten bored.I do recommend finding a good online community to play with while the game is under development. For me that meant roleplay servers. The players are more friendly and are less likely to just break your stuff while you are asleep or kill you on sight. Plus interacting with other's characters is rather fun. At the time for local interaction VOIP is required. Otherwise there is a global chat for all and a global chat for your guild.The game is perfect for anyone who loves the idea of playing around in a fantasy world and building their own great castles or even small homes.As an alpha build, one thing to keep in mind is that servers do get completely wiped from time to time in order to fix issues. This can be discouraging but in a good community the players will work together to help rebuild before going to war with one another.I have recommended this game to all my friends and those who have purchased it have really enjoyed the game so far. I am looking forward to the future development of the game, but I will never feel that I was ripped off even if it doesn’t get much further than this. "

								aside from the guys that camp at the beach spawn points to kill anybody that starts the game, its not so bad. unless... you want to count the hackers and exploiters that noclip through your castle walls and one hit you with their fists and fly around at super sonic speeds. i really liked the game for about two whole hours. if you enjoy game breaking exploits and hackers, this game is for you. if you dont enjoy those kind of people, well TOO DAMN BAD! you cant report them and if you try, nobody will do anything about it. dont be like me and waste 20 bucks on a game that caters to 12 year olds that got their dads to download hacks for them. other than that, the game design and interactions were pretty cool.

								If you are sitting there thinking ""Oh here we go another early access survival game in Alpha"",  then yes you are right, but you are probably then thinking that this game is gonna be just like the rest of them.  Think again!  This game is polished in the fact that it does things brilliantly and with great humor, graphics and design, but yes it has its glitches too.  So far, I have seen a great community and I hope that this remains.  I have played solo and been instantly invited into guilds to help them de-throne the king and take control of the realm, and I have also played in my own group with close friends to build our own fortress with a view to gear up and maybe push forward at some stage to have a crack at the throne ourselves.If you have £15 burning your pockets and you have the time to spend gathering resources and knowing that this is alpha so can reset at any stage, then go for it, I can tell you that it will be £15 well invested in game play time.I have spent 15 hours at the time or writing and have thouroughly enjoyed the game, the crafting and the role playing.Let's hope that the game continues to develop as good as the introduction that we are experiencing already.Well done so far devs.			"

You can build.The roleplay is intense.Combat system is fubar because of game lag. Knights with swords hitting you 50 meters aswell and sprint inside your house against a friend will kill him instantly!This game will be amazing when it's getting improved! :^)			"

												If it wasn't for the player base this game could've gotten somewhere. If it wasn't for lazy undelivering developers it might have gotten farther. As it stands though, Reign of Kings has probably the most toxic player i've seen in a while, from kill on sight- to ""I run the server I'm going to salt the earth where you live"". I played this game in beta when it was rife with people that had ""hacked"" the game, I use paranthese's because all they did was give themselves admin priviliges on an unsecure game. This was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for all that weren't spawning in anything and everything they needed, but it quickly turned those away who would have given this creative game more hours. This brings me to full release, they've ""fixed"" the hackers, but the problems still remain; incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ server lag, and no balance whatsoever to the combat fixture. I've learned that blocking is 90% of the time useless, and that even though you're in full steel, if that guy is laggier than you, you're eating a ♥♥♥♥ing wooden club with no say in the matter.			"

												I loved this game for a short time period, but then I realized all of the problems it has. Then all of the good things, but the problems just outweigh the good.Pros:-Lockpicking(I couldn't think of much else for pros)-Base raiding with trebuchet-Take control of the land by overthrowing the current kingAnd now, the longer listCons:-Runs terribly, even on high end PCs(With resolution completely down, and all the graphics settings down, still 15 fps)-Block building system makes a decent house take you 2 hours to build, since the blocks are so expensive and small-Animations are just bad-Blocking with weapons doesn't work as it should-Did I mention that it runs terribly?Unless you have an Alienware or something, don't try this game and expect more than 50 fps.Edit: I know I have 20 hours. The game is addicting, just like any other survival game. It'd be my favorite if it ran better.			"

Early Access Review
								When I first looked into this game, I had thought that it would immense fun. I love high fantasy games but this one is a disappointment even with my positively biased views for Medieval games. The servers and connection between player and server is a huge problem. I had even tried it with 4 Mbps connection and I had a ping of around abouts 500. Not only that but if there is only just a single person on the server with you, lag jumps through the roof and will most often end up just logging you saying no connection to server. Now as for game mechanics, I would absolutely love to write a review for that however all my time in this game has been trying to at least get on a server without having a♥♥♥♥♥♥connection. I wish I could have a refund however the time limit expired months ago. Now im just stuck with an unplayable game in my library.			"

								What can I say... the game in itself had potential but at the end of the day has failed greatly on many fronts. The biggest being the consistent cheating / hacking / exploiting regardless of how many attempts the DEVS made to try and reduce it. The only way to play this game is on a dedicated server with a consistant population and ""good"" admin team. Although even then, the bulk of the private servers were filled with countless abusive admins. Just another feather in the cap that helped break this game to virtually zero. That's why the mass majority of us went to other and much more better survival style games such as ARK and 7DtD. You can look over the RoK forums and see for yourself how there's pratically zero activity for months barring a handful of new posts with zero to a few responses. Combine that with very little active DEV support and you have the perfect recipe for a slum game. Many will find this review ""funny"" but the numbers and forums don't lie. Go get 7DtD and find a good modded server (many out there) or get some fun with ARK. Hell even go back to RUST before even considering to buy this game.			"

												I bought this game because it had a lot of potential. However, PVP and hackers killed this game. PVP players doesn't seem to see any difference between PVP and PVE, so PVP players invades PVE servers all the time, destroying (every time) your base in the process. Also, hackers does. It is almost near impossible to log off, even for a few hours and come back to an instact base. Guaranteed you were looted, against most server rules out there. SO, i gave it a last shot, and rented my own personal server. hackers found it and destroyed my castle, leaving a single clue they came, a sign, that said that my home wasn't strong enough. It wasn't built to be the strongest, it was built to have fun.http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/297608265447115866/31659AB27422A6BB4AE75C4FC533C83AAB260E01/If I even had the opportunity to defend it, but no, I logged back on to a sign, the entire castle was gone.

												Game is fantastic. The community is cancer. Don't get this game unless you have A LOT of friends because the community on many servers are absolutely garbage. Alone, without people, the game is fun, so if you want to play build'em'up then by all means, but if you intend to PvP, or even so much as COMMUNICATE with other players on this game, do yourself a favor and just skip this game. I realize its not the developers problem for cancerous communities, but its still a BIG part of online gameplay and for that, this game has been uninstalled from my list.			"

Early Access Review
								Do you feel the need for a lobotomy? Buy Reign of Kings. This tire-fire of a game is truly one of the most horrific, poorly thought out, ill conceived, astonishingly poorly executed games on steam. My buddies convinced me to buy this game when it first came out as alpha. Since survival games were the rage of 2015, and having had some fun with others, I felt I'd give it a try (Day Z, H1Z1 -- which are not even close to great games, but at least were fun for a bit). Literally would have enjoyed burning a 20 dollar bill in my hand. I know that is usually a hyperbolic statement, but, seriously, that would have been more enjoyable than giving a cent to this game and its creators. From the beggining: -The worst hit boxes in any video game I have ever played. Ever. Spears stick out of enemies feet from their bodies, but if you swing a club at an enemy and it visible goes through them, guess what? You missed. Learning this defunct combat system is akin to learning sandskrit.... blindfolded.-If you like a gaming community rife with hackers, this is your game. The amount of hacking ingame makes H1Z1's hacking woahs seem like childsplay. Seriously, your base will be hacked by time you finish heating up that Hot-Pocket. -The doors. Oh, for the love of God, the doors. I @#$% you not, the doors, when closing them, will pull you back into your structure and lock you inside. It is a @$#%^%^@# artform to close those doors. If the secret to immortality and infinite wealth was behind a reign of kings door, you'd die young and poor.-Even if your base isn't hacked, don't worry, they are unimagineably easy to break into and have everything stolen from them. But let's be real, it was likely just hacked.-Did I mention the combat? Oh, I did? It is so @#$%@!% terrible it needs a second mention how bad it is. LAST BUT NOT LEAST: I tried loading this game to see if this s!@# storm of a game had any improvements made on it. As if I could salvage the 29.4 hours i wasted on this game, and maybe get some value. Nope.Blue Screened my computer upon load. Do Not Buy Reign of Kings. I promise. I guarantee. I ensure. You will regret it.  "

Early Access Review
								If you're looking for an alternative to Rust, this is your game. Although I am usually against purchasing Early Access games, I couldn't resist this one. The crafting is incredibly in depth and you can most definitely survive as a new spawn quite easily. Character customization is hilarious considering what you can do you them (i.e huge jacked legs w/ T-rex arms).My one issue with this game is that it was made by the same people who kickstarted their first game ""Starforge"" on IndieGoGo quite a few years ago. They've pretty much abandoned that game and are ""officially releasing"" it soon dispite it clearly not being done. I did however contact them regarding this concern and they offered to refund the initial purchase of Starforge (although I declined) and gave me an extra RoK key.Personally, this game is worth the purchase despite it being Early Access. They are updating the game regularly, server stability improves weekly, and the game is genuinely a fun time. To rap it up here's the review:PROS:- Character Customization usually results in tons of laughs- In depth crating system- Progession does not feel forced or grindy- Customer service/ Support are very cooperative when voicing concern with their previous gameCONS:- Made by the same people who never finished their IndieGoGo campaign ""StarForge""- Hackers are rampant- No incentive to not KoS - Server Stability is terrible right now			"

												i once loved this game .. to the moon and back . It had soo much potential . and no its just.. its just.. poop . the only real way to play this game is to play on private servers now . public are either dead or too many hackers and alot of chinese people sometimes lol . even then all they did was slap the finished label on this game when there were soo much to still be fixed , RIP reign of kings. you were once a great game in the beginning . :(			"

												Hello everyone, i hope this review can explain what this game is all about and help someone to chose to buy or not, I've been playing this game since alpha 4, i would say this game was 11/10 from alpha 17 to alpha 22, the game was insane, best team survivle/crafting game on steam, big medeaval wars, rainding bases had secrets like were you should hit a door with a balista to take it down with 10 shots, alpha twenty something they changed the game completly they removed raiding fun, they added crouch, changed the damadge of weapons, they completly destroid rainding and changed a lot pvp for the worst, at pvp crouch was ok, but the diferent damadges kinda was bad, people were trained to kill with their best weapons and it changed their plans completly... I am soo sad the devs completly destroied this game with stupid unecessary updates instead of focusing in fixing bugs and performance, you guys are a♥♥♥♥♥♥team with a legendary survivle game idea, you destroied the game i loved and spent 700 hours of my life in 6 months when the game was awesome, guys, being honest, i dont think you sould buy this game if you are looking for that amazing survivle medieval game rok used to be, thoe, still good crafting and building almost didn't got toutched, only now its easier to survive because of the updates to raiding you dont need iron gates and complex building ideas to survive to treb wars and balista raiding, thoe, game is dead too, only few servers working good i would say another 10 months and the game is dead 100%, hope my experience share was usefull.

												Okay, so this review is after the R8 Update, I've been playings since the R4 update, andlet me just say this.The Dev's Ran with our money, all of it, every piece, and basically gave no ♥♥♥♥s for this game. So, pros v. consPro's:- Can build castles-can RP pretty wellcons: -Graphics leave something to be desired -Hit registration is something god awful -Not enough content to be a decent games. -Only 2 vanilla maps -Development has basically been ""finished""(not anywhere close)The devs have abandoned this game after the R7 update, considering it to have, full release. With no intention of adding anything else, which this game needs, a lot more work is needed with this game.Update R8 Broke netcode and servers after which they put out a small hotfix, and then abandoned it again after the Twitch community left the game, again.

												good sides of the game:2 maps, and much variation.Mechanics are Easy to understand.You can meet many funny and symphatical people.Not so many bugsBad sides:Korean raiders, unless you play on a ping limited server, korean raiders will use the lag to kill you and do things like teleporting and such.Doors, they are the most dangerous things in the game, they will kill you very often.Grinding, you will have to spend the whole day grinding and building and collecting, but in the morning when you log on again, your house will probably be looted and destroyed. Even though you built top tier walls.People. this game is  full of people that just want to destroy your happines, they wont talk, but try to kill you if they are better armed than you, sometimes people`s goal will be to hunt you down, for no good reason. And normally they will succeed, because you are stuck, or some other bugs happens.The Combat system: Horrible, people are telerporting and freezing, I somtimes freeze myself, so people manage to run me down... It is horrible and unplayable.Some people think that chasing you while you are naked is worth it even if it takes 15 min.... ¨Servers without KOS often gets bugs and sometimes are just totally destroyed.The lag, will make it impossible to chase down someone, and impossible to get away when being chased, the lag has always worked against me, whatever the situation is..The korean raiders, and the KOSers are destroying my game experience on any server I have tried, it just isn`t possible to enjoy the game if anyone better armed than you will chase you, whatever time it will take... if you dont like spending your whole life on a game, consider not buying this, it will require that you don`t sleep for the first 3 days on a server, and dont think that this is a social game, the only conversations with others you will have will be like : "" pls dont kill"" ""mercy"" or ""No""If the community gets better, and I dont get killed everytime I try to get to my house after spawned after being killed, I will change my opinion, I am just not able to get any happpines from it this way...

												I really do like this game but unfortunatly, if you have your own dedicated server, be prepared to go bald with rage. (well, at least i almost did)If you're the kind of person to just join a server then great! you'll have lots of fun....until a server wipe is required and then you'll lose EVERYTHING!If you're the kind of person to host your own server or rent one then great! you'll have lots of fun with the admin commands, creating your roleplay world....until a server wipe is required.I was hoping that when they released the game, the server wipes would stop....Did they? i hear you ask.

Early Access Review
								TL;DR AT THE BOTTOMA good game with potential to be great, Reign of Kings offers an engaging medievel survival experience with a fair amount of depth already while its still in alpha. The game when fully fleshed out, has the potential imo to provide hours upon hours of fun akin to the type of experiences you would find in rust/dayz type communites albeit with less ♥♥♥♥ery. Thats not to say that this game has some flaws (which are to be expected in alpha) so for the sake of lists and lists alone (You know you like pros and cons bullet points in our reviews, you know you do!) I shall provide a brief list of Pros and Cons from MY perspective.PROS-Best Character Creation menu EVER!!! (I would seriously pay 5 bucks for a dlc that let me use the same system in this game on ANY game with character creation. Now the reason why I like it is very polarizing but I'll just state it simply; You can make your guy look ♥♥♥♥ing wierd beyond imagination. Remember 2K15's Face Scan Glitch? Picture that but the WHOLE body is your playground, if you haven't seen pictures of what Im talking about just google it and thank me later)-SUPER SMALL DL for how much stuff is already in the game, when I first dl'ed it was under 1gb (its more or exactly 1gb due to patches last time i checked)-Fairly Responsive Dev Team (Had one night where we saw 2 patches within a few hours of each other, they were extremly similar in what they fixed but it still shows they are earnest in their attempts to find all the kinks and what not)-Potential for an awesome RP experience (I suggest private or whitelisted servers, public servers it is nigh impossible to engage in rp or lite rp without sustaining small to severe raids up to having your whole base, blocks and all taken)-Potential for awesome PVP (Right now the game consists of several classes of swords axes warhammers bows crossbows javelins and varies other trinkets to maim and dismember your prey whether youre going for the kill or just to break his legs so you can rope him up easily and take him to your happy shack, and yes you will make a happy shack as I like to call it this game, filled with all the torture devices you can need for catching a leatherclad theif nicking your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also you can parry and feint and use 3 different types of strike for each melee weapon. SOMEWHAT similar to M&B or Chivalry)-Potential for amazing buildings (Has no upper limit to building as far as I know, built a tower on one server so high we timed it at 33 seconds to impact when jumping from the top. You can on rp servers mostly, build large complex towns through proper coordination and what not.)-Fairly engaging soundtrack (The soundtrack is very similar at somepoints to Skyrim the only problem being it plays sporadically at what seems to be random intervals, sometimes I hear music every 30 mins, sometimes its 10, sometimes it 2 hours etc.)CONS-Public servers can become riddled with hackers and griefers and even community servers that are not password protected or require you to be whitelisted can fall prey to these jackasses.-Limited material and structures to build with. (7 Tiers of material to make your base out of ranging anywhere from thatch,wood, reinforced iron, and stone being the highest tier currently. Also unless you rotate stairs or ramps there is no way to round out structures without resorting to the previous mentioned method, which is time consuming and often fatal if you are building high up. The game has half a dozen or so different lights, lanterns, lamps, candles, and torches to choose from when lighting up your humble viking raiding camp or peaceful cooking village. There are a handful of crafting stations each with there own set of upgrades that can produce anything from crests to claim land, steel armor for your warriors to defend their holy god emperor king lord, all manner of weapons, lockpicks, ropes, shackles, whips, trebuchets etc. The torture stations they have in the game are fairly limited so far but extremley rewarding when you do manage to throw someone in one, they consist of fun toys like guillotines, pillorys, gallows etc. There is A LOT of stuff for such a small DL and for an early release as well so I won't list them all.)-Unbalanced PVP (Right now most servers consist of midget fetus monsters with t rex arms running around with weapons twice the size of them kneecapping everyone of normal stature and just being an all around menace because, although the headshots are easier to score on these berserker offspring of the midget king napoleon, thats ONLY if you can hit the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Not to mention hitboxes are horrible in this game compounded with lag and the to be expected bugs from alpha makes most matches a toss up, even if you're decked out in steel you can find yourself beaten to death and dismemberd by man in a thong wielding a deer leg.)-Server rollbacks/crashes can set your charcter back 2 mins or a few hours, I've had friends say it set them back by a full day but I cannot confirm that)-Game in its current state can become somewhat repetitive without engaging PVP/RP (After 50 hours in and being the king on a server where we built a nigh impenetrable gate, I found myself envying the peasants me and my men tortured and harassed for so long, manually collecting taxes or leading werewolfs or bears into their open houses, making them fight in death pits etc, because I was trapped in this iron fortress which is really just a giant guy made of stone who appears to be knighting another giant guy made of stone, while the wretched little curs were free to roam the countryside picking flax and flowers or blowing obnoxiously on their wretched horns or flutes, I had to always be on my guard leaving my fortress for as King you were always a target. So I switched servers and started and savage camp with my friends where we only wore wooden armor and used javelins and bows and shouted incomprehensible phrases at passerby before savagely...well savaging them. I suggest whenever you're feeling tired with the game to switch servers or just rebuild your base under a theme like ""vikings, or traveling merchants, or slavers"" whatever! just to keep you in the game until the devs start pumping out the really good stuff-The land is extremly small, to run from one end to the other takes about 7 mins so if you're coming from jogging simulator I mean DayZ then you might be put off or find this to your liking, hopefully they expand and add more stactic objects and possibly NPCS to interact with. Maybe a safe zone to do trading who knows.)TL;DR This game has the potential to thrust itself firmly into the upper echelons of survival base building type games, but that all depends on the devs and their ability to push out fun and challenging new content and get rid of the hackers while also allowing a way for players to moderately their own communities without need of an Admin on 24/7. They also need to desperately update the admin panel because as it stands right now with explosive kegs being disabled, admin have no reliable way of removing objects or blocks placed down to grief someone other then using a trebuchet like a normal player. With all that being said this purchase should give you a few hundred hours if you're into medievel♥♥♥♥♥♥ torture, slavery, and base building survival genres.			"

								When I bought this game in early alpha it was great fun. I started on a server with a low amount of players and some became addicted to the game. Bashing trees, building towers, killing animals ( I said I'd take revenge you stupid bear! ), some pvp from time to time and even starting a guild. In the early alpha it was pretty easy to go from noob to hero, I didnt mind that at all since everytime you go offline for longer then 3 days you've got to pretty much restart and re-do everything. I had a great time and had a little guild with some new friends I made. But the fun decreased every update, restarting from the bottom became harder and harder until it was nearly impossible to get starting on your own. This game is fun, but the amount of time it takes to start and get into the fun stuff takes too long and everytime you get close someone will beat you up and make you have to restart all over again. But this isnt the only bad thing, there are tons of little glitches, sometimes they even kill you!!The PvP is very very laggy, its so laggy that its not skill based whenever you win, nope its based on the amount of lagg and luck you get.I honestly was looking forward to play this game, but after all these things, I'm not enjoying the game anymore.Too bad it had to end like this.

												The only reason I own this is I got it before the new refund policy without checking who made it. I got it, played it for a few hours, thought it felt very familiar, then looked and saw that it was Codehatch. Nothing I could do about it, so I played it some to try to get my money's worth.If you are a survival game addict, go ahead and get it. It's got basebuilding, crafting, endless gathering, building a base and losing it to Asian hackers or little kids while you're at work or in bed sleeping, etc. Some neat stuff, etc. It looks pretty good, but is, as with most Unity projects, pretty badly optimized. Don't recommend.			"

												This game was a fun diversion from other games for a little while, before I realized that being a person who likes to build means that you're dreams and hopes will get crushed quicker than your character's skull in this while you're sleeping.Rampant with trolls and hackers, and not only that it seems to be... kind of dead.  Feels like it needs more balancing, more stuff, and more... thought.  But that's likely not going to happen, so I'm rating this poorly as I can't say I'd want to convince my friends to join me in this punishment.			"

You will litterally do this exactly:1: Spawn in and run around like an idiot till you figure out the controls2: Grab random stuff and try to make a makeshift house.3: Get off for the night after building a small house and own this little nice plot of land.4: Get back on later only to find you're home has been raided.5: Get better at the game and build a giant castle that can't be destroyed other than seige engines.6: Have a small empire that you're really happy about with either a friend or not.7: Get off after aquiring a large sum of materials, weapons, armour ect.8: Get back on only to find another faction that owns most of the land has taken you over just because they can. No reason necessary. They just did it. They like you, but they still did it anyway. Even tho you're friends as well. Nope still gone. All that work, time, effort. To be rewarded with a swift 20 min raid of you're entire base. Taken over. Sure, thats the game. And some might find it fun. But no matter what. Even if you try to be friendly? Nope. You're dead. So If you're the type that doesn't like the idea of having all you're work taken away from you in a matter of minutes because somebody simply can because they are better than you? Don't get it. Otherwise? Go ahead. Be one of those guys. I'm sure its great.This game has a simple plotline. Start game, find place, build home, store resources, lose them all, restart. Don't want that? Don't buy this. Sorry devs, but if you want a good review? Make it more challenging to crush somebody. Other than break one block and get all you're♥♥♥♥♥♥stolen and home destroyed.			"

												This game is not worth you're time and neither the money, so instead of buying the game, here is how to make Ramen Noodles which is way better then this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥PREPARATIONTo make baked soda: Spread a half-cup of baking soda on a foil-lined sheet pan. Pop it in a 250°F oven or toaster oven for 1 hour. Store extra baked soda in a jar with a lid indefinitely.Put the warm water in a large mixing bowl. Dissolve 4 teaspoons of the baked soda in it, then add the cold water. Add the flour, stirring and mixing to form a crumbly, pebbly alliance—not exactly a nice dough.Turn that crumbly dough out onto a work surface. Knead it together, working the dough for 5 full minutes. (It will be a tougher sparring partner than any flour dough you’ve ever tried to make.) Wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest at room temperature for 20 minutes, then knead for another 5 minutes. (You will curse and sweat.) Rewrap the dough and put it in the fridge for at least 1 hour.Divide the dough into five or six portions. Roll each portion out using a pasta machine (Italian-made is fine). Progress through the thickness settings one by one. The final thickness of the noodles is up to you, as is the width and shape into which you cut them. I like taking the dough to the second-thinnest setting, then either finely hand-cutting them or cutting them through the finer of the two cutters that came with my machine. Keep the noodles well floured to prevent them from sticking.Cook the noodles in a deep pot with plenty of water. Noodles cut on the thinnest setting will only need two and a half or three minutes to cook. Check the noodles regularly while they’re cooking; if they stick together, rinse them under cold water immediately after straining them from the pot to stop the cooking and rinse off any excess starch.

												I feel very sad for giving this game a negative review, because I actually was starting to get addicted  to it and was having a blast playing this with my friends on a private server. What killed this game for me? It was not the bugs, the lack of certain features that I found crucial like let's say being able to put furniture on other objects, ladders, capes, more mythical creatures. It's the devs. If any of the devs is reading this, I want you to know that you have something special here. And I am puzzled on how you can just abandon such a goldmine. I have spent 40 hours in this game only, one of my best friends has spent over 100 hours and the other recently spent 20 euros on your game. We were having a lot of fun and roleplayed with our clan, until today, when we reset the server because the game was having constant mini-dc's. The server admin had a backup, but the only thing the backup did was reloading the building blocks...and apparently this is a bug that the devs said was fixed in the last hotfix.Every furniture everyone built, all the hundres of thousands of iron, rocks, wood, lumber, wool, leather, balistas, EVERYTHING was gone. This murdered our motivation to continue our story and we LITERALLY lost many hours of lives which we will never get again.All those hours, the pain of gathering and the joy of creating, just gone in the void. Along with all our money for a game where the devs just don't seem to care about their own game nor the community that sees the potential in it.Don't buy this game, you will get hurt, your heart will get broken.

But even at 5 dollars right now during the christmas sale you wouldn't get your moneys worth. The developers are complete scum, the game is completely broken and filled with cheats.			"

The combat is great, the building (while it can be clunky) is great. The gameplay is great. At least, it was. Until people figured out how to get around the practically non existent anti cheats. Now it doesn't matter how big, and thick your walls are. They'll just walk right through them and take all of your♥♥♥♥♥♥ The play base is practically stagnant. 400 people online on average.

												I've played this game for quite a while, stopped and started again quite a few times, co-owned a popular server, experienced almost every aspect of the game, and while a lot of this game has charm and serves a purpose to those that love medieval themed games. The overall execution of the game is terrible, I recently came back from months of not playing after they stopped adding features to the game, in the hopes that the optimization of the game would have improved. Sadly however, I returned to the same old unfinished game, the game that let me down from such a promising start. The lag on official and community servers is unbearable in combat. On community servers, PvP usually lags when a lot of people are online, which is supposed to be a time when the game is most exciting. The game is overall, pretty terrible, and the company should honestly stop making games until they learn what finishing and perfecting a game actually means.			"

Thats until the reign of kings devs had a better idea, lets give up on the game mid way and leave with the money like our previous game. I really wish the devs had continued on with this game instead of letting it die of because i would still be enjoying it today.So sadly im gonna give this game a thumbs down and hope that one day the devs will bring this game back to life or maybe some other devs will try to make a game similar.

												Well, it's been almost a year since a quit the game, and only now am I writing a review. The first time I heard of this game was while I was going through my steam quene, and saw the game. It looked cool, and I had played chivalry, but for whatever reason, I didn't add it to my wishlist. some time later (a few weeks, I believe), I was trying to find the game, so I could buy it, but I couldn't remember it's name. Eventually, I finally found it, bought it, and installed it, then soon joined a server. I got on, and was a complete noob. I asked where to find flax, and people told me there was a magical island... I turned to google and quickly found flax. While I was wandering through the woods, I came across some people, and they seemed nice, until one pulled out a rope. I didn't know how ropes worked, so I stood there, and got roped. They proceeded to restrain me and kick me to death. 5/7, would be a complete n00b again.But all that aside, I really want to like this game. I seeked it out because it sounded so cool, and I loved the concept. Since I bought the game, there have been no updates adding anything new, only ""bug fixes"" and ""hack prevention"" (I checked the news for the game bfore writing this, just to confirm). The community is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's always people going around who KOS people, and somehow never get beat in PVP. There's always one guild on each server that hacks like ♥♥♥♥ , and is super huge, and 90% full of ♥♥♥♥ing 8 year olds, who just KOS and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then there's a bunch of renegade people, who hide in the woods and KOS. Then, there's small guilds that KOS, and never get attacked by the Big Guild. Also, just to make it all worse, you can barely even defend yourself in PVP from these people because the game is so laggy. Not to mention they always have full steel, and I only ever have wood, if anything. For the most part, it's the community that make the game♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you play on the right community server, the game sometimes doesn't have the problems with the community, but it lags so much worse. Then again, my internet isn't that great. But everybody complains about the lag. If you play on a public server, there's not much lag, but everybody will KOS, I guarentee it. Of course, there are those special snowflakes like me who just wanna be peaceful, but still. Now, just to add to my rant, I'll complain about grinding and griefing. So... it's late at night, and you've been grinding all day, gathering wood, stone, iron, etc. You have your base all secured, and all your iron is smelting into steel, and everything's just fine. So, you find a safe place, log off, and go to sleep. You wake up the next day, log on, and see the dreaded ""you died"" screen, where it circles your dead body, and shows your destroyed base in the background. To make it worse, the ""respawn in bed"" box is greyed out. You respawn at the beach (a few times, because ♥♥♥♥ing KOSers in the woods), and get to where your base was. It's all gone. Only a few random blocks. Your chests are emptied of all their valubles. Then you quit for a few days and start again. Overall, I can't reccommend the game. It has a great concept, but a♥♥♥♥♥♥game and♥♥♥♥♥♥community. Maybe I'm just a little ♥♥♥♥♥, but I wasted 100 hours in this game, only to learn what would happen in real life if anarchy became a thing. Here's my ratings:1/7 gamewise0/7 community-wise5/7 medieval anarchy simulator, but some people are gods and can hack.			"

												I played this game for a long time now. To be honest, the developers stated themselves that they would continue to fix exploits/bugs/and hacks. They do not plan to release anymore 'fun' or 'new' content. This team of developers have the reputaion of not finishing, and sticking by their games. Over all, was a good game. It is not going anywhere though. A better alternative would be ARK Survival, or RUST simply because their Dev teams are amazing and is ALWAYS comming out with new content. Its sad to see this game go, but it looses my support. RIP ROK, Now lets watch it die.			"

												First off this thing says i should be polite? Hell no. I don't care. Don't get this game. Ever. This game will ruin you're hopes and dreams. You will litterally do this exactly:1: Spawn in and run around like an idiot till you figure out the controls2: Grab random stuff and try to make a makeshift house.3: Get off for the night after building a small house and own this little nice plot of land.4: Get back on later only to find you're home has been raided.5: Get better at the game and build a giant castle that can't be destroyed other than seige engines.6: Have a small empire that you're really happy about with either a friend or not.7: Get off after aquiring a large sum of materials, weapons, armour ect.8: Get back on only to find another faction that owns most of the land has taken you over just because they can. No reason necessary. They just did it. They like you, but they still did it anyway. Even tho you're friends as well. Nope still gone. All that work, time, effort. To be rewarded with a swift 20 min raid of you're entire base. Taken over. Sure, thats the game. And some might find it fun. But no matter what. Even if you try to be friendly? Nope. You're dead. So If you're the type that doesn't like the idea of having all you're work taken away from you in a matter of minutes because somebody simply can because they are better than you? Don't get it. Otherwise? Go ahead. Be one of those guys. I'm sure its great.This game has a simple plotline. Start game, find place, build home, store resources, lose them all, restart. Don't want that? Don't buy this. Sorry devs, but if you want a good review? Make it more challenging to crush somebody. Other than break one block and get all you're♥♥♥♥♥♥stolen and home destroyed.			"

												This game is not worth you're time and neither the money, so instead of buying the game, here is how to make Ramen Noodles which is way better then this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥PREPARATIONTo make baked soda: Spread a half-cup of baking soda on a foil-lined sheet pan. Pop it in a 250°F oven or toaster oven for 1 hour. Store extra baked soda in a jar with a lid indefinitely.Put the warm water in a large mixing bowl. Dissolve 4 teaspoons of the baked soda in it, then add the cold water. Add the flour, stirring and mixing to form a crumbly, pebbly alliance—not exactly a nice dough.Turn that crumbly dough out onto a work surface. Knead it together, working the dough for 5 full minutes. (It will be a tougher sparring partner than any flour dough you’ve ever tried to make.) Wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest at room temperature for 20 minutes, then knead for another 5 minutes. (You will curse and sweat.) Rewrap the dough and put it in the fridge for at least 1 hour.Divide the dough into five or six portions. Roll each portion out using a pasta machine (Italian-made is fine). Progress through the thickness settings one by one. The final thickness of the noodles is up to you, as is the width and shape into which you cut them. I like taking the dough to the second-thinnest setting, then either finely hand-cutting them or cutting them through the finer of the two cutters that came with my machine. Keep the noodles well floured to prevent them from sticking.Cook the noodles in a deep pot with plenty of water. Noodles cut on the thinnest setting will only need two and a half or three minutes to cook. Check the noodles regularly while they’re cooking; if they stick together, rinse them under cold water immediately after straining them from the pot to stop the cooking and rinse off any excess starch.

												I feel very sad for giving this game a negative review, because I actually was starting to get addicted  to it and was having a blast playing this with my friends on a private server. What killed this game for me? It was not the bugs, the lack of certain features that I found crucial like let's say being able to put furniture on other objects, ladders, capes, more mythical creatures. It's the devs. If any of the devs is reading this, I want you to know that you have something special here. And I am puzzled on how you can just abandon such a goldmine. I have spent 40 hours in this game only, one of my best friends has spent over 100 hours and the other recently spent 20 euros on your game. We were having a lot of fun and roleplayed with our clan, until today, when we reset the server because the game was having constant mini-dc's. The server admin had a backup, but the only thing the backup did was reloading the building blocks...and apparently this is a bug that the devs said was fixed in the last hotfix.Every furniture everyone built, all the hundres of thousands of iron, rocks, wood, lumber, wool, leather, balistas, EVERYTHING was gone. This murdered our motivation to continue our story and we LITERALLY lost many hours of lives which we will never get again.All those hours, the pain of gathering and the joy of creating, just gone in the void. Along with all our money for a game where the devs just don't seem to care about their own game nor the community that sees the potential in it.Don't buy this game, you will get hurt, your heart will get broken.

I think in total there have been less than 10 updates? It's a complete joke. I'm not complaining, I got my 20 dollars worth at the start when the game was thriving because it was new and exciting. But even at 5 dollars right now during the christmas sale you wouldn't get your moneys worth. The developers are complete scum, the game is completely broken and filled with cheats.			"

However, only 500 people still play, hackers still exist, development is painfully slow and a toxic community still exists in almost every server. I'd recommend to get the game if you were to run a server with friends, or the price was significantly reduced. Conclusively, because of the declining playerbase and low rate of updates I have to say that I wouldn't recommend this game anymore.			"

												I liked the game; RP aspects with friends are fun and you can wage fun wars against rival tribes. However, only 500 people still play, hackers still exist, development is painfully slow and a toxic community still exists in almost every server. I'd recommend to get the game if you were to run a server with friends, or the price was significantly reduced. Conclusively, because of the declining playerbase and low rate of updates I have to say that I wouldn't recommend this game anymore.			"

												Yes this game is sort of dead but just because you cant get into a server with more than 20 people doesnt make it a bad game. The pvp, building, community, and raiding are all amazing. They might not update the game but thats just leaving the old days and you wont have to get used to something different.			"

Fix the performance and the game will be great to play with friends.			"

								I want to recommend this game. But I can't. It has a lot of great features that i'm not even going to cover because there is no point in doing so. It's another crafting game that puts way too much emphasis on focusing people into a PvP situation. Want to build a base that looks like awsome fortress? Ok. Go ahead and pour hours into this game trying to do so and you will be rewarded with defeat in the end. Whether your structures are big or small someone will want to break it, and this usually will happen while you are logged out and your character is asleep with gear on its person in said base. Oh that's right, you log out and your avatar will be lying there waiting for someone to just beat it into a bloody mess and take all your gear. This game has no system in place to reward players for friendly play and it is eventually in the end causing players to kill each other for reasons such as ""I'm bored, and you were there."". Recently hackers have been making the game even more difficult with Fly Mode, Speed Hacks, Invisibility, and Duping Monsters in mass just to name a few. The developer made some headway against this with one good update, but as of the day I typed this up I saw these hacks being used in game again with no penalty to the user. I am going to say that I am probably one negative comment in a sea of positives, and I will say check out other comments on this game before making your decision to play this game. But my experience of this game has been mostly negative and I cannot currently recommend it.			"

								Be and some friends spent several hours building a huge base, made from the best materials. Then some russians came, using hacks, and destroyed it all in the matter of seconds. They were able to teleport through the walls, kill us from the inside, flying in the air throwing javelins - simply making it impossible for us to defend. When they finally let us alone, some other russians came, not hacking, but using the previous hackers damage to enter our base, and thereafter steal everything. My recommendation is to NOT buy this game, until the devs has fixed the hackers issue - cos like us, you risk building for hours, only to lose it all in a matter of few minuttes, because someone think it is alot more fun to ruin the game, rather than to actually play it.

												Dont buy this game, end of story. Reasons why? Combat is a huge part in this game and in my whole 30 somethings hours I played of this game it was always the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ Get killed by a fresh spawn with a wooden club whilst wearing reasonable armor and equipped with a decent weapon. No I'm not blaming the game just because I'm crap at it but because even with decent gear I cant seem to hit my opponent what so ever because the game is so so so SO poorly optimized, the combat is absoulety atrocious and it lags like you wouldnt believe. This was not due to my internet either, I always played on local servers with less then 50 ping and my computer could more than happily handle this game on high quality even though I played it on low settings to see whether my computer being able to run the game was the problem or not...turns out it wasnt. Your Life in the game? Cut trees, place a couple blocks to construct the foundation to your new home then get killed like the message above or get carried away on a rope to be laughed at by some twelve year olds and get your head decapitated..............................................................................................................................................

								This game has the potential to be oh so much fun. However, in it's current state I can't reccomend. You can dedicate yourself to a server with active admins and have a blast; however, when one cheater sneaks through they will ruin everything you have spent hours working for. Without any type of cheat protection this game is unplayable. I have a feeling this game is going to turn into another Rust. Buy if you have a group of people that can play together on a private server. Do not buy if you plan to play on anything else. Bought 4 copies for my friends and I and regret it at this time. Feels like money wasted when you are cheated out of a gaming experience and fun due to hackers everywhere. The client is also so easily modded that I have a feeling this game may be near impossible to stop cheaters. You've been warned.			"

								Let me start with what is likely a great disservice to the game, but something I think needs to be said early.This game is okay if you like the basic concept, but it is really only as good as the folks you play it with.There is a great deal of depth for what is essentially Rust with a much more in-depth crafting system.  The UI shares a lot in common with that other game, and the general resource gathering aspect will feel very familiar to those that have played both.But that is where the comparison ends.I was hesitant to jump in on this one as I had played both flavors of that other game, and a few others games like it, and was expecting the same general type of community.  I'm not going to lie, yes, you'll encounter a few of those folks here as well, but the sheer scope of this game and the community at large, to me, more than makes up for any aspects of PVP that may have you not wanting to jump in on this one.Building crafting is a free formed ""cubed"" based with multiple material types and a is a tiered progression tied to your crafting equipment (workstations).  As you improve those workstations, you gain access to better stuff to make, very straight forward and simple to get started in.Early game is about survival, mid-to-later game play is fortifying, and all of it builds up to trying to take (or defend) the crown for the kingdom.While yes, you'll run into those folks who simply want to watch the world burn, you'll also encounter those who want to achieve something more, and this game allows both to reside mostly side-by-side, while allowing you the convenience to play (mostly) how you like.Just keep in mind, at its heart, this is a PVP game that is really focused on the group vs. group mechanics, and there is no solo player mode without hosting your own private server.  So you can play solo if you really want, but you're honestly missing out on more than 50% of the game doing so.			"

												I absolutely loved playing this game but the server wipes really did squeeze all the enjoyment out of playing. I was really hoping that after R.O.K was out of early access, that the developers would find a better way to do their updates without server wipes. Unfortunately this is not the case, hours of building just to be wiped. Big or small updates always seem to need a server wipe.The Ark however is a similar game but with Dinosaurs and a lot of big updates, yet they never seem to need to wipe their servers.I've been cracking out to play this game, waiting on how they handled their new update and yet again a server wipe.If you don't mind all your hard work being wiped then it's a good game, but for me i'm disappointed with their severs.I would recommed this game, but sever wipes make me say no.

												I love the game, and these are my reasons why.You need to one, find a good enough server to play on, yes there are a quite a lot of hackers on offical servers that no one cares to do anything about. I recomend to join a community server with good active admin, and become a part of the community.Now on to the game itself This game has the normal 3 stage crafting such as early game, mid game, and of course late game. I love all of these stages and usually all games that have these systems usually do well. Theres different base teirs which can add hours of gameplay to the game, plus playing with buddies adds it that much more.you can raid, build castles, destroy castles, become a king, kidnap, kill the king, break out of a prison, and hunt Why does that not sound fun?Most peoples response to this question is that ""it's Code}{atch"" they've given up on another game.My answer to that is no.. ♥♥♥♥ you because yes they don't update the game with new content very often but they do update it with bug fixes and nerfs and buffs anything a normal game needs. Theres enough content to play for hundreds of hours, and when you're done play another game and start this one again later in time.			"

 Game Pros:	-The Awesome PVP features-The community.-Building.-Crafting system.-Character Customization Game Cons:	-♥♥♥♥♥♥ DEVS (game has been completely abandoned.)-FPS lag on high population servers (e.g Official Servers)-Occasional glitches.A lot of the reviews on this game i notice are negative however i do see that this tends to be a trend for players with under 10hrs of gameplay. If you want to enjoy yourself when playing the game i highly recommend that you do not play on Official. I find that it is often laggy and has a much worse community than on the Community servers. ]On community servers you usually find much nicer people who usually help you, active admins, and the servers normally include kits which can help you when first starting off.After 100hrs i would strongly recommend this game. I am quite dissapointed that CODEHATCH abandoned this game however nevertheless it is still really enjoyable. "

I'm not going to lie, yes, you'll encounter a few of those folks here as well, but the sheer scope of this game and the community at large, to me, more than makes up for any aspects of PVP that may have you not wanting to jump in on this one.Building crafting is a free formed ""cubed"" based with multiple material types and a is a tiered progression tied to your crafting equipment (workstations).  As you improve those workstations, you gain access to better stuff to make, very straight forward and simple to get started in.Early game is about survival, mid-to-later game play is fortifying, and all of it builds up to trying to take (or defend) the crown for the kingdom.While yes, you'll run into those folks who simply want to watch the world burn, you'll also encounter those who want to achieve something more, and this game allows both to reside mostly side-by-side, while allowing you the convenience to play (mostly) how you like.Just keep in mind, at its heart, this is a PVP game that is really focused on the group vs. group mechanics, and there is no solo player mode without hosting your own private server.  So you can play solo if you really want, but you're honestly missing out on more than 50% of the game doing so.			"

								I have a feeling this game is going to be another one of those early access games that no one will give a crap about in 2 months. I'm not trying to bash the game but I really dont feel like the game is going to do well with the amount of hackers and trolls in the servers. The idea was nice, A medieval sandbox game where people could rp and hold a castle, so on and so forth. Let's be honest, the only reason people play this game is to make ridiculous looking characters and run around being obnoxious/ or hacking.Great idea, meh execution. I'd pass if I was you.			"

								This game has the potential to be oh so much fun. However, in it's current state I can't reccomend. You can dedicate yourself to a server with active admins and have a blast; however, when one cheater sneaks through they will ruin everything you have spent hours working for. Without any type of cheat protection this game is unplayable. I have a feeling this game is going to turn into another Rust. Buy if you have a group of people that can play together on a private server. Do not buy if you plan to play on anything else. Bought 4 copies for my friends and I and regret it at this time. Feels like money wasted when you are cheated out of a gaming experience and fun due to hackers everywhere. The client is also so easily modded that I have a feeling this game may be near impossible to stop cheaters. You've been warned.			"

Early Access Review
								First of all I love this game.  The concept is awesome!  Unfortunately I find it hard to recommend.  It is often described as a medieval RUST.  Having not played RUST I can not say if that is a valid comparison but the reason I have not played RUST is going to be the reason I stop playing Reign of Kings.  In Reign of Kings you find yourself shipwrecked on an island, floating ashore on a tattered raft.  At least this is the implication in the character design screen.  The design of the character has lots of options, is easy to do, and does not take too long to accomplish so a hearty ""Well done!"" there.  There are no female characters as of yet but hopefully that will come.  After all historicly Queens took over countries as well.Once on the island you have a few bandages and torches as well as a piece of wood for a weapon/tool.  You stand on the beach of a new world... at least the first time.  There is no random world generator soafter exploring this world you will quickly learn the locations of everything.  Considering the concept of game I do not readily think random worlds are a good possibility, perhaps multiple maps or a random generator that changes the locations of resources?Regardless from here you must gather and build and climb the tech tree to success!  I have to tell you it is fun if you enjoy these types of games.  There is a unique mechanic here though that changes the gameplay.  This island has a king and this king can and does impose a tax.  The tax is taken automaticly as you gather and hinders your progress.  The tax can be from 0-20% of what you are trying to gather, though only on the most important resources.  If the tax is high those on the server may rise up and overthrow him!  Then establish a new king.  What an AWESOME concept!  There are draw backs though.  There is presently no mechanic that forces structures to be stable... or even possible.  This allows players to build ridiculously high walls, tall one block towers, or bridges in the sky.  This makes it either impossible to protect the ""Tax tree"" or ""Throne"" or impossible to get near it depending on how the games is progressing for you.  It allows those who have been on the server to ""wall off"" resources eliminating the possibility of newer players to EVER progress.  A fix concept is simple though possibly hard to incorporate.  That would be to make things without proper support come crashing to the ground destroying them.  This may force players to actually play the game and make alliances and work together to overthrow a tyrannical king instead of waiting for a relatively empty server and building a skyway to success.  I have also seen players build a wall block ing the tax collection area effectively removing it from all but the strongest/most patient players.  This effectively removes any incentive to be king other then to lower the tax rates on oneself.  Again an easy fix would be to have the area around the ""ancient throne"" be cursed or unstable and create a ""no claim/no build zone"" within it.  This would force the walls to be around a much larger area where there is room for seige equipment to give them hell if they are too tyrannical.The building itself and the tech tree are very well thought out and made.  The placing of block easy enough and a misplaced block is easily picked up and placed proper, though this too leads to a problem.  If an enemy destroys your crest and puts their own up they can effectively steal all your building blocks in a matter of moments.  If you see stations floating in the sky that is exactly what has happened.  :(  A days worth of toil and labor can be destroyed the moment you have to log off for work or sleep and if you are gone more then a day, forget it.  All you have done will be gone.  D:  You will find yourself back to square one with a bunch of levitating work stations as your only benefit for having played before.How to fix this?  :/  Well historicaly parts of old building were taken to make new buildings.  So this concept makes sense.  However the player disassemblnig a built structure should have to work for it.  Blocks placed by a player inside a claim should be mined out by other players, even if claim is destroyed and a new claim attached.  If done improperly parts of the structure could collapse if made unstable injuring or killing the player mining them up.  Falling stations or resources should be destroyed giving no value to the player trying to take them.  It wasn't always easy to recycle which is why ruins exist today.  I think ruined strongholds would be a neat attraction to the game.  Monuments to those who came before and dangerous sources of materials.  :DSpeaking of material resources, they have a neat system of giving them to you.  You cannot mine as in other games, perhaps the islands water table is too high or the ground to unstable for such.  Instead you have renewing nodes similar to World of Warcraft.  Unfortunately since they are in set locations they very well may become camped by stronger players.  This only becomes a big problem with iron.  While there are rock nodes you can also take rock in smaller quantities from the cliff sides all around so you are able to survive without entering the kililng zone where the nodes are.  Iron you have no such luck, the nodes are the only harvestable sorce of it.  You can steal it however, if that is how you play.  I have often been forced into such unhonorable acts as all my stuff had been stolen many times.Fix this by having small iron deposits found around the island similar but perhaps not as plentiful as the stone.Sounds great yes?  So why is it so hard to recommend?Well unless you come with a group of friends and can ensure someone is on at all times.  Days of play can be erased so very easily by other players.  I am not even talking about hacks as I have not personally encountered any hackers though I do hear about them.  If you have never had the gutwrenching feeling of coming home in real life to find your home robbed, you can get that feeling here.  I have seen really cool players who were playing the game as intended and we were having a great time, come on the next day to find they have to start over because their awesome structure is simply gone.  They have sadly quit because who wants to build over and over day after day to have nothing the next day.  It would be awesome if the stringholds were just that.  Perhaps not inpenitrable but at least hard enough to get into that you can log off for a few hours.If you have already established a group of friends or are in a guild you will have a ball playing this game!  If you are part of a private server with a group of friends this game will bring you countless hours of enjoyable playtime!  If you are a single player or a casual player that does not spend a lot of time online then this game has nothing for you.  There is no single player mode or creative mode for the game... or at least as of yet.  The casual player has no place in this game and will only find frustration and annoyance as they find themselves simply prey for established players and unable to play at all.  If you like building and creating this game is not presently for you as your efforts will be destroyed by other players, often for no reason at all.So it is for the groups and guilds that I can completely give it a thumbs up.  The single and creative player may as well look elsewhere.  Unless you are wiling to seek out a guild or server.  :(			"

								I would give this game a positive review, it is enjoyable and I spent many hours playing the game, The concept is GREAT. it gets ME aggravated at times, as other players randomly decide to shackle you and hang you, for no apperant reason, or, simply decide to blow up your building just for the fun of it, and lets say I can live with that even if it would be sort of nice ot have something to drive the players to fight over the thronerather then blowing each other up, while the throne stays vacant, or for a King awaiting eagerly for an epic assault, that will never come.Some thing that really Aggravates me is the HACKERS and CHEATERS, there are a lot of them and they vary from the 1 hit kill to multiplying their resorces. Unless this situation is fixed then it is NOT WORTH PLAYING THE GAME NOR BUYING IT!!!Hopefully, the hacker problem will be dealt with and maybe provide a little incentive for the fight over the throne.Ill update as it goes.

								So far my $20 has been well spent.  I joined a couple of Community servers to start out, and every time would gather/harvest peacefully for 30m or so.  Then I would run into someone and get KoS.Out of frustration I bought a server, made it PvE and advertised as noob-friendly, and now we have a nice friendly server where KoS is not an issue.  True, we have crazies that like to come in and rampage (PvE isn't implemented correctly as it is still possible to kill others) but hey, that's why they invented the blacklist!Everyone appreciates being able to log into a brand-new Alpha game and learn the ropes without being whipped in the stockade within 10 minutes.  As the regular server members evolve in their gameplay, KoS won't be such an issue because they will be better equipped to deal with crazy randoms.  10/10 would buy a noob-friendly server again.			"

								Great great game! No doubt about it. I see people here complaining about various stuff, like hackers or the server wipes. I guess it's different for all of us. I found a server, where i've put in almost 100 hours as i'm writing this, and not one single hacker, has been seen. I might be a lucky one. They are improving the hacker problem, doing what they can, but lot's of games have hacker issues, this one is by no means news. On to the server wipe complaints. This is, i think, a stupid complaint. They have to wipe at some points, if they didn't there'd be abandonded houses all of the place, and some lag because of all the rendering. They are going to put out an update though in a couple of days, that will significantly decrease the amount of wipes done to the servers. But it's really not that bad, you can build yourself a decent house that only siege weapons can get through, in a matter of a few hours. They are working on all these issues!As i said, the game is great! The fun is definately bigger if you play with mates, or befriend people in game. Me and a mate started playing only us, we have a guild of 6 people now, and it's awesome. There's ups and downs all the time, and the combat system is decent. There are bugs in the game, but if you know about them, you can prevent other people from exploiting them against you! This comes with the experience though, and obviously will be fixed soon. I highly recommend this game, if you want a fun medieval sandbox game, with great crafting, and awesome siege mechanics, and a game that has some issues, but by no means make the game unplayable as some reviewers indicate. Get it, go in, and be prepared for all kinds of weird stuff happening, like people trying to recreate the 4th Reich, or a guild of black midgets assaulting you at night, or even people hanging you, or capturing you in cages just for fun. The game really shows the true colors of some peopel! HAVE FUN!			"

												ALBERT SCHLOSS! ALBERT SCHLOSS! I feel like I need to shout this from the rooftops! 5 stars just isn't enough for this place! It is by far one of the best bar/restaurants I have visited in Manchester for a while and I couldn't speak more highly of the friendly staff, warm and welcoming vibe and mouthwatering food, and here's why...SO, I have visited here twice now - the first time just for a quick beverage which I enjoyed and really got a good feel for the atmosphere and bohemian bier palace vibe they're trying to get across. The place is HUGE but you can reserve a table/area with ease and the staff kindly greet you at the door and show you to your seats.The second time I visited was to eat and celebrate my families Christmas! Sure we were already in good spirits but this places definitely lifted them to new heights. We were quickly shown our table which was a nice booth at the back of the bar (slightly to big for a group of 5 but we made it work).The waitresses came over quickly and took our drinks order. My mother and I opted for a bottle of their dry rose. We also asked a few questions about the menu as we weren't familiar with the German terms and again the waitress was polite and answered all our questions with ease. We ordered our food and began to drink our wine. Usually I'm a sweet wine drinker but I really enjoyed their dry rose and would definitely recommend it! Now to the food...Yey! We started by sharing the meatballs, ham and cheese croquets and the tomato and basil flat bread (yes we were hungry).The meatballs you could tell are made fresh as they have that slight crumble to them and are mixed with a real hearty chorizo flavoured sauce. They literally melted in the mouth.Now I know what you're thinking - ham and cheese croquets... Well don't underestimate them. The cheese has a slightly sharp taste and mixed with the ham it's the perfect combo. As you cut into them the inside just poured our. Devine.The flatbread was also a winner - crisp, flavoursome and topping plentiful!I also had a spoonful of Alex's beer and onion soup which was just packed with flavour! A real rich, stew like textured treat. I'd only recommend this however if you're really hungry and it is ridiculously filling and rich - you could have it as main!Now to the mains (by this point we were getting full). I chose the beef house special. My gosh, was it good! The meat literally melted in your mouth and with the compliments of bacon lardons, potato rosti, and pickled cabbage in a red wine sauce it was a dish Albert Schloss should be truly proud of - a taste sensation! I also have my mums pork knuckle a try - SO GOOD! The pork just fell off the bone.We also ordered sides of sweet pot and normal chips which were thin, crispy and yummy. There was actually quite a delay with the chips and when they finally arrives the waitress couldn't apologise more informing us that the waitress had fallen and dropped them so they had to be done again! As an apology they wiped all the sides and the bottle of wine off the bill - what service?!?! As I said at the start I cannot speak highly enough about this German beauty in the heart of Manchester! I urge anyone living or visiting Manchester to give it a try! You won't be disappointed!And to top it all off they have push for prosecco buttons for all those who enjoy a glass of fizz... Or two!

								Don't buy this game.""Oh look, a bug where someone's loot will disappear after they've attempted to craft an item, and the intended item does not appear! Let's NOT release a hotfix that could resolve this issue and instead wait another two weeks until we have some other cool, visual stuff to add to it. At least the loot bags don't spin and the ropes look nicer now. That's definitely the priority over hackers, exploits and bugs.

The company itself has a poor reputation. The company is labeled as a scam company. Many people have put in hours into this game, for only the game to be wiped to scratch. Wasting your time and money. Not one small communication from the developers as to why they are locking servers and wiping without warning or explanation.

								I've had the game for a week now now and was so impressed with the potential of the gameplay that i bought the game and after a few days set up a dedicated server that has become very popular.This is probably more pre-alpha than alpha.The actual content already in the game is good enough to create enough objects to make decent castles and an array of weapons that can be used to siege each others castles. The crafting system is basic but workingGraphically it is pleasant.The world is big enough to cater for a good few playersUnfortunately the optimisation as it stands now will only allow for around 35 players on a decent Zeon\I7 based serverAs can be expected at such an early stage of development  it has bugs, there are obvious massive holes to be plugged in GUI, admin tools, server logging etc and little if any thought seems to have gone into how the game would be played by the masses. Suprisingly though their are few Major game breaking bugs. The majority of problems are caused by kids with limited knowledge decompiling the code and then rewriting it to use in cheeting.If you were to consider trying the game in its present state, then you need to stay away from the public servers or run your own server connecting via localhostUnfortunately I see a major downside to the development of this game.The game is being developed by the following 2 menhttp://www.codehatch.com/vision.htmlThey have limited experience in game development and are quick to censor posts they disagree withFrom their youthful appearance and the fact they they already dropped their Starforge project and their inability to take advice from those more experienced the Gold Mine they have created is likely to collapse.They need professional help to get the fundamentals in place. I have a feeling they wont accept that and as with their previous project they will drop itShame reallyThere is no official website, no official forums and no bug tracker.  REALLY!!!!  YesBest approach here would be when they drop the project, turn it into an open source project and let it develop and achieve its true opotential			"

								Picked this game up today because I insta-buy games with melee combat in it, my experience with it so far is that it's a good game for just being added on the market, one of my real problems with the game (Yes. I know. It's early access) are the servers, Yeah, they'll probably change some things around and increase stability and such etc. However it does annoy me joining a game and getting hit from a guy standing 30 feet away from me. (Once again. Yes. I know. It's early access) Other than that I have many high hopes for this game, I very much hope that the developers redeem themselves with this game and improve their reputation. Starforge was bad. That's all I really have to say about it. (Started off good and then was just unfinished, and unpolished, and some features were never added into the game.) Ok. Ok. Sorry for having a disorganized review for this game. Sorry. Yeah. Heres what I really wanted to say before I got caught up in talking about other stuff. Yeah.It's a good game, good concept, fine graphics, Chivalry ""inspired"" combat mechanics, amazing customization, and gore, loads and loads of splurts and decaps. It's a fun time reallyAs I said my real downside with the game is it just not being polished enough (*Incoming comments about saying ""bruh itz early access do u evn no what tht meanz?!!11""*) Hope you enjoyed my ok review.

								This will  be a quick but informitive review.This game is a mix of many popular games that brings elements out of them to make this wonderfull game.As such I have seen a mix of minecraft, Medival Engineers, Chivalry, and countless others.This game brings together friends to survive the wilds, explore, and finally to defeat the king. I play on Roleplay servers, they really bring out the game, being sent by the king to do his bidding and brings a format to the game helps enhance what it already has IN ALPHA!Tho this game has its faults and I thought of quitting in the first hour of gameplay, Yes rumors are true of the FPS drop and the lag beyond belief. BUT there is a fix! Try going on other deticated servers that are not from the dev. They have WAY to many up right now with hundreds of players, This equals a LOT of lag. Any other servers are great!This game will bring that joy, and entertainment that current games have been lacking, Maning from charector creation, It's funny the creations people make.But even with all that its still in alpha and I see a good future for this game and hope people will support and devs will make this game into the greatness it can become. This has so much to offer!10/10			"

								I've played about 100 hours of this game so far, and while it has been fun at times, the majority of my experiences have been some of the worst of any multiplayer game. Every server is currently full of people who's only goal seems to be making your time playing Reign of Kings as miserable as possible. Hackers, exploiters, racists, and trolls as far as the eye can see.As of writing this review it is impossible to find a server without hackers. You want to build a nice base for yourself? Hackers will remove it. Get the best armor and weapons? Hackers will kill you through your walls and locked doors and take it. There is no way to make your items or your base safe from them.  It's amazing they could make a game that is so easy to hack, and not include any anti-cheat protection at release. There is the /report option for reporting hackers, but there is no way to see their names unless you can hit them or they happen to talk about cheating in the chat. Even when you do know their name, reporting them seems to do nothing at all, as they just stay on the server and keep hacking.The worst part of all is that the game can be really fun and addicting, but no matter what you do you will get screwed over, either by hackers or server crashes that leave you rolled back and without all the resources you just collected. Hopefully they will add anti-cheat soon and that will make the game actually playable, but right now it just feels like a very frustrating waste of time.			"

								Hackers and glitches are common in any early-access title you can buy nowadays. Reign of Kings is no exception, although in fairness, this review was written by the time of the Alpha 10 patch. Nevertheless, these game-breaking glitches and extremely prevelant hacking is ruining what can be at times a fun and enjoyable survival game that is extremely addictive.PROS:- Ideal size map (not too big where you see a person every hour or too small where you see one every minute)- Fun cooperatively, although playing by yourself can be enjoyable if you meet other friendly players- In-depth crafting system- diffrent tier levels of weapons, building blocks, workbenches etc.- Intriguing King system where one who takes the throne of the land can tax every person of their materials (creates potential role-playing scenarios if King taxes too high)- Funny and expansive character creation for an open world survival game (although this leads to people exploiting their character's body size so that they are a midget that cannot be hit in combat)CONS:- Game-breaking glitches (as in major fps lag before you enter combat or the plague village, poor collision detection where your character gets stuck on objects like mountains- unable to move because you are lying on your side while you starve to death/slowly die from the plague in the village- you'll see this often if you buy the game at its current state)- HACKERS- been turned into Shrek or red Shrek so many times (making me stand out in the bush/targeted for being different), been killed by flying glitch 3 times, had hackers storm mine and my neighbours' bases with unlimited trebuchet rounds- KOS (Kill On Sight) makes the game combat focused, which itself is not the greatest aspect of the game- If you're Australian, have fun trying to cram into only four offcial servers with 119 other Australians who have the gameAdmittedly it is a little unfair to criticise a game on its bugs and hackers when it's only in early Alpha. I'm really only thumbing down this game now so that those indecisive people don't buy the game in its current broken state and give up entirely on the early-access notion. The potential for this game is enormous if the dev team can keep their attention centred on developing the game based off of gamer feedback. I'm desperate to turn this review into a Thumbs Up and will do so if most of the cons are patched up in the next update. For now, I recommend you save your money until the game is discounted or until progress is made on fixing the errors.			"

								This game looked good and fun, so I got it. However, my first day, I logged on and was starving to death, which is stupid to be starving when not logged in, then servers are restarting way to often. I finally get to play the 2nd or third day after buying it and then someone just randomly kills me. King was being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with high taxed so i left to play a different server, and really liked the community on it. but then there is always the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who just has to kill a helpless person trying to figure out the game. Finally got a place started, then along comes a thief when i return from chopping down some trees and took all my stuff. Then a couple hours later, a hacker in full steel armor with steel hammer comes and takes over my place and just kills me for no reason. really a buzz kill. had the chance to get my stuff changed location and set up. got back on later server is down. had to start all over again on a different server and its just BS. Then I cant even be logged off without someone coming and killing me, taking my stuff. this game needs some serious work. I feel like I have lost my 20 bucks. they better fix it. and yes I understand its a survival game, but really?? The looting dead animals is stupid how you have to smack the hell out of the body to loot it. just add a loot menu. and have servers for people who just want to enjoy the game, not EVERYONE like to play in PVP.

								*Sigh* What can be said. Well for starters don't be the ""Good Person"" You'll only get yourself killed, and no matter what you do you will lose all of your things when you log off. No there is no base that can stop this, I tried everything from a complicated fortress to just a box made out of  stone bricks. The one time I sorta had fun was actually playing with my friends when we were the only people on the server. Would be a great game if I could just invite people but I have to go through the trouble of making a server to even come close to enjoying myself. How I would fix it: Step 1: Have a system of at war, where you can wage war on another clanStep 2: Include a system of currency and maybe a town of npc's where you cannot damage one another. Step 2A: Have the ability to buy and sell equipment and materials to npc's Step 3: Have a system for bounties where killing someone unafiliated with a clan will set a bounty, and after a certain     number of kills you are no longer able to use the facilities at the npc village. (This let's people new to the game have some sort of defense while also allowing for the bandit play style.)Step 4: Remove the player from the instance of the game when he or she logs off. (You keep the things in your inventory)Step 5: Make clans more manageable, only allowing a few people to do anything.Final verdict: Needs some major work. I had no problems with hackers, but the community has no reason to be kind to one another and for that reason very few people are.			"

								I think people tend to forget that this game is still in early acces and they are impatient and start raging in their reviews. Have patience with this game. Because this game is really awesome when the bugs start to go away for an hour or so. Especially if you play with a friend. And if you're new try and play on a RP server or a server where there is no KoS (Kill on Sight) because you will stay alive a lot longer and have a higher chance of a better experience with this game. Also you will learn the basics of the game easier and you will be prepared for proper PvP servers if thats what you're into.In my opinion people should be patient with this game. Because seriously. The idea behind this game is brilliant and there are so many awesome opportunities for this game to be epic. It just needs some tinkering.I have only played this 17 hours as of now and I've run into several bugs. But I overcome it and I try to be patient for the best experience possible.If you can't play a game that has bugs dont buy this game. But if you think you can overcome that and be patient with it. Then this game is most certainly worth it.			"

												PROSDidn't run so could not play enough to find outCONSBuggy and broken game would not runSadly this game does not launch most of the time... I manage to launch once on average in 10 attempts. I've tried changing drivers, Windows updates, messing with background processes and turning off anti virus with no luck. I accept it's early access but seems quite broken! I tried on two PC's one has an almost brand new install of Windows and very clean and my other is configured for gaming and very high spec.When the game did work I connected to a server got killed by another player within 1 minute. No help, no tutorial, no game intro and this other player didn't respond to chat. Where was the new starter help or spawn protection? Graphics and sound seem nice enough for this genre but I'd rather be able to play it.UPDATESo 3 months later I have reinstalled and went back to this for about 30 minutes this evening so I could have a 2nd attempt at playing. Same issues launcher very buggy and I kept getting attacked in game so gave up. I walked around for a bit tried to do some basics and decided that Minecraftm Scrap Mechanic and Space Engineers are more my sort of game.POOR ALL ROUND!			"

								They advertised this game being a mixture of Rust and Chivalry, and they really werent kidding. So far this game seems awesome. It already feels like a full games worth of content even though it's early access. Do not expect to get a suit of armor and a sword quickly though. There is a lot of hitting trees and finding the right type of bushes before that can happen. The servers do have some minor lag issues, but it was just released yesterday so hopefully those will be sorted out. 10/10 for those who are ready to put in some work to make the best items.			"

								Reign of Kings is a medieval multiplayer sandbox with rich crafting (smelting, foraging, building and hunting.), a survival of the fittest will you Make your own base to fend off the creatures players, will you fight to be king to Show your gentle or violent heart off as you rule the kingdom,leaving your reign amongst the people,with the base combat system of Chivalry Medieval. There's so much rp from the community servers no Kos no random grabbing people with rope and running off, The Kings somtimes make there own rules Like a market no one can or is allowed to kill inside of it and players can make a shop to trade resources so if people live near iron and others live near oil they could trade it.RoK (Reign of Kings) is Like many games combined together, Life is Feudal : Your own, Chivalry Medieval, Mount and Blade warband, Minecraft, Rust and many more games.If you like the the Medieval side the PvP side the raid other peoples bases side the Building hunting or any other side, then I Recommend this game to you.

								A friend summed this game up in a passing comment once, he called it ""Reign of Rust"" and for the most part in its current form that is exactly what it is. Now Rust is a fine game, you may be thinking being likened to it is no bad thing but I found for me at least it had no real long term playability. RoR in its current form generally will encourage the worst in most players, what I mean by that is going around killing other players and wrecking their accomplishments. It is standard practice for most survival open world games, which is easy to understand because without a story or objectives there's little for players to really do. RoK has some pretty major balance issues for instance the trebuchet which can be loaded with 1000's of ammunition in a single shot which will just melt any wall you choose to build giving nothing you build any real longevity/durability and all the armour just feels wrong for instance I don't think in any reality someone with a wooden club should be able to kill someone else in head to toe steel plate armourBut in spite of all that I did enjoy the majority of my 100 hours, due heavily to the fact that the server I mainly played was populated with generally nice people who liked abit of role play, now I generally felt a little uncomfortable with the whole RP thing but over time I came to really appreciate  it , it adds colour to an otherwise kill people, build/wreck stuff experience, RoK just added a two ingredients a guild system and throne, then in this framework the server created a town, guilds with mutual defence agreements a sudo police force and a church with daily services.I am in conclusion hopeful about this games future development, although unless you know of a server with top notch admins i would wait to see if the problems are being resolved before buying, hacker issues have been well documented  bad game balance etc all are issues which are fixable and if the developers concentrate on how players can better work together by further developing the guild system having other objectives to rally around like separate taxable regions and making it so new to server players cant just kill anyone or wreck stuff within a couple of hours RoK may be a game you could play week in week out instead of being something you get bored of within a week			"

								After playing for nearly 30 hours, I have to say this game I would recommend but be warned it is by no means a finished game and Early Early access is a more appropriate tag for it. There is plenty to do if you have a good bunch of friends and a friendly server as we have have found but we did try some other servers just as hackers decided to ruin the game for everyone. The developers seem to be updating and working hard to fix the hackers issues but as I said if you find a good password protected server and befriend there should be no issues from hackers for the most part. There are tweaks needing done to some of the systems but the basics are very much there.			"

												I really tried to like this game but it's hard when you see yourself playing a medieval version of RUST when it was on it's early stages.The crafting system is too simple, even for an early acess and i can't imagine that it will get better. Also, It's a man x man all the time and the island is so small that it's almost impossible to hide from other players while you get ready for action.Also, the simple gather-system, the small world, the simplicity of the resources and some low-quality animation, makes the game not suitable for players that really enjoy the surviving aspect of the experience.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I don't recommend this game for players who prefer REALISM. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<If you like 7 Days to Die, Project Zomboid, The Forest, Xyson, The Long Dark, Wurm etc... in other words, games more oriented towards a realistical survival (man x nature), then RoK is not suited for you.If you like RUST, extract wood from hatchet attacks, unfinished games ( vid StarForge from the same devs ) and something more PVP cored, then this game might be of some fun for ya.Good luck if you think that these devs will finish the game...

								For an Alpha this game handles very well.I've noticed this game has a lot of negative reviews and i'm not sure why? It's a great survival game in which you try to become king of the realm. (or in this case king of the server) The fighting mechanics or PVP is a big part of the game and it handles a lot like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, which is a good thing! I joined a server with nearly 100 players and it was an all out war between Lord of The Rings fans and Game of Thrones fans lol, not sure who won as the battle went on for hours but if this sounds like your type of game i highly recommend buying it. Just keep in mind that the game is in Early Access Alpha which means anything could happen.. ANYTHING!!... nothing bad lol no, of course not -_-Reign of Kings - 7/10			"

								Extremely buggy.Here's my experience so far.Log into server. While im looking at loading screen, i hear stabbing & dying, when game finally loads R.I.PApparently someone stabbed me to death while i was logging in?Okay, fine respawn then. Oh, now i cant move.Oh well log off & try another server.Log into another server. Spawn in the middle of the night, get chased by wolves, run for dear life, as soon as i lose the wolves, the game coughs (literally) and im stuck in place.Guess ill try a couple more times before i give up on this game. Good thing theres plenty of servers!Edit: A patch and a half later & its still pretty broken. Again I was killed before the game loaded, and again i was stuck in place on respawn.I do like the premise, and i hope this game is playable someday.That day has not yet arrived.			"

								Amazing game for the price. Has it all, PvP, Building, RP and Survival. I've been holding off reviewing this game until I've had atleast 500 hours on it. It's time to review.Pros -Some of the funniest gaming experiences I've had have been on this game. -Building is fun and you can really creative with it, even better than the building system in minecraft.-PvP - Fast paced and very skill based. -Roleplaying - Even though I'm orientated towards PvP, Roleplay servers are an entirely differant experience in the game. Putting on a funny medieval voice and catching criminals as the medieval police was a very fun experience.-Character creation - I still chuckle at the bizzare and ugly character people come up with.-War time - The King and the guild system really add to the game, go to war with the king or with differant guilds. Cons- Don't play this game alone - Whether you get irl friends, steam friends or make friends in game, it just makes the game so much more enjoyable than getting teamed on by yourself by 3 guys.- Official Server KOS and offline raiding - Although a lot of people like killing on sight and offline raiding, (i'm one of them) a lot of people get fustrated and leave after they die and lose their gear or somebody raids their home. If you're one of these people do not threat, you can still enjoy this game. There are COMMUNITY server with rules and admins who will ban anybody who breaks the rules. Find the right server for you.- Sieging - Sieging went from being completely overpowered to being completely underpowered. Codehatch are currently working on balancing so in time the siegeing system is a bit unbalanced and it may take a while to break into a base with a trebuchet. Overall I rate this game a solid 8/10 game. Some balancing issues are needed but overall I am very, very happy with my purchase. Thanks codehatch.			"

								Alright I’m going to give an honest review of the game. Now mind you, these are just things that I have experienced, so I may be wrong. 1. Hackers- there are hackers on every single server. The only exemption is if the server is private. The hackers in this game pretty much ruin everything that you could think of. The first day I played, this hacker decided to repeatedly kill everyone on the server at once until everyone rage quit. Another time the hacker just focused out the king of the server, so that no one could claim kingship. The worst one was when a hacker went into my guilds base while we were offline and removed all of the floors, chests, and doors, only to kill us. I know this guild on the server I last played on had spent more than 40 hours building up a really nice castle, then hackers came in and completely decimated it. What they did was remove all of the walls, then go inside and basically delete their guild crest, their chests, and then kill them. Hackers are the cancer of this game and there is nothing being done about them.2.♥♥♥♥♥hats- The base building system is there to help players make a cool fort to store their stuff inside. In said fort you can build these crests to expand the radius where people won't be able to build something like a ramp up to your base and just loot the place. The problem is that most people will build a tower straight up along your property line, and then jump into your base. In all, you have no safe way to build a base without people finding a way to jump into it. This really kills the game because you can build this really kick♥♥♥♥♥fort, then have it broken into while your offline. There is no way to stay truly safe in the game.3. Even more♥♥♥♥♥hats- Some of these people you play with are just cancer. You can't play this game alone because you will be ganged up on. To counter this, you could run in a group, but it doesn’t matter because there is 0 respawn time so by the time you kill someone, they could already be right back attacking you. For example, a group of my friends and I were building up our castle and we kept getting attacked by these same people. We killed them at least 20 times each, to no avail. After literally 2 hours of fighting the same 2 people, they logged off. Later that night we were chopping down trees and noticed 2 beds on the ground about 100 yards from our base. You see, beds are respawn beacons so what these people were doing is they would die, then spawn instantly at their beds. The respawning system is totally broken and needs fixing. 4. Crafting- there are a ton of things to craft, but it uses the same 5 materials. This means that to build anything, you will be running and farming all day. Now armor and weapons are easy to make, but the higher tier you go in your building materials, the more repetitive it gets. Now say you do get to make the highest tier building material in the game, the siege weapons are so lopsided right now that no matter how well you fortify your walls, they will still be destroyed in a single hit. To put it bluntly, this game is a grind fest and no matter how much you grind, you will never be safe.5. Armor- armor in this game is worthless. You gain no defense from having it on and the stats it promises are a lie. The only thing that is true about the armor is that it slows you down for having the full set. It really stinks that a naked person has the same amount of health and defense as someone who is sporting full steel armor. The weapons however do the damage that they promise, so I can’t say it’s all bad. This game has more faults than anything. The potential of this game is absolutely astounding, but there are some game breaking faults that make it so I just cannot recommend this game. If you are going to buy this game, for the love of GabeN, do not drop $20 on it. When the game goes to beta you might want to look into it, but avoid this game like the plague now.   "

								This game is one of the few early alphas out there that i overly enjoy. Sure there is the odd hacker, and maybe the random KOS♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it is an amazing game. The character customization is detailed. I've seen a few goliaths and people that are outrageosly disproportionate, but thats the beauty of it. The armour does not have fixed dimensions as it shapes around your characters unique body. If you are a fan of games where you can attatch rope to a fellow players leg and make them bungie jump, or even want to hang an unsuspecting victim and chop their body up into little peices, then this games for you!!!!I rate this a 9.5/10 (and it's still in early alpha), thanks for the wonderful times Code}{atch team!!!!

								i'm sure i'll change my review back and forth from not reccomended to reccomended at some point because i love this game, but at the moment this game is overrun with hackers. it WAS fun before that, tho. i would say steer clear of this game unless you know for sure they've taken measures to get rid of the hacking.EDIT: 4/3/2015 there are not as many hackers and the game can be fun again. the developers have shown will to fix problems fast. there is still plenty of hacking but it's getting harder for the grimy punks.EDIT: 4/5/15 stamina needs to be involved in running, or give a speed boost or something. right now there is no way to get away from someone if they outmatch you. steel plate dudes can catch up to wooden armor dudes because noone wears shoes (full armor sets give speed reductions, so just don't wear a piece, right?) the ability to remove all armor even if your inventory is full should DEFINETLY exist.

								5 months and the combat system is still buggy. what the hell is this♥♥♥♥♥♥ its like people are buying it expecting a combat system like chivalry but what you get out of it is a lag simulator when in combat. Makes zero sense how a naked with a club could beat someone full armored with a steel weapon. Great game but the combat needs improvement asapp.s. this isn't about the game itself, but about the development. According to the news feed of this game, they are expecting to fully release this game in 4 months when they can't even fix simple things (ex. weird swimming, getting trapped in areas that would seem easy to get out of)			"

												I would recommend this game if it was a long time ago. It was so much fun, but they stopped updating it, patching, fixing bugs. I wish it stayed the same. It has got to that point were unless you have a group of people to play with, you can't get started out. By the time your done gathering stuff for a starter base, someone would probably already have killed you. Online raids almost never happen unless its a role play server. The map has way too much bases on it, no good places to build. There will be places to build but it will either be in the middle of every thing, which means you probaly would be raided fast, or out for from everything, meaning you would have to walk a long time to get anything but trees and things you can produce anywhere. There also is so much asains on this game. They just basically own the map. Your only chance is on a wipe day because on most servers its impossible to get anything, do to the fact that the main resourses are not in random spots, which means in almost ever offical server there will be a base on top of all the main resoures. This makes it almost impossible and very difficult to do anything and have fun. This game could have been so good, it once had no hackers, no 50-man asain clans that build huge buildings everywhere that say china#1. There once was a nice community, now that once nice community is 99% dead. It was always me and my two friends. We used to love the funny glitches, dances, and people we would find. Now the game is just, see someone? KILL HIM. Almost no one uses the mic. There is way too much hackers as well. Sence the game is not up to date that makes it to were there not patching any hacks anymore. FEELSBADMAN.			"

Now the game is just, see someone? KILL HIM. Almost no one uses the mic. There is way too much hackers as well. Sence the game is not up to date that makes it to were there not patching any hacks anymore. FEELSBADMAN.			"

												This is a good game in thoery, but is ruined by the players in practice.  The ratio of good to bad players makes the game virtually unplayable.If they introduced a feature for bad sports, like in GTA, whereby they can only play on servers with other players who have a penchant for attacking players who are not on their land, it would be better.However, as it stands the simple minded players are treating it as a run around naked attacking people simulator.

								well to start off this game has great potentail. ive spent countless hours trying to love it. but in the end like most people before me have said deff not worth the money yet . you can spend hours if not days building your base and in a matter of a few minutes watch as it is destroyed by a couple of guys and or hackers witch i thought the new update was supposed to fix but nope e very server ive joined has multi hackers in it . and if your playing alone forget about it your just gonna get jumped by random groups of bandits. so unless you plan on playing with atleast 3 freinds at the same time dont even bother lol. again ive tried really hard to love this game but for now save your money and look for a more fully developed game.

								Edit: Now that the game has fixed the (bug) with hack like effects i now love this game. best played with friends.   BELOW IS OLD VERSIONThis game is great. I was not sure about it. But i really liked it. The crafting system is great the fighting is intense an the politics with the king works. I played with two friends which really allowed me to see the full scale of the game. We had a nice fort set up lots of gear in only three days. Around the forth we took the throne from a cruel king, setting the tax to 0%. thats when my opinion about the game hit the fan. THE HACKERS. It is a game breaking exploit that completely ruin it all. Every thing me and my homies had worked on was gone because of some hacker and because the devs can make an anti cheat to save there lives(in this case game). The fact that this game is based on all players being able to compete with one another is shattered when a hacker who kills everybody spawns in. I will change my rateing of this game if the amount hackers drops by an amazing amount. Please devs fix this. It is the only reason why i am not suggesting this game to others.			"

								The game is really inviting and easy to figure out, I can spend hours on and just build and farm materials with the occasional bypasser who greets me (kos mostly if not on closed server) and who might just offer a RP session of a lifetime.The most fun i get out of this game is when my guild has made a beautiful base filled with equipment and resources, and we head out in search of adventure and combat. Some servers have built a small comunity with arenas, inns, battlegrounds, churces and whatever you could think of, the oppurtunities are endless. The combat system is pretty easy to figure out, but harder to get skilled at so just practice and you'll get there. The build system is ok, items that are hard to place and take to much space, the point and click is uncomfortable and almost impossible at certain angles.

												I'm changing my review...1. Graphics - The graphics are pretty damn good, except maybe the player graphics but very good nonetheless. You get some high frames on the highest settings if your computer has a good graphics card. (Running r9 280x). So all in all if it';s graphics and good frames your looking for, get this game.2. Combat - The combat is fairly straight forward it's like chivalry and failry good. My only problem with it is, you are pretty much screwed no matter what if someone has a tier above you in terms of weapons/armor. Still it is really good so if your wanting the combat; get this game.3. Glitches/bugs/hackers - I have never ran into any game breaking glitches or bugs in this game, nor have my friends (that I know of). But I have had my fair share of hackers which is never fun. But you will not always have the bad luck I do so... You can get this game knowing there are no bad glitches and bugs.4. Servers - The official servers all seem to be pretty good ones, and the community servers run real nice to in terms of ping, although I have died in combat a few times cause my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet (although in all honesty about half the time I have died in combat because of my ""internet"" is just cause I have terrible combat prowess.) So all in all the servers are usually good in terms of ping and even if you have♥♥♥♥♥♥internet like me you can enjoy this game.5. Multiplayer - The multiplayer in this game is really good, like really good. Thee only problem I have with it is it is force multiplayer. No singleplayer and no lan with just friends :(. Honestly though it is good, it does have the DayZ vibe though so watch out for players you do not trust.I rate this game a solid 6/10. In other words get this game.			"

								Weirdly, this might be the best survival early access game there is at the moment. They just got it right with so many things.Combat feels good, base defense and offense is just brilliant, you can have proper sieges in a very balanced way. It is addictively good. They added a lot of fun stuff, you can capture enemies instead of just killing them, and there is various ways of execution and humiliation. So one can finally deal appropriately with the cheeky american teenagers after they annoyed you in the chat.Harvesting resources takes some time, but its quite reasonably quick. You can build a basic base that offers you some basic protection in less than an hour once you know how to, and you'll advance to medium-tier materials in a day which will already require enemies to set up serious siegeworks to get in.The highest tier requires explosives and one can reach that level in 2-3 days of dedicated gameplay with 2-3 people.Breaking into bases isn't terribly hard, on the easy ones a simple melee weapon and patience often will do. It seems mostly to be the fault of bad base design. A well designed base requires serious effort with good coordination, also the timing is usually quite tight. You can't spend hours on sieging a base without nobody noticing.Overall, it feels they balanced the base building effort with the break-in effort. Something i didn't encounter at all in similar games like RUST yet.Its the typical game you want to play with a bunch of friends in Teamspeak, playing alone can be a bit frustrating since you'll likely encounter larger groups all the time and kill on sight isn't always the case, but quite often.The map is quite small, one find its way around after a few hours. You can run from one end of the map to the other in a couple of minutes, in contrast to say DayZ the map feels much smaller.Gameplay, Features, Concept: Brilliant.Now the ugly part. No matter how good your PC is, this game will eat it. Performance doesn't really depend on your graphics card, but seems CPU or server limited. You simply won't see good FPS. ~24 FPS was the best i've seen. Sometimes the game freezes completely for several seconds. It is possible to have proper combat when the performance is good, but lagspikes and low-fps periods will happen, and you will be completely unable to block your enemies swings, turning the otherwise brilliant combat system into a joke.The (official) servers restart frequently without warnings and often with a rollback.I'm pretty sure they will be able to fix most of that, but i wouldn't count on smooth running 200 people servers anytime in the future, 20 people servers seem to run the smoothest atm. Server wipes without any announcment ingame on new version releases. That means every week. Code base seems to be quite messy when thats needed, so say goodbye to your Hording Simulator 2015. Puts me off the game immediately to have my progress wiped every week.Hacks: The game has been out for a couple days, and there is already plenty of hacks. I've actually had people proudly tell me how easy this game is to hack since its all client sided, and i believe it. I've seen hackers on servers myself already, and the recent announcement of the devs to ""now look into hack proofing the game"" tells me this is now the games main problem.And will remain so. I am very certain that the hack issues this game has can't and won't be solved. It is always the same story with small dev teams throwing out a game like this: They didn't think about hack proofing the game from the start. They developed the game to work with normal players, behaving themselfes. Many things are client side, there are no server side checks at all, and the engine probably needs to be completely recoded to make the game harder to hack. That won't happen. Its an economic issue, there just isn't enough profit in doing that. So the game will get some patches here and there, but it will always be an ugly hackfest.I've seen too many games suffer the same faith to think otherwise. Expecially when the devs write into their recent announcement that they're now ""looking into options like VAC"". They obviously didn't spend any thoughts on the issue until now, and that simple fact will ruin the game now.

												>Join server>Fight 3 people>Run over Bear Trap>Kills 3 people>gets full steel>steals massive base>Kidnaps three guys>make them slaves for life 10/10SERIOUS REVIEW BELOWSo, Reign of kings is not a bad game. The negative reviews are from people playing on the CodeHatch owned servers. In every survival game, the dev owned servers usually suck. But look at the community servers. There are some really great community out there that love the game and have fun with it. Certain blocks in game cannot be destroyed without advanced equipment. This is where most people complain, either they used the lower tier blocks that can be broken into with a stick, which is really their fault if you think about it. Or they were raided using this siege equipment. Most community servers have rules against offline raiding, players that have these siege equipment have been around for some time, and don't want to be banned on the community servers over something so small.      The hackers have gone down, the few that do get on get banned within 5 minutes. The community servers i play on with ban a player with a chinese name, and do regular saves to the map so that in the event of a hacker, they can revert to a older version of the map.     The bugs are kind of annoying in RoK, but can be avoided     Combat in reign of kings, is the only thing i have problems with. Lag can totally ruin a fight, some weapons need to be nerfed, some need to be removed entirely. Server side modding had helped with this, owners can change everything in the game.     Overall a really good game, i would recommend Shadowgaming or some other RP community			"

												This is my first revieuw but will be one of many to come on other games.I'll be straight forward with where this is heading:I've bought an number of alpha games and to be honest this is the only one i wouldn't recommend. I'll start with an pro & con and then explain why etc...Pro's:Can be fun at times.Has an easy building system-Character customization Realistic combatCon's:Unfinished and disappointmentAnti Cheat isn't accurateNo terraforming or agriculture Lets explain the why & how now:-  Can be fun at times:Yes this game can be loads of fun when played (alone or with friends). I've met allot of people and seen nice communities of course there are  some little kids that cry over voice chat but doesn't all games with voice chat have that?But the fun doesn't last bc they dont made it to last ur quickly reach the time u have nothing to do bc ur at full steel and ur able to out kill everyone.- Has an easy building systemThis is by far the easiest way to build u place a block with left click and u remove it with right click (default). U can stack it to the building height limit and there is no realism in stuff not being supported.- Character customizationU can create and alter ur character how u want and go either male or female. Its not advanced but u can change sizes of different parts of the body for example have a big arms & tiny body- Realistic combatOnly the damaging part of the weapon will deal damage has the same combat features as Chivalry and it has accurate sieging weapons.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unfinished and disappointmentThis was by far the reason why i dont recommend this game, First of all:Codehatch this isn't a finished game! (Of course thats what i make of it)The game had potential to be the best medieval survival game but it grabbed next to the rope and fell down the reasons why are so many just to start with no way of keep on playing without being bored after u reached the end game, No mounts at all not even horses or just a pack mule to carry stuff, Not to start with the awefull 2nd map they released. To be honest this shouldn't be classified under survival but under Hack & Slash because thats what the game has gone with there is no in debt survival only water & food the AI of the wildlife isn't good & the plague villagers are no threat. U could have done so much and u didn't. Maybe bc u didn't want to spend the time and u already had the money? Or just not enough skill in the team? Or no ambition? Anyway its a shame.- Anti Cheat isn't accurateThis doesn't need much explaining, to tell a long story short outdated Anti Cheat.- No terraforming or agricultureTo start off i want to say that even minecraft has this...But like the title describes there is no terraforming, meaning u cant change the landscape and get resources of a ""node"" even dirt is represented on a ""node"", U can agriculture (farm) but the limits are high meaning u cant have a roof garden bc the grass blocks aren't farm able, u have to farm on game soil and the plowing system is broken. Could have done a better job.Overall i would rate this game at a 3.5/10 and there for nor recommend it they have let there community down in so many ways. I'm happy that i played it but wouldn't buy it again or infact anything in sequel of this.			"

												This game has some interesting ideas, but has a long way to go. Most importantly, wipes prevent me from wanting to invest any time in creating a character. While this game has very interesting features, I feel that there are too many barriers to creating a long term community.  The building system is amazing but not worth investing in as it will most likely be deleted by the developers before anyone has a chance to siege your castle.  The combat is fun but there is no long term reward for stealing that coveted piece of treasure. This game has a lot to learn from the others of the survival genre, especially ""Ark Survival Evolved"" which has implemented far more features in less time without the need to constantly wipe characters and structures regularly. From the Medieval genre it should learn from the new release "" Gloria Victis"" which has made its characters free of server limitations. The ability to roam servers and maintain your character when your current server is down has  prevented so much frustration and reign of Kings should implement a similar system. The developers may have technical limitations for saving character content, so I propose this: Character saves can be set to a paper doll, preserving the core attributes and features of a character. When a milestone in game development occurs for the devs, this data is saved and transferred to the new format of the game. while characters are not necessarily their original form, some of the progress players have worked on will be saved, thus encouraging long term play. I sincerely hope that the developers listen to the playerbase including myself as there are some simple fixes that could make this game enjoyable for long term play. Untill that time, I would discourage others from spending money on a time sink that maintains none of your progression.			"

												Was fun building, exploring, and surviving the lands of a medival age. Definitely has potential. Unfortunately, imprisonment is a multiplayer function in the game, and these two players tied me up, dragged me to their base, and locked me in cell. There was no escape, no mechanic to pick a lock or bust a door. No /kill or suicide options. Just a game ending multiplayer function that enabled two trolls to completely waste my time for hours. Absolutely game breaking. I wouldnt recommend getting this game unless you can create your own server with a functionality to resolve hostage situations more quickly. Would give the game a 2/10 until they resolve the mechanics.			"

												""The development of a melee combat system adds a gritty and visceral feeling to Reign of Kings that will allow players to become deeply immersed in a realistic and intense medieval survival experience.""You can carry a fu**ing Trebuchet in your pocket, up a mountain, and set it down to destroy a base that is otherwise impervious.  There is nothing realiztic about this experience.  Typical community of rll/olba who wait until you are offline to loot and destroy.  The ones who make their parents proud.  Official servers are garbage.If you insist on paying the money (only do it on sale), then find a community server.  You'll be much happier with the purchase.  Still has some bugs, like objects getting stuck and binding to other objects, despite them being MIA.  Weapon tiers aren't much of an improvement from stone to steel.  Many items with no use at all.  Likely will never have a use as the only purpose of the game is to destroy and loot the resources others gathered.  There are no professions or other aspects of making the game at all realistic.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't like this game - I spawned in and decided to head out to seek the king and ask his purpose, I was met by players with massive swords who were hitting me at this point.I decided to try out another 5 servers, 2 of those official, and try that again, each to seek the same demise.So - I decided to screw the king plan and head over to building a house, I got quite a lot of wood and tried to find a suitable place to build such a mansion in which I would build, after running around a little bit I decided to settle down, night fell and so did my FPS. Try running this game at 15 fps, it really isn't nice.. I asked in chat if anybody else was recieveing the same lag that I was, turns out almost the entire server was. So, I decided to restart my game. Sure enough, the lag had gone and after 20 minutes it was back again. Anyway, enough about lag as that doesn't represent the game at all. In the time that I had, I managed to construct myself a massive wood house in which I placed a Tinker (crafting table), however two hours later a new crappy anti-cheat update came along and wiped the server..Honeslty, if you want to play this game to it's potential either buy a 4-slot server for your friends (so you don't have to wipe it) or find a small abandoned server to settle onto.The building system is horrible - you place a block and it ends up slanted, you place an object like a cage to hold your captives but it ends up 90 degrees sideways and you can't get into it, it's rediculous! PEOPLE - if you want to build without a pathetic interruption as such, find a flat peice of land :)Would I recommend this game?  Hell no, It's fun to play for a while with friends but if they weren't online don't expect me to step foot onto it, far too              rushed just like the companies past game which had horrid reviews.TL;DR :> Laggy after playing for a while> KoSers on every server> Server wipes galore> Bad building system> Dont buy			"

												I enjoy playing this game, but as soon as you log off, your base gets raided and you lose everything. Takes a few hours to get a decent set up and weapons, but it is all for nothing. Im tired of putting in time for the same result. I even try to find servers with no one playing and I still get everything destroyed and stolen. Like most of these open world survival games it is ruined by other players. Is it too much to ask to be able to log back onto this game without having to redo evrything?			"

Not buying a server on top of paying $20 for this game. Aside from having to now work as a Server Admin. This is a game, not a job. C. If it is just going to be me after maybe a day of stale gameplay as everyone who joins the server: Quits from gameplay that quickly gets stale, hacks and gets kicked/banned, or generally ruins the game by trolling and gets kicked/banned then there really is no reason for me to get a server let alone this game.Do not buy it.

												The game started off well especially in ALPHA. But since BETA the devs here are clearly out to get you money.*Few updates, little to no hacker prevention.*Hasnt been any meaning full content added in a age. Look at the previous blog posts most of them have been 70% copy and paste from the last one!*It's not fun to play anymore, especially when everything you build gets destroyed by hackers.Started off well to a point. When it was in alpha it was worth the money, when all the content was being added, content being patched, a high player base and the game had potential.But not anymore its a shame really. But now avoid this as if it was the plague.  It just isnt worth it.			"

												This is my first revieuw but will be one of many to come on other games.I'll be straight forward with where this is heading:I've bought an number of alpha games and to be honest this is the only one i wouldn't recommend. I'll start with an pro & con and then explain why etc...Pro's:Can be fun at times.Has an easy building system-Character customization Realistic combatCon's:Unfinished and disappointmentAnti Cheat isn't accurateNo terraforming or agriculture Lets explain the why & how now:-  Can be fun at times:Yes this game can be loads of fun when played (alone or with friends). I've met allot of people and seen nice communities of course there are  some little kids that cry over voice chat but doesn't all games with voice chat have that?But the fun doesn't last bc they dont made it to last ur quickly reach the time u have nothing to do bc ur at full steel and ur able to out kill everyone.- Has an easy building systemThis is by far the easiest way to build u place a block with left click and u remove it with right click (default). U can stack it to the building height limit and there is no realism in stuff not being supported.- Character customizationU can create and alter ur character how u want and go either male or female. Its not advanced but u can change sizes of different parts of the body for example have a big arms & tiny body- Realistic combatOnly the damaging part of the weapon will deal damage has the same combat features as Chivalry and it has accurate sieging weapons.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unfinished and disappointmentThis was by far the reason why i dont recommend this game, First of all:Codehatch this isn't a finished game! (Of course thats what i make of it)The game had potential to be the best medieval survival game but it grabbed next to the rope and fell down the reasons why are so many just to start with no way of keep on playing without being bored after u reached the end game, No mounts at all not even horses or just a pack mule to carry stuff, Not to start with the awefull 2nd map they released. To be honest this shouldn't be classified under survival but under Hack & Slash because thats what the game has gone with there is no in debt survival only water & food the AI of the wildlife isn't good & the plague villagers are no threat. U could have done so much and u didn't. Maybe bc u didn't want to spend the time and u already had the money? Or just not enough skill in the team? Or no ambition? Anyway its a shame.- Anti Cheat isn't accurateThis doesn't need much explaining, to tell a long story short outdated Anti Cheat.- No terraforming or agricultureTo start off i want to say that even minecraft has this...But like the title describes there is no terraforming, meaning u cant change the landscape and get resources of a ""node"" even dirt is represented on a ""node"", U can agriculture (farm) but the limits are high meaning u cant have a roof garden bc the grass blocks aren't farm able, u have to farm on game soil and the plowing system is broken. Could have done a better job.Overall i would rate this game at a 3.5/10 and there for nor recommend it they have let there community down in so many ways. I'm happy that i played it but wouldn't buy it again or infact anything in sequel of this.			"

												This game was great at first but has been ruined by koreans and Hackers alike. Let me tell you a story  At one time in the game i had about 12 guys all playing at once and building and gathering to help toward the common goal, To get to the kings castle and claim the throneWell we build a base and started the raid only to get to the bridge and relise that they can block it with a certain way of building and make in practically impossible to get through but you think that stoppped The Kings Men? No we build a tower under the bridge and past the building block point. You think that would possibly be it that they couldnt come up with anything else right? Nope we get on the bridge and past the gate and there is another up towards the hilt of the blade.. Do you think that stopped the Kings Brave 12? Well it did for a bit while we had to build a catapult on the bridge that took about  3 hours to knock through that gate. Before we could even walk through that gate we hear kids yelling in chinese and running up behind us on the bridge( guess the owners because they got through the first one without having to do the same♥♥♥♥♥♥we had too). And we kill all 5 of them over and over and over trying to get up closer to the castle.  We get all the way TO THE CASTLE AND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..........................Figure out that the chinese guys have figured out some way to block the enterance of the castle so much that it would literally be impossible to sit there for 16 hours and chop on the stone with them trying to attack you from behind. You cant set up the catapult up there becauuse the terrain is too rough......So pretty much about 5 hours wasted on trying to claim the throne. And that is the last i have seen of my friends playing this game. What is the point? If people are just going to block the enterance in some dumbass fasion that makes it impossible to get in.  No only that but we go home to our base only to have a hacker run around at super speed and one hit through our door then came inside and killed us all...... So please unless this sounds like a fun and great experince then this game is for you . But if you like to be immersed in  medieval times then THIS GAME IS DEFFINETLY NOT FOR YOU. Having immersion broken Constantly by hackers or Cheating the building system just wears on you after a while and the game will be dead soon anyways. The devs dont give a♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Reign of Kings as a raw game is fun. Base building is fun and it's easy to be creative, sieges are fun, combat is fun. The concept is interesting, the maps are good(for the most part), and grinding is even slightly fun.The game overall is great. The problem and the only thing that turned me away from it is the total infestation of troll hordes from China. There are literally networks of organized griefers who have nothing better to do than trash servers overnight, and they're ALL Chinese. I have no idea who, how, or why, but I've seen some of my favorite servers thrive when I go to sleep, burn when I wake up. They'll go to extraordinary lengths, too. I used to own an RoK server(big mistake), and I ended up having to get a plugin which bans all people connecting from China. Then, they started connecting from Hong Kong, so I banned that, too. Then they routed through Australia, and even purchased internet services in THE UNITED STATES just to bypass the plugin.Normally, I'd say it's the devs' fault, but there's nothing they can do. Ban one account and another pops right up in its place. Ban anyone connecting from China, and they just route through another country. Make them take a test to prove they're not Chinese and they just bypass it like every other system.The game's ultimately dead, and I'm betting that chinese trolls now consist of this game's primary customers. I reccomend you spend your $20 on another game, because this one isn't going anywhere.			"

												This is the worst game i've ever played. Don't buy it! Not even during sales. Let those developers feel how♥♥♥♥♥♥they are. CodeHatch had made another game before reign of kings and its the same story. They just throw some cheap add-ons and precoded scripts together and call it a game. Don't even finish it and release it. This game has so many problems. Don't buy for the love of God.			"

												Owning one of the most popular RP servers ""PURE Reign of Kings"" I have to say after all that time this game is dissapointing. Don't get me wrong, it was loads of fun. Survival was great, balanced in my opinion. However, devs gave up working on it. Game runs like trash if you dont have a beast computer. Buy it if you like, but dont expect it to be any different after.			"

												Would not recommend buying this game, do to the strange buggy weaponry and the combat system. Both are in need of a fixing from the creators. An example of the weaponry being strangely uncomftable and hard to control is the hit boxes from weapons like the iron star mace or the halberd. Most of the time you not able to block or dodge their attacks, do to their rather difficult and strange hitboxes. Blocking in this game is a pain too. You are not able to block for a long time, and the stamina drains rather fast. Besides when your stamina has been drained, the only way to get it back is to not move, which I believe is a rather irritating gamemechanic, since most of my battles with people result in me dodging most of their attacks, doing no damage myself (Even when I hit them, and do to a strange bug in the game) and somehow lose all of my stamina in 10 seconds and not getting it back, even when I don't move. You can not be strategic in the game do to difficult lag spikes and buggy teleporting combat players (This happens almost in every battle; not hackers)However the other game mechanics such as the crests and the siege equipment works rather well in the game. The crest can be protected, which I believe is a great way to stop no living grinders into raiding your base when you are offline. The siege equipment works most of the time and has a lot of potential in raiding higher tier buildings. Sometimes they do fire a shot, hit the building and do no damage at all.In my opinion Reign of Kings is a great game and I love to play it, but do to recent changes to the game, the combat is fustrating and a solid reason to quit the game fully.

												I enjoy playing this game, but as soon as you log off, your base gets raided and you lose everything. Takes a few hours to get a decent set up and weapons, but it is all for nothing. Im tired of putting in time for the same result. I even try to find servers with no one playing and I still get everything destroyed and stolen. Like most of these open world survival games it is ruined by other players. Is it too much to ask to be able to log back onto this game without having to redo evrything?			"

Early Access Review
								Probably the worst waste of money I have experienced this year. Where to start..1, You can get killed while you are logged off. Now I know a few games have this ""feature"" (rust) which would be ok if you could take reasonable precautions to protext your ""struff"" while you are offline, Unfortunately, there are a lot of (for want of a better word) idiots in the game who will go out of their way to destroy what you have - either by just bashing the crap out of your base while you are away or by using a Trebuchet.2. I guess this is related to the type of game it is, but I found (on several servers) a very poisonous bunch of people who will go out of their way to give you a hard time just for the sake of it, I made a comment on one occasion that its a shame there was no built in map feature to which several replaied that I should press ""alt + F4"". A few minutes later another new player asked something in general chat and received the same reply.3. The game itself is very ""basic"" and well deserves its status as being a pre-release build. There are many bugs and its simply just ""not finished"". I mean even a fairly basic thing such as a mapping feature. I mean this is not rocket science. Object collision is flakey to say the least and on occasion, stuff just dissapears! Several times I have been hunting say a wolf only to have it vanish at the last minute!In hindsight I should have got my money back. lesson learnt. My advice, avoid at all costs! Its mainly populated by ""young"" (or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) people and I predict that it will die natural death in due course. "

												I liked it and i still do but the reasons below show why i have a bad review for this game and how bad it has gotten:I wanted to like this game as I love Medieval 'sandbox' fantasy games; however, desipte trying out multiple servers (at least a dozen) everyone had the same exact thing. Huge disappointment & waste of time.* Servers were nearly dead* Those left of the servers hacked* Hackers flying around* Destroying your base without destroying the crest* Building on top of your base even though you have an intact crest* Speed hacks* There's massive clipping issues* People warping through walls* Even though the servers aren't full, there's still massive lagI could go on and on about the hacks, but even without the hack, this game is still unfinished but it is being ""sold"" as a completed game when it should not be. If this game was a stock, the SEC would be getting involved.			"

												Loved this game when it first came out, met a great group of people, having fun and then.... the floodgates were opened to every low life hacker in the world.  I stopped playing and went to go play Ark Survival and recently came back.  Every server has Asian hackers.  You spend hours forming a group making a base planning strategizing, having fun and literally they just come in a wipe out everything in a few minutes.  They go through walls they fly, they teleport they spawn unlimited items, they can attack you from huge distance(infinite range).  If you are thinking of buying this game, don't because you can't and won't progress.  Sure you might get lucky and have some fun during those few hours when the asian scourge of hackers is actually sleeping.  But when they wake up they will just fly to your base cheat and hack.  You can report but sometimes it works but most of the time it doesn't especially if there are more of them than normal people.			"

Here's the deal: The developers pused it out of beta too fast without optimising it.

Early Access Review
								This title, like Rust is a sandbox survival game. That is, gather resources, gear up, build your base of your dreams, and fight other players.The core concept is fun, the game can be too, but there are issues. As I previously reviewed, ""You can spend hours building a house, only for it to be destroyed faster than you built it while you sleep."" this game punishes those who either don't have a large, active clan, or those who have other responibilities. IE: School or work. Playing solo, to build a respectable building and start upgrading can take 1-3 hours, depending on pace, and threats (Players or monsters). The fact that you can log off for dinner, and come back to have all your work destroyed in under an hour is defeating. Essentially, the game's design punishes players unwilling, or unable to put forth greater time and effort to build an impenetrable base. Rest assured, even at your best, your base can still be breached and destroyed by a top tier player with time and a lock pick. While hackers numbers have lowered, they're still an issue as well.If you're a casual gamer who doesn't mind getting murdered, and struggling to build, this game can be for you. But if you're with alot of friends or have a tremendous amount of time on your hands, this game was made for you.			"

												I tried to play Reign Of Kings. Overall the game was heavily optimized, I ran it at a solid 80fps, however if you look at it from a gameplay perspective, the game throws you in with no knowledge of what the ♥♥♥♥ you are doing, that being said I bashed a tree and got stones, I picked up boulders that where 10x the size of my character. I saw a castle on the top of a hill, so I decided to venture out and investigate. Whilst my journey I came across 3 different variations of chickens, a solid red one, a solid yellow one, and a solid orange one. 10 minutes later of boulder grabbing and tree bashing I reach my destination, which was completely blocked off by a rival guild called the ""Pig ♥♥♥♥ers"". I was very curious to see the castle so I attempted to scale along the mountain, which soon led to me falling off the mountain, landing then jumping off a rock, then to my death from 4ft height. So here's my ratings, Crafting System: 4/10 Gameplay: 2/10 Graphics: 5/10. Overall 1/10 totally unrecommended. (Plus I didn't even mention character creation. (You can create a midget character that has the width of a tree branch, and have a tiny ♥♥♥♥ing hitbox.			"

												I liked it and i still do but the reasons below show why i have a bad review for this game and how bad it has gotten:I wanted to like this game as I love Medieval 'sandbox' fantasy games; however, desipte trying out multiple servers (at least a dozen) everyone had the same exact thing. Huge disappointment & waste of time.* Servers were nearly dead* Those left of the servers hacked* Hackers flying around* Destroying your base without destroying the crest* Building on top of your base even though you have an intact crest* Speed hacks* There's massive clipping issues* People warping through walls* Even though the servers aren't full, there's still massive lagI could go on and on about the hacks, but even without the hack, this game is still unfinished but it is being ""sold"" as a completed game when it should not be. If this game was a stock, the SEC would be getting involved.			"

Early Access Review
								Probably the worst waste of money I have experienced this year. Where to start..1, You can get killed while you are logged off. Now I know a few games have this ""feature"" (rust) which would be ok if you could take reasonable precautions to protext your ""struff"" while you are offline, Unfortunately, there are a lot of (for want of a better word) idiots in the game who will go out of their way to destroy what you have - either by just bashing the crap out of your base while you are away or by using a Trebuchet.2. I guess this is related to the type of game it is, but I found (on several servers) a very poisonous bunch of people who will go out of their way to give you a hard time just for the sake of it, I made a comment on one occasion that its a shame there was no built in map feature to which several replaied that I should press ""alt + F4"". A few minutes later another new player asked something in general chat and received the same reply.3. The game itself is very ""basic"" and well deserves its status as being a pre-release build. There are many bugs and its simply just ""not finished"". I mean even a fairly basic thing such as a mapping feature. I mean this is not rocket science. Object collision is flakey to say the least and on occasion, stuff just dissapears! Several times I have been hunting say a wolf only to have it vanish at the last minute!In hindsight I should have got my money back. lesson learnt. My advice, avoid at all costs! Its mainly populated by ""young"" (or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) people and I predict that it will die natural death in due course. "

												I do not recommend this game to any player who wants to build a home and actually get weapons before they are killed by several knights in a what can only be explained as ground-hog day for everytime you restart. The new player is better off waiting to be killed than actually fighting, you will do litreally no damage against a armoured player and they know it and will do everything in there power to ruin your little hamlet- if you can even start it.

												I have over 200 hours played on this game, it is one of the best of it's type for both the build function and pvp/pve.I however DO NOT recommend buying this game because the hackers or game mechanics that are not explained have completely ruined this game for me and other I know.On more than one occasion I have come back to find my base not destroyed but completely intact with my crest (a feature used to outline your territory) destroyed after I had made it invulnerable. My recommendation would be a thumbs up if it weren't for the fact that hackers make this game unplayable for people who aren't low life scum and the dev team seems to be doing nothing to fix it. On several occasions I have reported players for hacking as have other people along side me and nothing is done, I only come back to find them ♥♥♥♥ing over someone else.If you like a game that is fair and challenging buy this game when they have sorted out the anti-cheat systems and not before, because right now if I could I would ask for a refund.I bought this game a week into it's alpha release and have stuck with it this far, with this review I delete it from my machine and will not play it again and I will stop recommending people spend their money on it at all.

												Hackers. Solution? Got to a bought server or buy your own. A. Bought servers have tyrannical admins that ban at slightest provocation.B. Not buying a server on top of paying $20 for this game. Aside from having to now work as a Server Admin. This is a game, not a job. C. If it is just going to be me after maybe a day of stale gameplay as everyone who joins the server: Quits from gameplay that quickly gets stale, hacks and gets kicked/banned, or generally ruins the game by trolling and gets kicked/banned then there really is no reason for me to get a server let alone this game.Do not buy it. Play Minecraft it you really need to.  "

												This game was great when I played on it. However, there are just too many reasons why I can't recommend it.-Support isn't great-Frequent updates that required server wipes. You didn't want to put any time into building anything because it would be wiped within a month.-Server hosting is not very customizable.-Maps weren't unique or different.All in all, I spent a good amount of time on this game, and hosted a server for it, but given where it was and is, I can't recommend it yet.

												Ok so watch the videos, then watch lets plays. The game is no where close enough to the experiences you see. There are only two maps, which arnt that big. And so the game loses its replayability solely based on new experience. There just isnt any.Once you've figure out the game, you begin to notice how much there is stuff left out, and that the game could be so much more. The game could have vegitable soup at least, or wine. You know, be a little more like the pictures you see. But nope. The creators moved onto another project, and what it is, we'll have to wait and see.There is a biog problem with bugs too. And in servers that have no ping limit, others from other countries could come in, and when you got someone from another country come in, they lag, and glitch. You are real easy to kill after that point.Forget trying to build armor and fight, you dont keep anything once you die.But I hate to be all negative. The game is fun with friends, and you could roleplay for hours. That's really where the replayability comes in. And that's the only thing too.The crafting is clever, and the fighting sequence could be a bit more improved, but compared to most, its alot of fun. I definitly enjoyed the game. Done with it now since my friends no longer wish to play. And without friends, there is no point in playing the inevitable. Do I recomend this game? I would if it was still being worked on.			"

												I liked it at first.. you can have a few fun days sometimes but before long you WILL come to despise yourself and everyone around you. I see the updates are including lots of exploit fixes but as long as they exist this game (and certain games like it) just won't make the grade. It's like a frickin episode of Reboot where the virus keeps invading the game. My life is a cartoon. Also the polish, fit and finish, story (still with the Plague Victims? or whatever); Not that I need a story here. It's a fun concept but hackers ruin everyone's fun. We can only assume some troubled upbringing for the hackers. Most likely out of their hands, a dysfunctional home, no chance to gain the basic tools needed to interact with other human beings. Still, no shame in feeling not one ounce of empathy for them.			"

												if only this game worked out, great idea. the bug that destroys crests, too much.   shut down the officials, until you fix this bug.   there is only damage that comes to the game from leaving  it operating in this state.   ""crest destroy bug"" means you can do everything right and still lose your base for no reason of fault, your property claim just oop and disappears.    too devastating, dont let anymore proud RoK lovers like myself  turn to uninstalling.  we are few in # already.    i want to congrate codehatch on the following things- fixing duping- fixing speed hackboth of these were in the game for far too long, its nice to see that go.i want to suggest to codehatch the following- remove fishing system and fish/insects  (optimization!)- add anything, doesn't matter what (more clothing, a map, more weapons)- ensure the basics.  you guys must be working with a plate of spaghetti (rok code).   why are crests disappearing a year after the game goes official?   holy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sheet.   i haven't felt this in a long time, what do you call it? i think its hate.  yeah i am pretty upset because i was so attached to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.

An advise to everyone:Avoid Code}{atch like the plague.And I wouldn't even recommend the game if it were on sale.But even if you really lose all your sanity, ignore every fact about this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥and buy this game: Make sure you have your own(!) private server (with maybe at least one friend - if you find one).

The community RP servers are great. All they need is a little bit more active people. I've also heard things such as bad optimization. I haven't noticed.

Only noobs build base for 1 day! You just need a company of 2 players, you build your base for 2 hours, you play and upgrade it. You go to sleep. You wake up and base is still there, you continue to upgrade base to be safer. When you are done you make weapons, trebuchets and ballistas, you go and loot other guys which didn't follow thease steps, yo take their whole house and upgrade your house wit them, the looted guys go and write stupid reviews about the game.

								This game is really cool. I'm not regret a single penny that I've spend on this game. I don't know why there is so much hate and complaining about this title. Lags depends from server not game itself. When I was reading those negativ reviews i laughed really hard. I spent 30 hours at this moment playing this game and I think this is very good product even in alpha stage. Of course there are some bugs, but almost every game on early access has some. I don't know too much about previous title released by those developers, but I heard it was bad game and I don't really care. Give them chance to show you that they have learned from their previous mistakes and now they have released very good game. I just want to ask people to stop write reviews without any wise statements, for example ""There is no offline mode"", because it is just silly and immature.			"

Hopefully they continue to add more things to enjoy while they polish other things off.Character customization is pretty good so far,  you can make your character look goofy or similar to that of a cartoon character or you can try to even things out for a normal image.  I also respect the Banner customization,  although it could use more sigils to pick from.    It feels good to choose a sigil and give it a color,  then shoose a color of the backround etc.    It is great to place your ""crest"" in-game and have your banner displayed on it as well as letting visitors know whose land they tread upon.  Whether you refer to your guild as a House,  Clan,  Order,  Cult,  etc.,  or some other such thing,  it can be personal,  or you can join another player by swearing fealty to theirs and adopt their banner by doing so.    Once again this indirectly helps rp for those who wish to rp family members or property to create a more sustainable community/gaming experience.    If you play on a server with ppl who do not suffer from a lack of vision,  you might be able to forge alliances and establish neighor and guest rights while political intrigue developes itself.  Like in most of these types of games,  there is lag at times,  there are cheaters/exploiters abroad,  dealing with servers hosted by strangers usually sucks because it's a hit and miss trying to find responsible hosts that don't exploit(or allow thier friends to exploit).    That being said this game still presents much potential for capitolizing on certain concepts and implementing them in a logical manner.  It took me a while to upgrade my fist castle attempt,  while testing out the various craftable technology(forge,  windmill.  torture devices,  execution devices,  cages,  weapons,  armor,  hanging objects,  wall objects,  ground things,  small banners,  Large banners!,  doors,  windows,  etc.),  They have plenty of weapons but could use color dyes or more armor sets to help with faction-ing.   The graphics aren't the best in the world but the game is fun.  The physics could use some work but I didn't care much.  I would hide in my castle and look out the the ocean during the thunderstorm environment,  the sound effects of the storm,  and intensity of the rain during these parts seemed realistic enough and caused my anxiety to grow and become overwhelmingly apparent.  In closing I would like to say that this game is fun so far and best played with friends or on servers with like-minded people.  I recommend this game for the progressive implementaion of it's concepts and the potential to supply one with actual gaming(fun).  If they manage to add enough more things to it and fix the bugs it could turn out really good.			"

								Love the game, but WAY too many hackers WAY too many, i spend hours on one server and finally get steel stuff, i log out and a hacker completely whipes my base, bare in mind it was floating, had no doors, had atleast 4 layers and it had a iron crest.I have screenshots of an invisible hacker in my base roping me.And its clear Easy Anti Cheat didnt do too much, but it stopped some hackers i suppose.Great game, but come on devs, sort these fuc*ing hackers out!

								Fantastic game. The start was a little rocky, but it gets imporved every day. The Devs are dedicated, and value their growing community. The community is spectacular. Ive had some of the greatest unscripted interactions of my life in this game. Many people take RP very seriously, and the game is perfectly suited for it. I recomend it to everyone who enjoys role play and is willing to put up with the Devs as they smooth out the kinks.Fight with honor-Alvaron			"

								Its a fun game, but the community is a bunch of annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.You will get killed all the time for absolutely no reason, if you are a fresh spawn and have literally nothing on you most people will  instantly hack away at you. Built a base? Dont worry someone will spend 5minutes smacking your walls so they can kill in your sleep. Have walls above tier 4? A hacker will just teleport in or instakill you. Dont get comfortable.The game is ok yet fun but the community almost ruins that.			"

								Bought this game thinking it would be alot of fun. Had alot of fun built a castle only moment later have it get hit once with a stone and break the wall. had everything in chests. Just what I didn't know is that other people can open them. No way to lock them at all. then a hacker came and took all of my stuff that I worked for 1 week to get. then i rebuild a base with my friend. made all of stone. 3 layer thick wall. 3 layer thick roof and base. All steel doors. Thinking no one can get in. 2 hits with a trebuche. All of our stuff gets taken. Plz dev's nerf trebuche. as of right now I do not reccomend this game unless you plan on playing on a role playing server. hackers on every server. people can take all of your♥♥♥♥♥♥in like 3 minutes. 10/10 - IGN 12 ducks out of 1 duck - Game InformerSo MLGMuch Hackervery OP trebuche			"

								Woke up on a beach, It was beautiful.The sounds of birds and gentle sea waves caressed the air.I took my first steps along the beach, it was a calm night but was still fairly hot.(lucky as I was pretty much in the nude)I continue walking till I saw a light, it seemed like a fireplace. I could smell barbecue in the air, my belly rumbled and I decided to run towards it. As I got nearer to the fire on the beach I could see 4 little people running around it and dancing. I stopped running and walked. “Hey guys!” I shouted. They stopped moving and slowly turned towards me. One started to play the drums and another the flute, I started to laugh and complement them as the tune they were creating was very good. The two other midgets came closer, one shouted “Hmmm tasty” as they walk towards me. He out of know got a gigantic iron sword. I immediately halted, “Hey, I come in peace”.I lost sight of the other small guy but he had actually ran behind me. As the midget with the massive sword came towards me, the midget behind me tied me. My body suddenly flopped. “What are you doing!” I shouted on the top of my voice. “We are doing what we must do” said one of the little guys. They put me onto a Guillotine. “You don’t have to do this, I wasn’t going to do anything” I cried. Out of no where a guy approaches. “Put that wee lad down” he says as I smell a sour onion sort of smell caress the air. “IS that… is it… thats…. It’s Shrek!” I Call out. “Help me please” He reveals his ogre sized sword and destroys the midgets. “Oh your my hero mr shrek!” he keeps me in the guillotine and strokes my forhead, he says “I child, nothing to be scared now. I’m here wee boy” As he walks behind me. “whaa aren’t you going to let me out?” I ask, “Not yet” I feel being whispered into my left ear with his warm onion breath. That was the last I ever saw of this guy, as my computer decided to disconnect from the internet. The mystery is that my body would have been there left logged in for a few minutes… I wonder if I did ever get set free.17/5.6 would defiantly order from this seller again!			"

								This game has an ok premise. The problem is that it has some sort of memory leak. It crashes about every 5 minutes for me. (I5, radeon 280 graphics card, 8gb ram, windows 8, and on low[er] settings than it defaulted on) Not only that, but I just got auto banned from a server while restarting the game after crashing. Admins say that it is because ""a DLL is different."" They also say that it is an automatic thing that is 1 day to start off with. I validated the game. 100% validated. No files were different, or needed.This game is garbage. Do not buy.  Going to see if Valve will refund. If not, I am going to do a charge back.			"

												This game is not worth 20$. 5$ at best.At one point when the developers actually cared about this game 20$ felt right because updates were coming out, bugs were being fixed at an appropriate rate, you had hope that they would stop hackers, and content was being added. There is no security in this game, EAC is currently installed but that doesnt matter, it literally takes one dishonest person to spawn in 10,000 of every item and boom the entire server is ruined for a month and it makes the game pointless to play.In December of 2015 this game was released after being in ALPHA for less than a year, beta for two months, then boom polished product....Well after almost 1800 hours I feel let down. There is just not enough content for your buck. In the Sand box/Survival genera Reign of Kings just isnt up to par for what a 20$ game should have provided.The Developers didnt listen to the community during any phase in the game, even when topics would get a huge community support. SHAME on you. Whats the point of even pinning the community suggestion list? what a joke. I just feel bad at this stage in the game if you purchase this game, you just wont experience what everyone else has experienced because the fun train is gone and left the building....			"

Also if you want to be king forget about it there is always some greedy f**cking chinese kid basically on a lot of servers that I have joined that will block the entrance to the ""evil"" castle, no one can get in. Especially if they put this stupid thing to protect their stuff... Not only that when they log then they can always stay king on that server basically. Terrible, terrible game... Why the castle on a ledge of some rocks so no one can flank or anything just frontal attack, DUMB! Also the siege equipment and all that is a load of horse s**t too. You build something someone new or old will come buy kill you loot everything and destroy everything. Be a fresh spawn and get killed by some other fresh spawn. The communication is not there litttterrrallllyyyy... I talk to some people and their mics cut out and everything to the point you can't understand a word they say, in result they will kill you.

Here is my review on Reign Of Kings. The review is based on my opinion and my experiences with the game.Hope this helps you on your decision whether you want to buy the game or not!Pros / ConsPros-Good combat system-A lot of roleplay on most servers-Nice building system-2 maps with a lot to doCons-Still pretty laggy-Devs have pretty much given up on this game-BugsConclusion / verdictIt is a pretty solid game with a couple of bugs here and there.The only problem is that the developers are not a big part in the community and they don't do a lot with the game. It's hard to reach them and they still haven't fixed bugs that have been here for over a year now. It's really the community that makes this game enjoyable.If you're looking for a cool medieval game with lots of roleplay (politics) and a solid combat system this game is absolutely for you. However, don't be surprised if the devevelopers let you down.7/10 "

												If you can put up with the occasional base disappearance on some servers, buy this game. If you can put up with losing everything after weeks of farming resources, buy this game. If you can put up with animals being able to run on the ocean floor, buy it. Or if you can put up with server lag which can kill you, buy the game. Yes this game has it's pathetic bugs that make you wanna kill someone even when the game is apparently fully released, but this game can give hours of fun once you get into it. If you survived Rust with your mental health still intact, then you'll survive this game. Just remember, trust no one. Escpecially the New Zealanders.They will steal your sheep.			"

												After playing 16 hours, I can say that ""Reign of kings"" is a complex game, very funny and makes you play at least 1 to 2 hours per day ... however the pvp battle system is unpolished, and in my case, I find it difficult to fight against other players, whom earn advantage over me, it seems a rather difficult game for novice or rookies players for this reason, it is too frustrating. Evaluating these aspects do not recommend the game, because if you're a rookie, you will be very hard to start playing, unless you can create a private server to play alone or with your friends.			"

												These developers are pretty terrible at fixing bugs that have existed for MONTHS.  I stopped playing the game because it was a hackfest and was pretty much unplayable due to being unoptimized.  I come back after nearly 6 months and there are still blatantly obvious bugs (i.e. crafting items and they don't even show up in the completed box).  They claim the game is feature complete just like they did with their previous game, Starforge, when it obviously is not.Do not buy this laggy, buggy, piece of abandoned garbage.			"

												It's kind of good fun and interesting, to start with. Ater your first time getting brutally murdered over and over st the spawn you learn to run and hide and make friends cautiously.Combat is a little like Chivalry but with all the coordination and skill taken out. It could be much better but it works I guess.The game itself is compelling and interesting but the community is what lets it down most. Griefing is constant and gets boring fast. No rage quit more meh quit. That is the biggest flaw I think; any time infested in this game will be wasted as soon as you log off.Each time you log on its like starting from scratch because your buildings will have been destroyed and you probably killed in your sleep just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.You quickly learn it's futile to play and stop trying. For £3.74 it's earned its money but I'm no mug who will keep playing. Love the concept and will be finding something similar but better.			"

												First: This game can be absolutely fun (instruments, trebuchets and e̶̶x̶̶e̶̶c̶̶u̶̶t̶̶i̶̶o̶̶n̶̶s̶ building)  but there are some things you usually need for that first:-friends you can play with-a good community server or your own server-other players that aren't annoyingThe thing is that it's quiet hard to fulfill these requirements.To example after finishing my house on a community server two guys were breaking the door.They said they would kill me. Raiding for no reason on daytime was forbidden on the sever and it WAS daytime.So I threw javelins at them and a moment later I got kicked because "" I did not give a reason. ""And also the performance is sometimes bad. At least the music is epic!Please think about such things before buying this game or you may be disappointed.If you want to give it a try you should probably buy it in sale like I did.			"

												400+ hours I've put into this game, largely because I'm a fan of the building mechanics and the pve elements that you can find on certain community servers. Had a blast playing the game, building massive bases solo and had the odd problem with hackers or greifers coming in and taking my stuff. Nevertheless, I always thought that this game could have been a lot more than it was. A game that could have rivaled some of the best given its unique deliverables like the building system, the crests etc. Alas, it was not meant to be. Although I still hope that the devs maybe revisit the game, or that they open it more to the modding community to do something greater with this game, because this game caters not only to the pvp, but also to the pve element. It does a lot of core thing correctly, but now, I wish there was more time spent on creating more content for this game. Maps, game modes/styles, more things to build, harder things to create, more elements of siege etc. With this being medieval based, the roleplaying capabilities could have been far more than what it is today.Would I advise buying the game? At full price, not a chance. While on sale, maybe. If you're into building, check out some youtube videos and make your decision on that basis. It's a good game...just incomplete. And likely won't ever really fulfill your ""medieval experience"" (All I wanted are double doors and a fountain LOL)			"

								I believe this game has a lot of potential. For example, It is fun and realistic in which you progress, it has amazing designs that do not need to be improved and overall it's very enjoyable... that shows me that that work can be done to make the game even better... however, there is always problems. Exept that this game, has A LOT of problems. Mostly mechanically. Uhh... also the horrible bugs, the horrible, horrible... bugs. Let me note a few: First, there seems to be a bug where if your network connection is bad and you leave a game, then shut the game down and get back in to the same server, you'll randomly die. I'm not sure if that is the correct meaning, but it doesn't happen when you appear as a man in a bed free to die at any point, that is for sure. Not too long ago I relized that you can actually double-jump up walls (if they don't have anything extending out of them) making you Altair... the ultimate assassin. Also, containers, workbenches, granarys, campfires through tiers, and all accessable objects will lock up saying 'occupied' although nobody is in them. Only momentarily... luckily. Onto the right-out-there problems : First of all, armour does NOTHING AT ALL. It really sucks and needs to be fixed. Now last, the weapons aren't equal AT ALL. After you grind those hours trying to get that steel great sword... you get creamed by a newspawn with nothing but some driftwood. Did I tell you that the driftwood club is also the BEST weapon? By any means, this review ends here.			"

								One word: hackers. I just can't make any progress in the game basically because some kids decide it's fun to insta-kill everyone. I don't mind if their hacking were limited to their own characters like flying but having all your items dissapear each time you work your butt off, well it wears down on you. So until they eliminate hackers, I'd recommend to stay away from this game.			"

								All the negative reviews I've read are about a few things: Not enough content, bugs, and hackers.Tell me something, do you always purchase Alpha games and expect finished products? There is plenty of content already in the game and a lot more being designed and implemented into the game already. Obviously there are going to be bugs since we are TESTING a game in its ALPHA stage. Duh. Hackers are a problem in every Alpha game because they're in the middle of working on security and finding what works, if you have a problem with hackers call a server admin and get compensated for what was lost and get the hacker banned. Easy as that.All in all this game is absolutely amazing and a load of fun. You build up and raid people or take the throne and when you finally get raided and lose it all you get to do it again, which is what keeps the game fun. This is obviously meant to be an open world PvP game with the ability to build amazing bases, what more could you want? I would GLADLY have paid two or three times as much money as I did and I still would have gotten my moneys worth. Lets put it this way:                                 If you know what an Alpha game is and are looking for some fun, get it.                                  If you do not know what an Alpha game is do not purchase this game.			"

It wasnt long before they nearly stopped working on the game all together other than some minor crap they add in the ""patches"" they release. (98% of the recent patches are ""exploit"" fixes that dont even fix any major problems that plague the game.)I don't care if CodeHatch makes the next big game, I wont be buying it. This is TWICE now they have shown off a promising Early Access title that has just fallen off the map and was forgotten about. All they had to do was work a tad bit harder and the game could still be generating revenue with an active population but they have proven multiple times they dont have one ♥♥♥♥ to give.			"

For example i was fighting another player but they kept dissapearing from my screen during combat and I lost all of my gear and resources. Once when i was walking around while wearing full steel armour and I was roped by an invisiable, flying man who took me to a far end of the map and hung me. A spread of resources has improved, but on the map crownland i find it almost impossible to collect resources such as iron and stone without running into other players who will not hesitate to kill you and send you back to square one. Overall i found this game frustrating and annoying, despite how fun it really is. It should not have been released and the developers really need to take some time to fix the errors in this game.

Once when i was walking around while wearing full steel armour and I was roped by an invisiable, flying man who took me to a far end of the map and hung me. A spread of resources has improved, but on the map crownland i find it almost impossible to collect resources such as iron and stone without running into other players who will not hesitate to kill you and send you back to square one. Overall i found this game frustrating and annoying, despite how fun it really is. It should not have been released and the developers really need to take some time to fix the errors in this game. I would not reccomend it to anyone.			"

												I would not purchase this game. Most importantly, the creators of this game are known to make early access games and never update them. (Which is mostly the case here) For the gameplay, he game is fun for the first two hours, but it gets frustrating when better players come and kill you for no reason. The hackers are also a huge problem, as there are so many. The game also has huge lag spikes, even if you have a great computer. (Which I do) Overall, I would rate this a 3/10, and would not buy it until they fix it. If you want a good RPG survival game, I would reccomend Rust.			"

												Hello. I am a new player but I have noticed some things that I feel like need fixed: 1. The poor optimization. 2. The Lagg. 3. Works on Combat. 4. Just some small issues. The 2 main big ones are optimization and Lagg. That should really be fixed and if they are, this game could be one of the best survival games. Please Devs, don't let us down!			"

												Personnally, I loved this game, despite hackers(Which are less frequent than one would think, and are sometimes just funny)Examples of hackers i hate-♥♥♥♥ing seige engines everywhere, literally can't build on the mapExamples of hackers im fine with-Goes in, kills hacker king, then dupes his loot and gives everyone in game that loot by noclipingBasically what im trying to say, is that the biggest problem with this game is that the community is just a huge bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I mean, dont get me wrong. You can swing your♥♥♥♥♥♥around aswell, and thats what it feels like sometimes, just a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥trying to ruin eachothers day. The ONLY way to play this game is with a friend you TRUST, because honestly, nothing is worse than haveing everything you work on being taken by a ""Friend"" after about 3 full days of playing on a server. That being said I've had some truly enjoyable times playing this game. For example, once I had full teir armor and the kings sword, and I had to defend WAVES of little black midgets(Their guild was the black midget army, which was hilarious) And they stopped their onslaught after about the 10 wave of deaths. They got my sword and armor tho;-;This game can be fun, and since I got it on sale, it was certainly worth $10. I reccomend buying it on sale, just like any other title. Just remember that noone should be trusted, and your play experience will vastly improve. And do the community a favor, STOP GREIFING NEWSPAWNS. Thanks.			"

												The game itself aint bad, but very circumstamtial. If you catch a good wipe with few known bugs and good guild. It will be fun. Otherwise, do not waste your 5 euro. It used to cost 20 now massive drop and sale, I wonder did the dev team just doom it to cheap last min sales. Last update broke more things than fixed. Will that be addressed or fixed I dont know. Certainly working on a base for 200+ hours with team of 10 people to see it taken due to crest bug or time warp bug is not encouraging to say the least. Overall - Do not buy this even for a 5er. One day they might fix this game to an extent it is playable.			"

 I have played this game for just 12 hours, which are a very few for a game, but just for a lot of reasons.	This game is very frustrating in my opinion, and I wouldn't recommend it even for the price:The fights are very laggy, just consider, you're fighting with a sword against a guy, and he instantly slips to your right, and it lags so much that then you both don't even realize what happened, till one kills the other with a lucky hit.The game, last time I played, was full of nerds who had built castles high to the end of the sky, and captured me 2 minutes after I spawned, and then a 12-year-old idiot shouted in the damn mic ""HAHA! I GOT YOU!"".Oh, to build a house you need to take resources for at least 6 hours and, if you die, you'll lose all your items, and you'll respawn somewhere 2000 miles away from there.P.S. The devs totally left the game; Before buying this game I trusted the devs and didn't trust much the reviews. Once in the game, well, I felt kinda stupid because I had not trusted the people who had reviewed the game, they were right in most cases. The only positive thing about this game, it's that there's an exit button and the alt+f4 button works.	 "

Pros.Very fun game..There is a bit of stuff to do.Really good medieval atmosphere..Lots of stuff to craft.Good to play with friends.Good priceCons.Devs are Horrible, they have abandoned the game.Game is SO badly coded which makes it very easy to make cheats for. Even though they get EAC Banned eventually they can do lots of damage before they get banned. The devs can fix the issue fairly easy but they don't..Not that many people playing.Quite a few bugsOverall it is a very good game but the Devs are selfish and have abandoned the game because of too much work or not enough sales. Even when they did do updates it was like 1-2 little bug fixes each month. Also the game is so badly coded and because of that you will most likely run into cheaters. The cheaters can use god mode and spawn stuff in and cause all sorts of problems. The game is fixable, the devs have to recode some bits of the game but they choose not too. If you find a good server it is worth a buy.Do not trust anything made by these developers. Once they get everything they can from this game they will abandon it and start a new project. Which they have ( Remember Starforge biggest cash grab I've seen. Made by the same guys ) Do Not Trust These People! "

												Ok game.Lacks content gets boring fast and too be honest isn't worth anything more than 5 pounds.Can be fully completed in about a week if you play 3 hours every day and lacks things to do.The game can be fun to just troll random people by putting them in a guillotine or to be hanged.Also fun to chuck people in jail and steal there stuff and make slaves to get items but other than that theres no point buying the game.

								All the negative reviews I've read are about a few things: Not enough content, bugs, and hackers.Tell me something, do you always purchase Alpha games and expect finished products? There is plenty of content already in the game and a lot more being designed and implemented into the game already. Obviously there are going to be bugs since we are TESTING a game in its ALPHA stage. Duh. Hackers are a problem in every Alpha game because they're in the middle of working on security and finding what works, if you have a problem with hackers call a server admin and get compensated for what was lost and get the hacker banned. Easy as that.All in all this game is absolutely amazing and a load of fun. You build up and raid people or take the throne and when you finally get raided and lose it all you get to do it again, which is what keeps the game fun. This is obviously meant to be an open world PvP game with the ability to build amazing bases, what more could you want? I would GLADLY have paid two or three times as much money as I did and I still would have gotten my moneys worth. Lets put it this way:                                 If you know what an Alpha game is and are looking for some fun, get it.                                  If you do not know what an Alpha game is do not purchase this game.			"

Spending hours and hours to building somthing just for a hacker to come on by and destory it is a second, will make anyone quit the game.

												I enjoyed this game alot back then when Reign of kings first released. Though this game is failing to live up anymore and the community has gotten less and less. When this game started as early access so much elements were told and being added. People were playing reign of kings because of the potential of this game because of how great this game could become. Unforunatly the game became offically released one day, which threw off people because there wasn't exciting features that were new therfor failing to live up the game, so players simply became bored.The game is fun at times and i do props for the all 400 hours i got out of it, but Anyone who buys this game espically at -75% discount right now. It will be a letdown as you will you get killed on sight, people will raid u with thier friends, if you try to melee some people most of the time people use hacks or lagswitch, above all some big community servers had to shut down because of ddossing. Don't recommend it.-First review i did, had to get off my chest- "

								This game would probably be fun with friends, but since its so hard to make them in this game, your just going to waste your money if you buy it. But if you have friends who actually have this game, great. That is if you are able to find them and band together to fight the evil other players that have no hearts.RP servers are just as violent as the PVP servers. The no KOS rule goes right out the window, and the active admins that are apparently watching the servers are most likely butt ♥♥♥♥ing themselves since they really dont seem to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥on what happens in the server.If you love games that are all about killing and surviving, this is for you.

												This game is good but its bad at the same time. Its so bad its good, like those crappy B-Rated horror movies like Sharknado that people will go out of their way to watch with a group of friends. I've dicked around quite a bit in this game and have had a massive amount of fun playing the jenky-game with my friends. The early access glitchy-ness was appealing. But, I'm going to rate this negitively because of one key aspect:This is it. The game is finished as it is.I supported this game until Code}{atch, the developer, once again abandoned a project mid-way through. I bought this in beta a while back, expecting a lot more to come of the game. A friend of mine made a brilliant point ""I couldn't tell if this was a glitch or a feature of the game"" and that essentially describes a lot of the poor mechanics of the gameplay. This wouldn't be a problem but the developer decided that, one day, it was time to release the game in full! So this is it. This is the entire game in all of its (glory?). I wouldn't reccomend it. Its on sale for $4.99 and it isn't even worth that much content-wise. There's NOTHING in this game. Its in dire need of being updated and unfortunately it just won't really happen at this point.Not to mention the fact that they didn't even incorperate region-locking for the online servers, so there are massive amounts of vigilante chinese-hackers ruining servers so average players like me can't function properly and play the game the way its supposed to be played. I hade to make my own game out of it and create different goals aside from the main goal. At least it supports creativity, I guess... I'm pretty decent at the game, but I'm just sick of going on a North American server and seeing invincible chinese players spamming chinese characters in the chat that I can't read. Its sloppy and region locking should be incorperated in every game.			"

(TL:DR at the bottom)When I heard of this game and it's possibilities, I was like: ""Hell yeah, I'm gonna play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it"". Soon I was disapointed. The game is very unique and it would be one of the best games only if developers (CodeHatch) would take care of it. It's a little bit better if you play with friends.I will start with hackers. The game has a terrible anti-cheat system, you basically put in hours to make your base just so a naked guy with a club would beat you to death because he has unlimited ammount of health and you don't.The game only has 2 maps, which would be okay, if they weren't generating the same ammount of recourses in the same places every time.The game is buggy as hell and the servers don't run properly. Let's not talk about data-leaks and wipes that happen not so rarely.TL:DR - full of bugs and hackers, can't go to sleep because of it.			"

It used to cost 20 now massive drop and sale, I wonder did the dev team just doom it to cheap last min sales. Last update broke more things than fixed. Will that be addressed or fixed I dont know. Certainly working on a base for 200+ hours with team of 10 people to see it taken due to crest bug or time warp bug is not encouraging to say the least. Overall - Do not buy this even for a 5er. One day they might fix this game to an extent it is playable.			"

												This IS an awesome medieval game that CAN best be enjoied after you get some skill with a weapon. Otherwise, a New spawn with a club CAN end you even if you wear Steel. ONe of my friends bought the game a week ago,and at first, he almost uninstalled the game after rageing when getting killed by a New spawn.But after some practice with me and with some weapons he really got INTO the game and now he really loves it even though at first he almost deleted it			"

								To begin with, the offline system is quite bad. player have to make strong shelter so he can protect his body when he is in sleep (when u log off) or other player will kill u and take all your items. + there are hackers. randomly kills u...those ppl has weird numeric name. so beware. other than these issues its really fun game you build your own buildings, make tools, items etc.			"

Highly reccomend running your own servers for just your people. That aside, it is sad that this game will no longer update.

								So far the game is a ton of fun to play especially if you have some friends to play it with. For a game in alpha it already has a ton of stuff in it crafting, weapons, the ability to build houses and more. Just the crazy things i have done in it so far like dangling a man who assulted the king by a rope into a pit with a bear and then making him fight the bear with a stick (he lost by the way). I also like the concept of the king and how he can really influence what i happening in the game. The only problem so far is that i did run into a few hackers but it is only day 3 so as long as they clean that up quickly this is definitely a game i would suggest you pick up			"

								This game is acually pretty damn terrible. Most Admins i have seen abuse their powers terribly. Char will randomly die for no reason or at least a reason you cant really figure out. I thought maybe this would be cool, like rust and chiv mixed together. Mostly KIDS play this game (all that needs to be said). If you would like to play a real game then play LIFYO (which unfortunatly is broken ATM with the new claim system) . If LIFYO was not broken ATM i wouldnt have purchased this game.The only positive thing i can think to say about this game is the bugs / char generation are extremely entertaining. Aside from that i guess $20 for a lot of laughs is worth it in a way. I give this overall a bad review due to the game not being Original. Seems like every MMO will play just like WOW. Now every survival game is compared to RUST, and all play the same. Companys need to stop smashing this♥♥♥♥♥♥out for people to buy thinking its worth the time.			"

								Update* It appears the hacker problem has gone down which does help out the game. I will still leave my past comments up but know that hackers are much less of an issue. People just griefing is still very much real on public severs. (You can find good private ones but those are generally hard to get into) A lot of the updates were good starts and I am liking the direction this game is heading so far. I would probably give this game a 5 out of 10 so still a not recommend. Servers are kinda small, Resets are way to often which I understand is ""needed"" but it really makes playing the game seem pointless because all your work just goes away. Combat still a bit clunky but it is improvingAt this point in time I do not say this game is worth buying.  I love pretty much everything this game stands for. I love the whole Medivial Sandbox Survival game. It is fun being able to build giant fortresses with your friends and go out and battle other groups of people. Sadly there are a lot of flaws in the whole design of this game. Flaws List:1. Hackers galore: There are soooo many hackers in this game. They can fly, move quicker, duplicate items, teleport through walls, take you hostage in .5 to 1 second, can destroy the forts you worked so hard in seconds and leave you with nothing. This is the worst part of the game by far and with hackers in this game I would rate it at a 0 out of 10 because it is just not enjoyable for anyone who doesn't hack.2. Greifing to the max: The amount of people who play this game just to screw over other people is insane. (These are the non hacker griefers) I would probably rate the game 5 out of 10 because of the greifers if there wereno hackers. This game caters way too much to the griefers. It's less of a survival game and more build enough stuff till you can♥♥♥♥♥♥over everyone else game.2A. The greifers who will go around the map looking for people who are just trying to collect resources, tie them up, throw them in the stockades and leave them there till they die of hunger/ thirst. (Make sure to shove sharp stones up your bum because thats the only way to kill yourself when you are trapped) I am okay with these guys they make the game more annoying but they are not actually doing much to destroy the game for other players. They are annoying but they do add a bit of a thrill to the game. It is the other style of greifers that do that really destroy the game.2B. Base destroyers: These guys come onto the server at off ours (when there are few people) and go around with siege weapon and completely destroy peoples base when they have no way to defend themselves. So when you log back after sealing up your huge castle of a fort that you and your guild spent 10+ hours building you find yourself on the beach naked and when you go back to your castle all you find that your base is all gone after they broke through ur walls, destroyed your crest, replaced it with their own and then went on their way taking every last block you worked so hard collecting.2C. Greifer kings who generally work in a guild of 5+ and then set the taxes at 20% and then go around the map being like the other 2 types.3. The combat system: The combat system is a bit wonky. Because of how poorly this game is opitimized you will be hit by lag spikes and frame drops during fights. This means that what you think should be a direct hit is a complete miss or what you think is a good dodge is you running right into the guys swing. Then there is the fact that if you are in steel armor using a 2 handed weapon you move and attack so slowly that a naked guy can just run around you and kill you with a weak weapon. He will just run behind you as you wind up your swings and kill you if he is even semi competent (as can be used by you to take down armored guys with 2 handed weapons) This needs fixed because whats the point getting armor unless you are in a large brawl where you just swing randomly hitting whatever moves. 1v1 it is more of a detrement than a help.4. Server resets (100% wipes to the almost 1 an hour you get because of dupers): The first one while expected because this is an early access game is also the more annoying of the 2. About once or twice a week you will log on to the game and find that you need to remake your character. That also means that everything you have done on that server has been wiped and you are back to square one. Meaning if you are the type of person who spends tons of time farming to build big forts you are SOL. If you are a grief it doesn't really matter because you didn't actually do anything to get all your items and you can always do it again by abusing the poor combat system. The second one is also a pain because it doesn't actually tell you when the server resets so you may be mining materials for 10 minutes only to realize when you go back to open a door or your chest that you can't because of the crash. Then when you log back in (if your server is not full making you wait spam trying to connect) you find out that not only did you not get anything you collected in the 10 minutes you were playing on the crash server but also everything from 10 minutes before that because thats the point it reset to.TLDR: I would give this game a 0/10 because of hackers and the fact it seems to favor greifers over people playing to build cool forts and have interesting battles instead of 5v1. If you are a hacker or greifer though this game gets a 10/10 you will love it because of how easy the game is to exploit. If the developer gets rid of the hackers this game would probably be a 5/10 and if they balance the game so the greifers can't just destroy peoples bases while they are logged off and they lowered the number of server wipes to like once every 2 weeks or once a month I would give this game an 8 our of 10. Then all that is left is making the combat a bit smoother they would have a 9/10 or maybe even a 10/10			"

								The game itself is fun, despite the regular alpha stuff. The community on the other hand is cancerous to the core. Hackers, terrible servers, RDM everywhere, griefing. Expect at some point to get roped as a new spawn and tortured. Your only chance is to group up with people. Solo play you might as well go back to minecraft.			"

								This game has a lot of great concepts, but is effectively KOS with no balance. If you get on a server early, and have a group of people with you to get armor and weapons, you can go around and kill noobs. To get to a point in the game to protect yourself from people killing you after you log off, you have to spend hours gathering resources. However, if you don't use the right resources, are away for too long, or just didn't realize how the game can be exploited, you'll return dead with all your hours of work gone to waste. Hackers also abound, even after some of the latest patches; while it did get a little better (was no longer getting turned into Shrek), now it seems the hackers are more subtle and using their hacks to kill other players.It will be a while before this game is interesting, and until there is better balance, it will be very frustrating for some, and just another way to troll gamers for others (you know the type).

								this review is written for alpha 6.  great game with a lot of potential. just one little niche. Full of hackers. even with the patch without a active server admin its a hack fest plus if your guild does not have members online 24/7 you get raided and hours if not days of work lost over  night.Pvp and base raiding should be seperate. Base raiding should not be allowed unless your guild is no longer active or there should be a option to allow your guild to participate in base raiding or not. fix the hacking and limit the raiding somehow and the game would be great otherwise. is it worth buying? not at this stage.

								Did not buy this game, it was gifted to me.I do not trust devs to finished thisThey're other game seen on steam ""StarForge"" was claimed to be finished (wouldn't even call it an early beta release) in late september 2014.StarForge was no where near completed and the dev's have a reputation for releasing unfinished material.I would not recommend this game. If you are looking for a medieval combat game, I would recommend Chivalry: Medeival Warfare. And if you are looking for a survival game with base building and very similar features to this, I would recommend Rust (even though I have not put many hours into Rust since that major update while back)edit:The fact that you need at minimum a 64-bit computer with an Intel core i5, a full 6GB of RAM and a GPU that appears no where near as low as I would expect for something that looks visually this unappealing. My computer is well over the recommended requirements and I got horrendous amounts of lag when looking at certain areas (not even on the top graphics settings).ConclusionI would not recommend this game or any of the developers work.This game along with many other survival games (often made simply in unity, and with assets taken from the unity asset store) has ""POTENTIAL"" and with what Steam is becoming now, potential just doesn't seem good enough for anything in my opinion.Warning this bit starts to rant more on what gets into steam!There are a large amount of games being greenlit as jokes e.g. Grass Simulator. (Who at steam allowed that crap to get into steam after it being greenlit???)VALVE, WHERE IS YOUR CONTENT MODERATION?! Where have your standards gone?(if some of this does not make sense read comments):I will now point out, survival games would not be my favourite genre (my favourite would be story rich and in-depth games), I do however continue to play the DayZ mod for ArmA II (I would compare Reign of Kings to Rust but I have not played Rust all too much sinch it's major update a while ago, so I am not in a position to compare the two) and for me Reign of Kings does not live up to the same enjoyment, exploration and accomplisment as DayZ does.Yes Reign of Kings does have very unique features (the taxing system and it trys to bring a large amount of roleplay to the game, but unfortunatly I was not able to see this), these bring the game a great deal of potential but unfortunatly it just wasn't executed as well as it could have been.This is entirely my opinion. Feel free to share yours, but please don't go all fanboy on me though ;)edit 3 (so many edits :D. Some positive points! Also this might be messy as I am tired and hungry :P):As MrJoe has pointed out in a comment, I was incorrect with some of my claims about game updates and content updates (there was one a few days ago).MrJoe also points out that Reign of Kings is in a much better state than other Alphas on Steam (main reason why I am not so fond of Steam's ""Early Access"") like DayZ standalone.As I have not played much of this game [Reign of Kings] for a while, I have been told this game has been changing in each update.I may not recommend this game in it's current state as there are other survival games that are in a better state than this. But I will revisit this review much later to determine whether this game deserves my recommendation or now.Also there are many negative reviews based around their experiences playing the game (e.g. blah blah, base raided and everything lost, blah blah), I would like to address these reviews. These people are all talking about gameplay issues, in this games state this is going to be an issue for some people due to the game not being fully balanced (gameplay issues with safe zones, clan flag (I think it's called that, can't remember the name off the top of my head) and other bugs). These reviews are mostly ignorable as I would assume that these would be some of the dev's concerns.			"

								""Other than the fact that people sometimes come through your wall(i mean w/o legitly doing so), or the noobs going around killing everything they see on sight this game is pretty fun. I would hold off for the moment but after a few more updates this will be a much better experience.""     Now as the game has updated quite a bit since I originally wrote this post and i have over 225 hours i would recommend this game. Unlike their previous title they are dedicating the time and effort to please the community. My Rating for Reign of Kings would be a 8.5/10 and hopefully rising as each update comes!			"

								Put many hours into this game, unfortunately. Complete waste of time. What you need to know: - Look up CodeHatch's reputation. This will explain what to expect from this sort of early access. - You can choose between official servers, which are rampant with cheaters - or community servers, that are rampant with double standards and admin abuse. You get banned or hacked into, either way. - Each new version requires a server wipe. I haven't personally been affected by this, but in the end - no matter what you build or collect - it will always be erased. - Community is notoriously bad in the vast majority of cases. Example: had a community guildmate ask me to borrow resources I didn't have. I didn't have anything to give him, so he came into my house (guild priveliges) and destroyed it in the same manner one would remodel/build the house while I was away. Then, brought it to the attention of a server admin, and said that the house was his, and that I destroyed it. I was banned instantly, no questions. I have had nothing but experiences like this.Bottom line - I recommend you don't give a single cent up for this game. It's a subpar game that's shoddily upkept by a notoriously shady developer. I can't imagine most gamers could stand a game like this past the first ""wipe"".			"

								This game is riddled with hackers (as of 3/29/15).  Any of the official servers are hit around once an hour; moreover, even if you start a server, it must be pswd protected, or have admins 24/7.  I don' t mind the KOS; however, it is very much a RP game and when ppl do KOS it destroys the intent of the game.  The map is very limited, and running into people quickly is very common.  I know it is very early alpha; yet there are a ton of bugs, many are game breaking,  If they could fix the hacks (which is based on how the game is setup, client side), add more PvE, and make the map larger.  I may return and try again; otherwise, I am out and uninstalling.			"

								Let me just start off by saying that I have NEVER EVER left a review on ANY game. That being said, after trying to play this game for the last few days with no avail I can personally tell you that it is in fact, at this stage in Alpha the biggest piece of sh*t that I've ever wasted $20 on. First off, if you're not crossing your f*cking fingers while you try to join a server you will get a random error message, whether you've altered the game or not (which is great since hackers can join freely and kill everyone on the server at once but normal players can't even connect. Awesome) Then there is the fact that everything lags. Literally. I joined the server for which I was rated the LOWEST ping. Guess what? Still other players lagged. You guys have a great concept and excellent promotion. I just don't see how you keep f*cking it up but, until it's fixed I couldn't rightfully reccomend this game to anyone.			"

Early Access Review
								Well then, here's the short and sweet version of my Reign of King's experience, and by short and sweet I mean a sample of what myself and my guild of 15+ people (more or less, it varies due to people leaving the game because of lack in developer interest/care) had gone through during months of RoK playing.First and foremost let me start by saying the game was a blast to play. From the beginning it was fun, simple and hacker-free with room to do whatever you want. The building was solid, becoming better as you learned which piece would fit with another to make intricate designs on castle walls, bridges, and towers. This aspect of the game was more or less 60% of your time between gathering resources and actually building it out. Combat in the beginning was lacking, and still is (but I will get to that later) and due to it being faulty, skill isn't a factor in the game and instead became all about luck. With these factors in mind, it was still playable and it kept you thoroughly entertained because these issues seemed trivial for a game in early stages. However we soon learned that mostly everything would change.Around mid-point from where the game is now, I'd say Alpha 5 or 6, things got out of control. The combat was getting worse, hit-boxes being huge on almost every point of your characters body. This caused the poke to be an absurd way to kill someone quickly requiring no skill at all. (When I tell you the hit-box is huge, I mean imagine your head was 3 feet wide and 2 feet long.) Raiding bases was way too easy, everyone learned that trebucheting a base was as easy as getting the materials for it. You load the thing with 15 shots aim and fire, the base immediately crumbling into dust with the crest fully exposed. Now I understand completely the point of the game is to siege, kill, and build. (With added perks of being the king) However when you spent 10+ hours sometimes even DAYS building your base, just to log in one day to find it completely gone, your body dead, and your loot that took you forever to get all missing in one foul swoop, you'd immediately recognize the issue with this game. Not only was raiding easy, but during the Alpha 5-6 range, hackers became prominent in the community. Everyone and their friends had free gear, free blocks, and so many other items that the servers became laggy, and the community volatile. This was the downfall of the game, however only the beginning.As time went by, the Developers became more and more lazy, less and less interested in what their community had to say. Alpha 7 and up became a slow trend of useless updates that did nothing to end the start of the collapse (that being the hackers) and how the game became unplayable because of ESP (player-spotting), Kill-Commanding, Player controlling hackers. The player control part was incredibly annoying, getting to a milestone of 10 hours on a server only to see a hacker turn you green, wipe your body of all it's loot, change your size, weight etc, etc. Not to mention they could also instantly teleport you into a bear pit causing immediate death, and this all was absolutely terrible. Granted, the Dev's added some new content, and eventually began working on EAC hack prevention, which let me tell you all, was a huge waste of time. EAC did nothing for the game, it lasted a total of 24 hours, a peaceful 24 hours that seemed too good to be true, and of course it was. Soon the hackers came back, only this time pretending to be a casual. As you played you would eventually come across someone who jumps you and or kills you with no questions asked, forcing a retaliation. When trying to get them back they'd turn out to be a hacker and over night would destroy your base completely with infinite trebuchet shots. Turning away from the hacker issues there was the update on the game engine from Unity 4.5 to Unity 5, which was delayed somewhere around 2 weeks with little to no response from the Devs. The update finally came and it was lovely, the graphics updated and new items to tinker with seemed nice but ultimately was just a face-lift on what was already ruined in the first place. More bugs came from Unity 5 than its predecessor, hackers kept on hacking, and the community was scarce but toxic. Eventually they ""fixed"" sieging, which by that I mean they nerfed ballistas into the ground rendering them useless, and tuned Trebuchet's down to a mere 500 damage a shot, 5 shot capacity (ultimately changing nothing about sieging)All in all, the game in it's current state is broken, battered and ruined. The community is thin and the developers seem to be off elsewhere while the whole thing crumbles. They rarely respond, their updates are useless, and if it's anything we've learned about Code}{atch is that they've sunk another game into the ground, and whether or not they acknowledge this, nobody knows. It's a shame though, because the game had great potential before all of the chaos arrived. If you ask me, I think they should sell the game to another Dev, or to the community and be done with it.In my honest opinion, leave this game alone, and don't waste your time with it. You'll just be putting more money into the pit like the rest of us.			"

								Reign Of Kings is a survival game and is a whole lot of fun.this game is flawed, yes! but it also has potential and value, like an uncut diamond. let me elaborate.the good things about ROK (reign of kings for you dummies out there <3)the game is fairly easy to learn, with the complex combat system + the uncomplex way to build castles this game is a game you can easily learn well after about 20hrs ingame, to become a good fighter ofc will take some more practice, not that im a good figther, i suck.if you are on a lan party this game will bring many hours of good fun, the community in the game is really good, and alot of people on the roleplay servers are really friendly and interesting\funny people, i found myself laughing so hard i♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants when i first started playing, because of this little black midget that was calling me king and being my fighting champion without me even being king or having armor for such either.some things that are bad with ROKif you find a server, you play for about 12 hours you should be well set up, fully geared and just trying to raid some bases. but sometimes when you play on 1 server for to long there will come  a hacker, and yes he will ♥♥♥♥ up everything you ever built or did and the server will be complitely unplayable for about 48HRS on the ususal servers because lazy admins.either than the hacker problem there are a few minor problems that ofc is not something that needs fixing, but should be tweaked just a hunch. 1 of these things are the 1 shot head shot factor that can occur either you block or not. people find ways to abuse the system, well the combat systen has a flaw, if you aim correctly you can insta kill any1 with  iron helmet or lover. because the block radius dosnt reach all the way to the tippy top of the head.its kinda annoying but its not a big deal.hjope this was useful. happy hunting			"

								Let me just start off by saying that I have NEVER EVER left a review on ANY game. That being said, after trying to play this game for the last few days with no avail I can personally tell you that it is in fact, at this stage in Alpha the biggest piece of sh*t that I've ever wasted $20 on. First off, if you're not crossing your f*cking fingers while you try to join a server you will get a random error message, whether you've altered the game or not (which is great since hackers can join freely and kill everyone on the server at once but normal players can't even connect. Awesome) Then there is the fact that everything lags. Literally. I joined the server for which I was rated the LOWEST ping. Guess what? Still other players lagged. You guys have a great concept and excellent promotion. I just don't see how you keep f*cking it up but, until it's fixed I couldn't rightfully reccomend this game to anyone.			"

								Well then, here's the short and sweet version of my Reign of King's experience, and by short and sweet I mean a sample of what myself and my guild of 15+ people (more or less, it varies due to people leaving the game because of lack in developer interest/care) had gone through during months of RoK playing.First and foremost let me start by saying the game was a blast to play. From the beginning it was fun, simple and hacker-free with room to do whatever you want. The building was solid, becoming better as you learned which piece would fit with another to make intricate designs on castle walls, bridges, and towers. This aspect of the game was more or less 60% of your time between gathering resources and actually building it out. Combat in the beginning was lacking, and still is (but I will get to that later) and due to it being faulty, skill isn't a factor in the game and instead became all about luck. With these factors in mind, it was still playable and it kept you thoroughly entertained because these issues seemed trivial for a game in early stages. However we soon learned that mostly everything would change.Around mid-point from where the game is now, I'd say Alpha 5 or 6, things got out of control.

(With added perks of being the king) However when you spent 10+ hours sometimes even DAYS building your base, just to log in one day to find it completely gone, your body dead, and your loot that took you forever to get all missing in one foul swoop, you'd immediately recognize the issue with this game.

												Had to pull my old early access review because they went and did it again, consider Reign of kings abandonware hidden as a full release.While my developer ethic always has me in the mindset that you improve on old mistakes, it is clear that the developers of Codehatch do this intentionally, this game started in early alpha and got a full release in around a year, adding very little content to the game in that timespan, if my memory serves correctly it was a few weapons, shield, some blocks and a map.Not much going on with it.Avoid at all costs, don't waste your cash.this sort of thing has left me hating FrankieOnPCin1080p as he has constantly got me into buying early access games only for each of them to be abandonware, looking at you DayZ.

												I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME, DO AT YOUROWN RISK!!!Reign of Kings...Playtime: 3.9 hoursFirst of all, the whole time spent onthis game I played with a friend.This friend bought me this game and at first I was happy,now I want to punch him in the face.When you start this game the ingame sound destroys your ear and I lost theability to hear for about half an hour.After that you can join a server and play.Before the next part I'll do a Pro and Con list.Pro:-The game is fun to play, with a friend, for the   the first hour or less. Bear in mind nearly any  game can be fun when played with friends.Con:-The graphic looks like a♥♥♥♥♥♥version of Quake,  Quake was released on the 31. Mai 1996 but I'm  not a person that only cares about graphics so thats   not a major downside of this game.-Even when played with a friend the fun you'll have with   this game was limited to a few hours,  there's no introduction, you don't get to know how to  anything and you'll die probably a few times from  dehydration before you figure out how to get drinking water -Combat sucks balls, if you jump around like a madman you'll  never get hit by anything and its laggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥(at least in  my case)-As I mentioned before you don't get to know how to do  anything, apparently you can be a king and tax the other  players on a server but HOW?? They don't tell you♥♥♥♥♥♥br>  about what and how to do, I dehydrated probably 10 times  in my playtime of 'bout 4 hours and a friend and I only  only managed to find out how to get drinking water  because of luck... SERIOUSLY?As you may have noticed by now I'm not fond of this game,I absolutely hate it, it's just bad and I lost interest after3 hours the other hour I spent reluctantly.If you do buy this game be sure to bring a few friends, becauserandoms are mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and have probably found outthat jumping like crazy makes you invincible.Thats It, I'll go jump of a bridge now to relieve myself fromthe pain that Reign of Kings brought on me.Goodbye			"

Early Access Review
								Not a lot of thought was put into buying this as any survival game with building aspects gets me wilder than hormonal teenage girls on a boyband concert (it makes me sad to say this is spot-on). I don't think I even remember how much I paid for this game and quite frankly I do not care anymore, it was worth it.Info:Reign of Kings is a survival based medieval MMO (massively multiplayer online) game. Hunt wildlife, mine resources, craft weapons and armor to protect yourself. You may form a guild, bring war to opposition players, and seize the throne and become King! in Reign of Kings resource collection and crafting are a large part of the game. This game could best be described of a third person rust, combined with medieval aspects and a lot of content. But takes itself a lot less serious (in a good way)First experience:Logging into my first server I made a character called ""Sir Pipsqueek"", and as there is a character creator (one of those other things that gets me wild) I made a tiny little midget man (or should I say ""little person""?) with giant arms and tiny tiny legs. His body proportions challenged the laws of gravity as he must have had steel legs to keep himself standing but yet brave little Sir Pipsqueek proved to be quite a handy guy. I proceed chopping some wood and becoming a chicken serial killer in order to make myself armor. As I was done I considered I was too lazy to gather material to make a house myself and ran up into the fields where I found a person in iron armor. He was no match for the Sir Pipsqueek, the bringer of death and slayer of chickens. I beat him up with a wooden stick and killed him with it, allthough he had an iron sword. I was surprised to say the least. I proceeded to use my findings to build myself a nice little shack and start expanding it. Sadly on my first trip into the wild I found 3 wildlings or as I'd like to call them ""Dumb, dumber and dumbest"". I greeted them like a polite lord of death, they danced for me and then decided to team up against me. I did not like the idea of 3 naked guys beating me with their wood against the forest while yelling especially since there was a peasant watching us go at it as wild as we can. Sir Pipsqueek fought bravely but was eventually slain by the 3 little wildlings to have all his precious possesions taken from him. Little did I care, since that was the very way I obtained these posessions in the first place.Verdict: Reign of Kings is a very rewarding and pleasurable game where you can build whatever you want and have it be destroyed the next day. But somehow it's always a thrill to gather resources all over again to build your house. One thing i'd love to see is for the progress you made not to be deleted so soon, due to griefers, server refreshes, hackers, etc. The crafting system is flawless and very easy to use and the community is very nice, allthough it has it's flaws. Up till now the only major problem I have had with this game is hackers, and a lot of them. In the beginning this was a game-breaking aspect but luckily the producers keep updating and adressing the hacking issues full-time. Surprisingly enough besides the hackers keeping the developers busy they manage to add new content that makes the game a lot more pleasurable and rewarding. Pros:-Crafting system-Always something to do-Making progress is very pleasing-New content regularly added.Cons:-Hackers, hackers, hackers.-Easy to lose progressI would definitely recommend this game, a must have for anyone who loves survival, MMO, and anything that involves building. There is always something to do in this game!Rating:8.5/10 -Amazing game!			"

								Reign of Kings needs a lot more features and it should be easier to find your friends. I see a lot of improvements that could be made to make things smoother and give characters and weapons better hitboxes. In terms of current building and combat mechanics, it's fun, but not really something I can recommend spending money on unless you want to support the developer.			"

								This is definitely a very fine example of ""Early Access Game"".Pro's:- Amazing kingship/guilds features, Definitely something not seen in a lot of games.- Yields a lot of gameplay time, has a lot to do.- The map is fairly large, and has a lot of places to build.- Players cannot logout to avoid death, their character just goes to ""sleep"".- Servers are pretty configurable; Different ranks & permissions, and different customization for each rank.Con's / Known bugs:- It can almost automatically be assumed that any public server will have a hacker on it.- Basically all processing is run clientside, making it easily hackable.- Items are known to randomly disappear.- Sometimes opening cage doors can crush you and kill you.- Things have a very short hit radius. You basically have to be close enough to be glitching into trees/rocks to collect them.- You swim like you're carrying a mountain on your shoulders (which sometimes you may be?)- Torches / Lanterns will show that they can burn with wood, but will actually only accept oil.- Chests don't show the correct holding space (IE; Iron Chests say 20, but holds 24.)- Players are only banned from a server until it gets restarted [Bug].- Players are IP-Banned, so VPN users or users with a Dynamic-IP can easily rejoin. (Probably should be banned via Steam ID.)Suggestions:- Fix Bugs ASAP- Some sort of Anti-Cheat for servers- More advanced permissions for kingship/etc for more RPG-Based servers- Skills (?)Overall it's a great game, and I hope one day to change to a positive review.My gameplay experience:From the get-go of playing this I set up a server locally on my computer to avoid dealing with the grievances of multiplayer online pvp games. I'd much rather spend my hours of time constructing something that will be there tomorrow when I want to continue building onto it, not spend my hours of time constructing something that will be destroyed by another player in no time at all. Yes, breaking eachothers♥♥♥♥♥♥is the point of this game, which is great, but I'll still stick to my private server. I enjoy battling the elements anyway.The day after playing around on my private server some colleagues bought the game and asked me to assist in setting up a server (as I'm a known ""tech guru"" to friends) and joined in on playing on their private server instead of my own. I played for about an hour preparing some workbenches for myself.Later in the day I joined in on a publicly listed server with a friend and two acquaintances and spent most of the day setting up an abandoned base that we commandeered and claimed, set up some furnaces and workbenches, and camoflauged the base with some birch blocks by a grassy area on a beach. Just after a server restart two men in full steel lockpicked our door and slayed two of us almost instantly, killed one of us who wasn't yet logged in, and then finally slayed me. They then set up a trebuche and destroyed our whole base. Hours of progress lost. ~ Some time later after doing some looting of our own we finally got back up to steel armor and realized that any effort of setting up a legitimate base was pointless due to it being destroyed shortly after, so we decided to just rush the king. We slayed one of his henchman at the sword-tip of the castle, and then a hacker immeadiately summoned thousands of werewolves and killed all of us.At this point I returned back to my colleagues private server and began actually beginning a sustainable home.The following day (today) while out collecting resources to finish building my cobblestone structure that I call home, I entered my house to find that all of my lanterns, my smelters, my 3 iron chests, and my bed had vanished. Some quick research shows that this is a known bug. So now I'm done playing for the current time.			"

								This is a must have game with great combat, great music, and great visuals...I will admit this game sucked when hackers were around but now that the security is getting better and can safley say this is my favorate game and it will stay that way for a while! This game has originality and is easily a great game!Join guilds: Join guilds and work together to gather resources and build a base to live in with buddies in this medievel world, and with a good team raiding other bases is a BLAST, you still have the option to be alone though, just in case your a lone wolfWeapons/Combat: With a TOn of weapons and awesome combat you can dominate servers with your guild members, Making your guild one to fearUpgrades: Gathering resouces is key to becoming strong mighty knights, you start off with a simple driftwood axe (I think its called :P) torches and badages and craft your selft a crafting table by chopping down trees.There are a TON of things to craft so you will always have a goal to chase after in Reign of kingsKings: It's good to be king! In Reign of kings its diffenitly a good thing to be king! You can name the world, set taxes so that you can quickly gather resouces from people and get a kingly sword and crown! Becoming king is simple, claim the throne by entering the kings castle. What makes this hard is the fact the King at the time will fight you and protect the throne in order to stay the almighty ruler of the land!Executions/Torture: <---- Enough said :PBuilding: There are a ton of blocks to craft in this game, the building is great and each has its amount of health and resources needed to craft it!Crests: Crests are used to claim a territory, when claimed all people (besides your guild mates) W'ont be able to build blocks in the area or remove them!Seige equipment: From a ballista to a catapult these structures will be able to help you destroy enemy base and satisfy the user with an overwhelming feeling of power! Thats basicly all i can say!(sorry for spelling mistakez <---- :3 )			"

												Was once an awesome game, if devs actually still worked on it it would have true potential. Unfortuantly the pretty much took the money and ran. Hopefully one day someone will redo this or the rights will be sold to someone who will continue the badass game this really is. The only problem is it needs to be tweaked, other than that the game is great and has hours of laughs and fun. Just not enough to keep you playing for a long time.			"

								With each Alpha release, Reign of Kings keeps surprising me with how utterly awesome it is. True, the game is still very unbalanced and extremely heavy for any computer, inducing crashes even for the most hardcore gaming PCs every now and then, but nevertheless - a medieval Rust-a-like is to my fantasy-ridden mind one the best ideas for a game ever. Building an epic castle among good friends who you can trust to keep it safe, fighting in the open fields against rival guilds, and launching merciless barrages with the ballista and the trebuchet to your sworn enemies are just a few of the most enjoyable things about this game.Then there is becoming the King. To rule the land with an iron fist and issue terrible taxes that inevitably lead into civil rebellions, or to rule with a kind heart and give to the people instead of taking from them, being the King is good. And Reign of Kings is most definitely good, if not great.			"

								First things first, this game has an awesome amount of potential. However, the way the devs are handling the hacker and exploiter issues could very well kill it long before alpha is finished. EVERY public server you join will have the telltale signs of hackers; stone fireplaces and trebuchets littering the main fields. There is virtually nothing stopping them, and it has been driving server populations down drastically over the past couple of weeks. They can build up an impenetrable base in a couple hours, seige every other castle on the server and then take the throne for themselves.All that aside, the game can be fun. Building huge bases, raiding others. Claiming the crown for yourself and raising taxes to ludicrus amounts is all in good fun. It doesn't ever seem to play out like the videos and stills of the game would have you believe but that's okay. You will come to fear the crazed naked midgets roaming the forests until you soon become one yourself.Also, there is a ton of racist teenagers populating the servers, but the same could be said of Call of Duty. If you're looking to buy the game, be warned that the hackers are legitmate issue at the moment. If a patch fixes it as has been promised several times I'll be happy to update this review, but until then this warning shall remain.			"

								From what I've seen this game screams early access. In my limited time playing this game I've crashed over 20 times for different reasons, and had my progressed shut down 3 times on 3 different servers by hackers. The game does show promise though, and does build on many of the mechanics I loved from rust and minecraft. This game would have been very enjoyable for me if the experince wasn't effected so greatly by crashes and hecking problems. I'd honestly say if you liked rust and didn't like what it became after they switched focus away from legacy, this game might be for you once it hits beta or gets released, but with the company that made this game's history, it might never truely leave alpha. If I were you I'd watch the game's development, and come and consider a buy once it's more stable and a few issues have been fixed.			"

								I've played this game a lot. While I've enjoyed it, I don't recommend it. Here's why:1. Too many hackers. They will mass kill everyone. Seems fun the first few times when you've got nothing valuable on you, but when you've built an entire fortress and are placing the last block to seal off your base, it's game-breaking to die with an open doorway for invaders to waltz right in. When you've spent hours farming iron, and have 1,000+ in your inventory, it's game-breaking. When you're winning a fight against a full-steel opponent, and you die because a hacker spam kills everyone, it's game-breaking. They also lag the server, steal the kingship, and do other♥♥♥♥♥♥that's annoying and ridiculous. And it isn't a once-in-a-while thing. It happens constantly on Reign of Kings.2. Because code)(atch is such a reputable company, they've implemented their own custom measures to prevent the hackers. One problem... they ban innocent players. Plenty will argue that's not true, but my friends and I have all been banned at some point recently, and none of us know a damn thing about how to hack the game. We just don't care enough to learn/bother/risk it. But maybe we should have, because we're being punished anyways. That's how this game works. It punishes you for not cheating, and the hackers continue, punishing you for playing. So you lose no matter what you do.3. Trebuchets. Don't bother with a base. You'll lose it. Don't bother with chests, you'll lose them. Matter of fact, don't bother with anything in this game because it will be gone when you wake up. Thankfully, somehow, my base hasn't been destroyed, but it's a matter of time. Don't get attached to this game. It's not something you can build to. You will lose. Every. Single. Time. Either the griefers, the hackers, or the idiotic ban waves code)(atch believes will solve the problem.  One will get you. Go play a better game.   "

								This game has a lot going for it, however overall even though I got right into it for a few days, it is terrible. This game is essentially everything that was right about minecraft, warband and many similar games, with everything that is wrong from Garry's Mod combined with more bugs than you can imagine and insanely regular crashes. It is Alpha right now, so I ignore the crashes part. The main problem are the players. Constant streams of hackers. Lots of people who log on, kill anyone they can find, kill sleepers (people who have logged off) and will destroy everything they can. They don't steal - just destroy. Most servers are populated with children and the gameplay shows for it. It is like trying to play with a bunch of high school aged ♥♥♥♥♥ users.Every day you will wake up, log on, and have to start everything completely from scratch all over again. Many servers have nothing but ruins as far as the eye can see and people running about in loincloths beating each other with clubs. Combat is very weak and pretty much lag will determine the outcome of every combat every time. Defending your base is impossible - doubly so in making somewhere defensible while you are offline. With the structure of the game I cannot see how they can ever resolve any of these problems. Servers are getting fewer and fewer, players getting less and less, and the game is only in Alpha phase.Don't buy this. At least wait until the full version and then give it a go. Unless you are a 12 year old troll or are planning to hack you wont get anything out of this game.EDIT: I recently tried this game again after giving it a long time. Not much has changed.Essentially the developer has dropped most of this game and aside from tweaks will no longer complete development. There are slightly less hackers, but the maps are still full of trolls with all of the same problems as before. Almost anyone decent has left the game for dead, making the issue even worse. Building is an utter waste of time. No one forms guilds and works as a team at all.This game is pretty much dead at this point. I would have given it a 2/10 before, but now it is so buggy and laggy and with such a greater percentage of idiots that I am going to drop it down to a 0/10.Don't even touch this. Don't bother spending any money on this. Go play Rust or something.			"

								Cool game, however even having a setup built to eat this game my fps is low on main servers. Decent fps on the community servers. It lags, like horrible lag. Hackers are in abundance. Although alpha 7 is suppose to kill the hacking from what I read. Game has potential.~Current Rating~Fun - 8/10besides copying minecraft6/10 altogether because of hackers, fps, and current state.

Lack of Balance - You build a solid base in 5 hours, can be taken down in 10 mins, treb OP.Still in alpha, but at this point we all know what ""alpha"" entails. Especially with codehatch lawl. I don't regret buying it, but I still don't recommend it.			"

								I've had some great times on this game, and some terrible times. Building and fighting is fun, the game is pretty, and it's easy to sink hours into just gathering resources so you can build up an awesome base for you and your friends to occupy. Unfortunately, that base is gonna be nothing within a day of building because of griefing players or hackers. I understand the hardcore aspect of the game but after getting raided while i'm offline so many times it's just not worth it anymore.

												I am very disapointed. I started playing today. Keep in mind this is a twenty dollar game. The first thing to note is that the graphics are lackluster. Character creation is boring. They're very few options for hair style, facial hair, no option for eye or even skin color. Anyways, you spawn in on a beach, start to collect resources. You have to go into your inventory to know what anything even does. Some of the crafting doesn't make sense. Example: Stone sword, you think that would require wood and stone as any other game would have it be. No it's stone, wood, and flax. The hell is flax? So you find that you get flax off of some weird white plant, that makes even worse sense. When the hell do you even need a flower like plant to make a sword? So I'm walking around looking for more recources when out of nowhere like 5 people rush me in full metal armor and weilding battle axes, swords, and throwing javalins. They start yelling at me saying ""Don't run we wanna help!"" And this is where the worst part comes in and the reason I knew to immediately run. They were all little kids, from the sound of it no older than 10 years old. I yell over my mic to them saying ""No, leave me alone."" (I am British by the way) and they just start making fun of my accent. So I'm running, with only a stone sword (low level weapon) and completely naked, no armor or clothes. Of course they all kill me. Point is this game is not worth the price. I understand with these kind of games people will always kill on sight but the fact that the majority of people I met were kids who shouldn't even be playing a game like this is what gets me. Overall we have bad graphics, bad crafting, bad character creation, and a bad community. Buy something like Rust instead.			"

If you are going to play on your own private server then you will enjoy the game but not have the fun of trying to kill the king to become him.

								Fun if you can get a decent server.  Even the decent servers however have hacker and general griefer (can't use the correct term due to censor) problems.  As of right now I cannot recomend this game.Overall my problem centers around the problematic players and the inability to really do anything about them.  Yes the game is pvpcentric however pvp isn't the issue here.  It is the hackers and people who aren't interested in anything other than messing with the people who play on the server.  There is no real way to keep them out, and there's no real way to handle them.  There's no trail or data (based on my last playing) to say who attacked what or killed who.  You'll go offline for the night and wake up to find your base is now a ruin, often times you're still alive and none of your stores are even touched, you were attacked only because someone wanted to screw with you.  Many servers have rules that strictly prohibit this sort of action, and with no idea of who is the cause of these problems there is no way to keep it from happening server wide.  If this company wants to recover from the cluster**** that was Starforge they will need to address the inability to deal with problem players.  As it sits right now I cannot recomend this game, it is fun the concept is awesome, implementation is great.  Only other glaring problem is, balance is a bit shot but what else can be expected of an early access?  Ultimately what will make or break this game is whether or not the company gets serious about being able to handle the problem players, how I'm not sure, but if they want it to work as far as I am concerned it should be their biggest concern.

When all players decide to build there ♥♥♥♥ing houses next to all the ♥♥♥♥ing iron it just results to that everyone that goes close to the iron either gets 1 fps for about 10 minutes or there game crashes now i think intead of fixing the hacker issue that they did in the latest upfate maybe they should fix so that you can actsually play the ♥♥♥♥oing game!

								Honestly, went in to this game with high hopes.  Minecraft plus chivalry sounded like a great win.The community blows hot chunks.No seriously, if you want to watch 6+ 12 yearolds ruin your days gaming (literally after figuring my way through the cumbersome menus) I had finally plated together a sealed home.  Not small, not huge, but reasonable.If you want to just throw a twenty in a blender you might enjoy it more.  Broken english and people that don't ""play nice"" are rampant.  Seriously, I caution you one last time!  Don't do it unless you're up for being griefed.  Over, and over.			"

								To start, the only reason I'm not recommending this game is due to the incredible amount of hacking currently going on in the game. Most servers are plagued by this issue, but if you join an empty server, you might be able to play without having to deal with this problem. If you decide to go ahead and buy this game, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.Having said that, this game is really well made, and offers a lot of entertainment. The developers have taken all the best ideas of Rust and implemented them into RoK (Reign of Kings). The creative building style is very much like Minecraft and players can do a lot of intersting things with the items and building blocks currently available. There is no traditional level system, which takes away a lot of the grinding issues, however with the most recent update, many items have had their building costs increased, which adds a bit of a grind to the game.The king gameplay mechanic is really well thought out and adds an interesting dynamic to gameplay. The king can tax the citizens and gain a portion of whatever resource players are collecting, which can be used to create defenses around the throne. However, if the king taxes players too much, they will revolt and overthrow the king.All-in-all, the game is really interesting, especially in a roleplaying envoriment or with friends. Hackers are ruining the game now, so I don't think I'll be playing a ton of it until RoK implements VAC or another anti-cheat program. The game would also be a lot better if a vote kick/ban system was implemented to allow players to kick hackers from the game immidiately.			"

								Simply an amazing game. So much to do, things to become. Base building is well done and I look forward to new blocks and structural pieces  being added in down the road. The character design is flawless, all you see is tall ogres and short midgets. Watching them fight is hilarious. Everyone hates the king unless he drops the tax below 5. In my first 2 hours my group became the holder of the realm, attacked the citizens and got over thrown. Would recommend this game to anyone looking for a new survival.. I often hear people saying ""This survival is nothing like RUST"" Its compared to alot by these Early Access Survivals that are coming out. But I can assure you that down the road you will be saying ""This doesn't compare to the fun I had playing RoK""10/10 This is a must buy.Long live the King			"

								I don't normally write reviews, but I am angry.If you enjoy spending 7+ hours (literally) looting and building a base, then while you are away, someone walks up to your wall with a wooden club and spends ~1 hour beating through your walls to steal your loot, then this game is for you. :) If you have a life outside this game that doesn't allow you to play 24/7, then don't get the game because you will spend hours looting just to get everything stolen while you sleep (in the game and in real life). The walls have health, so if you want to spend even more time gathering and constructing ridiculous walls, more power to you. Unfortunately if someone really wanted, they could sit there for as long as you aren't on and bash through your walls no matter the health. And god forbid you ever lose your base and try to take it back, I literally spent an hour breaking through walls just to realize that I lost every resource I had collected after an all-nighter. The guy I found in my bed had none of my steel armor or weapons, which I hadn't even gotten to use.To wrap things up, if you enjoy grinding for hours just to restart the next time you login,Then this is the game for you!

								Very fun at first and i do highly suggest picking the game up, But the combat system is in need of serious balancing. The one handed weapons are horrible when fighting in comparison with the two handers. The game is extremely unoptimized even after countless optimizations done through the first set of updates it still does not run as good as you would expect without lowering crucial settings that make the game look extremely dated. The building aspect of reign of kings is wonderful and you are able to make very cool house designs. Plenty of good RP can be found on this game if you are into that but the more you play the game in its current state the more you begin hating the constant wipes among other issues similar to that of legacy rust.

Overall, great game<3This game can also be very repetitive if you're playing it alone, try to find a friend who would want to play with you, chances are you'll both have an amazing time :) (More people the better)			"

								Reign of Kings is awesome so long as you do not play public servers. They are full of hacks and troll you to death. Without a large guild you cannot hope to last long. Admin run servers are awesome and the game play is always improving. Would recommend 8.5/10.			"

								Amazing game it would have been a 10/10 if it weren't for the hackers thats found on every single server. Low framedrop constantly and players from other countries with immensely high pings making it impossible to play. I wish they could Pick themselves up and fix those issues otherwise its only going to go down the drain.			"

								Its a good game. Its a survival game I can get into. But the servers just get obliterated by hackers or chinese people. And the combat system isn't exactly great. I went against a nude man with just a starter club, and I was wearing armor, I had a better weapon that did 3 times his damage, I should have easily beaten him, but nah, he spawns in next to me, 3 wacks to the head with his starter club and all my inventory gone and I die. You can't win. It's sad. You either get hacked, or the enemy has magical fairy dust. If you have a group of friends with you, its better, but so far I have no one to play with. Eh. 6 out of 10. It had potential, but the player base and bugs have ruined it so far. I could change my score if changes come.			"

								AMAZING GAME.BUT, LOTS of hackers. I mean LOTS. Out of every 3 people you face 1 is a hacker. Me and my friend had a very good and fun run, but eventually the hackers caught up with us. We had people spawning into the base, killing us and logging off to change their names. Guess what. The admins cannot ban someone if they change their names quickly enough. The devs are planning to release the game in late 2015 as it is (lmao).DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME.			"

								Entertaining enough medieval survival game, but I cannot recommend it in Early Access. Not that you shouldn't be expecting bugs with ""Alpha,"" but it's a bit too much of a headache in it's current build (Alpha 13.) Every time it crashes you have to verify integrity to reconnect to a server. And it will crash, the servers have a strong memory leak that puts Chrome to shame. Will change review if the game gets a full release that's in better shape.			"

I would like a refund please, no other game has ever given me this problem. After the first 4 hours playing this game, you'll regret buying it. Boring, glitchy, no point to anything, constant server wipes, and the fact that being king has no real benefit and the fact that you can't even remain king long enough to do♥♥♥♥♥♥ No matter how many friends you have.

You either get randomly killed by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the taxes are too high so you can't survive, or random people just try to ruin your game by roping you up or trying to waste you time by chasing you or something. The only time you ever actually have fun is when somone is cool and actually wants to roleplay or help you. The graphics suck and the combat system sucks even more. I wish I could refund it because I tried to play it at first and got 9 hours in but I realized it just sucks. I have not played it at all in weeks.

												As many of you have come to complain about how ""broken"" or ""unfair"" this game is and I understand that this game has a long ways to come but it still lives up to everything I can hope it to be. A fun game with base building that allows you to role play and connect with other players whether the interaction be hostile or not. I truly enjoy this game especially when I can get a few buddies to join in! Hundreds of hours of unscripted fun awaits, and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to make friends or play with them.			"

								Fun to build stuff in, not fun to pvp in. the combat is SUPER laggy (as to be expected from early access) and turns into a game of throw javelins at each other while running around in circles and jumping. Not to mention the fact that there is no real reason NOT to kill another player.. so it just turns into a huge server wide killing fest. quite honestly i dont really see much difference between this game and the 9000 other early access games out there. This one just has SLIGHTLY more potential than the rest, but not much. i dont really see this game being completed anytime soon and for the amount of time you spend building a house/fort/castle just to come on later to see your hours of work completely gone because someone who dumped 100+ hours into this just got bored and raided your place for no real reason at all. Right now this game is pretty much a mixed bag when it come down to whether you should spend $20 to play a beta/alpha. Also, dont play this game alone... youll just get abused by groups of 14 year olds making♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes. (EDIT) This was about the PUBLIC servers, of course the community servers have a different attitude on them for the most part like no KOS and what not but after giving it another go on a community server and spending a little bit too long building a base, after server restart the server never came back... if you have an abundance of cash, and youre interested in this game, check it out. if not, just save your money for something better.(like killing floor 2 maybe ;)			"

								Below is my initial review but now that I have over 157 hours of play time into this game I thought it appropriate to update my review. Don’t get me wrong, what I have written below still holds true for about 99% of the “official” servers but if you can find a decent server with decent people then you can build a decent base. The trick is building your base somewhere that is hard to get to and just plain awkward to siege because multi-layer walls do nothing to stop a trebuchet. Also contrary to belief 99.99999999999999999% of raids happen after the defender goes offline. Basically this game is a game of players who have too much free time keeping other players from progressing too far. Basically a KoS fest.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*******THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND NOT CONTENT*********I really wanted to recommend this game but after 19 hours of game time I literally have nothing to show for it. Why? That would be because it is a MMO! The following is a point form retelling of my 19 hours.- Get on a heavy traffic server, have lag issues which prevent me from building.- Move to a lower traffic server, no lag or building issues but-- Get ganked when collecting resources by individuals with full steel armor and me no armor and only a stone hatchet-- Get killed when offline multiple time and lose all of my stuff even items the players do not need to take.-- Get tag-teamed and then have them swarm my base.-- And the kicker, have what took over 7 hours to build undone in less than 1.The flaw in this game is that there is too little to do especially for people with too much free time.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

Theirs no fun in spending any time doing anything in the game, when i get back from work all my progress gets destroyed, and my characters killed. Map is way to small, the powerful stay in power, and the weak get wrecked over and over again unless they comit to the game head-on with a guild. This is definetly not for a casual gamer.			"

								So, after playing over 100 hours I think i can write a pretty good review.This game is quite nice in the way it was designed. It has the same nice building experiance that you might know from rust, and both rust and RoK have taken their inspiration from minecraft. The fighting in the game is not what it should be yet, but developers are working on it every few updates, and have recently made a big update in the way the physics work in the game. The graphics are decent, and are very adjustable for any kind of pc. So the game itself is quite nice.But then came the community.... dear god -_-First of all: the game is flowing over with hackers. I have met at least 30 hackers already, in both official servers and community servers. So that is already a huge downer since it ruins your gameplay.Second of all: If you like PvP, you might enjoy this game a lot despite the hackers. But if you expect a nice RP or PvE or building experiance; Forget it! It ain;t going to happen. There are a lot of servers that claim to be RP and PvE or even Build. And their intentions are good. They have arena's for pvp and good starterkits wich give you blocks and items to give you a headstart so you don;t have to punch trees (sort of speak). However the players in this game are 80% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They often find excuses tot attack you on sight even though the rules say not to (a.k.a. roleplaying as viking, it;s just an excuse for kos in RP servers to annoy people). Or people just ignore the rules completley and then whine like a 12yo that they didn;t do anything against the admin, who then does not know how to deal with it.So in conclusion:The game is nice, but as you would expect from an alpha, it still needs a lot of work to be perfect. (the beta is coming up, so let's hope they will improve the things they added in the alpha to create a both fun and good working game). But as for the community, this game is horrible. So I think that the mixed rating here is very much in it;s right place. As a game, i would reccomend it, but since the players that play the game are horrible, I would not reccomend it. Gameplay is more important then the game itself.It is a nice game, it is worth the money, but expect grievers, rulebreakers and hackers by the dozens. If you can live with that, have fun, but personally I am done with the game so I do not reccomend it, not until some decent programming options will be developed that can eliminate PvP and Raiding on a server (meaning for PvE and build servers).

								TL;DR: Great concept.  Bad follow through (so far.)  Wait for release + 3 weeks.Hacks are everywhere. Development is slow and working off a history of abandonment.  New game additions are focusing on fluff and not optimization and key issues.  Overall combat is poor and has very little depth.  During a raid you will mostly be fighting vs naked fresh respawns that will zerg you and spam mouse click for an easy win.Sadly, base design and security eat into artistic design freedom.  Due to a lack of good physics, you'll see mostly squared flat buildings or floating islands for bases.  Game optimization is very poor. While servers do support 30+ people, there are often disconnects when people group up which results in your character sleeping in the open with a high likely hood of being killed for all your items.  Many people have also run into terrible FPS as people start to gather over groups of 8-10.  I personally do not see this till 15~ people come in so your millage may vary.However, if you want a medieval Minecraft built on Unity 5, this isn't a bad pick.  You need to go into the game and be accepting that you are likely to lose many hours of your time investment through hacks, getting stuck, and bugs.  This game is also coming from a publisher with a history of abandonment.  For that reason I wouldn't recommend this to anyone until at least a few weeks into release.			"

								Loved the game, played for weeks.After rebuilding multiple times all I have to say about this game is they need to do some balancing with the seige equipment, and region lock servers before I will consider touching it again, or refering anyone to play.If you like building and working hard for weeks only to have your hard work undone over night this is the game for you.

								ive learned to love this game but within about 20 hours of playing i found several ways to dupe and now there adding in this system where servers can make it so people with under 100 ping can join and anyone els above cannot join im not sure if this is a rumour or not if it isnt then it will be its last nail in the coffin. for this game there are hackers everywhere and glitches that will make sit there and wonder wtf just happend in for five minutes straight but the combat system is great as is the building.

								Where to begin...So do you like playing on a server to have you experience ruined by hackers within in the first few minutes? Do you love playing with a bunch of immature losers on all of the official servers? Do you enjoy spending multiple hours building a decent base to have it torn down via trebuchet within 5 minutes? Do you have fun getting killed in full steel by a person bombarding you with a wood club? Would you like to get killed over and over by a bunch of lag-killing chinese hackers who group by the dozen to kill you and♥♥♥♥♥♥and pillage your entire server. If you answered yes to any of these questions, then THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!!!Let me start with the positives, then the negatives, then I will give you a summary of my opinion on the game.PROS:. The game can be very fun at times when playing on a good server even though it is very rare. The combat is very enjoyable when its not laggy and glitchy. Building a base is really fun as well as trying to defend it. There is a huge variety of weapons that you can craft all of which having advantages and disadvantages.. A lot of the community servers are really fun to play on sometimes. Some guilds that you run into have really cool people who want to group up with other guilds to take down the jerks and trolls on the server. Every once in a while the hackers that take over servers do some hilarious things. One time I was placed on a freeforall deathmatch on the beach with all of the other players. Trebuchets are really fun to use even though they can be a pain sometimes since their accuracy is inconsistent. New things are constantly being added into the gameCONS:. The game has been out for over 6 months and it is STILL ridden with hackers. All of the anti-hack software that the devs make you install to play the game is TOTALLY USELESS!!!!!!. Every update seems to introduce more bugs then bugs that are fixed. You will usually spend 5+ hours to build a decent base to have it torn down in 5 minutes. Sieging bases needs WAY more balancing. There are a lot of annoying trolls in this game. There is virtually no point in making your own stuff since everyone else always tries to KOS and take your stuff that you worked hours upon hours to get. Any block can be one-shotted with a trebuchet with 5 stones in it. Makes sieging ridiculously OP. Sometimes the bugs such as respawning with no club are really frustrating and STILL HAVE NOT BEEN FIXED. Hackers will ruin virtually every server that you will ever join within at least 2 or 3 days of playing. Blocks are way to expensive and the cost of certain blocks needs to be reduced. You usually have to wait for a server wipe to get any type of enjoyable experience because servers are usually dominated by just one guild. The throne room can be blocked up and crested which makes no sense as far as defending your throne. You have to spend hours of grinding to get situated . This is a cut-throat kind of game. There are still a lot of lag issues in the game despite patchSo, is this game worth $20.00? Certainly not. Is the game worth $10.00? Maybe. I would wait till it goes on sale for $5.00 or something to get it like Chivalry is right now. Between all of the hackers, KOSers, annoying trolls, and bugs, this game is virutally unplayable most of the time. Save yourself the heartache. I would wait until this game is officially out of alpha and beta to give it a try. I might give it another review then. If the devs don't make an effort to really fix the game by the time it is released, I wouldn't bother wasting your money on this game. You can still have fun in rare cases, but all of the problems are so much of a turn-off that It will turn you off to playing it a lot of the time. Overall, I would give it a5/10. If the problems are fixed and the devs add lots more new features and mechanics, I might be tempted to give a much higher rating. "

												Yes, the game used to be very fun. Yes, the devs got kinda lazy. Yes, the game has gone down hill. But no, I don't really think it's the dev's faults. Long ago, people would actually rp on roleplay servers, people would give fresh spawns a chance on servers allowing kos. You used to be able to meet fun people and start wars. The reason I think the game went down hill is the community's fault. The game itself is still very fun, but the people are not. I still reccomend this game, hoping eventually some half-decent people might start playing it. #makerokgreatagain			"

								I'll give this game a good review once I can cross the map without crashing, lagging horribly, and FPS dropping for 5 minutes. Until then, its going to annoy the crap out of you if you play. Enemy team sets up on a hill to treb your base? Sorry, You can't go up there and get them because you'll lag out, be forced to crash the game, and come back praying they didn't kill your sleeper yet.			"

SummaryThe game is great, it needs work as it is an early alpha but it has an advantage to many other early access. This one actually feels playable and works! Yes it has bugs and glitches, but if you join a server that is watched by admins and they actually remove hackers and exploiters you can have a really balanced and fun experience.The Good Fun, fast combat Functional seige (To some extent) Great dances and voice Better character customisation than most games that are full releases A lot of gameplay Functional guilds and guild lands Interesting king mechanic Roleplay galore Gore! Dismemberment! Great fun!The Bad Easily exploit the character creator  Slower updates than i'd like personally Not enough control within guilds (Ranks etc) Admin commands are limited Hackers and exploits are there (Slowly being fixed :) ) Armour variety is quite limited, I'd like to see some more styles (Banners on armour etc) No allies? Having a function to create real alliances between guilds would be interesting Skyrim style mountain climbing, meaning castles have to be odd shaped to avoid allowing people to jump up your    castle "

								Ive been playing since A14 patch. So I cannot speak for any content/issues that happened before this. However I must say that as of patch 14 I was significantly more impressed than expected. Coming from chivalry the combat is familiar but slightly more forgiving. I havent seen a single hacker on the server i play on, which isnt even whitelisted. Unlike games like rust I feel like in this one its much easier to manage your territory with the crest system which I really like. As of patch 15 the game is signficantly better. It runs better, its more stable, theres a lot more content, and they revamped the combat to be even more like chivalry which I like. I also really like the building system they have.

								Honestly i love the game. But the sleeper system kills it, the small map kills it even more cause as you sleep due to how small the map is, If you build a base (which will take a awhile even if its small) it will be gone not even a day after you get off Even if its made of stone in the most hidden of areas and you will almost always wake up dead. Theres no point to building a castle and or stone house since your just gonna lose it in a matter of hours, May aswell stick to wood. Everything about this game is solid though (gameplay wise) and its fun and enjoyable with friends and on an RP server. From my week of playing it i enjoyed it very much but i do not recommend you purchase this if you hate losing hours of work in a matter of less than a few hours of obtaining what you need and want.

								Day 1. Logged in, No idea what to do, tried to break in a Building i didn't know belonged to a person, the Person comes out and welcomes me waving his hands up. He invites me to his Guild. I ask what to do in the Game and become Friends with the King, who teaches me the Basics of the Game.The King is being Persecuted by an Fully armored Guy who is hitting him with a steel sword. i run to Save my King.He Kills me.Turns out he was a friend of the King, and was Joking.They don't Give my Stuff back.""Okay, i'll make my way around.""They Kill me again.After someone asks, i point out who killed me, he Denies it.I'm Accused of calling the Kingsman a Liar.I enter in the Joke and decide to fight in the bear pit to prove my innocence, receiving help of the Gods.They come to my house, Lie to me, and Instead of putting me in the bear pit, they drag me into a huge platform and hang me.I made all my stuff again, and finished a house, using a bug to make blocks without spending the Material.Day 2. I log in another server, and find a guy Called ""Ape"". Ape is going to try to take out the throne, and i Decide to help him. i help him taking rid of a Guy that entered his house by using the Rope. I follow him everywhere, Ape and His friend (Clehman) are making a Trebuchet and Ammunition, But they don't trust me Yet and don't let me enter the House.I stay out of the House, complaining about how cold it is out there and how hungry i am. He throws me food and a Flute, and tells me to Play him a Song.With time, he trusts me enough to let me enter and help with the trebuchet.I Play Titanic. He Loves it.We hit the castle a couple of times, but we deal no Damage.The guy that Entered Ape's House enter there again and steals his stuff, and stuff of more people of the server.We found his house, break in and take everything.in the Meantime, our house was raided.We lose the trebuchet.Everyone is Mad.Day 3. Me and Clehman Take as out new Job Raiding Stuff. We go around and Break in Houses and get away with the Stuff. We find a Huge Base and Try to break in, But it seems almost impossible.So we climb to the Roof, After a Long Long time Trying.The Roof is made out of wood. we break the Block and enter in. we steal everything we can, and decide to come back.But we become a little Greedy, and decide to stay a little more to see if we can find something else to Steal.We Die mysteriously. Suddenly receiving damage from Nowhere.We are Sad. But it was Cool.Day 4. Clehman can't Play. i go to another Server, try to put someone in the Rope, got killed.Find another person and helps him building a house.We make full iron armors and Swords, i decide to take some more iron.In my way, i find a Weird Naked guy making Weird noises on the Microphone, and another Naked guy, That seems normal. I decide to interact.Bad Choice. Both Start Attacking me with Pieces of Wood and i end up dying.Respawn close, come back to the House.they come in the house, jump on Each other's Head, and since my friend didn't fix what i told him to, they are able to jump in. the weird guy keep doing the weird noise. they kill me again, take all the stuff from the chests and smelter and run away.Day 5. Me and Clehman enter some bases and Get Stuff. we become rich and Put all in chests inside a secure base.I Join another Server, make friendship with a guy called Willie Stroker.I Steal lots of stuff for us, i'm getting good at that, and Raided an Incredibly big Base, getting 100 Steel Ingots and Much more, on my Own.I tell him how to build a safe base, what materials to use and much more, but he doesn't listen to me.We go to Sleep.Day 6. Our base (clehman and i) Got Raided by Hackers.I go to Willie Stroker, Tell him to do the Stuff Again. he Doesn't.We go to Raid the Base i was told him was good to.Willie Betrays me. he Kicks himself out of the Clan, Makes a new one and start conquering our Base.But he left the Door open. Naked Guys Enter the House, take all the Stuff, Kill me (i was over the base at that time, trying to talk to Willie) And Get away, Saying on the Chat: ""thx 4 the steel m8"". I'm not Mad.Ask some guy on the server to Teach me Fighting.He brings two wooden swords, he is teaching me.I gave our location by the chat. the Naked guys come, kill us both without giving chance of defense, and say: ""Didn't you want to learn how to fight? now you learned.""Still not Mad, but now, Tired.I leave the Server.Day 7.(30/05/2015)Log in, New server, time to make a new character.Get undecided, decide to make a funny one.I make one that looks like a caveman. name decided. it'll be caveman.I get around using the mic to scream and talk on third person and by there it goes.people laugh.i enter in a guild with that.we're taking rocks, then we meet a friend of one of the persons of the guild.he is with some people.one of them looks just like me.his name is ""Bigman""I tell him constantly he's a copy of me, and i'm the real caveman.At some point, he calls me.I go there.He looks deep in my eyes and say: ""there can be only one.""And starts stabbing me with a knife made out of god knows what.I run screaming: ""bad man is killing caveman, bad man is killing caveman"", ""Big man is trying to kill me, help!""Suddenly, a group of about 6 - 7 people, on leather armors, come running and take down all our group.i respawn at the beach. i was killed 2 times at this rate and was tired.come once more, find bigman by accident, they break my legs and kill me once more.i decide to stay at the beach.meet a guy.his name is Hank Hill.i play with Hank Hill, we get around. cool guy.We decide to raid a house.he jumps over my head, and enters without thinking, get stuck.we are able to take him out because a Guy called NAStro helps us, bringing Flax to make a Rope.we form a group, make a hidden chest, store stuff. put beds.Damn Bigman.Day 8.(31/05/2015)Log in the server Hank, NAStro and i Were.They're Sleeping.A guy comes and announces a server, saying that KOS is not allowed there.I got interested and decided to take a look.Server is pretty good, pretty organized.The Admin Says the Arena is Open and Fights will Happen.A guy comes carrying other in a Rope, and when the admin asks if he will Fight, he says That the guy on the Rope is the one that will.Me and the admin put our crotch on this guy's face, and i say he looks pretty strong.Fight Begins.We keep screaming: ""kill the white guy, kill the white guy!""the Guy from the beggining wins.I make a Nice and Safe House, and put a Sign, with my character's (Adrian, the Modern Knight) face drawed, and Written: ""Adrian's House. no Girls Allowed!""Some guys come and ask me if i'm raiding that house. i show them the sign.One of them ask about the Girls thing.I answer girls are nasty and ask if he's a girl, to care so much.he says yes.i tell him to get the f*ck out.He does.Not much time after, i search for their house. i want to make friendship.i got stuck in a bear trap while being attacked by a zombie. almost died.They save me, but they put me in the rope and throw me in a cage.All i know is that one of them was named ""THOR"".One of them whip me constantly while i stand at the corner of the cage.They ask me if i had ever played the♥♥♥♥♥♥game.i tell them i didn't.He asks me if i want. i tell i don't know.He asks if i want or not.They dance around me,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me.They bring me to the bridge, and threaten of throwing me if i didn't allow girls. ♥♥♥♥♥♥me in the way)Too late. they threw me when i accepted the terms, i Died.Changed the Sign to ""no Girls Allowed! Girls Ok.""They tell me they'll Check Everyday.They bring me to the Holding thing Again and ask me if i have any last words.i Make a commentary about how onions are disgusting.My head is cutted off as he says: ""i love Onions.""

								This game has the potential to be very entertaining and as the anti-hacking tools got installed I hoped the real game would begin to shine but instead I found the game became stagnated. You will invest a huge amount of time in building a small base whilst trying to avoid being killed by other players, along with trying to make alliances to get more people on your team and the ever present thirst and hunger battles. Almost invevitably, as soon as you have any kind of half completed base you will become a target for ganking. I made several attempts on official and community servers to get to a point where I had a base to hide in and build up my armory, each time this process was stalled (usually 5-6 hours of pretty dull resource gathering gameplay later) you barely had the front door on when fully armored broadsword wielding players in groups of 3-5 would come and kill my team of 2-3, destroy our crest and then take all our resources. If you have several friends who are willing to sink several hours of gameplay into repetative resource gathering to begin building a base then you might be  able to enjoy this game (no guarantee), if not you will spend much of your time respawning and mourning your lost resources. This is like Minecraft without the charm and with some very unfair game dynamics. That being said, the trebs are cool but so far I've only seen hackers with those.			"

								One of the best alpha games ive ever played.The game improves on a bi-weekly basis as updates come.Hackers have become extremely rare as the developers fix exploits and add protection.Has a bit of a learning curve (have to learn to protect yourself and your base properly or else you will wake up and it will be gone)Some servers are better than others.For the most part i have a ton of fun and play this game every day.-btw come join me if you buy this game. i play on a server just search ""The Dungeon""			"

								Reign of KingsYou start out on a beach with nothing but a club and a few bandges.This is how it always starts.Then you look around to find a little place to call your own.gather some resources and then build a base that takes hours. Then someother players think you have a ton of stuff so they raid and destory everthing.Thats why community servers I perfer because they make a story and people will not walk up to your base with a treb just to watch it fall. The admins hate haveing bot so they ban them pretty quick.Public servers have been a bit of a mess for me.just add horses and some more seige weapons			"

								This game is good in all but it will soon be ruined by people not wanting to RP and just want to PVP. One week in and its already becoming a PVP game. And don't get me started on the cowardly kings. In most servers you will find that kings will get in power raise tax to 20% get enough resources and then build a mile high wall around the Castle making it inpossible to get the thrown. If your lucky enough that you get past the tier 6 mile high wall you will find that there will probably be and army waiting for you then if you get past that you will find that all the castle entances have been sealed by tier 6 walls and that the king and his butt buddy's have beds in the castle waiting again for you. So basically the only way to be a king is to be ther first.0/10 -rjbandits			"

								Reign of kings is a great game i highly recomend its alot of fun to play especially if you have someone playing with you and no matter your playing style theres tons of servers like no killing kill on sight ect anyways reign of kings has a character looking like rust and more crafting recipes than both the forest and rust you start up on an island and build your way up to greatness from a drftwood club to iron shackles and a guiotine in the game you play either alone or with many players on a server the goal is to become king of the server by killing the origional and becoming the new king as king you can tax your people resources and command people that fear you to do your biding or become a guard as king you are granted the strongest weapon and helmet in the game but if you arent good at pvp your probably still going to get overthrown i am sorry for punctuation but my keyboard settings switched so my question mark is a capital e with an accent and everything else got meesed up aswell but anyways get the game its really good "

								For all intents and purposes its Rust with a medieval twist. Main issues include finding available slots in servers, as well as lag, which can make combat difficult. The game is, overall, not bad, a little boring, but not bad. It's still in it's beta stage, with a few more tweaks i'd definitely reccomend this game.			"

								Game is definitely fun and has a lot of potential.But you have to remember these are the guys that made STARFORGE. The most unfinished buggy game they gave up on last year because everyone hated it.I really hope they pull through with this one, it's a really good concept.As it is it's probably not worth twenty dollars, but buy it on sale if you can it is indeed quite fun.
