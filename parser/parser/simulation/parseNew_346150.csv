Early Access Review
								First off, let me say that the trailer for this game is unreliable and borerlines false advertisement. PLEASE keep in mind what you see in that trailer is NOWHERE NEAR comparable to your in game experience. In fact, I will go so far as to say that until the game is built in the manner the trailer portrays it...the trailer should be removed.This game has potential, but I cannot recommend it at it's current asking price. At least not yet. The single player is nothing more than a sandbox mode. I'm not sure if it's automatically online and I can't seem to find a multiplayer option in the menus anywhere. I've played for about 9 minutes, my experience in such a short time wasn't too great and was even enough to decide this game is just not what it portrays itself to be. I know, 9 minutes is hardly enough time for some users to judge a game with....that is if you're new to gaming. (lol. Please, a gamer who knows his or her salt will know instantly what's junk and what's gold).Upon starting I liked that I was given a knife, pistol and a car. I could have also kept the house I spawned in if I wanted to but decided to venture out. I drove up the road in the car and started taking damage. I got out and took cover and suddenly a random NPC appeared for about 2 seconds then glitched and disappeared. I stopped taking damage up until I explored an empty house, something was shooting at me but I couldnt identify it. It was able to shoot through walls and any cover I tried to take. No matter how far I ran whatever it was damaged me until I finally died.Wilflife NPC's look pretty poor. The wolves walk in a very fixed and stiff pattern like WoW when they should wander naturally. Also, wolves in the wild don't usually keep that close to civilization do they? Like literally in backyards?The AI is terrible and glitches, you'll get shot at by nothing and seemingly no one at all. Don't bother taking cover, whatever it is can shoot through hills, cars, trees, houses. Pretty much just stand still and die when you begin taking damage. NPC's disappear after you kill them. No blood or bodies left.Never got to see any building or crafting as of yet because I only got to explore one house before some unidentifiable hostile killed me by shooting me through a giant rock.There is NO storyline whatsoever. You spawn in a random house, and that's it.I would have liked to see more of this game, but every time I spawned I would die in this same fashion. This was every time I drove into town. It was annoying enough among everything else to quit. I hope I can get a refund for this until the game improves.The only thing about this game so far that I can say is positive is the performance. It runs smoothly and the graphics are nice. But the game needs MUCH more than that to be worth 15$At the moment, I cannot say it's worth it until the devs fix it.			"

YouTube™ Video: Martial Law : Steam early access Gameplay UPDATE v0.1a 

			Views: 658		

			Just and update video for the new early access game Martial Law, gameplay footage and bugs as well. Hate it like it :P I know I say uhhhhh's a lot just something I do with an unscripted review.		

***NEW REVIEW SINCE UPDATE***Pros - Nicer graphics as to some early access games that are out.- Runs smoother then most early access games.- Developers listen to the community and fix the issues at hand.- Sound in game are more clear and clean since the new update- Physics to downed NPC's (bodies still disappear but at a slower rate)- Food and water levels feel realisticCons- Trailer is no where near where the games development is.- AI are dumb (They have been fixed to a certain extent but their mapping is way off walking into invisible walls, they have eyes in the back of their head's meaning they see you from places they shouldn't.)- No one was on arena mode so I can't tell you about it.- Not much to do at the moment from what I see- No craftingFor what's in the game at the moment its really not worth the $15 there's just not much to do in my opinion.  As of right now I DO NOT recommend this game on the sole purpose that there is no content other then exploring, HOWEVER If you like being apart of a community that helps shape a game through its development stages then join in and help out, if you hate bugs and slow content then is game is not for you as of right now. The game is playable and looks great however it is really up to you if its worth the $15.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has extreme potential, not going to lie. The dev (1 I believe) actually listens to your feedback. This game is in its early stages, but I'm already excited to see how this turns out.Pros (As of now)- A pretty big world, from what I can tell- The animations, there are actually animations- Actual AI that don't charge through walls- The game looks nice, just not a lot of grass (future updates?)- NO ZOMBIES- Good gun textures- There is a car, wonky, but hey, faster then running wouldn't you say?Now for the cons, (none are game-breaking)- I can't seem to drop items? Maybe I'm just missing it though, Accidently grabbed two pistols.- You seem to get stuck on the door ways- When I open the inventory, the game pauses (It is ""I"", correct?)- Multiplayer doesn't have a chat button! (Prophet you joined my game, but I couldn't say hello!! :( )Not a con, just a question, I can't seem to find the big city, like the one in the startup menu?Overall, the game has a neat concept to it, and I thoroughly believe the game will get much better.  The developer seems to be very commited to the game, as he has roughly 300 hours into the game.  Keep in mind, if you buy this game, you are in no way getting a finished product, but it is actually playable, and quite enjoyable I must say.  If you have a couple of bucks to spend on the game, go for it. I know I will continue to help the dev make this game better, and more polished! Great work Prophet :)			"

								this game does not work in ubuntu 14.04. it may be a unity issue and not necesarily the dev as theres an issue with the movement and other game keys not working properly. also the menus dont render properly where you select the resolution and when trying to enter the truck at the start area the game immediately locks up. the game is completely unplayable for me and may affect other versions of ubuntu or linux			"

Early Access Review
								Guys remember this is early access, if you dont know what this means then in short its still in development. Now I saw this on my Early Access 'coming soon' thread and jumped on the game when it came out and was on sale. I wouldnt recommend buying at full value at this time because the game is only just playable. That being said it is playable to a degree and has potential.  The game looks great at the moment, however the mechanics are sadly lacking. Here are a list of pro's and con's.Pro'sGreat idea and potentialGraphics are goodCars already implimented2 weapons already implimented with fairly good skinsEnemies implimented in a basic formSome basic inventory presentSome basic food/water/stamina implimentedCon'sFirearms and bullets need a lot of workEnemies need a ton of work AI wiseNot much to do in gameBuggy housing and towns means you get trapped or have to jump stairsCars - working a little but no player visible in the car on 3rd personCrafting not implimentedSounds are a bit off.Trailer is massively misleading.

Early Access Review
								how come i can not pick up more than one weapon. the bullets are cheap. what is this paintball? took me a while to figure out to drag items out of inventory to drop them. don't know how to heal just eat and drink. pause menu.....sigh. can't pick up pistol in the gay town we start in lol. this game is rough. there is no point. not alot going on. i don't see other survivors just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swat team shooting me. get hungry and thirsty pretty fast and sometimes i can not consume things. the game looks like it could be fun if a team spruced it up and made it smooth like the kind of gaming we are used to now adaysthis game is pointless. no matter how many updates get done. it's still going to be ratarded			"

								i have got over 40 games in my library but this game is one of my favotites and i do recommend especially to people who love challenges. the one downfall is that you spawn with an m4 in your inventory and all i ask of you developers is that if your going to spawn the player with a gun then spawn him/her with a handgun because it is more fun to look for the good/big guns then it is spawning with one otherwise AWESOME Game guys ;)			"

								I love the concept, but until this game has functional controls I can't play. We need a way to change sensitivity, and imputs during the game. Many elements are clunky such as movement, inventory, menus, textures, and items. Please continue to work on this game. Great potential!			"
