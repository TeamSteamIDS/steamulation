												Unclaimed World is about humans trying to survive on an alien world. Different scenarios take place at different points in the history of the world, so you see the people of the planet at different times from early in the colonization to generations later. The alien world itself has lots of strange and new species of plants and creatures, and the look of the settings is interesting and beautiful.Gameplay revolves around managing the actions of your community of colonists by giving them tasks and prioritizing. A lot of the colony management is zone-based, where you drag and create zones and indicate the actions the colonists should take within that zone - scouting out new locations, gathering resources, patrolling for dangerous creatures, etc. You also manage the production of tools, buildings, food, etc. through a production menu that has an extensive technology tree. The developers have done a great job of making it easy to click through and access information which is great because the technology of the world is well-realized, you need the right materials and tools to gather or build things, and for the more complex technologies it's relatively easy to click through the different menus to see what you might be missing.Using all this you manage the colonist's needs for food, comfort, and security. To begin with you start off with basic hunter-gatherer technologies to establish a foundation for your colony, and as you accumulate food, dwellings for your settlers, and defenses, your colonists can vote to establish new policies that simultaneously give you access to more advanced technologies but also increase your colonists' expectations of each category, which means you can't rush farming without first getting a good amount of food stocked up from fishing, berrypicking, hunting, etc. I feel like this helps to realize the technology of the world and state of the settlement - your colonists will get upset if you look to set up farms where fields will yield crops month from now, but they need food right now. If colonists get unhappy enough, they'll leave for a neighboring settlement.Which brings up another important aspect of the game - trade. You can establish trade with neighboring settlements in order to get access to tools and resources you need, and also you can entice new people with new skillsets to your settlement. This is often necessary as your small hunter-gatherer village will probably not start off with a blacksmith, so in order to advance your technology and create new tools and buildings you'll need to find a blacksmith and ask them to join you.The game has come a long way and the developers have been great about continuing to improve on and develop the game. They're extremely responsive to questions and bug reports, and it's been a pleasure seeing this game make its journey from vision of a strange alien planet to released game. If you're interested in city building sims, survival sims, or colony management sims (e.g. Banished) you'll probably enjoy this game.As a last note, I want to point out that many of the negative reviews of this game have come from early in Early Access and the complaints are regarding problems that have since been resolved or the absence of features that have since been added to the game. If you feel this review isn't helpful, feel free to ask any questions and I'll respond in the comments and amend my review to include the information. Thanks for reading.			"

Early Access Review
								Unclaimed World has oodles of potential oozing out from between the flaws.  But don't be tempted, the flaws are terrible and many.  After playing 0.1.2.1 in January 2015. I'm going to probably give this game a year or more before trying again.  And now I have given it a year - it's January 2016 - and things have changed but not drastically.First off, the good stuff.  Unclaimed World is like Majesty and Dwarf Fortress at it's core.  You designate tasks and one or more of your free-willed plebs will undertake them.  There is no mico-managing workers.  The banter between the various colonists is the perfect way to introduce the new world.  The scenarios are not random so after a couple of tries you'll know which colonists you get and what their skills are.I like the graphical style and the smooth character animations, they give a good sense of pioneering on an alien planet.  The character portraits, whilst somewhat caricatured, make knowing and empathising with said characters much easier.But.  That's where the good stops.There are currently only three stages, the tutorial which is so hand-holdy it's a chore; and not one I've forced myself to complete.  The first stage which is impossible to lose unless you try really, really had to get your colonists killed.  And lastly the second stage which crashes fairly early in.  Don't expect content, it's not here.The user interface is bad - but vastly impoved from when it was first released.  And as things start to take shape it's now possible to see higher level issues with interface.  Right click context sensitive menus have been a 'thing' for a very, very long time now.  Unfortunately the devs have ignored years of progress and have a wierd left click, bring up a small box with an arrow, left click the arrow, bring up the context sensitive menu.  Right clicking hides the interface but doesn't close anything.  Left clicking brings back all the menus as they were.Unclaimed World is SLOW.  The characters idle along at maybe 5 to 10 pixels a seond but have to traverse areas that are thousands of pixels across.  Leaving the game to run whilst doing other things seems to be the only meaningful way to play.  Even after three version bumps this is still a problem and I suspect it's a fatal one.  I've added more detail in my first comment.And the speed gets worse on the (previously mentioned) second stage.  The characters still move at about the same rate but the screen refreshes at less than a frame a second until eventually it becomes a slide show and crashes.  I'm sure a simple 2D game should run better than this.The artificial intelligence in a game where units can't be directly controlled has to be good.  But in Unclaimed World it's not.  It's awful.  I can't seem to prioritise tasks. Gathering seems to take precedence over everything.  So if there are a couple of construction projects going on and I set a new gather task then everyone drops what they're doing and rushes (relatively) to all gather the same stick of firewood.  Practicaly this means as long as there are gather tasks construcion tasks will not finish.Furthermore the AI in combat is even more deficient, with the characters commenting that they must attack as a group and then walking in one at a time; and only after the previous character has been killed.  It's horrible.  They also seem to get lost and will wander backwards and forwards through an enemy nest despite there not being any tasks near it.  I still haven't found a good way to get the colonist to move and work as a unit.In closing, Unclaimed World has a lot of potential with a good exploration and command vibe but it is so far from being completed that it's barely even a tech demo - let alone a full game.  Avoid.			"

Early Access Review
								I've played this game so far for Hours and does crash from time to time which is to be expected with an early access game. I really like the concept of trying to survive in an unknown region then having the ability to control the outcome of each and every one of your people. Currently I own several early access games and Unclaimed World is deffinately at the top of my list. Patience is key with all early access games expect buggs. And talk about them. Creating games is a long process especially if the dev team is small. Overall the game has a great concept with unlimited possibilities and I like sim type games so I recommend this game. If any potential buyers of unclaimed world want more info please feel free to message me I will get back to you as soon as possible.			"

												Many reviews point that the game had poor AI and some bugs, but the current release seems (3 hours of playing so far, but I like the game) pretty solid.It's... a pretty peculiar game: a building/exploring/surviving game in which you try to survive on a planet (in various environment). But the design of the game is pretty unique, and also consider that you come from space, but you you'll need to discover again a lot of technologies during a normal game.A funny game, not perfect, but I think is worth of his price.The problems: there are a couple of bugs, but, so far, I haven't find any annoying problem.No, the main problem is, sadly, the UI design...It works, but I sincerely don't understand why creating a design so difficult to understand and to use.It's possible to create and repeate and programming tasks, but you fail to grasp all the possibilites and probably you'll find yourself to be annoyed.Overall: a good game, not overpriced, and pretty unique for his design, but also not for who don't like to do micromanagement tasks and slide some graphs.

								I just caved in and bought it , I played through the tutorial scenario and found it extremely engaging to play .. I think when this game is complete it could well scratch an itch for a type of game I have had for a very long time , I really hope they finish it and it doesn't end up abandoned. The AI pathing needs work and maybe a way to speed things up a little .. it can get a little tedious waiting for your guys to do something. Overall I am glad I got it , really really hope they stick with it and make it the awesome game it has the potential to be :)			"

												Rather enjoying what I've played of this so far.The screenshots in particular really don't show how much stuff there is to do here. Loads of materials, intermediate products and lots of different types of production. It's more The Settlers than RimWorld, though your people do have information about them tracked, from energy to tiredness, hunger, and general happiness too, amongst other things.I'll update this to have more detail once I've played some more of it, but so far, it's good.

												I really like the premise, and the ideas behind this game, but the UI is hands down one of the worst things that I've ever seen.For the love of the players, please redesign the way the interface functions, or give us a way to choose what style of interface we want. As is, this is essentially unplayable.I'll seriously reconsider my review / recommendation if or when we get an interface that is actually usable.			"

Early Access Review
								Many reviews and ratings for this game are really out of date. I am writing this review as of version 0.9, have been playing since early Alpha, and have logged 80hrs on this game. I will say that a lot of those hours were very frustrating and felt like a slog BUT - the game is really improving.What's not so great:Thankfully it's mostly stuff that's still in progress!* Finicky system for harvesting resources; sometimes they're visible but not harvesting* Balance still needed for food production and how the colonists perceive their level of supply and comfort* Lots of time waiting for colonists to finish tasks* No randomized maps* Sometimes difficulty is frustrating rather than challenging* Still has some instability/crashesWhat's great:* Maps are handcrafted and beautiful, and highly dynamic and interactive* Feels like a fleshed out eco-system into which your colonists are intruding (not just hey there are rabbits and also wolves)* Highly varied animal species which each play unique role* TONNES of things to harvest, which can be over-harvested and lead to realistic resource scarcity, forcing your colonists to wait for them to regrow! You have to plan your settlement strategically* Cobbling together buildings and tools from realistic ingredients (not oh hey I need 5 wood and now magically have a workbench - you can see the ingredients in the design of each structure: i.e., this simple workbench has a big purple leaf as its awning, and this could break and need to be replaced)* Highly stratified task-management system to juggle priority of specific tasks and task categories* Each colonist has not just specific skill sets but different priorities for the colony (some want better food, others can live off survival rations but want more comfortable living arrangements)* Different scenarios in different timelines give different blends of survival/advanced technology perfect for a Space Western kind of genre.* Slowly and deliberately build from a collection of tents and eating fish to a developed industry town producing machine parts, finished rubber products, bombs, or moonshine!Overall the game really is a joy to play, and I wait with baited breath for each content release. It feels very distinct from other similar games, such as Stonehearth, Rim World, and Clockwork Empires and has a lot to recommend it!			"

												While I usually like this type of game I just didn't find this fun.I think its mostly the interface which is both cluttered and has multiple layers of menus that are hard to navigate, but I also think this is compounded by gameplay which seems to involve a lot of production chains and is equally fiddly. While the graphics do look nice I din't think they were especially clear in terms of being able to tell you what's going on. Lastly I didn't get the feeling of emergent gameplay which is what I usually like about similar sandbox style games. Even though you don't directly control your colonists, there is little sense that anything much will happen if you don't intervene.I sort of feel bad for not recommending this because I suppose a lot of this is a matter of taste and it could be said that the developers weren't trying to make ""that kind of game"" but I think this will pop up as recommended for a lot of people like me who like games like Rimworld, Prison Architect, Planetbase or just straight citybuilders.

Early Access Review
								This game really come a long way since I bought it. The last update mentioned they were coming out of early access in Oct. So I thought I'd play it again to see what improvements had been made. All I can say is WOW. I've been playing for about 13 hours since I started. i did get a little sleep in there somewhere. I keep losing all my coloniists, for 1 reason or another but it's not the 'rage quit' kind of feeling. I'm learning more and more about what NOT to do and what I should focus on.Still needs some work in some areas but the devs have been so active in the forums that I'm pretty sure they have a medical IV drip of coffee to their veins.Well, I gotta get back there and get some more water cane stems so I can build the workshop and I'm sure the damned binal rats have probably eaten all my food stores while I've been away.

Product received for free
												The game features only a couple of maps and some bare tutorials; Unclaimed World would benefit greatly from randomly generated sandbox levels. The interface contains a lot of information, and the game struggles to show it in an efficient manner. The production list needs a search function (on top of the filters already present), though the task list is useful and clicking on an item clearly shows the components needed to produce it. Unclaimed World has very deep, multi-tiered production chains, but designating tasks could be easier: a square area must be defined first, then an order given (scout, gather, examine, attack, hunt), rather than simply saying to collect needed items from any location. Citizens will undertake tasks automatically, however. Goods can be traded with other towns, and additional technologies can be unlocked by a vote. Citizens need food, security, and shelter, and will leave the settlement if their desires are not met. While the mechanics of Unclaimed World are quite detailed, the feature set and general approachability could be improved.

								As many before me have said, this game is still in production.  It has some kinks to iron out.  However, I did spend several hours exploring the landscape (over a couple of replays) and I am very impressed by the depth of this game thus far.  It looks like it's going to be a very unique and exceptional builder.  I would recommend it, so long as you understand that there are bugs and crashes and it's not a polished, finished product.  If you're willing to pay into it then please don't complain about this, and remember that your funding at this time of development is almost definitely going toward making the end result bigger and better.

												I really wanted to like this game. Around 6 months ago I tried it but it was far from complete and I thought they are trying hard lets give them some time and try again. After all that time I installed it again. They fixed some of the bugs but most of them are still there. People are always starving. You just spend most of your time trying to get people to eat so they wont die or leave. When you try to build new stuff it is even more annoying. Sometimes they will build it like an hour later and sometimes they wont even bother. Every 10 minutes you have to save it or it will slow down like hell eventhough I have the latest Alienware 17 so it is definitely a programming issue or even worse it will crash. In 3 hours game time it crashed more than 5 times. It is a great idea with bad elements. There is still some fun to be had and spend time. I wouldn't say it is unfixable but it needs proffessional focusing. I dont believe most gamers would be as patient as me. 5/10			"

												Well, having exited early access, I figured it was time to update the review as well.  The game definately started on shakey ground.  It had a lot of growing pains during early access....The game has grown up.  The systems that are in game work respectably.  There are still a couple issues, but the devs are working to correct those, and bring us new possiblities.  It has become a real simulator, where you actually can build what you want (within reason).Now that it's released, I would definately recommend this for people who enjoy the style.  It's not the most stellar (no pun intended) presentation, but it is definately fun to play, works pretty smoothly, and will give you several hours of enjoyment at minimum.			"

												Unfortunately buying this game while still in early access was a mistake. I cannot recommend it. After a long development, the final game still feels like an early access version. The UI is horrible and one of the UI that really are the exact opposite of what an UI should do. It is not responsive, easy to control, easy to be informed and it is not interactive. You need excessively many clicks to do the most basic things. The graphic is nice – until u realize you cannot zoom in. It is like having an ant farm – just boring.

Early Access Review
								This is a beautiful and complex management/survival/crafting/Sim game that has a ton of potential.  The developers seem to be updating on a pretty regular basis and if this type of game appeals to you then I'd say support it with your dollars!  Is it 100% fleshed out yet?  Nope, but I'll say that it has about 2-3x's more gameplay and polish than it did 6-10 months ago (when I played it last). One thing I like about it is that the developers aren't afraid to build a good bit of complexity into the game.  While it's no ""Dwarf Fortress"", it has some depth (and more to come from what I've been reading).  I think this has potential to be a great little gem.			"

Early Access Review
								I was very sceptical at first seeing that this is an early access game, and I have considered for awhile now if I should buy it.  The graphics didn’t seem to be worth a mention … I mean you’re playing with midgets Well two days ago I though what the heck, seeing as the devs are not going to drop the price I just get it over with and buy it. They’ll probably reduce the price now that I’ve bought the game (Murphy’s Law).I have only 90 minutes on record with this game and I must admit, its 90 minutes that went by very quickly. The reason being that I started enjoying these midgets’ tasks to complete. They seem a bit lazy because they move very slow, but hey their going through a tough time right. And they seem reluctant to start working on tasks that are urgent, but that’s the rebellious nature of man. As mentioned the time spent on playing this game went buy very quickly and that is because I found it to be a very enjoyable experience. Its one of those games where you say “I just want them to build this before I quit”, and after that its one more thing and the process just keep on repeating itself until you see the night is gone and you need to get ready for school or work, or even worse you’re totally late for your date with the girl of your dreams. O well, you’re now learning how to survive, so you’ll probably get a new girl. Maybe not your dream girl but hey, if you play sports you have to live with the injuries.I can appreciate the fact that the game is still in early access therefor a lot of work still needs to be done. So I think the end product should be very good. The idea of starting with nothing, salvaging, gathering and surviving is a very intriguing idea and I think there is a level of satisfaction to make these guys do stuff in order to survive.So do I recommend buying Unclaimed World in its early access state? Yes I do.			"

								Currently the game is quite enjoyable, and has a lot of features. The graphics are nice, and is has quite an advanced colony management simulation. One thing that is still a bit wonky is the interface, or maybe it just takes a bit to get used to. In that respect it is quite similar to dwarf fortress, although perhaps slightly easier to use. One thing that was a bit troublesome was that saving takes quite some time, and windows ended up closing the program, but it did successfully save and I could continue my playthrough.			"

								Ok, after last update and after I played a few more hours, I have to say this is a great game.There are some glitches now and then, but you will find a way to fix them very quickly (it coloniosts freeze, try deleting the oldest task or zone, it always worked for me).Cant agree with those who say there is no significant prgress, I see huge progress in playability and responsiveness.As for sandbox experience, this may be the dream come true and huge breakthrough, if developers polish UI, icons and do the right advertising for the mass audience.

												Having this game since it's early early alpha version when it had tons of gitches and bugs, I've seen this game come a long way. I haven't really played it that much but what I have been able to play has gotten better the more they progressed and worked on this game. While there may possibly be people who get a bug or two or some crashes, I haven't experienced anything of that nature so far. Granted, I do think the game could use a bit of polish and I can't wait for the possibility of things like electricity and medical treatment to be added. So overall, I have to give this a good solid recommended. If you like strategy story-ish like sci fi colony management games, you'll probaly like this game.			"

												Unclaimed World is an awesome game. The colony system is quite deep and it has a more relatable feeling that the Fantasy colony management games out there. I like the attemps to give the colonists personality, but their AI leaves some space for improvements: it frustrates me when they drop tasks halfway, leaving all the tools behind. Otherwise, this is a relaxing game with a complicated system where you construct a nice village. You'll be choosing new goals for your colony, pinning them to the UI to keep track of them, feeling great when they are achieved.There are some draw-backs, however. In 10 hours of gametime, I've crashed twice and I feel that the character AI could be optimized.			"

												This game has a complex survival simulation that it uses to a great detail. You can easily spend hours on a scenario and still have only half the tech tree unlocked.The Good:- Big tech tree to discover- Colonists talking to each other dynamically, not just story driven- Lots of entities walking the map at any one time- Long term scenarios that you can each play for many hoursThe Bad:- The UI needs to make things a lot clearer to the player. At one point it took me hours to realize I already had 5 farm plots while my colonists were starving.The ""this would make the game awesome"":- A scenario editor! Let people make and share their own scenarios!- Extending from the above, a random map generator.See my Let's Play playlist for how I reached the conclusions above:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV5ESRXYMGbQzK8eV747NCt0Sz_NJHhTX "

								Hello,it would be a nice game if the development would continue for one year or more, if it has some more content (except the 1-2 maps) and wouldn't crash after 1 or 2 hours. I havent managed to finish one game without a crash, wrote bugreports, etc. It has no modding support so nobody can add the missing content.Today I heard the game will be released in october 2016 - so that means for me another unfinished game to leave behind. Its a shame - the game had some really nice ideas.As a fazit i can say:- Sorry, but it is not worth the money.- I cannot recommend this game except you want to sponsor the developers.rgds			"

								Unclaimed world looks very promising indeed. Between hard sci-fi setting and survival/colony sim gameplay, the game has what it takes to attract certain players. Moreover, the indirect control style, reminiscent of ""majesty"" series, is a rare thing to see in modern games and I, for one, absolutlely love it. I can only hope for frequent updates and new scenarios. Can't wait to explore and settle this unclaimed planet!			"

												The game is definitely challenging and fun - that is one aspect that I am enjoying so far.However, graphic could have been tinkered with a bit. I have trouble telling where the water starts and the ground begins. Lastly, moving structures is out of the question (you can't move turnip shell huts). But I can live with that - just wait for them to wander through your camp and kill them.The only thing I find annoying with this game is the dog - it literally chases everything and tries to kill it. Good way to explore the map; super annoying later on. But besides that - game is really really fun.			"

												UPDATE - 7 Oct 2016The game has just gone live as version 1.0 so I thought I'd take another look at it. The developers have put effort into polishing it, and there have definitely been some optimizations, however I'm still not very impressed and I won't be playing this very much if at all.The isometric view of the game is frustrating. I keep wanting to zoom in on what is happening, but you only ever have the one fixed distance and it is from a long way out. You end up peering at the map to try and find details like plants etc that should be easy to identify.The control interface is not intuitive. Everything feels clumsy and wrongly done. Too many complicated menus, with information and controls in unlikely places. The game itself is not that complex, but learning the interface is.  I can't help but feel that a more experienced team might have designed this differently and more effectively.The pace is not well balanced, and the game drags. The first tutorial takes about 15 minutes to play through, even if you speed up time x4, however what happens feels like it should take 5 minutes. I always feel like I'm waiting for the game to catch up. That's the real killer for me, I find the game is tedious to play, and plain not entertaining.I wish I could support this small indy team more, but to be honest I'd never recommend this game to a friend.5/10 - not actually broken, but not worth playing.ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM EARLY ACCESSHard to review this game. It's in an early stage of development, sure, but even allowing for the small development team it feels like its been stuck in the same rut for a long time.  There have been several updates, but nothing has changed much and the fundamental flaws remain.  The interface is problematic, and the control system feels disconnected.I've persevered and have spent about 4 hours playing the test scenarios, but inevitably I only stay there for 15 minutes at a time before getting bored and frustrated.  I'd like to hope that it will evolve into something interesting - the potential is certainly there - but so far it's just not grabbing me.Thumbs down, I'm afraid - I'd like to give the developers more encouragement, but if the question is ""would I recommend this to a friend at this time"" then the answer is simply ""no"".

Early Access Review
								Note:  This is a review of the Early Access version of the game as of Aug 24, 2014.The game is virtually unplayable because of the incredibly frustrating, unintuitive, unfinished, and buggy interface.I fought with the interface for at least half an hour, but anyone without a lot of patience and determination will probably give up on the game in a few minutes.I'm not sorry I paid for this game, despite its unplayability, because I do think the game has a lot of potential and I want to give its developers a chance, but it's got a LONG way to go before it even becomes remotely playable, much less fun or interesting.Right now it's nothing but an exercise in frustration.  Did I mention the game was frustrating?  Frustration, frustration, frustration.  Nothing but frustration.  Actually, that's not true.  As you can see from the screenshots, the art is beautiful, and so is the music, and it's got an interesting concept... but it's all overshadowed by how awful the interface is.I hope this game gets better, I really do.  But right now I can't help but recommend that you stay away unless you want to contribute some money to its development without expecting to get any gameplay out of it at all. "

								I think there is a memory leak, as about 15-20 minutes into gameplay it crashes to the desktop.  Other than that I see no other gameplay problems.  Fun concept, enjoying it immensely			"

								Had this game since it would crash, a little over 2 years. It was fun then, took some getting used to. Now i cant even begin to understand 9/10 things to do. Like most modern things, menus within menus, within menus, within...ect Makes absolutely no sense to me anymore, more of a chore to navigate dialog box hell than anything. I get the premise, i understand the objective, its just not fun. Even though it was barely playable back when i got it, i could still manage to enjoy it.No idea how such a simple design became an over-elaborate nightmare			"

								I t I thought such a strategy/sim interesting, and also love sci/fi so I went for it, and great choice I feel, also I thought it might be boring play or to texty, or maybe complicated to learn and play. No such problems, got quite addicted to it, and seeing the interaction and the players and their stats working, I laid back and explored the game, and enjoyed it all, can hardly wait for more to come. Very nice and skillfully done game.			"

								This is a game that is in desperate need of a lot of work!The posibilities are immense and I like where it is going.The developers shuld probably think of including mining. manufacturing, industrialization, city construction, and enviornmental manipulation to name a few of the posibilities.Do you think you could include ""intelligent"" AI enemies or situations that can change as you play?

								I write reviews as if I could go back in time and tell myself if I should get it or not.Currently I dont find the game fun. I thought the art itself is pretty cool, but the game just doesnt interest me. I cant really describe it. Things just are akward, self. I dont feel in control, even though I really am. I know this is in early access so I wont ask for a refund..			"

								Very ""pretty"" df-like scifi colony building game. Unfortunately mechanics and UI are lacking. Once the pretty graphics wear off I lost interest in doing anything in the game itself.It's a real pity since it does look great.			"

								I decided to update my review below because this game didn't deliver on promises and had so much more potential than what the devs were willing to put in. I am going to leave my original review on but I will move it to the end.I have decided to unrecommend this game because the developers have stopped adding comment and promised more than what they were willing to put into this game. It really looked like it was going places for a while there with regular updates and gameplay changes but I suppose why continue with the dev when you've already milked the cow. I won't be supporting Nordic Games in future.***Below is the original reviewThis game is an absolutely amazing concept for an economic/town management type simulator. I love how the game combines advanced technologies with very low level primitive technologies to give an exciting twist on economic and town management in a futuristic sci-fi setting. If you enjoyed playing the old Caesar 3, Emperor and Pharoah games then then this is your type of simulation game but it is however much more than these games because it combines other aspects into the settlement running that make it a lot less mechanical and requires a lot more input from the player, it really pulls the aspects of building a town that will thrive while ensuring that you survive together into one continuous journey. You will constantly be tested by dangerous beasts that try to eat your settlers and plagued by vermin who steal your food stores.I bought this game at a very early stage of development and was very disappointed with the lack of features in the game but since the release of a lot more content it has started to become the simulator/town management game that I have dreamed of playing for so long and has really in my opinion become money well spent on a game under development even though I didn't initially feel this way.Be advised that the game is still in a very early stage of development and there does tend to be a long wait time on updates to the game but when an update is released it tends to add a whole new level of depth to the game which really makes it worth playing which is why I have recently logged so many hours playing this game.I would like to see a lot more content added to this game both in the world variety (fauna, flora and environment) as well as different scenario types each with their own unique challenges. Unfortunately there is only a single player mode so there is no intertribal warring and there is currently no sandbox mode.			"

								Post Release Update: Since poking at it on and off for a while, it does not feel fluid or fully functional. Still has a horrid UI that I was really hoping they would scrap. ""Maybe they will fix it with patches"" isn't good enough for me, and I'm not a fan of things being released and entirely new content being patched in that should have been there before release. Changing this review to negative.Update: Might want to wait until this one is farther along or promised to be finished, as the development cycle isnt very fast.Shows promise, not feature full yet, but does have good vision and a steady updates (Albeit slow, probably smaller team) .The systems they have in place show some foresight, compared to other strategy sim games (Gnomaria, towns, etc) and I can see they had good systems from the start. It has been a while since early access started but it seems they have been adressing AI bugs and implementing systems over just raw content.  I would wait for release or a sale if you like something feature complete, but if you are like me and just like to keep an eye on projects as they go grab it and suppourt them, as long as they don't abandon it like some other ones *cough spacebase cough* then it will prove to be a solid game			"
