												Reviewing a remake of a game that is over ten years old is a little difficult, especially if the remake is nearly an exact copy of the original game.  In this case, “Age of Mythology: Extended Edition” is nearly identical.  Everything from the character models to the level design remain the same.  Don’t get me wrong, it looks much prettier than I remember it…but aside from the extras, you’re getting the same game you played years prior.  Same scoop of vanilla ice cream if you will, but with jimmies and chocolate syrup on top.  Shadows, lighting, water effects, time of day, antialiasing, ambient occlusion…all great additions, I just wish there was a bit more.  Twitch users will be pleased to know that there is Twitch integration, though I personally haven’t tried it to know if it works.With that being said, I do appreciate the remake, even if it’s almost the same game as I played years ago.  Seeing the updated graphics was nice, though I admit the appeal was mainly centered around the fact that I didn’t have to enter my blasted serial key each time I wanted to install the game.  I also don’t have to worry about managing discs…all three products (“Age of Mythology”, “Age of Mythology: The Titans”, “Golden Gift Campaign”) were all condensed into one nice, easy to boot up package.  It’s hard to justify that convenience into a thirty dollar price tag however, the going rate as of 4/29/14.  If you’ve never played “Age of Mythology”, love RTS’s, and don’t mind the outdated character models/interface, then picking this up is most certainly worth your time and money. If you have your own playable copies of the game from years ago and want to know if buying the extended edition for the effects is worth thirty bucks, then I’d have to say (with heartfelt regret) no.Full Review:http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/Gameplay Video:

												Age of Mythology is the classic, mythology based spinoff of Age of Empires, and boy was it fun. But does Age of Mythology  Extended Edition live up to the original? In many ways, very much so, though the price tag might dissaude you unless you're a huge fan, (like I am). If you've played Age of Mythology before, you know exactly how this game works. If not, here a basic gist of it. It plays much like Age of Empires 2; you have to collect resources, specifically food, wood and gold, in order to fund your armies, economies, technologies and advancement. sounds basic enough, and all the races work similarly in regards to these resources. The difference comes in the fourth resource: Favour. Favour is generated differently depending on which race you are playing. For instance, the greeks generate favour through worship, the egyptians through building monuments, the norse through heroes and fighting, and the atlanteans through having more settlements. Favour is the special resource, which ties into the major mechanic of Age of Mythology: Gods and God Powers. There are 12 major gods, 3 for each of the races, and these determine starting bonuses for you when you start the game. the gods also have minor gods to choose each time you advance an age, with a total of 36 minor gods, each offering different bonuses and god powers. For instance Hades gives you the Sentinel God Power, that creates stone sentinels to watch over your town centre, but in the second age, you can choose Athena, who allows you to train minotaurs and the Restoration God power which can heal your units.Aside from the new favour mechanic, for the major part it plays like the age of empires games. Build Army, upgrade, and take care of your population cap and economy. Rock paper scissors, for basic units, (cavalry beats archers who beat infantry), but add heroes and myth units which can turn the tide of battle. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer are fun, and with the new release, there is a rebirth in the multiplayer, though not as big as the heyday of AoM. As being essentially a remake (a la Age of Empires 2 HD Edition), AoM:EE is actually fairly bug free, and while it definitely shows its age, the added subtle lighting effects, water and shadows do help to make look better. It is definitely very playable, and for fans of the original, it shouldn't even be a bother.The campaign is just as memeroable as always, a hunt through Greece, Egypt, Scandinavia and finally Atlantis in order to stop a power hungry cyclops from releasing Kronos, King of the Titans; followed by A New Atlantis, set a number of years later,  where you are tricked into releasing the Titans, and must stop them at all costs . Overall, Age of Mythology: Extended Editon is fun, unique and offers up plenty of value, with 50 singleplayer missions, skrimishes, and now revived multiplayer, though for those who still have a copy of Age of Mythology and The Titans expansion, it might not add a great deal. Definitely recommend everyone else (who's a fan of older RTSes). "

												Ordinarily, I don't write reviews - but I've always been pretty invested in the Ensemble Studios games and seeing what Microsoft and Skybox have done with one of their all-time legends has pushed me into comment.Age of Mythology: Extended Edition. Ordinarily, to extend something means to prolong it or make it bigger somehow but if you're hoping for new content, this game does not have any. It's just the same game you played back in 2003 - but that's not so bad, because that game was great. This however, isn't - and there's some vital reasons as to why:1 - The Multiplayer. The most important aspect of any Real Time Strategy game is its multiplayer community and Age of Mythology has always had a creative and thriving one. This Extended Edition would too - if the multiplayer actually worked. You don't need me to tell you, just go check out the Support forum for this game. The game suffers from consistent crashes, desync, stuttering, framedrops and lag when attempting an online game. The developers blame ""ancient bugs"" left over from the original game despite the fact that none of these bugs were actually present in the 2003 release and accusing the now defunct Ensemble Studios (thanks Microsoft) for being responsible for your own mistakes is downright cowardly. disrespectful and lazy especially seeing as you're now flogging their product to an unaware market.2 - The Single Player. The AI during Single Player matches is bizarre, eclectic and at often times completely incomprehensible. Prone to suddenly stopping all activity halfway through a match for completely banal reasons (there was no food in their line of sight, you spawned too close to them etc) every Random Match is essentially a roll-of-the-dice of whether or not the AI feels like playing along this time. This problem has only been made worse by the addition of the new, COMPULSORY DLC which has 'updated' the AI to coincide with the introduction of a new civilization. Unfortunately, those who don't purchase the DLC are still obligated to download the patch, meaning they suffer from all of the bugs whilst receiving none of the reward.3 - The DLC.  Most likely what drew you to this Steam page in the first place seeing as this game hasn't seen a real increase in playerbase in almost a year. I followed the development of the DLC for a good few months and have been heavily invested in it. The attitude of the developers and their 'effort' as far as producing quality content goes is detestable. Aside from the rather invested and community-involved attitude from those at ForgottenEmpires (a small team of fans), comment and involvement from the lead developers (Skybox) has consisted of grade-1 ♥♥♥♥-all. They spent a good few months assuring us the DLC would contain strictly new, fresh content without any reskinning, repackaging or rebranding of existing content and that turned out to be a complete lie. They also lied about having playtested the game for balance - admitting during a public streaming of the game (you can find it on Youtube) that they purposefully left the DLC broken and unbalanced as a means of making people have to play it. The DLC itsels is incredibly broken as of writing this (again, check the Support forum), with half the playerbase unable to access the DLC at all and the other half jokingly trying to laugh off the regret of their purchase.One of the developers admitted on the Subreddit that they are currently ""using the public to beta test the game"" - meaning that if you buy this DLC you are not getting content, you are buying into the opportunity to test unfinished content. This coupled with the fact that the developers openly laughed at the idea of fixing the Multiplayer (again, check the stream) tells me that we aren't dealing with incompetent developers - we're dealing with scam artists.I don't like having to write this sort of stuff about any Ensemble Studios IP because it sucks seeing their legacy ♥♥♥♥ on by untalented coat-tail riders, but if it means discouraging people from wasting their money on what is essentially a gigantic bug test, then it feels somewhat worthwhile. Only buy this if you absolutely *must* play Age of Mythology again and don't want to go through the effort of pirating the old copy and getting it to work - but know that this is not the Age of Mythology you played ten years ago and it certainly is not a well-supported or active game.

												\ Ignore the amount of hours I have here, I've played the original game and the Titans expansion for hundreds of hours. / - THOSE WHO HAVE PLAYED THE ORIGINAL GAME SKIP THE FIRST PARAGRAPH - Age of Mythology is a simple strategy game to get into, but hard to master. The game has 3 campaigns (although not the same length) and PvP multiplayer (Online, AI and LAN). The first campaign alone (32 levels) is a lot of fun and the story is very interesting; it will take more than 30 hours to complete this campaign alone! Add on the Titans campaign and another one (which I haven't played yet) and you can easily get over 60 hours of play-time.The multiplayer is nice and easy to set up and a lot of fun and very competitive.The mechanics are pretty much the same as any other RTS (Real Time Strategy) game: gather resources, build a big city and army, and finally demolish the enemy. Unlike other RTS games I have tried in the past, the game is easy to learn and the UI is very well set out and organised: you will rarely, if never, get confused as to what's going on or what you're supposed to do to advance/beat the level.Now, I'll talk about the remastering of the game.The game is pretty much the same, apart from the inclusion of the expansions straight away; you won't find anything new gameplay-wise or content-wise. What has improved is the support for high screen resolutions (including multi-monitor setups, which I have tried myself and... oh boy... it's faboulous), better shadows and lighting. A cool addition is the ability to stream on Twitch directly from the game; I haven't tried doing so myself but I think it's a nice feature.Lastly, there's Mods. Still have to play around with them, but as far as I've seen there's some quality stuff.\ VERDICT /If you have played Age of Mythology before and want to re-experience everything again and compete against other players, this game won't disappoint you. BUY THIS GAME.But if you're expecting new stuff, you're out of luck.If you have never played Age of Mythology you're missing out a lot. BUY THIS GAME.If you have played any Age of Empires game and you enjoyed them BUY THIS GAME.This is the longest review I've ever written on Steam.			"

												As you see I've spent over 600 hours playing this game, and that is not even a lot when you compare it to the time I played the original game for. Definitely had to re-write my review since my other one was made after 30 gameplay hours.Age of Mythology takes you into one of the most unique and timeless RTS experiences I have ever seen. You have to pick between 4 civilizations: the Greek, Egyptian, Norse and Atlantean - each have 3 major gods to pick from. There are 4 ages to guide your civilization through, each of which unlocks new buildings, upgrades and units.  Each of these presents you with two choices for minor gods that you can worship. Every time you choose a god(including the major god), you will unlock a god power that can be used only once (up to 3 times if you're Atlantean) as well as a mythological creature or two that are associated with your god choice + unique upgrades. These god powers can change the tide of the game entirely.Each civilization is completely different in their design, and there can be differences between identical major gods as well thanks to the minor god system.The units classes featured are infantry, cavalry, archers, siege, heroes, mythological creatures and ships. The game makes these interact in a rock-paper-sciccor mechanic.The campaign is very high quality for its time, it can be highly entertaining even now, though. A total of around 50 missions is more than any RTS game will give you. The voice acting is great, though the dialouge and the plot get cheesy at points.Graphically, the shadows, the water improvements, the map texture improvements are nice, but they cannot hide the dated models and textures. I wish those had been areas of focus when it comes to visual improvements. The lighting is terrible in a few cases, so I would recommend turning the ""lights on units"" option off, as it's the worst of all new features. FXAA and water refraction aren't too helpful either, but to each their own.The multiplayer is awesome design vise. A multitude of game modes, custom scenarios (aka minigames), supremacy(standard mode), deathmatch(high starting resources, all upgrades researched) etc will definitely keep you hooked for months, if not years. Multiplayer performance, while improved via patches, is still not perfect, but definitely playable. Just make sure you don't run on an integrated graphics card. If you have both an integrated card and a dedicated one in your system, make sure the game defaults to the dedicated one via your driver.As for the competitiveness of multiplayer, ranked games are available via a matchmaking system that will attempt matching you against player of similar skill. Most, if not all methods of abusing the system have been dealt with by the developers.Overall I am happy with the game, but it could have been so much better. Rating it below:Graphics: 5/10Single player content: 10/15Multiplayer content: 12/15Music, sounds: 10/10Moddability, replayability: 11/15Stability, bugs: 5/15E-sport features (replays, observer mode): 8/10Cost/value: 7/10Final score: 68%			"

												I wrote a review for this a while back, and I can say with confidence many issues have been sorted out, but some are still persistent.If you have never played this game, I am going to say right now to buy this game and play it. The campaign and its storyline is great, the factions are unique and well fleshed out and balance, for the most part, is achieved with some minor discrepencies/exploits which with experience can be learned to be countered.I will say that the game is not in its glory days anymore as this IS a re-release of a fairly old title. But the multiplayer is also active enough to have a competitive community and there is a revival in the scenario community to experience a taste of the legacy of AoM mapmakers, I suggest looking on http://aom.heavengames.com/downloads/ for more or the Steam workshop downloads provided.But lets start with the actual meat of the game for anyone reading for determining whether to buy this:The Extended Edition brings many new improvements over old Age of Mythology and the Titans expansion included, water and other graphics are overhauled and improved significantly. Graphics in general have been improved over the original and the game looks much more vibrant and detailed. This makes playing the singleplayer campaign, which is still one of the better campaigns of an RTS I have played, much more enjoyable.A new online server is also available for multiplayer gameplay and while its nowhere even close to the glory days of ESO in terms of activity and the amount of scenario makers, some old faces are there both in competitive gameplay and with old mapmakers, and some newer map makers such as myself have been sprouting up. In terms of connection these days it really depends on whose actually in the game but as long as you're computer isn't a toaster your connection and running of this game should go forward without a hitch.However there is still some bugs that are highly irritating that remain. Desync errors still happen too frequently for my tastes and this wouldn't be so much a problem if it didn't lower the rating of those involved in ranked matches. When someone is on the verge of victory and then a desync error occurs to make them lose rating... its understandable someone would be angry.There is also more visible lag and connection issues between players then there was on the old AoM in certain instances, such as on certain scenarios or with people with very bad connection to begin with. And the Extended Edition is notable in how it actually lags your computer- some of us may remember we could browse the internet with Age of Mythology running in windowed mode or running other programs while we wait for a game; while this isn't prevented and is still possible the speed of which you do so is stifling and I would not recommend it at all now. (Nor would I recommend it in matches even back then, but if you're in lobby just idling, waiting for your friend to host that game...)I suggest if you are buying this, do not play on your toaster or similar dinosaur computer, this is an updated version of Age of Mythology meant to be played on semi modern machines.And as for scenario editors who wish to return to making maps for this game: The online multiplayer community is in desperate need of scenario revival. There is scenarios still being played from time to time but the newer population of competitive players is either unaware of most of the maps or simply do not host them, mostly the former. As for the editor itself, for all intents and purposes its more or less the same as what we know, but there is some notable differences now.The differences boil down to some old trigger techniques not working, and now causing horrible lag. The old trick of looping Move Army To to move your spawned units to a location, looping it within the trigger editor now causes horrible lag and no longer just simply makes them keep moving there. It acts as if the computer stops their units and tells them to move there, acting as if the loop was just restarting and stopping the order instead of merely continuing it as it did in the past.There is also UI changes to the editor, and while the function is largely the same it takes a bit getting used to. I can say with confidence though the editor is still fairly user friendly and easy to learn, though trying to find experienced mappers to help you with your project is a little difficult in terms of looking on the lobby- you'll have to consult various forums like AoM heaven or pitch it on the steam forums for this game somewhere. I myself can help with things too, and even old legends like Nottud are still around if you look...So it boggles down to this, overall: Should you buy this game if you are new, and should you buy this game if you already have age of mythology, the original and its expansion, to relive your nolstalgia?If you are new, refer to the top. Yes. If you are an old and musty returning player like me, Yes, but don't expect it to be total brass and shine throughout the entire game. There is some grime to be worked out with this still but I can say with confidence there has been legitimate work and attention on this game to improve it and fix bugs.(p.s Potato, if you review my review im going to shoot you and feed you to a chimera, not only was your review pointless, it was awful in its critique and if anything uninformative. No one cares about grammar to that extent, it's all about presentation, and the clarity of my review was fine. That is all :D ) "

												I have been playtesting Age of Mythology: Extended Edition for a week, played over 30h, and yes, the game is worth it. If you are at least marginally into RTS, this is a game you shouldn't miss.If you are new to AoM, you're in for a good old real-time strategy experience that shaped the world of RTS gaming, all in a fun mythological setting. Specific mechanics like god powers and mythological units make the gameplay unique and interesting, bringing different style, but with the same basics, to the whole of ""Age of"" franchise, the paragon of strategy gaming.If you played the original, you're going to get the same great gaming experience, but with some extra goodies. Obvious are enhanced graphics and support of today's resolutions (I've been playing on 1920x1200 with no problems) - the graphics take a while getting used to as there are some harder to discern things due to the new lighting and colour scheme of map backgrounds, but overall the change is nice and adds to the game, making it more attractive for first timers.The most important addition is revitalisation of multiplayer through Steam, which looks just like old ESO. You have Quick Search for random matchmaking, advanced games for all your fun and scenario games, chat lobby and they added Leagues and Events. They've also included Treaty mode (ceasefire until certain amount of time) and the option to disable Titans (the unit). You can check the video I made about the Multiplayer Online Lobby

			A comprehensive playtesting look at the online multiplayer lobby (aka new ESO) for Age of Mythology: Extended Edition. Quick search, advanced games, ladders, chats... All there!		

Another fun thing is the Steam Workshop and the fact the game has been made more friendly to modders. AoM community has always been full of talented people producing fun and useful content like various UIs and custom scenarios, and even before launch, there are mods already trickling in. Plus most of the original custom scenarios should work even on AoM:EE, so no real way to get bored with this game :-)Last thing in need of mentioning is improved support of Observer Mode and streaming - you can now see various in-game stats of players like resources, upgrades in process and similar in an easy to navigate table to give you a better idea of how are the players doing, and you can also switch to players' perspectives. This same interface works in recorded games, so you can analyse even those.All in all a nice remake of a great game. If you loved the original, you'll enjoy this, if this is your first time with AoM, you'll enjoy it, too :-)If you'd like to see the game in action, check my livestream http://www.twitch.tv/blackaddersplays and the videos on my YouTube https://www.youtube.com/BlackAddersPlays

												Pixel Judge Age of Mythology: Extended Edition reviewThe VerdictAge of Mythology: Extended Edition is a very good cash-in on an old game. RTS market isn‘t really oversaturated and AoMEE is still a solid game. Two good (and one less so) campaigns that are bundled together with really fun skirmish, and all of that is topped by an excellent map editor, and now, Steam Workshop integration. What else could one ask? Surely not a sequel, because it would suck.Score: 4.5/5 - Still a legendary game.Full review and appeals - http://www.pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/ "

												Game breaking bug pertaining to memory usage still persists after a number of years unfixed.  Many many many people have reported it in ongoing threads and nothing is done.Any lengthy or large games against AIs will crash, it's just a matter of how long the game will be.  I have not finished a single game because every one of them has come up with the ""UNABLE TO ALLOCATE MEMORY SIZE 172"" error.Can't recommend a game that's not even fully playable.

												I first bought this game on CD, (Age of Mythology: Titan's Expansion Gold Edition). When I played it, I found it to be one of the best games I have ever played and to this day it still is. This type of brilliant RTS game is sadly practically dead. Which makes this game a must-have for anyone who is looking for a gem. The campaign for both Age of Mythology and then the Titan's Expansion are both amazing. I am a person who usually does not play the campaign's since they are far from enjoyable. Yet this storyline will make you want to play it, you will want to know what is going to happen next.Why did I hit ""Not Recommend"" then? Very simple, ""Age of Mythology: Extended Edition."" These new developers are a insult and a slap in the face to a brilliant game. I went and bought the Extended Edition when I heard a new DLC was coming out. When I play Extended Edition, some of the textures they have ""enhanced"" look far worse. I could not believe the terrible lighting and how awful the Hades States for the Temple looks. It is like a slap in the face to the Greek gods. The DLC is far worst, next to all the ""new"" units are actually just reskins of units from the other factions! I have continued to hear that the campaign is buggy and terrible. If this DLC was a mod, I would have deleted it and gave it a thumbs down for no effort. I refuse to play the new DLC and ruin my image of this beautiful game that has already been tainted by these amateurs...What I recommend you do? Go and buy :Age of Mythology: Titan's Expansion"" or ""Age of Mythology: Gold Edition"".  It is only $10-$15 and you will like the untainted version so much more. I love this game and I would love to see it continued, but not by these childish developers who have no respect for this game or doing a honest day's work.			"

												Simply an awesome game. As a new AoM player, but an old AoE player, I am certainly impressed and cannot believe that I missed this game during its original days. All the best qualities of Age of Empires combined with an unique mythic atmosphere. If, like me, you never played this game before, now it's certainly the time to get it. Otherwise you're probably looking for the Steam improvements such as Multiplayer and Workshop support. See you online!			"

												I was fooled by myself, thinking this would be a great Extension to AOM, I feel that the developers and the people who worked on this (Sky box) have cashed in, knowing people will buy this regardless if they polish it well or badly because of nostalgia and the sly meta critic score that was taken from the original release several years ago. They knew there were going to be problems with this game upon release, it is disgusting to think that any company would release a product which is not up to scratch especially since the game was already released. I didn't pay the already expensive price to play a beta of a game that already exists. They have not delivered in my opinion, the AI is still terrible, the Multiplayer is lagging (reason I bought this game) and the frame rate is questionable for a game like this, the lighting effects are nothing special if not distracting and the menus are different (compared to the originals) but either way, re-mastered or not, the menus fulfilled their purpose, to be menus. I don't see how this warrants at £20 price tag. To make matters worse me and my friends are encountering problems with the steam overlay which is hindering our multiplayer experience. The steam workshop is also not working.I do not recommend buying this until the price drops and the problems with it are fixed, I will not trust this company again I thought AOE2 should have been a good indication of how they handle projects like these, I feel silly to have used the benefit of the doubt.Age of Mythology (when it is working) however is an excellent strategy game for competitive play, the multiplayer is excellent and the different civilizations are unique in terms of units, technologies and strategies that can be applied, it makes for a fresh experience on an age old formula, If only they continued after Age of Empires 3.

This is still a great game that will give you the same satisfaction that you have gotten from the other titles. The campaign is fun and quite a lengthy investment. The expansion added campaign following the original is fantastic as well. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353515278You can live without the dwarves focused one, while it has some fun ideas for maps it's short, easy and lacks any real depth . The main problem I had with these in the newest steam version was that the graphical quality seems to have been dramatically reduced.The day and night cycle is over rated and really serves no point, if anything I found it broke the game up more and turned it off. Multiplayer is fun but expect to play against strong players. Random AI matches are the same as before but with two new game types. They can be fun but I've always been a conquest or occasionally supremacy fan. Overall it's basically the same game that it was in the past. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353515262The steam community seems to have produced a nice array of new mods to enjoy and I've had fun revisiting this game once again. If you are considering repurchasing this game, wait for a sale and pick it up cheap, it's the same game. If you are looking at this game for the first time and enjoy similar games in the ""age of"" series you should enjoy this title and get your money's worth from it but it may seem a little dated at first.

												The DLC changed the main game, forcing new crappy units onto the game, and you´re not able to disable them, neither are you able to disable the new DLC gods, because the devs want money obviously, so they´ll keep pestering you, and will allow their buyers to play as much as they like online with the crappy new gods. So many bugs in the game, way more than there was in the past, and alot more disconnections since the DLC was introduced. Skybox completly ruined the AOM special feeling...""May very well be the only RTS game you´ll ever need"" a review said more than 10 years ago, written on the back of the disc version.  That perfectly describes and sums up the unique feeling of aom, both casually and competitve. If you´re a hardcore fan since 2002, then you´ll be very disappointed in this digital steam version...Truly miss the old ESO servers ...if you want to play this game, use the disc version and go to voobly (preferable) or GR. This is only good if you want to play scenarios. If you want a proper match, stay away from this garbage.oh...and to anyone who´s been playing online, don´t forget "" new badges coming soon""...

												If you are looking for a multiplayer RTS, and your internet speed isn't incredible, move along. That said, if you are interested in single player or have amazing internet connection, go right ahead. In Short - There is a compounded latency issue. Animation quality is directly proportional to connection quality. One player with a bad connection (Or a large number of players) will slow your game. And when it slows down your game, it slows down everything causing animations to lag and glitch. They’ve updated the server client code in the Extended Edition, where they didn't need to (causing terrible bugs).In Long: Instead of a dedicated server setup. AOM now uses a peer to peer connection. The Pros are that you don't need to create servers, or port forward. But the downside is that the next iteration of the game cannot continue until every player has received information from every other player. This means that with more players, more information is required to be sent before a game iteration occurs. Additionally, with one player with a high latency, that latency affects every single player within the game. Currently with this problem, AOM game speed slows down, affecting EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF GAMEPLAY. This includes MODEL ANIMATION (Imagine bad connection = laggy and glitchy character models). However, this game would have been fine it they either: When the game speed is slowed down, change the timings of the model animations to match the new game speed (Just play on lightning speed to compensate).…Or just kept the old dedicated server engine for AOM.It saddens me that I cannot play this game reasonably with my friends, and I don’t want others to be disappointed. Considering that we all pre-paid, none of us can get a refund for the game we bought. That said, if you are interested in single player or have amazing internet connection, go right ahead.			"

												Age of Mythology is a great game.  This version of it unfortunately does not work.  I usually spend a couple hours starting a game, and for well above 50% of the games I try it either crashes and corrupts the save, completely losing my progress, or the framerate randomly starts alternating between about 5 seconds of normal fps, then dropping to completelly unplayable levels.

I feel like the features it has does not suit the $ 30 , if you are planning to get it I recommend getting it during a sale. It is fun, especially playing with friends and having to pretend to talk to the AI, they say some of the ugh.. stupidest things sometimes lol ""JUST SHUT UP CORNITH"" (god I hate Cornith lmao) The game is pretty basic too, collecting your basic rescources like wood, gold and food, building up your army to massacre other teams. One annoying thing is as soon as you take over a team you have to make sure to destroy their buildings and kill EVERY unit they might have. this is especially annoying due to the fact that sometimes they have one stupid fish boat swimmin' around somewhere in the ocean and you have no idea where it is. *Overall, I`d say this game is worth your time but not worth the full price!TL;DR : annoying wierd AI, really fun, basic game and ♥♥♥♥ you Cornith "

And I regret it.Problem: They messed up badly with the multiplayer network (Doesn't matter how fast your connection is and how beasty your computer is). Even if played via lan, the lag totally kills the fun,  and at least for myself and everyone I know, makes the multiplayer beyond frustrating.-If you intend to play the campaign and singleplayer ai skirmishes only,  go ahead and enjoy.   HOWEVER,-If you want to buy this for the MULTIPLAYER,  - DON'T BUY THIS!

												Age of Mythology: EE is a reprise of the oldschool AoM: Titans, incorporating many online features thanks to the Steam platform the game manages to come back to life easing out the task of playing with other players around the world which is always a refreshing thing to do when it comes to replaying really oldschool games.Graphically the improvs of the game aren't as shocking as the multiple previews we had through the years this was being announced, but its something, and its nice, decent.The game on its core is better balanced, and the gameplay has some nifty improvements to offer.The main issue is the performance. Somehow the game manages to run poorly on most systems, with huge frame drops, and the games unability to run from certain common graphic cards, and only from integrated graphics. Which drops the framerate and overall responsiveness even more. To the point that is actually hard to enjoy.Even if there aren't much changes graphically/gameplay wise to be called ""Extended Edition"" its a shame such cool online features are being hindered by the inability to correctly address the performance issues that were promised to be tackled since the launch itself.If you really enjoy RTS games, and you love AoM, and you're sure your system's performance will overcome the game issues then you will have a good time.Otherwise. Stay Away.			"

												I've played AoM since about when it first came out, or at least a good chunk of my childhood. And its absolutely awesome to see if on steam but there is just so many bugs at the moment. I can't launch a single player game at all, because theres some sort of bug in an expansion that I didn't buy currently corrupting the game I did buy. Its a tangled mess that frankly is beyond me. It sort of reminds me of what happens when a game thinks its been pirated. It'll let you run the game and then immeadietly before you start gameplay it shuts down and goes ""nope no play for you.""

												TL:DR version - I like age of mythology as a game, but this remake kind of sucks.TL:ohgawdwhyareyoustilltalking version...Alright, let's start with what makes age of mythology great! As a game, it's wonderful and has stood the test of time. You have a wide array of very different strategies and tactics you can use, the different races all feel substantially unique from one another, and you can pick various major and minor deities to worship which each tweak your play style to suit your individual preferences better!The units are fairly unique from one another, there's lots of interesting mythological things like giants, pegasi, sphinxes and so on, and the economic aspects are rather enjoyable as well, which is rare for a strategy game. For an example of the economic stuff, look to the egyptians who can have their pharoah empower a building to make it build faster or boost the resources given to it, or that the atlanteans carry carts with them so they don't have to wander all the way back to town to drop off resources.There's always sort of a rock/paper/scissors thing going on, and no one unit is overpowered... buuuuut. Ah, yeah, there's always a but isn't there? It's a big fat butt in this case. Several of them.Well, some of what I just mentioned isn't super accurate. A lot of the units are very, very similar with little difference at all other than their stats - special abilities are pretty much reserved for mythological units and the god powers can only be invoked once per game instead of on a cooldown so they're not that impressive most of the time. Generally speaking, your units may look different and be better tasks, but one soldier is pretty much the same as any other soldier, other than what they do bonus damage against.That's another issue... the ""balance"" of the game, if you can call it that, is kind of wonky. If you look to other strategy games, such as the blizzard games of warcraft 3 or starcraft 1 or 2, the difference between being ""good"" against another unit or ""bad"" is generally 150% normal damage vs 50% normal damage in return. It's a significant difference and makes it possible for masses of units to fight things they're not that good against so long as you severely outnumber them. In AoM... well, you get things like a x15 damage multiplier... it's kind of absurd. If you aren't fighting something you deal bonus damage to, you may as well not be fighting at all.This balance also has the problem that the ""rock, paper scissors"" moteif that AoM has going for it kind of breaks down with mythological units. Oh, you like your sphinxes? Too bad. Sure, they look big and strong, with much higher stats than normal infantry... but if the enemy has even a single hero, the bonus damage from heroes to myth units is so absurd that you may as well never bother making myth units. Especially against the greeks who have some of the most powerful and cheapest heroes which take forever to kill since nothing does bonus damage against heroes. The game claims normal infantry are the counter to heroes, but they really aren't.The AI and mechanics make turtling not an overly useful strategy as well - all, literally all defensive structures deal piercing damage, and siege weapons usually have 80-99% resistance to piercing. Walls are easily destroyed, and the AI just sends wave after wave after wave of the same small units over and over so you'll probably never be able to rebuild a wall once it's damaged, even with the silly fast building speed in the game. So if you like to turtle and just tech up for long periods of time, you're going to find it's a nuisance - not difficult, just annoying, especially since the AI tends to ignore military units to attack peasants mindlessly. You can work around those things, but it's irritating instead of fun.Still, the game is fun as a whole. There's no denying that. As strategy games go, even for the minor nuisances it has, it's still one of the best, and by far the best of the age of empires series by leaps and bounds over any other. Yeah, the game balance is a bit wonky, but it sorta kinda works still. Really, it's fun in a way that more serious games like starcraft aren't. Starcraft II has by far a better campaign mode, but honestly I'd say the skirmishes in AoM are vastly superior to the skirmishes in SC2 surprisingly enough, and I have a platinum rating on SC2 so make of that what you will.So if the game's still very fun after so many years... what's wrong with it? Why the downvote?Well... this version... sucks, to put it mildly.Example: do you have a computer that can run Evolve at 120FPS? Well expect to have dips below 10FPS on AoM.The ""new features"" are things that honestly have no real impact on the game. A tiny little mini campaign is kinda... nice I guess? But let's be honest, the vast bulk of a strategy game's lifespan and value comes from its skirmish mode which this doesn't change in the slightest. The day night cycle is... negligible, as is much of everything else.The glitches that are brought, such as crashes, freezing, framerate drops, and actually a significantly reduced AI kind of diminish the game. The original was better because it actually worked. This version... you've got a 50/50 chance of finishing a mission without it being finished for you by a glitch of some sort or another. These bugs have been around for over a year now, so don't expect them to ever get patched.The price point is also a major issue - I was annoyed enough as it was that AoM was still trying to charge $20 when it was a decade old. Then they came out with the ""extended"" version... and now they want over $35 for it. Yeaaaaaaaaaaahno. Get it on sale, but that's it.Actually, you know what? Buy AoM: extended edition on sale... and then download a hacked copy of the original after you've paid for this one, and play the hacked one instead because it's flat out going to play better than this. That's right, I just told you to pay for the game but play a hacked one. That should tell you something about the quality of the game - the game itself is fine, but this version isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Oh, it's a computer title. It's not printed on paper. Yeaaaah it's worth less than $0 as it is.Oh well.But I didn't get the chance to pay for AoM when it first came out years ago, and honestly, AoM as a game is worth paying for to encourage further development of games such as this. Seriously, support AoM:EE simply because if enough people do, maybe they'll make a sequel. Yeah, the extended edition sucks, yeah, it doesn't deserve your money, and yeah, a hacked version of the original is simply the better game... but AoM itself deserves a reward for existing, even if they dropped the ball on this one. Into the sewer. Sorry, I don't have hip waders, I'm not going to go dig it out of the slime and sewage.If you do, however, have the hip waders? It's a magnificient game beneath a veneer of crap, so if you can wash it off, it's well worth it. I just can't recommend this release is all. Even at -75% off.			"

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition as a real-time strategy game published by Microsoft. It is a perfected version of the old game Age of Mythology and Age of Mythology: The Titans.Age of Mythology: Extended Edition gameplay are pretty much the same as the old Age of Mythology and Age of Mythology: The Titans made into one game. In addition, the Golden Gift add on are also included in this remake. Unlike Age of Empires II: HD Edition, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition doesn't have population cap increase, everything in the gameplay stays the same. It's quite nostalgic to replay this old game with improved graphics, I remember almost all the god powers I used, the meteor rain, tornado, earthquake and more. Age of Mythology: Extended Edition also comes with Steam Cloud support and Steam Workshop support, which is a great addition into the game.Age of Mythology: Extended Edition however, have improved graphics than the old game. New improved global lightning, widescreen support, new water shaders and the new day and night cycle in skirmish play. It looks prettier now and more epic to play. With all these improved visuals, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition still retain its great performances and runs very great and smooth.Age of Mythology: Extended Edition exact same gameplay can be its good side or bad side for some people. But for me, it's very nostalgic and fun. I prefer this kind exact same gameplay rather than some of those next generation game with many promises which turn out to be a disappointment. Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is indeed a great remake. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												It somehow manages to be worse than the original game.It really goes to show the lack of effort aswell as how broad the term ""Extended Edition"" or ""Graphical Remake"" has become.The extended content is apparantly steam intergration, a new campaign, day night cycles and achievements...The achievements just show the pinacle of laziness. ""Finish the campaign""""Win 10 games of Zeus""""Beat Zeus 10 times""""Win against 1 AI""""Win against 2 AI""etc etc. The titles aren't amusing (Like Postal or Magicka) , the objectives aren't creative and they are just a complete waste of time (More so than usual with achievements.)The extra missions are four campaign missions using assets already in the game, just to show that extra lack of effort.Somehow the AI has gotten worse since the original version. I saw a computer team that had a titan and an army to be feared (On titan difficulty) surrender after they lost one oracle. Right after, I battled another town with similar forces, I lost the battle and yet they surrendered.Have they added any new units... noHave they added anything noteworthy...noDoes the game deserve the title Extended Edition...noIf you love the original then you will tolerate this... but it is nowhere near deserving og a price tag at £23...P.s The day night cycle is ♥♥♥♥...

												There are many features which make the game great. I'm gonna name a few:- beautiful randomly generated maps. You can learn everything you need to know about the maps in 2 hours, but even after 30 days of playing they will still surprise you.- the playable cultures excel with their diversity and fascinating mythology. Unleash terrifying mythical brutes such as the einherjer which will tear your enemies apart.- Advancing on the map with your siege army and military camps adds a lot to the 'all out war' feeling to the game.- The soundtrack, the graphics and the overall design make for a true atmospheric environment.Age of Mythology was the game that initally ignited my passion for online games. It's hard for me to be objective, because I share so many glorius childhood memories with this classic jewel. The main reason I bought the extended edition for steam were simple: The game hasn't aged and they gave access to online-playing. The former AoM servers were unfortunately shut down which was a huge bummer at the time. "

												First i'd like to say that i really enjoy the game. But there are way too much bugs introduced (and kept) by the extended edition so the main part of my review while be about them.BUGS:There may be less serious ones like a magical box appearing with the letters ""Message Text goes here"". And there are more annoying ones like reset of settings on start (i posted a fix in the support forum - the thread was only over a year old). And there are real ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs like the memory bug (full crash of game) which appears to exist since years.(extended edition didnt fix it ofc). Another Bug in the Tutorial - meaning i had to restart the mission. And right into the next one one while playing one of the first 3 Missions - having to restart the mission again too. Lets not forget the horrendus performance - even with all graphic features disabled the game needs way too much power for being this old. On the pro-side we got a twitch integration now. *insert sarcastic YAY here* Also while all the bugs are still there since years a new expansion pack is announced.... So while i leave a negative review here - i can really recommend this game for old times sake if it is going cheap in the sale.			"

												THIS is a review of the ""Extended Edition"" not the original Age of Mythology.    Age of Mythology: Extended Edition has minor improvements and major issues compared to the original game. The whole thing...it's not even close to a rework. Why would you make a reboot of a 12 years old game and still not make any major changes except the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ water? The only things that are new are some trading cards and twitch integration that has no point in this game. Why not? Well, it's because the multiplayer is barely playable due to the massive lag in any kind of server. Even when it says it has 50 ping. What impressed me was that I had read about a guy complaining about lag in LAN! Can you believe this? The developers - Skybox Labs just ruined the whole conception of gameplay in the Extended Edition.  Do you know what else is arrogant about the game? The price. Who would pay 28 (I can even say 30) euro for poorly developed reboot of a 12 years old game? It's worse than the original one which is much better and even cheaper.   Aside from the horrible reboot, Age of Mythology is a great game. It's a RTS game with the similar gameplay of Age of Empires. The game can be very competitive as almost every RTS game and the gameplay is amazing. The campaign mode has an interesting story with almost every element of the mythology. The game was my childhood game and I love it but I deny anything good in the Extended Edition since it's only playable vs bots.   Don't waste that much money on a reboot. It's even slowly dying every day after people saw what a tragedy it is. From top 100 games in steam on the release in the 7-8 place, it got kicked from the chart with thousands of people dissapointed. "

												At the current game state (as of 10/05/2014), the game handles like a donkey with broken legs; total trash. For (what seems to be) the majority of players, the game handles and runs poorly. Constant lagging, freezing and hanging that slows down the PC as a whole and can cause it to lock up.I've tried many things for numerous hours to try and get this classic RTS to work. To name a few,XP Compatibility, Admin mode, trouble-shooting with all sorts of options and settings in-game and in steam, folder read/write permission/rights, defragging, PC cleaning (registry files for example) and nothing made a difference. Sometimes right away or a couple minutes (at best) after I launch the game, the lag started and it just got worse and worse to the point where my whole PC would freeze up and I'd need to manually terminate the game exe' file through the Task Manager.Bitter I may sound, and disappointed I am. I do not recommend purchasing this game as of yet. Perhaps (and hopefully) the game will be patched and fixed in the future. But as of yet; it isn't worth the gamble to see if you're part of the minority that can run the game just fine.			"

												A good game, but I knew that already. Problem is how they really overcharge for it and when you see the huge problem this game still has, you just cant recommend it. - Constant lag when playing with friends- What was made to ""optimize the game"" is barely noticable, minor, or useless- Nothing was made to improve the AI. What I mean by that is that on certain maps, such as waterhole or Tundra, the AI wont gather any ressources nor will it build an army, often times because its too brain dead to find food, making for really annoying games when you spend 10 minutes building a base only to realise the AI's gathererer are all frozen when there are goats, gold mines and wood nearby.- Bad DLC's, stale, boring, complete cash grab with a stupidly high price tag attached on it. - Price is REALLY high for such an old game, probably one of the worst quality/price games on steam. When you find other older & better games for 10$, they better improve the original, which they really do notBuy it on a sale if youre feeling Nolstalgic. Otherwise, i suggest you pass this game			"

												Thats the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ HD remaster that could be made on planet Earth in XXI century.Remembering the first days ef ""enjoyin"" acidic graphics and horrible lags and freezes , i dont believe that fixing this took about a year. And even now some of this problems may occur in the game. Srsly? The old version from 2004 works fine even on modern machines and in high resolutions, how it could be so hard to make an HD remaster of game, that supports HD??Chinese expansion made things even worse. All new units and buldings are retextured models from other races. They didnt even tried to make a new set of animations. Walking huge baboon? Big crocodile? Is this a joke? WHY ON EARTH YOU MADE A CAMPAIGN WITH IN-GAME EDITOR AND DIDNT EVEN TESTED IT? It skips missions, music is too loud (or voices are too quiet). Shennong is bugged as hell, most units are missing some scripts and standind like dummies. Chinese in multiplayer are imbalanced, new units requires too much rebalancing, is that a problem to make a closed beta-test or stop making empty promises?Never, NEVER buy a game made by this company. Enjoy older versions, they are working perfect even nowadays.			"

												Three trolls, four golden battle boars and a pack of wolves have just devastated the last of Thor's town centres, and my gatherers have already moved in to take over their farming network. I am Odin, and my thunder god son had the audacity to attack me during the opening 30 minutes of this random map skirmish.The ludicrousness of this scenario, as mythical creatures of various origins trundle in over peaceful farmland to murder everyone in sight, was Mythology's strength over Ensemble's Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings when it was released in 2002. Mythology's colourful range of high-level fantasy creatures make the final act of any skirmish much more exciting than units of historical repute did in Age of Kings. Kraken trouble the seas, dragon-like nidhoggs circle the skies and hydra grow a head for every enemy they slay.Age of Mythology does feel antiquated, but it is still a lot of fun. It wasn't a notably innovative RTS at release, mostly built on '90s ideas, but it did take Ensemble's blend of Civ-style city management and more conventional military RTS ideas to its creative peak, as well as making the series fully 3D for the first time.The upgraded effects of the Extended Edition, most noticeably the shiny-looking water, help contemporise Mythology, but the character models are the strongest signs that this is a decade-old game. AI is a bit of an issue, too. On a moderate difficulty, the enemies attack predictably in medium-sized waves while rarely putting up an overwhelming defence of their own territories.I don't hold that against Mythology, though, because it is still cathartic to steamroll the AI on random maps. The online multiplayer, too, means you won't be short on smarter opponents, and it seems to be running well, even if the process of finding a game you can join feels a bit arduous.The Extended Edition isn't short on single-player content, either. Collected here are the Titans expansion and the shorter Golden Gift DLC campaign, in addition to the original's mammoth story mode.Each campaign level is prefaced by in-engine cutscenes of hilariously low production values. Voice acting sounds like the product of three almost-drunk friends being handed the keys to a recording studio for an afternoon. This shortfall is probably another sign of its age and the industry standard of the time, but otherwise I think this is one of the better RTS campaigns of its day in the variety of the mission structure.You rarely feel like you're doing the exact same thing twice, and the parameters can change from survival to deathmatches and surprise ambushes. The impressively in-depth Scenario Editor helps to extend the singleplayer's lifespan, and with Workshop support, there's no fear of running dry of stuff to do.Age of Mythology still has a lot of value beyond nostalgia.This isn't a total remake, so don't go in expecting one. The Extended Edition is still a really well-paced and entertaining RTS, one that revels in over-the-top imagery and remains a one-off in subject matter within the oeuvre of the sadly departed Ensemble.

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is a good example of a poorly made cash grab.The Extended tag probably means the new bugs Skybox Labs managed to produce, that didn't exist in the original.The AI pathfinding is messed up. Units often phase/clip through the walls and villagers often get stuck in larger buildings (Temple, Wonder, Titan Gate) they have finished building.The changes to the graphics are highly questionable. The new textures are washed out and blurry, so it's highly recommended to revert them to something that looks closer to the original (EG: Epic textures mod). Otherwise you will have a hard time finding your units, as they blend into the environment too well. Last but not least the netcode. Oh, boy! If you thought Age of Empires 2 HD's netcode was bad, then you have no idea what this game has in store for you. The online matches are insane lagfests, often freezing up for  seconds, rendering the game unplayable.Bottom line is that this version of the game is a mess. Skip it, you're not missing out much!

												The hours played on Steam pale greatly with the amount of hours I have put into this game. Still owning it in a hard copy...This is one of those games I always come back to.Not because the story is any good, it's the equivalent of a Hercules or Xena episode.Not because the gameplay is revolutionary.Not because of cutting edge graphics...So why?It's fun.It allows us to interact with myths and mythology in a way that's surprisingly rare.It is an RTS with a solid base building mechanic.The factions are unique from one another with those factions being further seperated by a multitude of minor god selections which help diversify and specialize your force.The game mostly works (in a generally) on a rock/paper/scissors mechanic...with mythological units (like a Minotaur or a Sphinx) eat up basic normal units, your hero units (say an egyptian pharaoh or Hercules) beat myth units and your basic normal human units beat hero units.The game does have its faults. Obviously the graphics aren't the best. The story is below average, the base building mechanics are from another time but you get to have Hercules knocking around giants while on another part of the map a sphinx unit spins to win on a structure.As with most games I'll recommend, snag it on sale but ultimately I suggest you give it a chance.

												AoM: EE is pretty good, but not worth buying if it's not on sale. Seriously, torrent that ♥♥♥♥.However, the Chinese DLC is absolutely abhorrent sludge that cannot be called an expansion to a once-great game. Uncreative units and myth units, no new or interesting mechanics (hurr gardens = smaller plenty vaults! we even stole the plenty vault icon!!!), and random defeats/crashes/glitches galore.Also the single player campaign sucks. A lot.The art is good, though. And the music is good, when it plays for about 15 seconds and then leads into the standard AoM music. Oh well, the classics are still great anyway.Worst of all, and here's why I implore you to download this game from a torrent site, the game forces you to have the latest DLC to play the game. It will literally boot you from a SINGLE-PLAYER GAME because it detects Chinese units when you don't have the DLC.			"

												Great game. It\'s very accurate in terms of mythology. If you\'ve played Age of Empires then you\'ll no doubt love this game. It\'s very hands on. I enjoy the graphics and sounds. The buildings are well done along with the story. The AI can seem a bit broken at times, but it\'s way nicer than Age of Empires AI, so that\'s a sight to see. Though there are parts that can get rather boring, it makes up for it with quick-play matches, and even a multiplayer system. The units are very ranged and it\'s interesting when you play as different groups like Nords, Egyptians, Greeks, etc. The system is very easy to learn and understand so even if you\'re new to these kind of games it\'s nothing to be scared of.

												Easily, the version in the early 00's had me clock in hundreds of hours.  When i heard about the re-release, I was stoked. So the 40 i originally spent, plus 20 for the titans,back in 00's, was worth it, but unfortunately, this 24 dollars I paid (on sale) is about 20 dollars more then it should have been.   The performance is awful, and it literally looks the exact same, other then the lighting effects (which inevitably need to be turned off to get framerates of 40+.    all the icons, are ported and super - lo- res. the UI and menu actually looks worse, I can even see the slim ""border""  on the text layout.Gameplay is as I remember.And for what its worth, the game doesnt have any network issues, which was the main thing that was broke in the first game.This game is worth about 5 bucks,  and anyone that purchases this game for any more is just supporting this ""cash-grab"" philosophy most game companies take to already succesful games, and throw a new name on it with no new content or polish.

												I used to think this was a nice improvement, but after a 100 hours and comparing with the original I have a few things to say.The game looks nice, but at the same time, non of the units were improved and the terain got dark and ugly after a while. Then it started to show that because of a lack of improvements in certain areas, the game looks worse because there is a beatiful shadow on the ground of a pixelated tree.Now this I would have overlooked, was it not for the fact that they also tampered with the game in terms of pricing and new units, and the God awful expansion which starred a huge baby gnome as the ""Titan of the Chinese"". The expansion gets in your face if you don't own it since there are some balance changes to accomodate it. Yet there  are no balance changes to the fact that Zeus will defenestrate your buildings like no tomorrow, or the fact that the atlanteans are all unbalanced as Britains Pound right now.But yet, I would overlook this. For these things are things I could live with if only I had a multiplayer that actually worked. And ofcourse, no it doesn't. Frequent desync issues, people randomly getting thrown out of games and general latency issues plague the multiplayer. Almost nobody plays the game multiplayer anymore anyway.It was here when I became desperate for some AOM, so I played tutorial and fought things in skirmishes. It was all fine and dandy, until I loaded up Acropolis and found to my horror that all the plateaus had gaps in the clif faces which completely ruined one of my favourite maps. I then started up the origional and played one skirmish game and it felt like I was playing Age of Mythology again. No lag, no weird shadows, no weird inconsistencies in graphical quality, no weird streched out faces, no weird skewed camera in cutscenes. Most of all it ran buttery smooth, so much so that I was supprised at how well I could actually play. I did the same thing as I normally but this time I turned out to have improved. My conclusion is that this is only worth it if you want to play with friends abroad and want an official way to do so, and don't mind any conectivity issues. This by no means is a good replacement for Age of Mythology, a game which worked fine but had some flaws. These issues are why I can't recommend this game as a replacement.			"

												Short version - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, even if you used to be a fan. The amateur developers have completely destabilized and destroyed the game.Long version - I've never written a review before, but my recent experience with Age of Mythology has driven me to it.Let me start out by saying that I've been playing this game since it originally came out and I've loved it the whole time. The campaign is incredible, the graphics are great for their time, and the strategy gameplay is the best I've ever seen. It's rare not to get bored of a game after playing it for 14 years, and I'd go as far as saying that AOM is my favourite game of all time.The old AOM that is... Recently a set of wannabe developers have released DLC that is absolute crap, or at least that's what I've read in reviews, which is why I haven't bought the DLC. I figured I just wouldn't buy it and continue to enjoy the same game that I've enjoyed for years.Of course, the old AOM had some bugs, but they were minor and the game was stable over all. Everything was fine until the fascist developers of this new DLC started screwing around with the original game! They've removed some technologies and units and added new ones, they've reskinned some things (and did a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job), and they've introduced a ton of bugs to the gameplay. For example, god powers show up in the area for researching upgrades when you click on buildings like the wall and temple, technologies that you research show up in the wrong buildings or not at all, and when you drag to select units, the bottom area of the screen which shows who and what you selected either shows the wrong number of units, the wrong units, or nothing at all.I paid to get the original Age of Mythology and the Steam version worked fine before, but the bugs these ameteurs introduced have turned the game into a steaming pile of you-know-what. If you want to add units and other new content, that's fine. Release it as a mod so that when people install it and it completely destroys the game, it's their fault they ruined it and not yours.To summarise, even if you are a fan of the old AOM, don't buy this game, because sadly it's not the game you played back in the day. I really hope the developers get their ♥♥♥♥ together and stop ruining this classic.			"

												Good ol' age of mythology that I used to play back in the dayYou would think in 2014 a game like this in multiplayer would be without problems..but then again here we go, back in 2005 I don't ever remember lagging, matter fact most games would run smooth, but good god steam AOM multiplayer takes it to a whole level. It literally feels like steam gave aom multiplayer parkinsons desease, The muliplayer doesnt care if everyone is running FIOS 5million gigbait internet it will lagg, it will be jerky through out the entire game, this is just plain ♥♥♥♥in sad. I dont even use steam but certain games i could only get on steam so i was forced to use this program, also with workshop integration i looked forward to an already good exprience being better, i was expecting steam to get things right that the original game versions did not,,,,but it didnt. I was dissapointed.The stats do not lieWhy is it that >90% of the players that play this game on steam dont play multiplayer?The chat lobby is glitchythe game lobbies are glitchymost original good scenarios are unplayableI'll continue playing just cause i love AOM so much, but i will not be advocating getting it on steam.People still play using the original CD's and the servers are still up, old problems persist but alteast microsoft didnt give their version parkinsons.

												I LOVED age of mythology as a kid.  It was one of my favorite games.  The opportunity to play a new and improved version on steam when it was on sale for $7.49 was too much to pass up.Unfortunately however this game is one of the buggiest and most poorly optimized games I have ever played.  It's multiplayer segment, even LAN, is borderline unplayable in its current state due to absurd lag and desync crashes.  A quick glance around the forums reveals that this is not an issue with my system, everyone is having these issues.  It has been over a year since the game has been released.  It should not still be having these issues.  There has been no communication between the developers and the games community over these issues so it looks like they won't be fixed anytime soon.  It pains me to have to leave this review, it really does.  It's so bad that I'm requesting a refund from steam.			"

												I got this game on 12/22/2016. After reading the numerous reviews about how I should not buy this game and play aom on voobly instead, I decided to go ahead and buy it anyway since I love aom (1800 rr back in 07' ;) ). I suppose I just was not satisfied because the reviews did not actually go into detail about anything that I thought was important. I am going to do my best, though, to give you the details of how terribly disappointing this game has been for me for the past couple days, even though I don't tend to give bad reviews because I don't like hurting other people's businesses, However, I consider this game a scam.I'm going to start with the China campaign, since that's where I started. The first issue arose when I restarted the first scenario, since I was kinda screwing around with looking at the new units and the AI got ahead of me. When I restarted, I was astonished to find that I was in the Archaic Age, rather than the Classical Age, like I had been in the game before. In addition, once I collected 400 food and built my first temple, I could not even advance to the Classical Age. Therefore, I was stuck trying to fight the AI with immortals from my town center, which was basically impossible once they started sending in human units. I restarted again and again, but could not resolve the issue. I decided to finally restart the whole game and wait out the cinematic all the way through again, and I finally got the game to start in the Classical Age. I can't say for sure that this bug exists within the game or if there is an issue with my computer. However, I reinstalled a fresh version of windows 8.1 about a week ago and there's basically nothing on my computer, so if it's a problem with my computer, then that's really a problem with poor compatability caused by the developers. The other possibility is it could be an issue caused by the Ekanta user interface mod that I dowloaded for, and I actually haven't tested that yet. However, Ekanta is a popular UI and I would be surprised if no one figured that out yet. After beating the first and the second scenarios, I got to the third, when I discovered that I once again could not advance to the classical age, despite having a temple and 400 food. I thought that this possibly could be like the original AOM campaign, which don't let you advance (although the option doesn't even show up for those), but was once again flooded by human units and forced to fight with the only unit I could make, which were immortals from my town center. This time I restarted and restarted and no matter what could not begin in whatever age i was supposed to, or resolve whatever the issue was this time. However, i couldn't advance, and did the only thing I could which was build my TC and either THRILL OF VICTORY, or spam O CANADA bears (recommend the O CANADA's if you run into this issue). I can't remember the order of the campaign past this because I just wanted to get it over with. Another one of the scenarios (there are only like 9 of these but they are almost all terrible) has you fight off an army. This time, when I restarted I discovered that my troops went from having heavy upgrades to having no upgrades. This bug has an easy fix, though, If you just restart and wait for part of the cinematic to finish before skipping; then your troops will once again be heavily armored. The final bug with the campaign that I ran into so far was once again that I could not age on another scenario, this time after building an armory since I actually started in the Classical Age. I was eventually able to beat the AI's champion, fully upgraded units with my clasical units after mixing in some monkey king myth units. So that ends most of what I want to say about the campaign. The final issue I want to bring up comes from watching a streamer play as thor against a chinese player in a 1v1. Once he got to the mythic age, he discovered that he mentioned that he had no units that could counter cataphract, which are Chinese counter-infantry cavalry, without also being countered by the cataphract themselves. Norse does not have an archer or a cavalry unit which counters cavalry, which would be the only two options, unless using myth units. Thanks for reading and please don't buy this game!			"

												I LOVE AOE. Played it religiously when I was a kid. That is why it is so hard to give this a no in reccomendation. To be brief:The devs of this rerelease do not give a crap. On some PCs the game won't launch despite numerous user attempts to fix it, it simply won't launch. From countless posts on forums this has been a problem ever since this rerelease was.. released. Yet it has not been addressed and many players aren't even able to play the damn game.There are a number of ridiculous bugs that were not present in the original game that appear present here. The most annoying and angering one is enemy units sometimes being able to glitch through your walls making them useless. I could ignore all this and not even bother with the ""no"" reccomendation if they hadn't rubbed salt in the wound - I was livid to see these useless devs have released ""DLC"" for this poorly coded game for things that are not DLC worthy!!! For example, to play on a ""giant"" sized map you need to buy the DLC whereas in the orginal this was always available. THEY WANT YOU TO PAY MONEY TO PLAY ON A BIGGER SIZED ORIGINAL MAP. There are a number of new maps with the DLC, which is great! But guess what, I don't want new maps, I want to be able to play as I did before without having to give you MORE money just to upgrade the map size. It is a very basic thing thing that they are using to shill money out of people.There are worse devs, but these devs have particularly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off because of how much I loved this game when I was younger. I get all rereleases are money grabbers, but at least have some dignity about it. This is shameful. "

												In its current state, I can't recommend this. As much as I loved the original, the extended edition is buggy as ♥♥♥♥. In multiple ocassions, I've had units get stuck inside terrain, trees or otherwise stuck and unable to move. Also fishing boats sometimes won't return gathered food to the dock, and the only way to fix that is to rebuild the docks. Bugs aside, it hasn't aged particularly well and the extended edition doesn't seem to be doing very much to improve anything.It's a good thing they're still bringing out updates, but they've still got a long way to go.

												Since the new expansion was released, this game is dreadful, problems loading, game crashing to desktop, freezing PC, there are more bugs in this mess than there are in the Natural History Museum.  Not sure if the ""developers"" have heard of testing, but they might want to try it before releasing such a bug infested product.  Until they sort out all the problems I would strongly advise people not to waste their money on this.  They have also deleted all the forum comments, including mine. Not surprising since they seemed to be overwhelmingly negative!			"

												Major multiplayer lag across all games on official day of release. I expected at least some testing within the long 2-month lapse of the early copies already being handed out. Mostly good, like the original, but the amount of additions to this game is equivalent to the amount of bugs. Of course, I am no official tester, so I am not leaving a list behind me. However, I will say that there is UNBAREABLE lag in multiplayer games (stutter-lag), and I have extensively played the original well enough to know that neither my internet connection nor computer would be causing such. Timers (wonder, settlement, triggered) are all away from the edge by a long shot, making it look way out of position. Also, some textures look too unrealistic with this lightning overlay, such as the Tartarian Gate.These results were briefly acquired from just three games. I do still 'recommend' the game, but only because people like the ORIGINAL game (pretty much this) and I am expecting bug fixes soon.9.5/10 original game (balance lack),6/10 remake-EDIT: two days later, I changed the recommendation to NOT due to virtually no balancing or testing prior to releasing game. no bug fixes			"

												AoM is very similar in the way that it plays compared to Age of Empire, and that's not a bad thing either since it plays very very well.There is a huge amount of content available which will keep anyone entertained for probably ~100 hours, if not more. I have managed to power through the campaign in about seven hours, partly because I played this game to death when I was younger.I haven't tried the multi-player out, and I suspect it will now be even more polished than before. This is a really strategy gamer's dream. Go out and buy  Age of Mythology, you will not be disappointed.			"

												I was a bit hesitant to buy this game. It has quite a BIG pricetag, especially keeping in mind that it's a 2002 game. A few months after release a sale came, I took a deep breath and bought the game. I have to admit I was quite surprised and astonished. Despite all the bad critiques the remake is getting the game works like a charm. The visuals are beautiful, the gameplay is fluid and bug free. Even though there are known performance-eaters like SSAO and FXAA/BLOOM added to the game Age of Mythology still runs like what you'd expect from a 2002 game, except with better graphics. I'd put it between AOE HD (which looks horrid in my opinion, despite the ""HD"" tag) and AOE III.However the looks aren't everything.Gameplay-wise (surprisingly) it's very much like the Age of Empires games, you can plow through several campaigns which mainly consists of gathering supplies, building a city (or two), fending off smaller enemy attacks, garrisoning a huge army and then defeating the enemy. It's a bit like Civilization on a more smaller ""local"" scale. However the main difference from the Age of Empires games is the addition of:- Epic Gods- Magic powers- Kickass monsters, mythological creatures to add to your army!The workshop is filled with great content, great texture pags to further enhance the looks of the game, small fixes and additions to the UI etc. The integration of the mods into the game is seamless. I heard that it also has a great mod development kit (I haven't tried it yet). Probably the only negative thing about the game is that many people are having issues with the multiplayer, server lag. I like playing strategy games at my own pace so I can't reinforce these criticisms, I haven't tried the multiplayer.To keep a long story short I think the developers really added extra ""oomph"" to an old classic spicing it up enough to be appealing even after 12 years. It's really up to you if you think the price-tag (which I admit is quite thick) is justifiable or you'll wait for it to go on a sale like I did. Right after I bought this game I played four hours straight without even noticing the time. I think that's enough recommendation, especially today when we (including me) just hoard up dozens of games without even trying them.			"

												Currently extremely disappointed! Worst $30 I've spent for a game I currently still own on disc from original launch and know that I love to play. Within my first 2 games of online play, which is the only reason I re-purchased this game for the steep price of $30, I cannot even play. Literally. Can. Not. Play. The lag is terrible, horrible, pathetic. Freezing for 5 seconds at a time, every 20 seconds. Both games I played stalled out at locked screens forcing a resign. I will be honest that I don't know the source of this lag, but I can conclude and deduce that it isn't Steam and it definitely isn't on my end (isp/pc/graphics). For someone that is re-purchasing this game because I already know it's great, it's sad that this issue isn't already fixed on a game that is so old. The main audience you that is thrilled to play this would be that such as myself, returning for the glory days of this game when it was one of the best. Get yourself together. This is a disgrace to a game as good as this is. If this was fixed I would recommend AoM in a heartbeat, but for now, don't waste your time or money if you want to play with other people online. If I wanted to play solo I would pop in my AoM disc and be happy. But in this day and age of online gaming in the Steam multiplayer community, there is no excuse for this.			"

												Aah, Age of MythologyI've played this game since I was 9 years old. I could remember the first time I put in the CD and saw the game I would play the next 4 years. I loved it, played it for days, alone and with friends. Until I lost the CD. 2 Years after the loss I met Steam, and saw that they made the Extended Edition. So, like I always do, waited until christmas and bought it in the Winter Sale. And all the memories came back to me, and started playing it again. And apparently I never stopped loving this game. Every time I click on the PLAY button I still feel the memories coming back to me.10/10 wouldn't forget the background music again.			"

												Age of Mythology is Real Time Strategy game that has managed to achieve the rare aspect of balance in its gameplay. Picking and sticking to an 'overpowered god' from the start is not really possible, as gods are very much rock-paper-scissors with each other. You can pick a certain god that counters the Norse (Gaia, for example) which would be destroyed by the Greek. You do get the feeling as you go along that certain Gods have better abilities than others, although I feel this is largely down to personal perference. Loki for example, has the ability for his Hersirs to randomly spawn Myth units into the battle, which maybe considered 'OP' by those who are in a militaristic war against them. BUT, Hersirs are very weak to arrows. Gather a few archers and you're back in the game. But then they can build calvary. But then you can build spearmen, and it continues.In terms of units, there isn't that much variety however it is not necessarily the units that you pick, but how you build the groups. When playing as the Greeks, two horseman, two archers and two infantry will survive longer than six archers.I played this game many years ago and am happy to see it make a HD relaunch, however honestly there really isn't much difference. My main 'pet peeve' with this game is the online play which, to be brutally honest, frustrates me to no end. There are three aspects which irritate me, those being; 1) Sync errors. You can be 40 minutes into a game and you will suddenly get a pop up saying 'Saving: Sync Error' which is an 'oh ****' moment. Your 40 minutes is now worthless, as you will now be back at the Main Menu screen. What a waste of time. They offer no explanation, no 'just kick the out-synced player', EVERYONE is put back to the Main Menu with nothing to show for the last 40 minutes. Oh, and did I mention that some players use programs to force sync errors if they are losing? Yeah.2) There's no option to vote-kick players midgame. The only option you have to kick a player is when they're about to disconnect, at which point the ENTIRE game comes to a halt for 30 seconds while you all vote. The voting, by the way, is pointless. Regardless of which option you pick (Continue or Wait) you will be forced to wait the full 30 seconds, even if the vote in unanimous.3) The program itself. The program itself can randomly just shut down. You can be destroying the entire map and then your game will just suddenly shut down with no warning as if you've pressed Alt + F4. Besides the above GLARING technical errors that I am in absolute disbelief haven't been fixed after x years since the game's release, the gameplay is actually very good. This is one of the most played, soon to be the most played game in my library. I would recommend, but I wish they'd sort out the gaping holes in their ship.			"

												Flushing $30 would be more productive then spending money on this terrible remake of a great game.  Super laggy and absolutely no support for bug fixes.  Examples of horrendous code:  One game started with a teammate that had a pond in place of where his town center should have been and therefore he started the game defeated!  Another time I was playing 1 vs 1 against the AI and after the game I saw that my opponent was only given 1 town center compared to my 3!  Several other times the AI has been known to do nothing after 2-3 minutes into the game as if they forget how to gain resources and advance ages.  I also have a problem where my mouse cursor thinks it is on my desktop when hovering over portions of a map which makes the game unplayable.  I can fix that error by using Alt-Enter twice to go to window-mode and back again.  However, if I repeat this process again (due to the error recurring), the entire game crashes...  The sad part is many people would play this game if any effort was made to correct these errors.			"

												Whilst the game is absouletly great, it's very badly hosted. The devs haven't added anything to the game, the contest and leagues are a bad joke! You may get it and play offline, or as I do and play with a  friend online. You will encounter many problems though (online) and you will pay money for something that is ''remade'' for the 3rd or + time now... Frustrating business making moves by microsoft destroy the progress of RTS these days, and there is no AOM 2 coming by any chance (official microsoft statement after a request i made via email). Don't expect to much EXTENDED, there's nothing extended about it at all, maybe only microsofts purse. Good day, The MoonMan			"

												Let me put it this way, I already had this game, I already loved this game and I had played it for more than 300 hours, so when I saw that this edition was going to be available on Steam I loved it, but oh boy I was wrong. I basically bought this, at 40$, rather expensive game to play MULTIPLAYER which was the only option not available with my old AoM game, and the multiplayer of this game is one of the worst I've ever ever seen. It lags, it fails to connect and it is unplayable, even when trying to play with people within my same city it was completelly impossible. So, I would highly recommend you NOT TO BUY THIS GAME since the best word to describe it begins with ""S"" finishes with ""t"" and it isn't Suit.			"

												Edited (July): I bought the expansion in the summer sale and the game is working fine now.I haven't been able to play a game since yesterday's update; it aways crashes in the beginning with an error report about Chinese villagers. Now, I haven't bought the expansion, so the Chinese should be irrelevant for me in the game. But, just like the Dragon expansion maps (which show in-game only for the game to tell you that you have to spend extra money to actually be able to play them), they have found a way to bug me.Oh, also, ""Giant"" map size shows in-game, but it's only available if I pay more money than I paid for the game in the first place? Not cool. Not cool at all. I think I'll look for a different game to play.			"

Yeah it just lags everywhere. And there was not a single graphic change overallNow i don't have the DLC i don't plan on purchasing it. But an BS happened, when you let your enemy random it might call out an chinese major god. I was like well i'm ok with that. I don't plan playing with it but against it is not a big deal.But the the ultimate BS appears. It kicks me from the game(ON SINGLE PLAYER) saying that since i do not have the DLC purchased i therefore cannot continue. WTF are you guys thinking? so why did you added all this BS into my computer anyway in the first place. It used to be good but now its just a more power requirement from the original AOE with DLCs that gimps performance.			"

												I have spent an overwhelming time playing Age of Mythology back in the disk form years ago. I was overly hyped to see that Steam was picking up AOM considering I lost the disk some time ago. Let's go over the game, shall we?(This will be solely based off of Age of Mythology itself, rather than any updates or such done by the Extended Edition.)Campaign32 levels, 3 different factions, interesting heroes and a compelling story. Barely any levels are the same, with each being unique and exciting. While a few (and I mean a very few) are a tad bland, that should be no reason to turn someone away from it. Not to mention the Atlantis campaign, which adds 12 more levels to play on with another new story and heroes tying to the first campaign in many ways.SkirmishWhen playing skirmish, the game provides a fun and (admittedly slightly repetative) experience to better oneself before possibly attempting multiplayer or the campaign on a harder difficulty. The player can choose any of the factions and their respective gods, giving a nice plethora of play styles. I do recommend keeping away from the ""Titan"" difficulty, however, as the AI gains a lot of handicaps.MultiplayerOh boy, multiplayer. I've seen a lot of great things from it. New maps, game mods, (usually) differing play styles from other players. It offers a good zone for both new players and pros, but I do recommend avoiding many ranked matches unless you're at the top of your game, because trust me, the other player almost always is. It's a great way to spice things up if you've beaten the campaign and are tired of the AI in skirmishes.Extended Edition + China DLCThe extended edition and China DLC are honestly... Disappointing. I'd say avoid the China DLC unless you're dying for new content so badly you'd do anything for it (which I'd even recommend the workshop before the DLC). The Chinese army is very gimmicky, and everything feels reused, with little, if anything, being brand new. It's also rather buggy. I, myself, haven't even beat the campaign yet, it's just bland and boring. The Extended edition tried to amp up textures and such, but it makes some things ugly and unappealing, and I highly recommend getting a mod or two to fix these up.All in all, I say buy this game, be it the disc or the Steam version, avoid the China DLC and game on. You won't be disappointed!			"

												FOR THE RECORD; Most of the negative reviews on the game aren't due to the actual mechanics and gameplay, but more to do with the terrible pricing, and the poor online netcode. If you're wanting to buy this game, DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM. Or at least wait until it's on a massive discount. Or better yet, buy a retail copy. That's the short version.Now, about the game. It's Age of Mythology. Which means it's a classic. Nuff said. The campaign is still amazing and holds up very well. The extended edition includes the Titans expansion which includes the Atlantean race, and the patched in content 'The Golden Gift' campaign. It's important to remember however that the campaign is also there to get you acquainted with the multiplayer mechanics.The multiplayer is ok, but the Netcode is wack. Lag is inevitable, and the only people who play the MP now are either vets from the original retail version who will wreck your sh**, or the odd random. My advice. Buy the game for the excellent singleplayer, and maybe jump online with a friend and get to grips with the unit intricacies, then have a go. PRO's:•	HD textures (not really noticeable) •	Excellent campaigns•	Solid balancing•	ClassicCon's:•	Dev's have abandoned the game. Horrific follow on development•	Multiple glitiches in MP. Also crashes sometimes•	AI is stupid as hell•	Insane asking priceConclusion: In my opinion, at this time the game isn't worth the Steam asking price. If you're willing to pay however, you'll have access to 3 campaigns, an editor, MP with all races, and skirmishes. All with a few HD textures. If you're not short of a few quid, you could do a lot worse than this. Pick it up if you want to try out more RTS outside of StarCraft.			"

												This game  I owned 14 or 15 years ago and loved it. For it's time and even now its storyline, gameplay and graphics are still quite good. What it definitely gets right is it doesn't just take the basics of mythology and used the same tired old tropes. It uses all manner of characters, creatures and phenomena from the 3 Civilizations and even for me some that I weren't even aware existed. You can tell alot of research and alot of thought went into this game.- Pros -  - Relatively good graphics considering how old the game is.- Nice music- Good storyline- wide variety of characters and creatures- Creative ""god powers""- many hours of play time (is not a short game)- really, really good tools for making your own map/scenario- Each Civilization has their own unique way of generating favour with the gods- Cons -- You can for the most part train a bunch of myth units that are more effective than most regular units to fight with and win- Enemy AI seemingly uses the same tactic almost every time, using small harassing skirmishes of 8-10 units at a time (at least on easy difficulty)- Seemingly the best way to give yourself a chance at winning is build as many walls and towers as you can and order your troops into defensive stance so they dont split up chasing every enemy unit they see all around the map and then dying.All in all though this game is fantasic and if you had any kind of love of Mythology before this can do nothing but rekindle it and maybe even make you want to do some reading on your favourite characters/creatures. I highly recommend this game. :)8.5/10Also a nice comedic bonus is watching a Cyclops use the special attack of picking up a humanunit and throwing it (probably) to it's death is pretty damn amusing as well. :)			"

												Malista!I got this game on disc over ten years ago. I got the Titans expansion as a gift a year or two afterwards, when I had fourteen teeth removed in a single operation. This is the game I played when I was stuck at home in pain all day, so forgive me if this review -is- a little biased.Even though I don't play it as much anymore, the campaigns are always a blast. I can't speak to multiplayer, however - I was never really good at that stuff anyway. The steam multiplayer community isn't *too* active, but it isn't too dead either. If I recall correctly there's actually still a pretty active Voobly community for the game.The achievements for this game are a little grindy to say the least. Having to play 1,000 online games got a little boring after a while, and it seems as if the hidden achievement for Alpaca Hour is almost impossible to get legitimately nowadays as the developers haven't switched on the toggle for it in over a year. I ended up just setting my clock back to get it.Overall... a timeless classic! For me it's well worth the price, but since most people aren't as attached to this game as I am, I'd recommend waiting for a sale before you pick this game up, which happens quite often to my knowledge.Any last quips? I wish they'd bring back the old theme music!			"

												I loved Age of Mythology when it was first launched, I liked it when Age of Mythology: Extended Edition was launched, I even recommended getting the game, but now that the first part of the ""Extended Edition"" turns up ""Tale of the Dragon"" I can no longer recommend this game.They broke it, and not just the new stuff, but original content as well, in game breaking ways.I miss Ensemble Studios			"

I had it on for over 6 months then the update happened and then poof no more worky.  Fix this and ill adjust my ratingfor this game... Discard my demands and youll forever be banished to the land of no trees, no fishing, no bushes, no gold mines and constant attacks from a massive amount of myth creatures.

												WITH THE NEW UPDATE (Chinese Patch) ABSOLUTLY NO! With the new patch for this 10+Years old game you can't play any real random Mission. So from start on, i  love this game. But with this new patch including the chinese Patch, you will get in you're game (if you don't own the DLC): -SPAM about the DLC (""get the dlc etc."")- you will have automatically, in your loved classics, the extra not clickable gods- ALL RANDOM missions are not working. (!!!)So well you pay much of money for an old game and you won't be able to play the random missions, because you will automatically get the new Gods (which you don't have installed, as long as you don't buy the DLC). Now of course you don't have the DLC installed but you get randomly always (?!) the new god. And Because you don't own the DLC you have 3 options after 3 seconds of gameplay: - BUY DLC- Quit the mission- Quit the game. yep. That is it. That's how you destroy and old game. Don't buy until fixed or a ""how to remove chinese patch"" is availible. Good Job Devoloper/EDIT: And by the way, the DLC is even at steam with ""mixed"" 52% reviews at the moment. At a Price of 10€.			"

												Broken game, runs worse than the non-steam version; the MMR system is completely broken and people just desyncs right before they lose so you wont get any rating. The graphics are the same as the classic game, except they often glitch out. The units pathfinding is unbelievably ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they will often get stuck in normally uncrossable terrain. There are very few servers and most of them are running mods, so, very often, the only way to have a standard game is by using the matchmaking system, which will put you against anyone it finds (yes, anyone, be him 100 mmr points ahead or below you).Shortly, this game is definitely not worth its full price, as its litterally worse than the standard AoM: The Titans on every point of view. Then, of course, the campaign is awesome and you can still play with friends or enjoy mods, but to do that you can as well just get the standard AoM from a retail vendor for a lot less money.			"

												I've always loved this game.When I found out it was on steam I knew that I was going to to get it immediatly.I heavily recommend for anyone who enjoys RTS game or the AOE franchise to play this game.However be wary that this game has many faults, the multiplayer is regarded by many to be the worst that steam has to offer, and has many, many bugs and glitches.If you already own a physical copy that still works or use Windows 10 it's not worth the large cost to upgrade.The graphical enhacement and ""Extended features"" are not anything to write home about, the graphics are formidable but are still lacking in comparrison to other games out on the steam store, the workshop intergration is a nice addition for those (Including me) who could not download mods off of the internet.This game is still amazing, and the story is amazing, the linking of all of these mythological characters was executed very well.Story: 8/10, I love it's creativity but it does rely heavily on clichés and plot holes.Gameplay: 7/10, Plays like all RTS with little veriation other than myth units and heroes.Online: 4/10, Terrible multiplayer, with the little veriety AOM had to begin with, mixed with the laggy and sometimes unplayable multiplayer it gets worse.Graphics: 6/10, Amazing compared to the original version however as I said before, they are not the best.Overall score: 7/10, Great game but bad multiplayer that damages the steam intergration.If you enjoy RTS. this game is a must have.

												I'm really glad someone brought this classic back to life. I had so many hours of fun with it back in the day. Should you have played the original and would still like to get a taste of it once again, you'll be happy to know that they almost entirely left the game as it was back in the day, only this time with mod support, support for modern machines, and Steamworks integration for multiplayer! Even to this day this classic holds its own and I think you will find a lot of enjoyment out of it even now.			"

												When I saw the AoM:Extended Edition, it seemed like the perfect solution. We've played the game for years, but three CD's later, it was time to get another one. And I was tired of buying plastic media to play a game I paid for.Steam's digital download seemed perfect. And then we actually tried playing the game.Ensemble Studios should be (and probably is) ashamed to be associated with tis product. The refresh rate is pretty near 5 frames per second, despite my machine running brand new high-detail 3D games at 60 fps. The multiplayer data connection is so slow it's unplayable.This was a complete and utter waste of money. Can't un-recommend this game enough. Just don't buy it. "

												Love Age of Mythology. Hate extended edition and Tale of the Dragon. No one wanted this game to work more than me. There is a long list of complaints I have, some that others may disagree with. But what I think we can all find inexcusable is how broken the multiplayer is. Horrible lag, games will just crash out to menu or drop without apparent reason, etc. etc. And I know it’s not an issue with other player ping or something to that effect because you don't have the same problem playing Vanilla or Titans. I stuck around for a while hoping they would fix it. They haven't, and I don't imagine they will. If you love this game, get the original version and play on Game Ranger. You'll have a better gameplay experience and a larger community to play with (unless all your only really into is single player, in which case there is no reason to buy this anyway).Oh, and I almost forgot, new maps are literally unfinished! They have maps say it has certain features in the map menu, but the map just doesn’t have the feature at all. And when you look it up online, they just didn't to put it in OR even bother take out the text promising the feature!

												After the update that came before the new dlc a number of game breaking bugs were introduced that have not been fixed.   The worse part is that I have not even bought the dlc and rather then have a more stable experinence (since the dlc had even more bugs) my experience is actually worse because the game was updated to look for the dlc even if you don't have it.  Making it so that I can't select random for any options when playing against the computer since it crashes after searching for and selecteing dlc that I never purchased. The update was also designed so that all of the starting menus remind you that you don't have the dlc by showing gray boxes everywhere.  Which in my option just adds salt to the wound since it keeps reminding me of the reason my game is broken while saying give me money.			"

												An HD remake of the original game, the spiritual sequel to Age of empires that's more about skirmishes between heroes and monsters than it is about setpiece armies and ancient kingdoms. The game takes large departures from the Empire serie,s but stays familiar enough to be recognizeable to an outsider. The game is fantastic, and although the mythos is bigger, the scale is a bit smaller: Military units always take multiple population, restricting your army size.Nothing here will win you over if you disliked the game already, but if you were a fan then, you'll be a fan now. That said: Thirty dollars is pretty steep. I would wait for a sale.			"

												Edit: - Post Updates/Bug Fixes: I could finally play this game regularly! I'd say now that I haven't encountered the save problem or any FPS drops, this is the game I remember playing as a youngin and loving, and it's still super fun yet I also still think it could use MORE upgrades both visually and added material, because it's pretty much the same base Mythology game (plus titan exp pack or w/e) with added steam fun stuff (badges, multiplayer). So if you loved this game/love RTS games, get this, but if you're on the fence about it wait for a sale, because you won't find 30 bucks worth imo. :D Again if you'd like to see more, visit www.BalsacandJenniferLawrencePlaySteam.com and check out our WORLD EXCLUSIVE XXX Video Premiere ""Zeus ♥♥♥♥s Athena in the ♥♥♥ while Hephaestus is at work"") *NSFW*I give this functioning Age of Mythology game a 4out of 5Original Post:As of right now don't buy this game. Have only been able to successfully save once. Just played through an entire skirmish and at the end it didnt give me the victory and crashed when trying to save. Buggy POS. Dissapointed. I don't know what ""Extended Features"" means because I don't really notice a whole lot extra, and was expecting a higher visual upgrade tbh. AoE2 HD worked right out of the gate (except multiplayer which I hear in AoM is even worse) and this has been nothing but trouble, which sucks since I was really looking forward to this. Hopefully they patch this in the next week or so, otherwise this could be 24bucks (30 for new buyers) down the hole. I tip my fedora to the devs for cashing in, but smh if these problems aren't fixed. Of course there are people who have had no trouble with the game (curse them) but unfortunately many bugs plague it atm. I love the idea of remaking these classic games, but a little overhaul to some textures and steam trading cards doesn't justify 30 bucks. Leaving it at ""recommended"" in case they do make it fun.Verdict: Not even Zeus having unprotected hardcore sex with Athena in 1080p could make me feel like this was a solid purchase. (as of right now) I give this game a 2 out of 5.**#BalsacSessler. Did you like my review?

I instantly crash whenever I try to choose the Random Map option at the main menu. This game is not playable without the DLC(which I'm told is very sub-par and basically just re-uses old resources) which is $10(a complete rip off). I do not recommend this game while it is in this broken state. They said they released a hotfix, but that did not fix anything.			"

												Great game that is let down by its optimization and lack of modern day standards. Locked 100% GPU usage (even in the menu?!) on a 970 in a game that looks 10 years old...really? The multiplayer experience is horrific too, lags and disconnects that require you to restart your game almost every match. UI is the same as the 2002 version and there is no steam integration, there is just soooo much to complain about, such a loss of opportunity to revive such a great game. I feel sorry for the people that find £30 games expensive, I would be really angry if I needed that money after buying this game. New troops and gods are cool though, pretty much the only positives.			"

												I use to love this game, Age of Mythology.""Tale of the Dragon"" has ruined the fun for me.I like to jump on once in a while and do a single player random map and all I am getting is errors because EVERYTIME it tries to load chinese stuff that I don't have, and wont be buying. I do not see an option to avoid what I don't have either. As a matter of fact, it shouldn't try to load what I don't have. This reeks of a poorly implemented marketing tactic. I refuse to buy this expansion just to play the game I love, bought 3 times already and have played for YEARS just fine.Outraged.Fix this and I shall ammend my review accordingly.Thank you.			"

												Ok so I love this game and have played it for along time with my wife. A new DLC jus dropped(I didn't buy it) 3 days ago and without the DLC i got a random map featuring one of the chinease(DLC civilization) as an enemy, the game started up a bug report came up saying I needed the DLC for the chinease units and closed the match. I'm livid that 14 some years after the games released a shotty azz DLC is launched which has mixed reviews which I would've bought save for those reviews and then find the DLC breaks EVERY SINGLE PERSONS GAME who doesn't even purchase it.First fix my game I only ever play random matches so u completely broke my game, second fix your DLC so it aint buggy and ppl don't hate it, third put DLC on sale so I'll buy it. Then I'll change my review.			"

												As a long time Age of Mythology die hard, it begs the question just what is an ""Extended Edition""? Age of Empires II was just known as being ""HD"" so what does it mean here? Honestly, very very little, for some nothing at all even. But does that stop it from being worth it at all? Asking this old fan, I'd like to think so... depending.Pros:+ Classic gameplay intact+ Readily includes The Titans expansion and Golden Gift extra+ New visual updates work+ Steam workshop+ Online interface and scenario sharing simple+ Developers keen to update+ New Tale of the Dragon expansion coming over a decade later+ Prostagma!Cons:- Multiplayer servers regularly don't display properlly- Online lag, sometimes difficult to know who has the connection issue- Visual updates minor at best- Nothing has really been ""extended"", Age of Empires II HD had a better, more reflective title...- ...and as a result the full price tag is too highSummery:This new version is at the end of the day is still classic Age of Mythology and has aged very well gameplay wise (despite some obvious old graphical quirks) in a landscape where real-time base building strategy is not as prevelant as it once was. Being on Steam and the perks that it brings with it (intergrated online community, workshop, future updates) with all the content is the easiest way to play today. However, even after a some time, the multiplayer issues are still noticable, in fact for some it may even be a deal breaker. Speaking of which, despite my overall praise, the game is not updated all that much making the 20+ price tag for most regions outright steep so even if like me you are a long time fan, a sale being your best option. Thankfully that does come regularly. Overall the package is worth a buy for the right lower price by your own standard and the developers do have plans to update the game beyond simply another expansion (visuals, balance, servers), I myself will update this review a period following the release of the expansion as some of these issue are very important and should have been ironed out sonner, in the case of online. Still, in the meantime what we've got at the end of the day is classic Age of Mythology.			"

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is an RTS that has in my opinion stood the test of time.  First and foremost this game is related almost directly to the Age of Empires collection. The big difference is the injection of Mythology and Gods instead of historical civilizations like in Age of Empires. A few different things have been changed but you will see about the same formulas being practiced.When I first started playing this game it was almost ten years ago. I had very slow internet but thankfully found this solid game on disk. I was amazed with the quality and the single player replayability. One of my favorite things is the simple and fun editor where you can make your own maps or your own challenges. I would mostly roleplay in which I would make up different battles and very own campaign. It was very satisfying when I could put time into my own ideas.I have always liked the resource race in this game as well where you start by hunting then move up to farming or knowing when to get that next woodcutting or mining upgrade. Managing your economy with your military plays a very large part too. There are many small things in this game that make it feel very well done, as an example when your units are upgraded it updates the armor and weapon textures. Little things like that have always appealed to me while playing because it makes me feel like the developers really cared about this game. I read about how the developers argued for days over the god powers to make sure they were balanced. I believe that's called making a good game to were you care so much about the fairness you push yourself and others that hard.Skybox is another story. I enjoy the fact steamworks is now into the game and instant modifications can be applied that enhance the way I play the game but they have done an ""ok"" job. The price is a little to much for a game that is this old. Right now is a sale for around $7 and I would recommend you buy it at a time like this but $30 on the other hand is just too much when the disk has been in the bargin bin for half a decade. I could go on about the desync issues but in the end I will recommend this game in its current state.Honestly I am just really happy this is on Steam. I have met so many of die hard fans that I would have never met playing offline so very long ago. It really makes me glad that the community still cares and likes to have a good time with this awesome relic.Thanks for reading.			"

												This isn't quite as good as the original because the multiplayer is essentially broken. However, the singleplayer gameplay is just as good as the original version and the graphics updates and steamworks support are nice additions. While I do reccomend this game, I would wait until it goes on sale (usually at every major Steam sale) and purchase it then, as I don't think it is worth the $30. It is still a blast to play and the gameplay hasn't aged a bit.			"

												A great game that is still fun to play that I've spent many days playing back when it first came out.This port, however, is terriable. Tons of graphical bugs, some audio problems here and there, and the Multiplayer has terriable connection issues which has yet to be fixed. It's like they didn't give a damn with ""upgrading"" this reboot and just made it half ♥♥♥ run on new systems. (They have put more work into Age of Empires II HD than this)There really isn't much added into this game. It only includes the main game, the Titans expansion, and a few other little things that is not with the $30 that it's asking. When it hit's -50% or more, then grab it up!Till they fix the MP to work better, which was the main reason why I bought this game to play with my best friend, it's only really a single player game at the moment, but still fun if you love Age of Mythology or RTS games. Get it on sale and not full price.			"

												I liken these recent updated Ensemble/Microsoft classics to buying a Ferrari full of puppies and pizza, they're that much fun. Take some of the best games from our gaming history, update them to work well on modern machines including the multiplayer components, then blow them out with a giant list of modern features like cloud save, achievements, trading cards, workshop, stats and on and on, sell them for a reasonable price and here we are, with a game that I will play until the end of my days.You don't get nearly as many wide-eyed blissful moments with gaming or with most other things in your adult years compared to your childhood, but that's exactly how I felt 30 minutes into playing this updated version, like a kid on Christmas morning. While I may seem a little over the top in my effusive praise, look here; Ensemble is my favorite developer of all time, Age of Empires II and Age of Mythology are among my favorite games of all time, and these updated versions of those games tick every box I need them to tick and then some. This is pure gaming perfection as far as I'm concerned.			"

												I think the devs made a mistake in emphasizing the shiny new graphics and features, because yes, they look stunning compared to the older version, but unfortunately I believe many people have gotten the impression that that's the only thing they're getting for their thirty bucks.I would honestly buy this game on steam without any additions for the same price. The better graphics can disappear for all I care, because what this re-release truly means is the return of multiplayer, a bigger, more active community, and devs that actually listen and actively improve the game. In my opinion, that is what I am buying, and I am not disappointed with the results. I would definitely recommend this to anyone whether old or new, to relive the experience or see it for the first time. :)			"

												Love this game, I worship it. Spent countless hours creating maps in editor and making unstoppable armies of Gastraphetes(100% balanced ofc). What I do not love, is this festering, stinking heap of a cash grab.All they had to do was fix multiplayer. Bring people back.Instead they made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimized shader system that makes it unplayable on any computer the game used to play well on. It lags and overheats my GTX 760.(It shouldn't even get past 30 degrees! wtf?) You need mods to get rid of their bugs(which were never there in the original version), their multiplayer is even more broken(game versions not matching...). ♥♥♥♥♥♥ achievements with portraits from units ingame. They ♥♥♥♥ed up God Portrait resolution on one picture. HOW? They ♥♥♥♥ed up the manticores wings. HOW? They added nothing(except the water, dassit), and ♥♥♥♥ed up things that worked. All the UI improvements and texture improvements were already on the net.♥♥♥♥ you, Skybox. Go to hell. You only had to fix the multiplayer, and I would have gladly paid the full price. Stay away people, get the original version somewhere. They ballsed it up here.			"

												Been playing the original constantly for the past 10 years but this ""HD"" remake is terrible. Apart from the fatal crashes half way through single-player random maps where the game just restarts for no reason, the graphics additions actually make things worse. With the new water, you can barely see fish through it, or units hiding in the water on the shore, the bloom is bad quality (even if you have a GTX Titan), the models (which haven't been HD'd) just don't suit the new lighting, they look all bubbly/oversmoothed and horrible, and the dynamic shadows look bad. I'm usually a graphics nut but I had to turn it all off and it's still ugly / hard to read. It's like some guy had this great water shader and was like ""hey we could stick it in AoM and call it HD, and we'd better shoehorn in some other crap to make it seem worth it"". Going back to the original version.			"

Here is my lists of what i like and what i dont. you guys read and see. and compare for yourselfs. also i am gonna recommend some mods that to me must have! in order to make the game feel like they should have made it in the firts place.The Good1-Very well done(and long) campaing (thanks, originals Devs.)2-Addictive gameplay sometimes have more fun that AOE 3.(thanks,original Devs)3- The water is very pretty they really to me mad ea greta job on it, if only they made the terrain as equal.4-Like the shadows they added and the day and night cycle.( thank,skybox)5- love the choice of gods and the power and myth units they provide.sometimes i dont even get why this game hasnt made a sequel.(thanks original team)6-I heard multiplayer is good.7-Steam workshop.The Bad1-Better AI, and being able to choose dificulty individually.Able to tell your AI what to do Attack, defense, economic etc etc.2-Game UI is very limited,cant even see how many villager one has and who is picking what resource.(MUST HAD!!!!!!! very important!!!)3-Cant choose colors for your race,they could have made the graphics a bit better especially the units. 4-Myth Units upgrades dont show diference when upgraded.(must add)5-No advanced Advanced tooltips.(must had!)6-Bland terrain textures.( your water effect were very good, could have done the same to the terrain)7-Steam workshop(cant acess your MODS if you play offline, to me i cant play whit put the mods)8-Serius lag and frezees on campaign cutscenes i dont know in multiplayer.9-At firts lots of bugs they have improve somewhat.10-Colors look bland. specially team colors11-I dont get diplomacy mode and how it works.( mi opinion, if somebody know feel free to tell me)12-lag and freeze when scrolling on the map.13-when unit die they look like a foto on the ground they could have made tiny 3d models as the body decays.(this is not necesary but it would sure look cool)What I hope from skybox1- Make all the error gone.2- Add a new race in the future(highlty unlikely but still hope so)3- Drop down the price.20$ whit out the many bugs if like it is now sell it at 15$.4- Add the basic stuff so at least we dont have to connect online to get the mods.(new terrain textures, unit upgrades, better UI, advanced tooltips).Mods that improve the quality of the game. i cant play whitout them.1-Better game UI.2-Advanced tooltips.3-upgrades Mod pack.4-Epic textures.5-Player colour mod( this just make your team color look more deep in color) If Any in Skybox labs sees this i personaly have some words of advice, for you as a costumer. your saving grace in this game was that you ""remade"" a clasic you guys sold more for nostalgia than anything else.if you keep making flops like this people WILL wont want to buy from you guys anymore. personally for your next title i would think of buying it if it came form you guys. this game feels unfished i think you had more ideas but dint come to fruitition and were rushed into making it. please update the crap out of this game. you WILL lose custumers if you dont and lose yours jobs in the process. If your remade Rise of Nations(i think that what you guys are doing or had plans for) try to learn from your mistakes and make the game look pretty and feel more like today RTS games UI and tooltips are very important also the terrain.(except water i personally love the water effects) and also add the great stuff you guys added. also expand on the game like add 2 or 4 races more. people eat that up. i personally will and pay for it, as long as it a fair price.

												EXACTLY the same as the original mythology with extremely, extremely minor detail differences that aren't noticable whatsoever. The graphics are still as bad as they used to be, the glitches haven't been fixed or even touched on, the AI hasn't been improved (so you still have the issue of 50% of your ally's/enemies freezing and doing nothing all match) and it genuinely is NOT extended by any definition. The story is the same, the gameplay is the same, the night/day cycle DOESN'T WORK and despite the massive nolstagic trip out it still has nothing good going for it. I'd consider this a waste of money. There are other games that are much better and there are other developers who don't mislead you who also do genuinely good work, save your money for yourself or for people who deserve it.			"

												The original, being a game i've played since I was only 4, has been, and always will be, my favorite game. That being said, this version (Age of Mythology: Extended Edition) has become a close second. The flow of the game feels the same as it did over a decade ago with a few minor touch-ups and improvements. I'll admit it, the graphical overhaul wasn't as ""stunning"" as i'd hoped it would have been, but, it leaves you with the nostalgic feeling of playing a childhood game once again. I've put thousands of hours into the original version, hundreds into the titans expansion, now, it's time to do the same on the extended! If you're new to Age of Mythology, or god-type games in general, but you really like strategy games, dive into this RTS and sink your teeth in. I guarentee you'll get a mouthfull!			"

												Having grown up with this game (and lost my original CD) it was absolutely fantastic to see it available on Steam. However I was quite baffled when I saw the game's price tag; to demand 27,99€ for a game that is more than a decade old is absurd, saying it is a HD remake does not even justify the price - graphics are the same as it was back in 2002, but with dynamic shadows and a day/night cycle.If you didn't play Age of Mythology back when it was released I wholeheartedly recommend it as the game features: Great campaign storyline.  Well made characters. Decent balanced factions.  An interesting history menu where you can read about the lore of individual units. Beautiful background music.To this day, I still consider Age of Mythology to be one of the most successful RTS games ever made and to play it again after 12 years really gives me a sense of nostalgia, but if want to buy it I would suggest looking elsewhere as a HD remake does not justify a 27,99€ price tag.

												Summary - The Chinese expansion is rushed, copy-pasted from existing things, and glitchy. The people who profit from this are not the ones who made the original Age of Mythology.Icons for Chinese buildings are re-used existing ones.Chinese god powers and soldiers are like copies of existing ones, just changed a little bit. For example, the chinese monk is the egyptian priest with a different model, texture, icon and description, and instead of converting animals he converts enemies. He waves his arms and makes the exact same chant, and the cursor turns into an Egyprian Ankh when you mouse-over enemies.Incorrect descriptions - The two Chinese heroes we start with are given Arkantos's description of special powers.Poor story-telling - Unlike the original campaign, the beginning of the Chinese campaign has very little story-telling. You are not introduced to the gods, and you just start already in the second age. We only have a brief introduction to the heroes.At the beginning of the campaign.../(SPOILER)\The heroes have to travel across China because when they realise there's evil afoot, a random peasant tells them to cross china, and so they do with no questions asked.\(SPOILER)/Graphic glitches on my new-ish computer - You can see flames if the ground is behind them, but not if the sky if behind them. When placing walls. the wall segment that is behind another is drawn in front of what is actually in front of it.Glitched first scenario in the Chinese campaign - You start in the Second age, but if you restart you are in the first age.It runs slowly.You can drag a box to select four soldiers and it will tell you you've selected only two, or the ""bamboo tree"" nearby.My fortified wall upgraded to an earthen wall.I got a steam card of Thor with a really bad picture on it, with the description ""The Norse god of lightning"". Thor is the god of thunder.This is my review after only getting to the second scenario in the Chinese campaign, because waiting to finish it to write the review would make it too late for the review to be helpful, because it's only just been released. Perhaps it's not their fault that the Chinese are so similar to the other ones, because there are only so many possibilities, and the three original races have already taken a share of the possibilities, but the lacking story-telling and the obviously reused artwork and code make it seem like the people who made it rushed it, or did not enjoy maknig it, or something like that. If it was released as a free mod then it would probably be well recieved, but it's been named an official expansion.			"

												This is a great game. I've spent hours playing it and have enjoyed it for years. But, this Extended Edition is a piece of garbage. The game is completely glitched. One of the more innocuous glithces occurs when you click on, say a tree, and drag toward a unit the game will think you clicked on and are commanding the tree; thankfully though the commands will be of the unit, not of the tree. Then, there are the abominable graphical glitches which can, at times, make the game unplayable necessitating a reset. At times the map won't load. These glitches first showed up months ago, it seems the Microsoft Studios are trying their best to make their intent of milking the Age of Mythology till it's lying motionless sprawled across dead grass as obvious as they possibly could. The most apt description of this version is schizophrenic. It will reset in the middle of a game, the entire game will close, the graphics will disintigrate, and all other assortments of frustrations. If anyone is curious my computer can handle games with superior graphics with no issue, the problem is rooted in the version of this game itself.If you want to play this game then buy an old version of it on CD. This version isn't even worth the $4.99 that it'll occasionally be sold for let alone the regular 29.99; it leads to too many irritations. After all, the ""improved graphics"" are meaningless when the entire Christ forsaken game can't handle them to the point where it glitches to Hell!			"

												I rarely ever write  a review but this just made me write one :/First of all I seem to be one of those who don't experience any issues be it framedrop, crashing or other stuff.BUT what I read in the reviews and the forum, before it was deleted by the devs.... yes you heard right, is just awful!It seems like those ""developers"" just made a lazy half ♥♥♥♥♥ product  with little to no optimization. I read of crashes when launching the game since the DLC is out, Multiplayer is laggy since teh release of the base game, random desyncs in MP and the list goes on to save files beeing corrupted and crashes when starting a SP game. Also the AI seems to be even worse from what I've heard.If I haven't already played 5 hours I would get a refund just so the devs didn't get my money (even though the game is working fine for me)Now to the fun thing. They recently deleted the Steam Forum. But after the ♥♥♥♥♥torm they got and about 90% of the threads are about crashing we have to assume that those amateurs can't even take responsibility for their product they just threw out despite it beeing very buggy. The Dev's are the worst. I like the idea of remaking an RTS classic in an age where this genre seems to die out or at least lose a lot of popularity, but if they can't even make it work and even make it worse with the new DLC they shouldn't have done it from the beginning. That beeing said. Don't buy it. You have no reason to do so. If you actually like the devs screw you, they are just as lazy as early acess devs which just quit their game.If you actually read all this, I hope I could help you. Just buy the original game and not the Extended edition, it runs better has no bugs.EDIT: The Forum wasn't deleted sorry for writing that it was only out of business for some timeEDIT EDIT: The game stopped working for me. Can't start it. I tried every ""solution"" and nothing works. I don't know what changed but I would suggest to not turn off your computer or update any program if you get this game to work. Turning off my PC broke it for me. ♥♥♥ these devs. I am out.			"

												Great game, but this extended edition performs badly; it's not well optimized. Could run all of the other AoE, as well as the original AoM, just fine but this one takes a dip in framerates just by scrolling through the map.If you experience slowness/reduced framerates, you can try some of the methods mentioned by others (ensure you're not running in integrated graphics if you have a dedicated card, run in the lowest resolution, turn off water refraction and shadows). This kind-of helped, slightly, but the game's frequent frame-drop just makes it unplayable.			"

												DLC for a game should be something extra, and those who don't have it should still be able to play the standard game.Not in this case though. Since the Far Eastern Mythology DLC came out the game no longer works for me. The first time I started a game the AI consisted of civs all belonging to the new DLC, yet I didn't own it. Then the game realises that and crashes. And now I can't even run it unless I 'update' it, as in 'unless you have all DLC you won't get anything'......And that was months ago, and I'm still waiting for this to get fixed...And untill the moment it has been fixed, I'm convinced the devs are either trying to scam you or they don't give a flying damn thing about this game anymore. And that is a real shame, because this was, and still is, a great chapter in the Age games line, and it hurts to see it in this state right now.			"

As far as the game itself is concerned, it's simply an amazing and beloved classic.
However, most people would want to purchase it when it's on sale, due to the fact that it's quite overpriced.
All in all, I am inclined to believe that Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is a very enjoyable game and may offer endless hours of entertainment to both longtime RTS fans and newcomers to the genre and/or franchise.Notable features and additions to the old game, for those who are interested in further info:Updated graphics and textures! Now suitable for higher (e.g. HD) resolutions!Long awaited bugfixes and balance changes!Trading cards!Achievements!Steam Workshop for all kinds of mods (easy to install and upload mods)! "

												The game has always been full of bugs, but now they've taken it to a new level!The latest release can't hold an online game reliably.  I'm seeing 80%+ of my games end with a sync error now!  It just quits and its tough luck.  That on its own is enough to make this game pointless.This is on top of all the other bugs that already existed within the game (too many to mention).They also have blocked off parts of the game previously accessible, like the nomad map now requires you buy the expansion.  Not only that but the name gods are rather unbalanced, meaning the only way to win is to buy the expansion to get the more powerful gods.Totally awful poorly tested product.  Do not buy this game they're a rip off. "

												Age of Myth is one of my favourite RTS's of all time. There's no doubt that this game is pure addictive fun. BUT there are a lot of problems with this version of the game including:- The new DLC makes it incredibly frustrating to play, as vanilla users will be constantly dc'ing when using certain abilities on DLC units. - The multiplayer is pretty garbage, takes forever to find a game and when you do it's either extremely lag-ridden or crashes.They should have left the DLC out and done a better job with multiplayer, then it would be 10/10 "

												Compelling storyline, diversity in player races/classes, and well thought-out map/level design makes this game the best in the franchise. I just finished playing all three, and I can't get over how they overlooked the idea of having 3 distinct player races have separate strengths and weaknesses that accomodate most playstyles to an RTS. Of course, its ""easy"" campaign option makes the campaign a rewarding experience as you play through all three classes in 48 scenarios. I haven't really dug into the multiplayer yet, but if I did I would feel more than prepared after such an engaging campaign. If you were thinking about getting into franchises or RTS in general, this is the one in the series to get. AoE 2 is much too difficult for me to recommend right away, and the story in the third is far too bland and uninteresting. If you're struggling or you find it boring, play it on Twitch. If you're lucky, you'll have nice viewers help you through it - it definitely made it more interesting for me to play.			"

And still, this thing crashes harder than the Concorde did.So.

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is a fun RTS game that allows you to play as different ancient gods and use their different abilities to wipe out your enemies. If you're a super competitive gamer and love trying a bunch of various strategies I would totally recommend this game, this is for you. I haven't played the other Age of Mythology games, so I can't say how accurate this one is, however this was recommended to me by a friend who says it's very accurate. Take that as a third party source, though.This is by no means a bad game, and it excels in what it does. It provides a challenging RTS experience that you can enjoy with friends or on your own. The problem for me comes from the game being a tad too competitive. This might not be a problem for you, and it might actually be a good thing. If that's the case you should get this game, probably when it's on sale. If you share the same opinion as me in this area in that you would rather spend your time goofing off than strategising and micromanaging resources, I would say no, you'd be better off spending your money on something else. That's just me, and I understand a lot of people feel otherwise, but for people like me I have to say no, I don't recommend it.			"

												Age Of Mythology is one of the best Real Time Strategy games ever made. It is unrivaled in depth and imagination. The playability of the game is endless. The campaign in Single Player may seem short for some people who like single player mode, but awaiting you and everyone is a massive base of user created scenarios and creations. In multiplayer this games is at it's best when it works. The new P2P style lobby system seems a little more unstable that the ESO system used previously. This game is a keeper, everyone who has it loves it.			"

There hasn't been any other technical trouble that I have ran into. Running this on my 7 year old rig just fine.So what is Age of Mythology?If you've ever played any of the Age of Empires games you'll know what you're getting into. Age of Mythology adds mythical creatures as units and adds (limited use) god powers from those gods who you choose to worship.			"

												Age of Mythology is one of my all-time favourite games and the only RTS I like. It's easy and intuitive to learn with an amazing soundtrack, varied gameplay and awesome campaign, context, story etc. The game design is flawless. I bought this just to re-experience the campaign. However, I did expect that, given it's ""Extended Edition"" to have updated graphics and some more features. The game does NOTHING!! I have no interest in the multiplayer but from what I hear it's broken - thus defeating the purpose of its revival. The only hope is improved graphics which it does NOT offer AT ALL. The screenshots are deeply misleading. If anything, the game is worse because of framerate drops and poor optimisation, non-functioning V-sync and other issues. If you haven't played Age of mythology, I strongly urge you to do so, but not at the extortionate price of this wannabe remake.			"

												I used to love playing this game and as soon as i saw it was being redone through steam I pre-ordered it. I don't know why I bothered. The graphics improvements are not worth the money I paid for this. General animation of characters is extremely poor and juddery. Somehow it feels like they have made the game worse.  Would have been nice if they tweaked some of the gameplay features which now feel outdated like not having the option to auto-scout.If you already have the original version of the game like I do, I suggest installing and playing that rather than wasting your money.

												While for most re-releases, the publishers at least went through the trouble of giving the games a marginal graphical update, this is not the case for AoM. The Extended Edition looks 1-to-1 exactly the same as the original. Everything uses textures that look like we are still playing on 640x480 screens instead of 3840x2160. In fact, despite the 3D graphics of this game, the HD version of Age of Empires II looks vastly superior. This is shameless money grab with no work done whatsoever.			"

												DOES NOT WORK!I'll make something clear as day before we get into the details. I really like Age of Mythology, it's a classic RTS game with a lot of fun gameplay to offer however my negative review is regarding the terrible handling of this updated edition.Somehow a team of devs have managed to update an old ♥♥♥ game, add their own DLC to it and break it in the process, I can't even access the launcher now and after several attempts to fix I'm nowhere closer to being able to play it. The worst part of all this is that I have played over 2 hours before the update ruined everything so Steam will not refund me for this purchase. While I applaud Steams concept of a 2 hour refund on any game purchase what has happened here gets around that standard practice by the dev patching the game into a buggy and non working state after the fact.Don't give your money to this company, they have made no solid effort to fix the games problems and post the most generic of solutions on the forums which don't even fix the issue.

												This game is a bad port of the original AoM. A first version of this review was extremely negative. Desyncs make the game in the current patch a true nightmare. If it weren't for this, I'd recommend the game, even with all its other shortcomings, because the game itself is rather fun and addictive. A lot of players quit playing the game because of desyncs.There's also good news. There is active work on the desyncs and a dev seems to publish statistics and his approach on the issue. That means there ís hope for the game. Check out future reviews.			"

												UPDATE: I saw people complaining about a terrible glitch with the Chinese factions of everything suddenly being destroyed when the scenario begins and losing immediately because of it. At first I didn't have that problem, I was even able to play a few levels of the Chinese storymode, NOW IT'S DOING IT FOR NOT JUST THE STORYMODE BUT NOW FOR EVERY FACTION AND EVERY RANDOM MAP I TRY TO PLAY!!! WTF!!Let me be clear that I love Age of Empires. It's the best real time strategy game of all time, but compared to earlier entries like Age of Empires 2, AoMythology feels like it's lacking. The growth and movements are a lot slower than I remember them to be, and despite the game being remastered with better graphics of the environment and buildings they are still really poor in terms of units (they're basically a few crude shapes with arms). the system of heroes and myth units put a difficult wrench into the mix of unit advantages, and it seems no matter how much you upgrade they die very quickly unless you have an overwhelming force. The buildings compared to AoE2 are also much weaker. Whereas in AoE2 castles and towers could protect you from all sorts of forces, the defenses in Age of Mythology are practically made of cardboard. It almost makes artillery pointless because so long as you're willing to lose a couple of cheap units you can stab whole fortresses to death in a matter of moments, something you and the enemy could rarely do in Age of Empires 2. There is one thing Age of Mythology has that is better than other titles and that's the learning element. It won't teach much history, but when you click on unit icons it opens up a short description of the unit's stories in mythology for myth units or if it's a human unit it will have a small explanation of that unit's weapons or place in ancient history. Even clicking on a wild animal will bring up it's scientific name and other facts about it. For learning purposes, this is the best part of the game. Something I loved about Mythology is that it had much better and much crazier cheatcodes. I'll never forget the glory that is WUV WOO and O CANADA which spawn a flying purple hippo and a superhero bear with the Canadaian flag on it's back. Yet for some reason, I can't get any of them to work anymore. That's reall disappointing for me because those cheats were amazing. All in all, I bought this game for the nostalgia and the new Chinese faction dlc, but feel it was not worth buying again. I much more recommend Age of Empires 2 because it is faster paced, more balanced, slightly cheaper, and has a lot more cultures to choose from.			"

												the following reveiew was made originally on jan 30th 2016 but i am cleaning house on my reveiws and proof reading stuff.The price is awful for a game that has aged like fine wine. When I was a kid I had this game for the ds, only difference was it was turn based and it didnt really ruin the game for me... but it made a whole new experience. HOWEVER when I came to this, it kinda ruined it I guess cause it was rts? (ikr? ) but also im sort of a casual player when it comes to ensembles aoe games and i like to face bots that prove a challenge but that I can still beat. In this game, when I play a skirmish, because of the rts and the god powers it makes it a lot harder to do things. The sad thing to me is that you can only use god powers one time in a game. I feel like some god powers should be a cool down thing such as the one lightning bolt , sure it may take like 1 min to cooldown and perhaps a certain amount of favor but maybe that would be a better system.the big pros (and not all of them probably):- Different cultures, they add a lot of diversity to the game.- Titans are awesome and badass, you're screwed though if one's heading towards your base.BIG CONS (and not all of them... maybe?)- Thank god I got this on sale, no way I would pay 30$ for this not even or aoe 1. (Which I think is the best out of them all personally.)- I like the settlements idea for ds wich was turn based but not a whole lot for an rts game however.- AGAIN with the house limit? come on I wanna make a huge sprawling city guys!- Just the way the game is, I dunno I cant get sucked in like aoe 3 or aoe 2 (check my hours guys i got a lot on those)- Now I feel like playing civ 5 (civ 5 is better then civ 6 don't get me started on that opinion) or the ds version instead of this game...unless i play this with a friend.- Finally, the price... really microsoft your going to put this price on this game? From something that probably ensemble studios made too.. who aren't around because of you...			"

												As a kid I loved Age of Mythology and played hundreds of hours. Seeing this expansion has really been a knife in the back of the game I once loved so much.  The new content is lack luster the campaign is repetitive, poorly balanced and boring. And the new civ pretty much reuses previous models to create every new unit. But the worst part is the bugs. This game not only crashes itself but my entire computer multiple times aswell and aswell as messing up the new content they have also ruined the existing campaigns. Why can my walls cast earthquake??? Why do my units get stuck unmovably on cliff faces??? Why are upgrades moved to buildings that are not supposed to be able to research them??? Why are units able to be garisonned in buildings if the rally point is set to them??? The answer a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ effort from the game developers who not only managed to ruin the new content but also the existing game. . . Thanks!			"

The growth and movements are a lot slower than I remember them to be, and despite the game being remastered with better graphics of the environment and buildings they are still really poor in terms of units (they're basically a few crude shapes with arms). the system of heroes and myth units put a difficult wrench into the mix of unit advantages, and it seems no matter how much you upgrade they die very quickly unless you have an overwhelming force. The buildings compared to AoE2 are also much weaker. Whereas in AoE2 castles and towers could protect you from all sorts of forces, the defenses in Age of Mythology are practically made of cardboard. It almost makes artillery pointless because so long as you're willing to lose a couple of cheap units you can stab whole fortresses to death in a matter of moments, something you and the enemy could rarely do in Age of Empires 2. There is one thing Age of Mythology has that is better than other titles and that's the learning element. It won't teach much history, but when you click on unit icons it opens up a short description of the unit's stories in mythology for myth units or if it's a human unit it will have a small explanation of that unit's weapons or place in ancient history. Even clicking on a wild animal will bring up it's scientific name and other facts about it. For learning purposes, this is the best part of the game. Something I loved about Mythology is that it had much better and much crazier cheatcodes. I'll never forget the glory that is WUV WOO and O CANADA which spawn a flying purple hippo and a superhero bear with the Canadaian flag on it's back. Yet for some reason, I can't get any of them to work anymore. That's reall disappointing for me because those cheats were amazing. All in all, I bought this game for the nostalgia and the new Chinese faction dlc, but feel it was not worth buying again. I much more recommend Age of Empires 2 because it is faster paced, more balanced, slightly cheaper, and has a lot more cultures to choose from.			"

												the following reveiew was made originally on jan 30th 2016 but i am cleaning house on my reveiws and proof reading stuff.The price is awful for a game that has aged like fine wine. When I was a kid I had this game for the ds, only difference was it was turn based and it didnt really ruin the game for me... but it made a whole new experience. HOWEVER when I came to this, it kinda ruined it I guess cause it was rts? (ikr? ) but also im sort of a casual player when it comes to ensembles aoe games and i like to face bots that prove a challenge but that I can still beat. In this game, when I play a skirmish, because of the rts and the god powers it makes it a lot harder to do things. The sad thing to me is that you can only use god powers one time in a game. I feel like some god powers should be a cool down thing such as the one lightning bolt , sure it may take like 1 min to cooldown and perhaps a certain amount of favor but maybe that would be a better system.the big pros (and not all of them probably):- Different cultures, they add a lot of diversity to the game.- Titans are awesome and badass, you're screwed though if one's heading towards your base.BIG CONS (and not all of them... maybe?)- Thank god I got this on sale, no way I would pay 30$ for this not even or aoe 1. (Which I think is the best out of them all personally.)- I like the settlements idea for ds wich was turn based but not a whole lot for an rts game however.- AGAIN with the house limit? come on I wanna make a huge sprawling city guys!- Just the way the game is, I dunno I cant get sucked in like aoe 3 or aoe 2 (check my hours guys i got a lot on those)- Now I feel like playing civ 5 (civ 5 is better then civ 6 don't get me started on that opinion) or the ds version instead of this game...unless i play this with a friend.- Finally, the price... really microsoft your going to put this price on this game? From something that probably ensemble studios made too.. who aren't around because of you...			"

												It is with a heavy heart that I write this. I need to downvote this game because not of itself, but that thrice damned DLC.I'm on the campaign ""New Atlantis"", trying to start the mission ""Odin's Tower"". And I can't start it. Because of a ""bamboo tile"", which is now part of the DLC Tale of the Dragon. Every time I start the mission, the only thing I get is a window asking me to buy the DLC - the same one, note this, is currently being downvoted to hell on it's store page on Steam.I am not going to continue the campaign if that means spending money because of a god♥♥♥♥ing tile.

												As a kid I loved Age of Mythology and played hundreds of hours. Seeing this expansion has really been a knife in the back of the game I once loved so much.  The new content is lack luster the campaign is repetitive, poorly balanced and boring. And the new civ pretty much reuses previous models to create every new unit. But the worst part is the bugs. This game not only crashes itself but my entire computer multiple times aswell and aswell as messing up the new content they have also ruined the existing campaigns. Why can my walls cast earthquake??? Why do my units get stuck unmovably on cliff faces??? Why are upgrades moved to buildings that are not supposed to be able to research them??? Why are units able to be garisonned in buildings if the rally point is set to them??? The answer a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ effort from the game developers who not only managed to ruin the new content but also the existing game. . . Thanks!			"

												I have been a fan of the game since it first came out. Since downloading the Chinese edition i have not been able to play the game and tried every single fix option possible. The game is now dead to me and since i cannot reach anyone there is nothing i can do. What was a great game for me with add ons , which kept if fresh, but this addon is a deal breaker for me. All i want is a working CD version or just someone to talk me through what could be wrong but that will not be the case. Do i recommend the game yes but be careful with the entire steam process as it is good and professional but for those who cannot just get a fix you can be very frustrated quickly.			"

NOPE! 0 bytes network usage, 0 bytes disk usage, 100 % completion of the update and... DISK READ ERROR!!! GRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!! What the ♥♥♥♥! I've never encountered anything like this before!

I might keep the game afterall (too much trouble trying to get a refund right now), but the review stays negative...

												Single player: RECOMMENDED! No the graphics aren't modern. This is a classic game. One I happened to have missed. And it is awesome good fun, if you like this genre and/or the mythology theme. AoM can be pretty challenging, too. I can't imagine playing on the highest difficulty atm. Which means there is someone out there that will LOVE this game for the challenge that would offer.LAN/multiplayer: NOT RECOMMENDED! OMFG WHYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE?! /emocide! /homocide!! /genociduhduhduhduh!!! ... /flop!!!1 Yea, it *is* that bad.  Still. Yes. Still that bad. If they haven't fixed it yet, I seriously question if they will fix this ever. Yes, that is sad, since the multiplayer aspect is the whole reason for the extended edition reissue.Any game starts off okay, but as soon as you guys begin to progress at all the game begins to hang/stutter a bit, then it hangs like crazy for 30 seconds at a time and eventually someone will just get booted altogether, which completely ruins the game.It does not matter if you have a decent (or better) gaming rig and a good internet connection set up for a multi-gamer household. I don't know what they messed up, but they did mess something up badly and it makes LAN unplayable. I assume multiplayer (online) would be even worse since I can't even play duo with someone on LAN.			"

 Masterpiece. 
Age of Mythology was the first game I ever played seriously. The interesting and diverse gameplay, the deceptively complex game mechanics, and the lovely graphics for the era all make for a game that is thrilling and incredibly fun to play.

This game has a certain charm about it; perhaps because of my experiences playing this game. The graphics may not be those of Fallout 4, The Witcher, or other such Triple-A Titles, but the gamemplay more than makes up for this. 
A lot of Age of Mythology's fun and diverse gameplay comes from its roster of incredibly diverse pantheons, and within those different gods that have different specialties. No two matches are the same, and playing with friends is incredibly fun.

Overall, Age of Mythology was a major part of my childhood and I enjoy it to death. I could not recommend this game more, and it holds a special place in my heart. "

												I've logged more time in AoM than probably any other game ever... except maybe Skyim.This is the end-all-be-all of RTS for me.  I've played every AoE game, Warcraft 2 and 3, and countless hours of Starcraft 2.  Age of Mythology wins.The races have drastic differences in appearance, economy, and combat function.  Combat is more economy focused than Starcraft and Warcraft.  If you've ever played an Age of Empires game than you have a basic understanding of what you're in for, but add way more variety in the races from square 1, add unique research abilities based on the gods you worship, and god powers that can drastically shift the battle at any second.

												I was excited when i saw that this game was getting an HD remake for the modern day of PC Gaming. I remember play this AoM with my friend at his house since i didn't own the game. Of course i loved it so much i bought my own copy and installed it on my computer. I spent hours playing this game, day and night i would play. So naturally, when i saw that this game was being released on steam with an texture update, i was excited! And after playing this game for 52 hours, i thought i give me take on the game.When you first load up the game, the game is different from the start, Having used a moving background behind a new menu layout gave it the feel of a new game, even though it wasn't. I loved the feel of the new menu (although some people didn't, as their a mod in the workshop for the old one, i didn't see a problem with the new one). and the world in the background was an awesome idea.Now as i said before, it did recieve an texture update, and yes it looks completely better then the old game, it still has the old game feel to it. They achieve the new look while keeping the way the orginal AoM looks and feels. I'll admit, when i first heard of AoM: EE i was thinking they overhauled the graphics on it and have the characters working mouths! Sadly, they didn't, but that doesn't mean they didn't update the game. The water and land textures (Greek, Norse etc.) have all been updated.Gameplay was as just much fun as it was when i was a kid. Building huge armies and storming the Gates of Troy was just as exciting as i remember it being. Of course not every game is perfect, at some points, when moving an army they would get stuck or move in a direction i didn't tell them too. When this happend, i would have  to kill some people or make the army smaller (by killing them) so the rest of the army could move, then i would have to rebuild the lost men and gather then up for battle. Yet, this was the only real problem i encounter in the game. With the edition of steam groups to the game, any bugs or glitches that come up and brough to the developer and are fixed quickly. Thats right, the developer actually cares what the people say and fix the problems that are bothering their fans!The campaign in this game consist of three storys. Fall of the Trident follows Arkantos jouney to appease the God Posiden,  Even if it means storming the Gates of Troy, or chasing his villian across the world! The campaign that comes from the Titan expansion follows Kastor, Arkantos son, as he struggles to lead his people following the events of the first campaign. A campaign i can't recall if it was in AoM is the Golden Boar. This campaign follows two dwarves on their wacky adventure to retrieve their golden boar! (It's not really wacky but it has its funny moments). Nothing new in the story section, the game keeps true to the old campaign leaving it how it was.With the steam groups added also comes Steam Workshop. Adding this to the game makes the content of this game seem limitless now. Adding mods to the game can change your gameplay (either with new maps or new scenarios etc). Allowing mods to this game just makes it even better to play by adding more hours of gameplay.Overall, the game was great! I missed playing this game and now that i have it on Steam (making it easier to keep track off, i lose disk a lot) just makes it so much better. For my first review i give the game a 9/10. I gave it a 9 for great gameplay (even if its nothing new from the old game), fresh new textures (which look great!), the story was awesome too ,and only one glitch that i could find. And most importantly, keeping the feel and enjoyment of what the AoM had. Extented Editions of games sometimes lose what the original game brought, and AoM: EE kept that while improving the game. So if you're an old fan or a newcomer, AoM: EE is the perfect RTS for you!			"

												==About the game in general==Age of Mythology is an awesome game... I had a lot of fun back in the ESO days, with tons of scenarios, friendly and good players .The steam version is basically the same game with only a few small things improved, But some problems still remains on the game, like DC's out of nowhere or one player can lag the whole game for everyone.And the launch... Don't even talk about the launch... It was a mess...  The launch scared a lot of people (that explains why the game had a low pop of players in the past months), but for a good reason... It was almost unplayable for a good amount of people. But, at least, they released a lot of fixes.It is somewhat playable... But yeah... you can still get DC from the match and the netcode in general they didn't improved that much, one player can still lag the match. I hope they keep releasing more fixes.I recommend the game, but just remind what i said about those multiplayer issues... They still happen. Edit: The new ""expansion"" increased the MP DC's and bugs. Beware.==About the new content and exclusive steam version patchs==They made some balance changes to the steam version. That is awesome, the game needed it, because a few gods were dominant, like zeus or isis. They gave some needed buffs and nerfs.Now about the ""expansion"". I haven't bought the ""expansion"", but i'm not sure if i will buy it now (will wait a 75% sale). The idea was good, but the final result is pretty mediocre. Some units are just reskins from vanilla/titan units, and units with unique models are pretty bad. It feels like a paid amateur mod.It seems like they didn't put a good effort on it and released it too soon. For now, i'm more happy about the balance changes and i hope they fix the new civilization (op units, bugs, awful models and god portraits).			"

												Great game, however the multiplayer is atrocious. If anyone drops out, there is no way for them to reenter, which makes finished a game difficult. The game also continuously drops framrate to an almost unplayable extent, even though I have a high end computer.Again, its a good game. It just needs a patch to help with the multiplayer conectivity. Do not buy until this happens.			"

												This has got to be one of my all time favorite games, an easy top 10 series (and I have been gaming for about 20 years +).  I have been playing this sinec the beta released!  Yes, that many years ago.  I still have my original discs for them and expansion.  Why buy this again on Steam!?  Because its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and I believe in supporting the companies you like.  Considering I have gotten several thousand hours of fun play time out of this, yes, they earned another sale from me.  So many different ways you can go and play with friends.  Titan challenges are fun as well.  One of my all time best was a rush with Odin winning in 10 minutes (killing all units and buildings), and making a hard mode CPU forfit in 8.  Not saying I am the worlds best, but this is such a great classic.  9/10 (no game is perfect).			"

												I cannot believe I have to give this a negative review.. This was a MARVELOUS game, but Microsoft has proven it likes to take games and mold them into a money printer. And that's what this game turned into. This game has almost no support form my recent beginning to play the game. There is much to despair over multiplayer and this is very unfortunate.My reasons Extended Edition should not be bought:-Lag across the board in multiplayer, regardless of how beefy your computer is, online or LAN-God Powers can desync Online games and make it easy to abuse ranking-Conversion of old maps is made incredibly difficult due to the addition of some stupid 'Alfred' unit-There is no report button anywhere, so if you're getting trolled/bashed, you have to cope or stop playing online-Single Player shows it's problems in cutscenes. Wrong Angles or complete terrain obscurity.-HD simply means, you can't find the fish while trying to fish. And a useless Day/Night cycle, that is never used.-Sometimes things happen for no good reasons, such as finishing a Titan Gate and it disapears.I bought this to relive a classic and play online, sadly, this wasn't the case. Skybox games should never be purchased. "

												Played this game when it was first released and loved it. I think this was the game that got me into playing RTS's. Played lots of different ones over the years but this one has always remained a favourite. I often hoped (and still do) that AOM 2 might be in the making. So i was over the moon when i saw this was going to be re-released.....a chance for the Phoenix to rise from the ashes once again and burn my enemies to the ground.If you haven't played this before don't expect an amazing graphical experience. The graphics have been improved, the sound aswell.....but the reason to play this is for the enjoyment. Its simple to pick up and play. However, experienced RTS gamers who haven't yet tried it, might find it too basic.Still, it's a classic and deserves a place in the RTS hall of fame.LAZER CROCS FTW			"

												This is a very bad remake of a very, very good game. I am utterly floored at how poorly optimized and broken the new graphical effects are. In like for like situations, this new version runs substantially worse than the original on far better hardware than was available at the time. There are missing, or incorrectly formatted graphical effects and textures, and all sorts of issues that cause crippling lag, which, when combined with the abyssmal netcode, make for an extremely frustrating experience. I love AoM but this port is an unoptimized, pathetic mess.			"

												I own AOE: Gold Edition and before that I owned the Titans Expansion + Regular game before I lost it. I would have clocked up at least 500 hours in this game in my time. Just stating that in case my hours of game time will help you hold my review to a higher validity. This game is absolute favourite game from the ""Age Of..."" series. In my opinion this game is superior to any Age of Empires game available, even the second. In fact, this game is honestly superior to any RTS strategy game I've ever played.It has every feature from all of the other ""Age Of"" games and more. Mythical units? ♥♥♥♥ yes. Fantastic campaigns? ♥♥♥♥ yes. Amazing map editor and scenario creator? ♥♥♥♥ yes. TITANS? ♥♥♥♥ yes! Heroes? ♥♥♥♥ yes. 4 different unique races? ♥♥♥♥ yes. A new resource? ♥♥♥♥ yes. I could go on for ♥♥♥♥ing ever but I won't because spoilers. (I'm too lazy.)In my opinion, AOE2 is only more popular because it is simpler. This game has many, many more features than AOE2 and if you go from AOM to AOE you will start to miss a lot of the amazing features that you start to take for granted once you play AOM.Also the multiplayer in the game is very active.I whole heartedly recommend this game. It is worth well over 30 dollars.Oh, and check out AOMHeaven and share your created campaigns/scenarios/maps/AI's on there for other players to play!			"

												Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is the enhanced version of the classic RTS game Age of Mythology (2002). It plays a lot like Age of Empires series, but with the use of god powers (spells alike), mythycal units and the controversial Titan, an extremely OP unit used to crush entire armies.Those accustomed to Age of Empires II (like me) will have to develop new strategies. Rushing and spamming units is a lot less efficient in AoM, because you can't build a lot of houses before claim new settlements (town centers) and the power of gods adds spicy situations that can turn the table in a favor of a player. Also, AoM has a lot less nations, but they're extremely different and will take you a lot of matchs to master them.The Extended Edition has graphics improvements, HD support, new online features (like the observer mode and Twitch integration) and steamworks features, like the Workshop, where you can download new maps, texture packs, etc. It comes with the Titans expansion (2003) and the extra official campaign ""Golden Gift"". To beat all campaigns it will take 20+ hours. There's a lot of map types and game modes to play in Skirmish and Multiplayer. The replay value is high enough to keep you hooked for a long, long time.IMO, some things needs to be addressed, like the mediocre pathing and some MP issues with players from different countries (if you play with someone near to you, the match will be smooth). While I enjoy this game a lot, I think it's a bit pricey for a 10+ years game with minor improvements. Thankfully, AoM: EE receives great discounts from time to time. Wait for a sale and join the community!			"

												A misleading title, ""Extended Edition""Below is a short list of what the game includes and what it doesn't to help you decide on your purchase. Microsofts development teams for these extended and HD remakes really would benefit from graphic designers, artists or content designers.DOES includes:-Minor new graphics engine changes, allowed for bloom lighting and better day and night cylcing with dynamic shadows.-The options menu contains a few new features which allow the player to zoom the camera out a litte further.-Players have a feature which allows them to intergrate their twitch.tv streamingDOES NOT include:- update graphics, texture, models units or animations- additional gameplay content, game modes, factions,campaign missions or multiplayer map styles- multiplayer fixes, issues addressed- better UI support- better hotkey binding support- better AI and pathingOverall Rating: 3/10The game is still good fun, but unless purchased at the sale price of £5 it isn't worth buying. I'm enjoying the title and its steam intergration, however the game is lacking most features you might expect from an extended version of the game. There are no features included which will extend the life cycle of the title and with poor multiplayer support and a high price tag for an old title, ends up making this purchase only rewarding for those who want to play a classic real-time strategy game by themselves or with a friend at sale time.

												Excellent job of destroying a wonderful game. If you want to only play the campaign with mediocre textures that were for the most part allready available this is your perfect waste of money. The multiplayer has terrible latency and the company that brought this to steam (sky box) is half ♥♥♥♥♥ and just cash grabs by poorly integrating old clasics on steam. Don't waste your money and just download the original and play on voobly.			"

												I have been enjoying this game for quite a long time. Bought the original edition in 2005 and a love affair began. This game is really one of the top RTS of all time with it's unique universe and time setting. The Ancient world has been never made before so nicely and I think several years after it's debut we can still say exactly the same. You have the stunning game modes, you have the outstanding editor, modding is pretty easy, just have a look at the biggets fan site (http://aom.heavengames.com/) where you can find plenty of help and of course the actual products of the hardworking modders. The Extended Edition brang back one of the things that I missed for a while, the Multiplayer mode. ESO was shut down and the game lost it's playerbase a bit, but the revival is finely made and hopefully we are going to see many new faces and of course the old ones. :) Other pro is the fantastic graphic effects. I never imagined that this edition will look that good after I saw the press release pictures. I can only recommend getting it as it's a game that you cant miss before you die.			"

												It's the exact same game I played a decade ago, just... prettier.  There are some nice visual effects added, but the character models and all of the graphics are the same, and the cutscenes of a decade ago are laughable by modern standards.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.  It was a very good RTS a decade ago, and there's nothing wrong with updating the skin while leaving the bones of the game entirely intact.If you're like me, and you've been dying to play this game again (now that it will work on a modern computer), definitely buy it.  In fact, I would recommend it to just about anyone who enjoys a good RTS.  Just maybe wait until the price comes down a bit.			"

												Age of Mythology has always been a great favourite of mine, wasted many thousands of hours on it (and in a good way) I even went as far to create a massive modification/overhaul of it called Expanded Mod for the Titans expansion.However Extended Edition is a very mixed bag, most of the time, the crappy work of the exe by Skybox Labs. and the code itself has caused many issues with lag, OOS etc overtime they have fixed this, but mostly because the small 1k community has coerced them into somewhat fixing it.  Rundown:PROS:+ All the Benefits of The Titans+ Four New Vanilla units (Patch 2.0 onwards) and 1 scenario editor/easter egg unit+ Addition of all extra-optional content by ES themself (Away from Home, +2 RMs, Golden Gift Campaign)+ Some Decent Balance+ Readdition of the Beta Ambient Lighting+ Improved Shadows (now dynamic, render based not .DCL/Texture files)+ Somewhat decent Mod Support, but... NEGS:- Crap Optimization, (run it with footprints + Amb Lights in 1024x768 should get around 45 FPS on most 2009 onwards Comps)- Nothing Spectacular content wise, if you know the Beta, AoE Twitch Livestreams, Alphas and Extra ES-made content.- Many Murky/Cloudy Textures, some texture stuff won't render correctly.- Eh Pathfinding- Still Needs a lot of fixing.- Lack of Dev Support- Almost no active communityYeah only 1k players play Online properly (even though there's 14k playing per 2 weeks, and only some 2-30 people playing non-private MP), even, also via the some 900,000+ purchases (roughly 27 million USD) Dev Support is really whack, so it's obvious that it's a money laundering scheme (MS is pretty infamous for that)Only get it, if your a non-Casual or below Age of Empires fan "

												After so many years the game has lost no charm, though it remains largely what it was before, except in one simple way, multiplayer. It adds a whole new challenge to the game, anyway, I aim this review at people who have never played the game before and are wondering ""is it for me?""Firstly, a huge part of this game (so huge they put it in the title) is mythology, it has rich, historically accurate features that really add to the game, you can train myth units, and you can also wield God powers, (send lightning down on enemies, and even make an earthquake right in your enemies base.) Before you start a game you have to choose a Major God, such as Zeus, Thor, Loki and others (a total of 12) your major God will determine what units, God Powers, and upgrades you will have.Gameplay - This is a Real time strategy game, one of the very best, you start with a few villagers who can build and gather resources (wood, food, and gold.) There are four ages in which you must advance, the archaic age, the classical age, the heroic age, and finally the mythic age. As you advance through the ages you'll unlock new military units (infantry, archers, and cavalry), as well as myth units (minoutaurs, centaurs, cyclops and loads of others.) Ultimatley your goal is pretty simple... Beat the other guy. Advance faster, make bigger armies, or win in other ways such as building a wonder and defending for ten minutes. So it's quite a tactical game. You can also, right at the end of the final age, build a titan, it is like it sounds, a massive thing that tramples cities like godzilla.Graphics - they're perfectly fine, and nothing more. There is violence in the forms of armies battling it out for domination, but nothing very gorey, and there is no bad language, unless you count ""Shkeepan"" (you'll understand that joke if you play the game""This is a great game, it has a little bit of a learning curve but can be picked up pretty quick, the best part is that even after so many hours, you still have so much to learn, it provides hours of fun. A couple of down sides - Price: £22.99 is a lot for a game that is 10 years old, don't get me wrong, I've paid more for newer games that aren't as good, but I think it's a little steep. Online games can be a little tough to come by, perhaps if they had a sale then more players would realise the quality of this game.			"

												Original game is great. Don't buy the extended edition.There are tons of gamebreaking bugs (e.g. constant desync issues in multiplayer, graphics bugs which make units invisible etc.)Since they brought out the Chinese DLC (which is horribly unbalanced and even more buggy than the rest of the game) I have not completed a single online match. It desyncs every time after just a few minutes or maybe if you're lucky after half an hour. There have been tons of bug reports to the developer team and none of these bugs have been fixed in over a year.There are people who apparently can't start the game because they didn't buy the dlc. (I can't comment on that because I wasted my money on the ♥♥♥♥ DLC)So there you go. As i loved the original so much,  I'm sad to say that you should under no circumstances buy the extended edition.

												This game is exactly as I remembered it, down to even the cheats. Sadly, the graphics are a bit dated. The models look exactly like the old version's on high. However, the extra features have made this game worth it in my opinion. Steam Workshop, while a mess at times, has the potential to add extra campaigns and more depth/balacnce. In game recording options let you easily save your games if you don't have any similar outside programs. Playing multiplayer is even easier, as you don't need to install outside clients.I would recommend this if you haven't owned the game or lost your copy, but otherwise, I would wait before getting this game. 8/10			"

												They really needed to make sure this game was actually playable before releasing it. It requires a patch to even start, but then by applying that patch, I am unable to see my DLC. I wanted to get a refund in hopes to buy the extended edition and tales of the dragon seperately(because that worked for a friend) buut now they wont allow me to have a refund because I went over the 2 hour limit(which is just FANTASTIC because I spent most of that time in game trying to fix it, not play it.)So now im stuck with a busted game and absolutely no help.

												This game was fine for the most part. I sadly experienced a lot of lag because I only have 2GB RAM, while the recommended are 4GB RAM, but it didn´t make the game unplayable.The last two levels of the ""Fall of the Trident"" were very buggy. Even with a wall, the enemy still would go through it without destroying it, and after I won the last level, my screen went black and I was only able to go back to the Windows screen by shutting down computer by force.The cutscenes seem to go ""underground"", whenever a character has to be shown in a close up. Something that didn´t happen on the original game. All in all, while this game has the Titans expansion (which I never played) and improved graphics, it isn´t worth 30U$D + 10U$D for the DLC, maybe 20U$D for everything would have been better, considering also the reviews for the DLC.I enjoyed it, but I don´t fully recommend it.[EDIT, March 3 2016:] This game just isn´t even worth 8U$D. Bugs started accumulating since yesteday: 1) Relics which instead of having bonuses for units have god powers (Pestilence).2) My walls have the earthquake power.3) Black boxes which summed up the unit´s strength/weakness disappeared.4) Enemy units going through my walls without destroying them.5) Available god powers having a different name (E.G: Prosperity has the name of an Odin´s relic bonus).

												Age of Mythology is a timeless RTS where players use their devotion and skill to ruin their enemies. It features a selection of Major Gods to choose from and then a series of Minor Gods to select as you advance through the ages, increasing the technologies and favour bestowed upon you. From humble beginnings with villagers struggling to gather food in the Archaic Age to armies of heroes, mythical creatures and human soldiers striding through vast empires in the Mythic Age, Ensemble Studios created a masterful entry into the 'Age of Empires' series that commands respect. Unfortunately, this rendition of the game is not the work of Ensemble Studios. In Age of Mythology: Extended Edition, the developers have criminally neglected it, this old masterwork riddled with connectivity issues and bugs that render it near-unplayable that weren't in the game before. The new Chinese civilisation, albeit well-designed mechanically, suffers from nearly all of its units being cheap re-textures of existing assets. If you can find a copy of the original game, there's an active community on there using a program to play online called ""Voobly."" So, if you wish to try Age of Mythology, that would be my recommendation. Try and cirvumvent this so-called ""Extended Edition"" if you can.In conclusion, this is a game many of us remember fondly. In the state it's currently in however, I'm sorry to say that it's better left alone until its current developers show it some more care.			"

												Don't by this piece of rubbish game. I will say it IS fun WHEN IT WORKS. Online games desync about 50% of the time, at various points in the match. Considering some of these matches are RANKED, or take ONE TO TWO HOURS to play, it is frustrating when it ""desyncs"" an hour into a good match.The verdict: don't buy. You'll just end up frustrated like me.PS: google search of ""age of mythology desync issue"" yields several threads of complaints back in 2013 and 2014. This issue must have been going on for a while, and it is still not fixed in 2016. Don't waste your $7 unless you want to play a glitchy game or the single-player campaign.			"

												     tl;dr- Don't buy this game until the company that picked it up publicly apologizes for their bad buisness practices and actually fixes them.     Okay, this is coming from someone who owned AoMG back when it was still run by ESO. It was one of my favorite games, with tons of hours of content. It had a massive modding, and map making support and a huge number of people took advantage of this. I would always rebuy it because I wasn't paying 10$ for one game, I was paying 10$ for an infinite number. That praise isn't even mentioning the base game, with a large number of civilizations and different strategies for each. Age of Mythology Gold is an excellent game and I strongly recommend you pick it up.      The Extended Edition that steam sells is not. There has been a little bit of confusion as to who actually is running the servers and support for the Extended Edition, although the latter may be a bit of a misnomer as Age of Mythology Extended Edition is rife with errors, bugs, and inconsisntencies. There are a kalidescope of problems that can occur during a game session to cause it to crash, from disconnections (which effect a single person) to desync. For the most part the cult following on Steam has bore these burdens with resignation. They make jokes at the expense of the servers and MS Ryzon (Ex-Developer for The Extended Edition) is actually featured as a boss in one scenario. The bosses' talent? He cause lag and steals money.      We were however content to have a medium which we could play our game on once again even if this medium was buggier than an anteater's lunch infected with crabs. This changed with the recent release of the Tale of the Dragon DLC. For 10$, one could unlock the Chinese Civilization. The quality of this expansion is such, that MOST players believe it simply to be a monotized mod for the game, and a poorly done one at that. The mod plays like already existing civilizations and brings little unique to the table. What it does bring however, is a host of new errors to the game. Chat in pregame lobbies no longer work, desyncs have become far more common, and players are constantly reminded by game breaking pop-up ads to purchase the expansion pack every time a player of the Chinese Civilization does, well, anything.       The most serious problem however has appeared. Custom games no longer appear on the list of available games as they are constantly being ""retreived"". This has rendered the largest attraction to the AoM experience completely unplayable. When I went to report this error to the support page, I found it broken. The Support page. Purchasing DLC is still entirely functional but attempting to to get game fixing support is impossible due to a broken link. That's the real reason for this review.The reason the player base is so frustrated isn't the errors in the game, it's the complete contempt of the paying consumers that is ultimately driving players from this game. I've asked dozens of people in the base if they have a favorable opinion of the hoster of this game. Not one single person has a favorable opinion or at very least neutral opinion of this game's hoster. The real kicker? This game was hosted 10 years ago by Ensemble Studios Online (from the makers of Halo Wars) and ran much smoother then. A company that has since collapsed was objectively more sucessful than both Steam and Skybox when it comes to smoothly running this game.    SkyBox, if you're reading this. You need to apologize to the players of this game for bad support, bug fixes and a DLC that has only exacerbated the problem. AoM is not a difficult game to run, and it has a lot to offer to all bases. But if your inability to fix basic game errors keeps driving off old players, you'll end up with a game that has no replayablity whatsoever especially when compared to the new generation of turn-based strategy.

												Maybe once upon a time this game would have been fun, but now not so much. I played some of the campaign and a lot of the sandbox/custom game setup. If you are playing ""conquest"" mode, then it devolves to a zergfest to see who can crank out the most units and overwhelm the other. If you are playing in other modes, the IA isn't much of a challeng until you have it on the 3rd or 4th setting and then it become overwhelming. Ultimately the biggest drawback is that there is no autosave. The game crashes (I'm running Win10), often only an hour or so after you've been playing and it is too easy to slip out of the habit of manually saving your game every so often. You lose a lot of progress and getting back to where you were is disheartening.			"

												(first review so sorry if its not a good one)AOM truly is an amazing game and ive loved it ever since about 2005 when i first started playing it but the extended edition, honestly, is not worth the amount they want. its full of bugs, glitchy AI, terrible multiplayer and dlc that i wouldnt even charge a penny for.firstly, the AI. the AI are stupidly stupid. they muster up smalll forces and poke at your door and thats if they make it across the map and dont get stuck behind a gold mine or a bloody deer. other times the AI just gives up and all of their units stop for no reason including their economy and its just stupid. the original cersion never had these problems and i know cause it was a major part of my childhood.secondly, the glitches. as i mentioned just then the AI glitches for no reason, they stop attacking and freeze but it doesnt just happen to them. oh no, iit can happen to you. your army will get stuck behind a cut down tree or they will run back and fourth because the route finder path says this wl get them to where you clicked even though its half a damn map away. a glitch i cant really blame on  skybox is farms. when a villagers farming near others they tend to stop because the game thinks there are more than one person farming on that farm and its just fustratiing because food is critical for a millitary. this was a bug in the original game that should have been fixed but no they left it.thirdly, multiplayer. the multiplayer is truly, truly, truly terrible. you cant even have a game wth out the game lagging randomly with good connection and half the time the servers cant conect you to other playes which makes the game even more prone to lag! even if you ddnt face these problems you have to hope tht half way through the game it doesnt crash and kick all other players and/or desync. its been like this since it came out and yet the developers sit on their lazy arses.lastly, the DLC. when i heard a DLC was going to be realeased i was over the moon! couldnt stop pestering my friend who i play with about it. i thought it would add more flavour to the game and fix some of the stupid bugs ive mentioned but no, it only made the current bugs worse and made the AI even ♥♥♥♥♥ier. The DLC is pretty much just a retextured civilization that the MODing community could have done better and i would truly love for them to make it better. All in all. dont buy this. maybe when its on sale for like £3-£10 but if not, ebay an original for like £2. and dont be fooled by my play time. i bought this game so by god im gonna play it!			"

												I have played hundreds of hours of the original AOM including the vanilla version and the Titans version.  I was very excited when I saw this was coming to Steam and my friends and I all pre-ordered the re-release of this game.Unfortunately, the game has more issues than the original ever had.  First off, performance is pretty terrible.  I used to run the original game on my Celeron 500 Mhz laptop with the built in graphics.  My current gaming PC (Core i5 2500 and 2x GTX 560 cards) has 10 times the power, and it struggles to keep 20 frames per second.  They did patch the game a bit over the past year, so graphical performance is a bit better, but I would not expect you to get consistant 60 or even 30 FPS even with a good gaming rig.  While the performance is disappointing, high FPS is less important for RTS games than it is for shooters.  The REAL ISSUE IS MULTIPLAYER.  I have started about a dozen games with my friends and have finished only two of them.  The game utilizes old school multiplayer hosting mechanism where hosting is distributed and if any PC gets out of sync, the game fails for all.  If you play a multiplayer game with only two PCs, you probably can finish it.  With three PCs, it is about 50-50 if you can finish the game before it de-syncs.  With four or more PCs, there is very little chance you can finish a multiplayer game before it de-syncs and permanently ends.The multiplayer performance is a known issue that has been out there since day 1 of the release, it is all over the forums with no work-around (such as a virtual LAN), and it looks like there is no intention from the developers to fix this.If you only want to play single-player, this edition of the game may be good.  But, if you want to play multiplayer, I would stay away from this version of the game. "

												I never played this game when it was released, I played it much later (2014) but enjoyed it a lot. I can see why people had been recommending it to me for years and telling me it was a classic. It's an old style strategy game like Age of Empires 1 and 2 except with a mythological theme, with Greek/Egyptian/Atlantaean Gods and legends and stuff. Your villagers harvest resources and build stuff, you recruit soldiers from your buildings and build watchtowers and walls and so on. It's kinda pointless me giving it a score because it's so old but if you're fond of strategy games from this era and you liked Age of Empires or games of that style then I'd definitely recommend it.

Thought my computer (which runs new games fine) was broken but nope, everyone has had this problem since 2014, and i have yet to find a fix that works legit...besides i dont feel like i need to spend hours to tweek my computer to play a game my XP could have run np.

												Age of Mythology is a timeless RTS where players use their devotion and skill to ruin their enemies. It features a selection of Major Gods to choose from and then a series of Minor Gods to select as you advance through the ages, increasing the technologies and favour bestowed upon you. From humble beginnings with villagers struggling to gather food in the Archaic Age to armies of heroes, mythical creatures and human soldiers striding through vast empires in the Mythic Age, Ensemble Studios created a masterful entry into the 'Age of Empires' series that commands respect. Unfortunately, this rendition of the game is not the work of Ensemble Studios. In Age of Mythology: Extended Edition, the developers have criminally neglected it, this old masterwork riddled with connectivity issues and bugs that render it near-unplayable that weren't in the game before. The new Chinese civilisation, albeit well-designed mechanically, suffers from nearly all of its units being cheap re-textures of existing assets. If you can find a copy of the original game, there's an active community on there using a program to play online called ""Voobly."" So, if you wish to try Age of Mythology, that would be my recommendation. Try and cirvumvent this so-called ""Extended Edition"" if you can.In conclusion, this is a game many of us remember fondly. In the state it's currently in however, I'm sorry to say that it's better left alone until its current developers show it some more care.			"

												     tl;dr- Don't buy this game until the company that picked it up publicly apologizes for their bad buisness practices and actually fixes them.     Okay, this is coming from someone who owned AoMG back when it was still run by ESO. It was one of my favorite games, with tons of hours of content. It had a massive modding, and map making support and a huge number of people took advantage of this. I would always rebuy it because I wasn't paying 10$ for one game, I was paying 10$ for an infinite number. That praise isn't even mentioning the base game, with a large number of civilizations and different strategies for each. Age of Mythology Gold is an excellent game and I strongly recommend you pick it up.      The Extended Edition that steam sells is not. There has been a little bit of confusion as to who actually is running the servers and support for the Extended Edition, although the latter may be a bit of a misnomer as Age of Mythology Extended Edition is rife with errors, bugs, and inconsisntencies. There are a kalidescope of problems that can occur during a game session to cause it to crash, from disconnections (which effect a single person) to desync. For the most part the cult following on Steam has bore these burdens with resignation. They make jokes at the expense of the servers and MS Ryzon (Ex-Developer for The Extended Edition) is actually featured as a boss in one scenario. The bosses' talent? He cause lag and steals money.      We were however content to have a medium which we could play our game on once again even if this medium was buggier than an anteater's lunch infected with crabs. This changed with the recent release of the Tale of the Dragon DLC. For 10$, one could unlock the Chinese Civilization. The quality of this expansion is such, that MOST players believe it simply to be a monotized mod for the game, and a poorly done one at that. The mod plays like already existing civilizations and brings little unique to the table. What it does bring however, is a host of new errors to the game. Chat in pregame lobbies no longer work, desyncs have become far more common, and players are constantly reminded by game breaking pop-up ads to purchase the expansion pack every time a player of the Chinese Civilization does, well, anything.       The most serious problem however has appeared. Custom games no longer appear on the list of available games as they are constantly being ""retreived"". This has rendered the largest attraction to the AoM experience completely unplayable. When I went to report this error to the support page, I found it broken. The Support page. Purchasing DLC is still entirely functional but attempting to to get game fixing support is impossible due to a broken link. That's the real reason for this review.The reason the player base is so frustrated isn't the errors in the game, it's the complete contempt of the paying consumers that is ultimately driving players from this game. I've asked dozens of people in the base if they have a favorable opinion of the hoster of this game. Not one single person has a favorable opinion or at very least neutral opinion of this game's hoster. The real kicker? This game was hosted 10 years ago by Ensemble Studios Online (from the makers of Halo Wars) and ran much smoother then. A company that has since collapsed was objectively more sucessful than both Steam and Skybox when it comes to smoothly running this game.    SkyBox, if you're reading this. You need to apologize to the players of this game for bad support, bug fixes and a DLC that has only exacerbated the problem. AoM is not a difficult game to run, and it has a lot to offer to all bases. But if your inability to fix basic game errors keeps driving off old players, you'll end up with a game that has no replayablity whatsoever especially when compared to the new generation of turn-based strategy.

												Don't by this piece of rubbish game. I will say it IS fun WHEN IT WORKS. Online games desync about 50% of the time, at various points in the match. Considering some of these matches are RANKED, or take ONE TO TWO HOURS to play, it is frustrating when it ""desyncs"" an hour into a good match.The verdict: don't buy. You'll just end up frustrated like me.PS: google search of ""age of mythology desync issue"" yields several threads of complaints back in 2013 and 2014. This issue must have been going on for a while, and it is still not fixed in 2016. Don't waste your $7 unless you want to play a glitchy game or the single-player campaign.			"

It's not just a small upgrade to an already solid product, it's a vast improvement built upon a solid foundation.All the old bugs that ruined the game have been squashed, the game itself comes bundled with the expansion and a host of new features.

												This is a bit of a mixed bag here... Age of Mythology was one of the best, if not the best, real time strategy games of all time.  The expansion was incredible, and the extended edition adds some really cool stuff (the day/night cycle is beautiful!)  But to release a 12 year old game for $30 and not bother to fix bugs before releasing it?  The word scam comes to mind...  What possible explanation could there be for 'rushing' the re-release of a game from a dozen years ago?  If it were only Steam integration issues, it'd be less shameful, but things like memory leaks and texture issues should have fixed BEFORE charging anyone money for it.  I'd wait until they fix more bugs and it goes on sale for 75% off.  That said, if the thought of playing a modernized version of such a spectacular game is just too tempting to wait on, you won't be disappointed.  I haven't found the bugs to be too bad and the Steam Workshop is, as always, full of amazingness and growing quickly.			"

												My playtime on steam doesn't even begin to touch the amount of playtime I ahve in this since I used to own the game on disk waaaay back in the day [I can probably still find it if I really tried too] But if you like RTS then you should absolutely get this- if you don't already have it. It's a fantastic game and one that even someone not super good at RTS can enjoy [IE: Me. I'm so bad I have to play everything on easy. Eventually I'll get better.] The campain is incredible in my opinion, I enjoy it immesily. It's a interesting way to make the player try every civilization- AND the story ain't awful if I'm being honest. I mean I didn't buy this game for the story, that was just a super awesome added bonus. I mean if you had to point out the flaws it may as well bethat yes the graphics are dated. It looks like it hasn't aged very gracefully, even with touched up graphics. Even so I find the graphics charming, they're simple enough to get the point across and they do that fairly well [I mean sometimes it's funny for a character to scream in a cutscene and their expression doesn't change. Maybe that's just me.] One of the only frustrating things is that the AI can be a bit buggy sometimes least in my efforts. Maybe I really do just suck at the game. And this is incredibly minor but those sayings that the units will yell when they're selected and moved do get old pretty fast. It's a minor complaint though, the game is still super worth it. [Be prepared to hear BUT before I let this get super long! Definitely get the game if you're a fan of RTS! Or Mythology! Or you really wanna check out something that's pretty darn fun. I love this game and I know I've rambled to my friends about it enough. I will add: I never played online. That seems to be another major complaint from people. As someone who does suck at the game I'm not thinking of trying it soon. But, everything outside that seems pretty awesome to me! 10/10 would recommend to all.			"

												I remember the original game very fondly from my childhood and I'm very glad they haven't messed around with it too much. The biggest issue with the original was the broken online multiplayer system which I'm more than happy to say has been fixed with the Steam integration. Amazing game, 10/10.			"

												Great game, love it even more than the older version especially with the addition of online multiplayer. I found it easy to get hooked on having had prior experience but new users beware- it's a tough learning curve. If you're thinking about buying this game I'd play some games against AI before you try online play.			"

												I'm a AoM veteran, this is pretty much just a graphics overhaul with the DLC installed, squashed most bugs and with servers. Since ESO was disconnected by Microsoft  the classic AoM can only be played with gameranger, which odes not contains a very wide variety like it used to on the in-game matchmaking system.I did like this port and I didn't have any issues other than poor framerate (even though i can play most games on mid-high with 60 fps) and the fact that people aren't doing those fun multiplayer games anymore (like cyclops throwing minigame, minotaurus arena, rpg scenarios, tower defenses, which i miss a lot :'( )  I also feel like they could have made better improvements like adding community mods (rotate buildings, more maps, etc.) or added a new campaign or game mode, but it's okay cause it's got workshop plugged into it, which saves the time and effort of installing mods.  But anyway, i only bought it cause it was on sale, I wouldn't spend 30 dollars on this even though I love the classic game :/TL;DR: It's pretty much a graphics overhaul and bug squashing, buy it only if you miss playing ranked or if you like to play LAN with friends, it's not worth 30 dollars though.

												A brilliant tribute to the original, the extended edition is a must-have for any RTS fan. Improvements such as steam integration and native multiplayer are as much fantastic additions as the recently enhanced lighting and graphics effects. With a simple tutorial for new players and three immersive campaigns, I intend on spending as many hours on this improved edition as I did on the original in my childhood. I would recommend this title to anyone interested in mythology because of the in-depth encyclopedia of classical history as well as anyone looking for a RTS with both a competitive and fun online multiplayer and single player options.

												Pros: All of your age of mythology goodness in one nice little box. No problems playing on newer OS.Cons: Way too much for an old game. Wait till it’s on sale.If you've never played AOM before you're in for a treat; all of your favorite Mythological Gods, Heros and Monsters slugging it out in oldschool RTS style. The addition of steam achievements encouraged me to change up my play style and try new things and gave me some shiny so that everyone can see I spend way too much time playing games. The modding community is small but has a couple good little gets if you care to take the time. The best part is that the online community is there, if you want to play with your buddies or get ♥♥♥♥ canned by a stranger you have that option. "

												I've played the game quite a bit, and never run in to any of the bugs everyone is talking about. I've played pre-made matches with real-life friends, matchmaking with random people, plenty of skirmishes against the AI, and the game has always held up just fine. Which is shocking, really, considering my laptop struggles to play most games, new or old. I've probably had fewer issues playing AoM than any other game. Which is just to say that the ""game-breaking"" bugs are not as widespread as some of the negative reviews may lead you to believe.It's a fun classic-style RTS with an interesting theme, plenty of faction/sub-faction variety, and the kind of easy-to-learn hard-to-master strategic-depth you'd expect out of a good strategy game. A solid 9/10.			"

												An RTS that marked my life as a gamer...We all have that first game we spent hours and hours without end, the game that took us into PC gaming or any kind of gaming for that matter, for me, that was Age of Mythology, I spent a lot of time just playing matches against the AI, I might be blinded by nostalgia and miss some of the flaws of the game, but the remake stands up to my expectations.Including the expansion is great, it has some of the most interesting mechanics of the game, you know, the part that makes it less of a Age of Empires reskin and more of it's own thing. The graphic updates are as nice as you'd expect for a game like this, it doesn't look ""stunning"" or whatever, it's still the same game with HD textures on top of it (some of them look amazing tho, water and lava were pretty ugly back in the day), shadows are nicer and there's antive widescreen, full HD support. My only drawback would be the achievements... stuff like ""play 1000 online games"" isn't as much of a challenge as it is a 400 hour grind fest... even though some of them are hard and interesting (defeating 11 enemy armies alone makes for some epic fights), workshop maps also offer a lot of variety to it, as well as the map editor.I'll reccomend it to any RTS fan looking for some epic, simple combat, as well as fans of Greek, Egyptian and Nordic myths who want some representation in gaming.

												A classic game, very nostalgic to play. The graphics have been entirely revamped, and it looks fresh and new. However, even at max settings, some of the textures are extremely dodgy. The game also seems to take up quite a lot of processing power compared to other games. However, this is only a minor detail, and I feel that the gameplay (especially with friends) more than makes up for this.Overall, extremely solid game, with a few minor bugs9/10P.S: Windows XP IS NOT SUPPORTED.

												I have owned the original AoM since it's release and it is one of my favourite games. I never had the Titans expansion so that's why I bought this remake/Extended Edition/whatyouwannacallit. Visuals are great and music is still memorable. Campaign keeps you well occupied but the objectives are just repetitive sometimes. You usually start with a few villagers and your task is to destroy enemys camp. Repeat that and repeat it again. Still I keep coming back because the story is very good for a strategy game, as you could expect from AoE series. Maps in classic skirmish and campaign modes are also often very detailed and so it encourages you to scout every black spot to find hidden relics which can help you with your mission.The myth units bring a nice new twist to the old RTS formula but matches dont become a Minotaur spamfest as myth units are usually much more expensive than regular human units. Famous folklore heroes like Hercules and Achilles are also there and they take mythic beasts down like the bosses they are. Everything is pretty nice and balanced like a rock-paper-scissors game.Gods from old greek, egyptian and nordic mythologies play a major part in game. Every civilization has 3 main gods and they all have six minor gods who give you different kind of god powers like meteorite rain, ability to mind control monkeys or making your villages to gather food faster (lame!). A well used god power can turn a game upside down but they can be used only once so when and where to use them is critical. If you already own AoM and it's expansions don't bother buying this as theres very little new to offer for oldtimers. But if you don't have AoM what are you waiting for? This game is accessible for newcomers and offers a fair challenge for hardened strategy veterans. Buy it and love it!			"

												As a kid, this was the first game I ever played. I would spend hours at a time playing it. When I saw that it was up on Steam, I was thrilled. I immediately bought it. The community is fairly small, but is close knit, and great maps are coming from the original AoM title back onto here. If you're on the fence about this game, take my word for it and by it. There are still some issues, but those are minor and you can hop right back into the game. The campaign is one of the best I have ever played, and creating your own game type/map is one of the best things that a video game can offer. Not only that, but you can gain info about the civilization that you are playing as AND get info on units like the minotaur, cyclops, and fire giants, just name a few. And what's NOT great about destroying your enemy with a bunch of giants spewing fire and ice?			"

The majority of the people on the game are terrible. There are so many bugs now, that its not even worth playing at this stage. You will desync the majority of the games, and the games that you don't will be quick. The only way to get a good game is to find friends that are at your skill level. To be honest, I only recommend this game to those who will take the time to deal with the bugs. Hopefully, the AOM team haven't given up on us, and are working to fix these bugs, but it doesn't really seem like they are. Good luck, and if you get the game, I hope you enjoy			"

												First of all, I've never played AoM or AoE or anything like this before, neither any strategy game like this. A friend of mine wanted to buy it and asked me if I wanted to share the four pack. I agreed and plled two more friends in... I loved playing Dota 2, but now, even when I miss racing around the map as Bloodseeker, I'm more willing to play AoM, because I loved it. I always play with a friend of mine, one of the two I pulled in, and he had already played it long eons ago, so he taught me the basics and we play cooperatively, almost like one civilization with two players... except our civilizations are never the same.For issues about connection, I admit there are some, but issues from Dota 2 are far worse than these, and mostly, I know it isn't the game's fault, but my friend's poor connection.The only real problem is... this game is just a ilttle expensive.... just the price to eat for a month... depending on how much you eat of course.So I suggest: put it on your wishlist and wait for steam's crazy discounts. The 4-pack we shared was for a bit more than $10.00 ... divided by four people. Plus, my share of the price was given as birthday gift.			"

												As far as I can tell, it feels like the original game patched to have mordern-ish graphics with a few bonuses. For those like me who have played the original and looked to this expecting something more refined, even if nothing new, you came to the wrong place! Most of the bugs in the original seem to still be around. I personally bought it to play with my friends online, but that is probably the most laughable thing there is. The application seems to use a client-side host with the steamworks intergration to connect players to eachothers servers. This alone isn't a bad thing, but the server seems so poorly optmized it feels that even the best of IPS will probably still have pretty bad lag. Simply put, steaming a YouTube video in HD is probably less taxing on your internet. Probably the worse part is the game has MEMORY LEAKS! Numerious times have myself and other players I know had there entire progress eradicated because of a memory allocation error which completely crashes the game. Rule of thumb in software development: critical bugs should not exist in finished products. Crashing to you desktop with a ""Memory System Error"" pop up is less than graceful and definitely counts as a critical bug.			"

												Runs a bit slow if you have all the effects on and not a fast computer but otherwise, its one of my favorite games from my childhood and I absolutely adore that they made it look more beautiful than it is. I also love being able to play online just in case a LAN game doesn't work out for my friends and I.			"

												I have been playing this game since it came out in 2002 and I was just a little girl.  This is definitely a classic game and is great for all ages.  The game is a great strategy multiplayer starter.  The single player is also fun to do.  I highly recommend this game for everyone from young to old.Pros: Easy to learn with tutorial and campaign mode.  Fun multiplayer that is customizable.  Twitch ready.  Nice sound effects and music.Cons: Old graphics -- so don't expect 4kUHD when playing this game.-mahalz143sinta-			"

												This is why I don't like Steam reviews; You can't have a middling opinion. Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is, at it's heart, the same good game we loved to play years ago. Pitting (mostly) real world civilizations with their own mythological flairs against each other to have a winner takes all brawl. Seeing cyclops throw men around like ragdolls or the villagers of an enemy die when you summon the cold horrors of Fimbulwinter will never get old. The problem is; The price and the DLC. I've heard MANY complaints over the multiplayer, but I don't play the multiplayer. Carrying on...The price of AoM: EE is far too much unless it's on sale. What (exactly) came into the brains of the people who fixed the price is beyond me. I can only assume someone fell asleep at the switch as this game should always be a cool $10 at most. Now onto the DLC; It reeks of mediocrity and is basically a fanmade piece, and not a particularly good fanmade one either. Look at the wonder that have been done with Wars of iberty for Age of Empires 3 to see what I mean; It's basically a small team of guys who poured themselves into research, polish, and creativity and came out with a winner. The guys who made Tales of the Dragon came up with a load of uninspired units and gardens, which are like many mini Vaults of Plenty (An end-game God power that nets you a trickle of resources; See how that can be overpowered)?The game itself is great, what they ask for it and what (new) things they've offered isn't. Don't get suckered in for full price, wait for a sale like I did.			"

												Alot of people have been having trouble launching AOM, If you click play, and you get a quick loading and then nothing happens you'll most likely need to re-install the game, and install Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 or better. This should help. The game if fun. Nostalgia. A little laggy when it comes to big games but it's an old game so. "

												With an enjoyable multiplayer game mode and good graphics I would recommend Age of Mythology. Although besides multiplayer this game would be a complete borre and waste of time and money. I myself am not the biggest fan of these build your own world and uprgrade it type games. I do enjoy it but just not thoroughly enjoy it. I'm pretty mixed with this game but it does offer some fun, just not enough of it to keep me entertained for long periods of time.			"

												This is an old classic which needed to be on Steam when it first came out in 2002.It is a unique take on popular mythologies and it has many game modes .Singleplayer campaigns are interesting,multiplayer still needs some work since game lags in online play.i like this game especially i like the included god powers and updated graphics.the only minus if you can call it that way is when you zoom in you can see that graphics is still dated but that is understandable since this is an older game.Music is awesome ,graphics looks better then some of the newer games if you put all on high details.Thumbs up and play this with your friends:)			"

												First of all, I've never played AoM or AoE or anything like this before, neither any strategy game like this. A friend of mine wanted to buy it and asked me if I wanted to share the four pack. I agreed and plled two more friends in... I loved playing Dota 2, but now, even when I miss racing around the map as Bloodseeker, I'm more willing to play AoM, because I loved it. I always play with a friend of mine, one of the two I pulled in, and he had already played it long eons ago, so he taught me the basics and we play cooperatively, almost like one civilization with two players... except our civilizations are never the same.For issues about connection, I admit there are some, but issues from Dota 2 are far worse than these, and mostly, I know it isn't the game's fault, but my friend's poor connection.The only real problem is... this game is just a ilttle expensive.... just the price to eat for a month... depending on how much you eat of course.So I suggest: put it on your wishlist and wait for steam's crazy discounts. The 4-pack we shared was for a bit more than $10.00 ... divided by four people. Plus, my share of the price was given as birthday gift.			"

												Dispite not having a lot of hours on this game in Steam, I have played several hours and hours, I remember playing this games for more then 10 hours straight back in the day. This game is absolutly amazing, even these days, the gameplay will just blow your mind away and keep you playing and trying diferent ways to develop your stratagy. I know that the graphics are simple, the music, and wahtever else, but the gameplay quality is great. Simple enough to keep you playing and not even realize that 3 hours have passed. And for the record, the mojority of what I know about greek mythology is on this game, and also the Percy Jackson novels. Lol.			"

												This game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. I thought that it would be an amazing way to get people to play the amazing game that the original AOM was. This is terrible, the game looks worse than the original did, the online is a fps dropfest and it's laggy as hell. Do not waste your money on this garbage!			"

												As far as I can tell, it feels like the original game patched to have mordern-ish graphics with a few bonuses. For those like me who have played the original and looked to this expecting something more refined, even if nothing new, you came to the wrong place! Most of the bugs in the original seem to still be around. I personally bought it to play with my friends online, but that is probably the most laughable thing there is. The application seems to use a client-side host with the steamworks intergration to connect players to eachothers servers. This alone isn't a bad thing, but the server seems so poorly optmized it feels that even the best of IPS will probably still have pretty bad lag. Simply put, steaming a YouTube video in HD is probably less taxing on your internet. Probably the worse part is the game has MEMORY LEAKS! Numerious times have myself and other players I know had there entire progress eradicated because of a memory allocation error which completely crashes the game. Rule of thumb in software development: critical bugs should not exist in finished products. Crashing to you desktop with a ""Memory System Error"" pop up is less than graceful and definitely counts as a critical bug.			"

												I have been playing this game since 2005 and it was nice to finally play this game again with new textures. Of course there are also a few things that were added. Steam Workshop is one of them and it makes downloading mods much easier. Twitch was also built into the game to make live streaming the game easier. Day and night was also added to give a realistic feel to the game when playing on a map for a long time. The graphics on the game are good along with a few other things but I found a few things to be a bit too polished. Overall I found Age of Mythology EX to be a great game if you are into RTS games and enjoy a good story line.			"
