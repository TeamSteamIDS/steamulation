												Great game for the true Speedway fan. So far I really like itPositives:+ Great graphics.+ Commentary can be silly at times, but it's funnier this way.+ It's hard. Even in arcade mode. You're bound to crash a lot when you first start out.+ Stadiums are truly phenomenal and you can feel the atmosphere of the croud.+ Bike setup, different traction at different parts of the track throughout the raceNegatives:- My Dual Shock 4 controller (that works with every other game) will not work with this title when racing (otherwise it works fine in menus).- Lackluster career mode. I wish you could create your own driver, go through SGP qualifications and then advance on to become the best. Or at least use your own customized driver- It's about the 2015 season which is well over by now. Maybe a 2016 DLC?			"

												If you are into racing games or really like speedway this game is a lot of fun. I would not recommend it to anyone else becase of the difficulty and it can be completed in a few days. Most people should just wait for it to be on sale to check it out.			"

												Being a speedway fan (hence the profile picture) I have been waiting for a game like this for a long long time. It is so much better than the ride and sliders game on the un supported web. Its hard, I haven't won a race yet, but I have some amazing cutbacks and round the outside bend 2 and 3. It can be tedious but it is very very good. I suppose I might not have won a race becuase im playing as Nicki Pedersen... But thats just my opinion. If you are a speedway supporter or even rider I reccomend the game!(And just for the record Eastbourne Eagles rule!)			"

												It's a fun game, but not easy!The winner of every round is determined in a lot of small, thrilling and sweaty heats of 4 laps.And you need to earn money to be able to look after your bike.Buy better parts to be more competitive, but also to repair the bike after every round.Parts that degrade or breaks in the heats can be replaced if you have spare parts.Nice graphics, but I do miss visual customization of your clothes and the bike, would also have been nice to be able to create your own rider..And the sound, especially the commentator is extremely repetitive!!

												Such amazing little game! Never been a fan of Speedway but i can tell you, after playing this i now love the sport!Graphics looks great. Just wish there would be more mud flying around and impair your vision and making a mess of things, but no biggy.The bikes are great fun to ride and it feels really good slinging it round the corners!I would like to see a greater emphasis on the career mode for the next game. Like creating your own rider and work your way up from a lower classed Grand Prix.All in all i can't recommend this game enough for any fan of two wheelers!/Hugs and Kisses			"

												Well, I'm a huge speedway fan. I've met with Greg Hancock in person three times, with the whole USA Team two times including Billy Hamill and Sam Ermolenko. I also had the pleasure to meet with Nicki Pedersen, Jason Crump, Hans Andersen, Martin Smolinski and many great riders from Poland to the Czech Republic, from Germany to Hungary, from Croatia to Denmark. I have a wall at home dedicated to this sport and jeez, my window looks to the Speedway Arena of Miskolc. So yes, I know a bit about this sport.I play with speedway games since Extreme Speedway Challange which came out before the first official FIM Speedway Grand Prix 1 in 2000. I prayed many times that someday there will be a great and enjoyable speedway game out there. And here it is, the FIM Speedway Grand Prix 15 is far the best game in this genre and a must have for all speedway fans. To be honest Speedway Liga was great too but the riding experience is far the best in this new game.The only thing I miss is a career mode where you can have you own driver and bike. The best would be if they can implement some leagues and SEC or SWC too but I know this isn't so easy because of the licensing issues.Nevertheless hats down to Softplanet, they created the best speedway game which is a true rival for MXGP and other motorsport games. Well done, good job! And never forget while you play, no brakes, no gears, no fear! ;-)			"

												I don't usually review games but this deserves one, the Fim Grand Prix series has certainly come along way with this one compared to the older ones, but this just goes to a whole new levelI did however have difficulties getting the game to start but after a few updates on graphics drivers it soon powered upI'm not going to go into depth with the game but it is certainly a must buy for the avid speedway fan like myself and also for the people who enjoy racing games you have two different controlling modes Arcade and Simulation which arcade is pretty easy and after falling off the bike over 100 times to get use to the simulation setting and finally complete 4 laps  I was ready to to attempt the Grand Prix I chose The Grin because Come on who doesn't love Greg! Graphics are awesome and the bike decals and the l  kevlars match that of the real thing!I do recommend not going straight into the races without first practicing and getting the set up on your bike just right yeah the track changes after every 4 heats but the racing line doesn't change that much that extra 10psi in your tyres can make all the difference from having a comfy win or a battle to score a single point. Unlike the older games they've finally sorted out the mechanics of going into corners where as before your bike would be well over a 45° angle before it realises it need to kick the back wheel out on this it's smooth I could write more but tbh you're best bet is to just buy the game and experience it for yourself!Good job Techland!!

												I've been waiting for a Speedway game for a long time that actually did justice to the sport and finally it has arrived.I purchased FIM 03 and 04 some time ago hoping they would capture the feeling somewhat but they were really lacking and very buggy so I purchased this one thinking the experience could be somewhat similar. Thankfully it wasn't and the devs have done a really good job of capturing some of the atmosphere.The sound of the bikes as they get ready at the tapes, the way the camera gets in there for the line up really adds to the feeling of a real race. The bike models, riders and stadiums look superb although there is a little bit of blur on background objects that looks like motion blur is working even when the game is still, but once you get riding these things don't matter at all.The only thing the devs didn't capture is the smell, it's such a unique smell at the speedway with the gravel and the fuel mixed with the sounds of the bikes but we're not getting the smells until we get smellavision. But saying that the atmosphere of the game does bring back those memories of being there.I would love to have seen more content like the leagues and subsequently a lot more riders. I would love to have seen some classic riders put into the game like Ole Olsen, Ivan Mauger, Peter Collins, Phil Crump and a more recent classic like Tony Rickardsson etc etc and also some little touches that would have made it feel more complete like riding into and out of the pits, somewhere I spent a lot of time as a kid at Coventry (or Brandon) Bees.I've been to most of the stadiums in the UK to watch the Bees but now I live in the south in order to get my Speedway fix I follow Poole Pirates but not as much as I'd like to. It's a very odd feeling when they face off against the Bees though :)It's not an easy game to master, far from it, but the simulation mode is where you'll get the best feeling of actually riding the bikes and being out there on the track. Persevere on simulation and you'll get a surprising amount of satisfaction from even finishing a race due to the difficulties of holding a line and finding good grip around the bends. You'll find yourself crashing into the barriers more often than not for the first few hours but the hardest part is riding with three other riders who want the same thing as you do, to win. After a while you'll get used to what you need to do to avoid the other riders and to get good speeds out of the bends and compete.Default settings for your bike may have it set a little to quick with lots of torque and high rpm so I would advise turning both these down quite a bit while you are learning the game. About half of what they are set on default will help you to finish the races and still compete with the other riders. I also found putting the AI onto Hard difficulty was a help when it came to staying on the track. They stay at a good speed and are subsequently easier to avoid yet are still beatable with good riding.If the devs keep on improving this game then it will become a classic for fans of Speedway and hopefully over the years to come we'll see more content added. For me it was well worth the full price admission.			"

												I don't write many reviews, but I feel like I have to for this one.  The lack of advertising and the fact that it's a new series may cause some people to overlook this one, which is a BIG mistake.  If you like racing games at all, especially if you like a good challenge, this game is essential.     You don't have to be a fan of the sport: in fact, this game is already very close to making me a fan.  Basically, it's a simple game but there's always more you can do to improve.Pros:The gameplay is just awesome.  The controls are nearly perfect once you get used to them, and once you get used to the handling, it quickly becomes a classic case of easy to learn, tough to master.Sounds: the game doesn't blow me away here but the sounds are more than enough to draw me inGraphics: pretty good, only real problem is lens flare is overused, but every game does thatHandling: very good, it's approachable but you quickly learn to be cautious with the throttle, especially if you start to get a wheelie or touch the wallTracks: This is where the game really shines, to me.  They probably could have gotten away with building one or two tracks and changing the scenery, but every track is different and needs to be approached differently.  The track even changes realistically from one heat to the next.Cons:Learning curve is steep for new players (just getting around the track is a challenge until you figure it out)setup options are very limited and not well explainedNo rider customizationNo career mode, just a season modeVery unforgiving if you go off track, I'd like the game to give you the option to let off the gas and slow down if you go off track, so you only get penalized if you get an advantage from it.  I don't know if that would be realistic though, don't know the sport well enoughBottom line: This is about as realistic as a game like this could be made, when few if any gamers have any experience with this kind of racing.  This is a very good first try, and there's huge potential for them to improve in the next game, if there is one.I recommend that anyone who is a fan of racing games buy this game, on sale or not.  If it's on sale, it's a must buy.			"

												I'm a big speedway fan and I've been waiting to play this since it was announced, and I had to wait a bit longer than most people as the game's release in Australia was delayed due to a wait for the age rating to be approved. Now that I've got the game and have played a few hours, I can say that I'm impressed with what I've seen so far. It's a lot better than the old FIM SGP 3 and 4 games. The graphics of everything are really good and the stadiums look great. I've only raced in a few but Tampere in particular looks really nice. The gameplay is good. It will take a bit to get used to how it works and when you first start playing, you'll crash quite a bit. Once you get right into it, you'll have a lot more fun with the game. The career/season mode isn't very deep but it's fun to play through and fight for GP wins and the world title. If you're a speedway fan (and you should be!) then I definitely recommend this game. It's great to finally have a new speedway game to play and the developers have done a great job with this one.			"

												Great fun, I'm a big fan of speedway and have purchased all previous speedway games on the PC - this is by far the best. Graphics and game play is great, although for attracting new fans it is basic and become very boring as there isn't a lot to do (very similar to the previous SGP games)Downside to the game is the decisions by the referee - ""caused a collision"" when no one has crashed, and also two riders get excluded for falling off in the first bend.Also, the game has been clearly manufactured for high spec computers - and although my PC is a good spec and has above the minimum requirements the game still runs slow (as I see a lot of users have the problem)It would be great if the makers of the game would release a PS4 / Xbox 1 version of the game (as promised!) before people lose interest in the game! A MAC version of the game would be great too!(4/5 stars)			"

												Hello,first of all I have to say, thank you for this game, it will bring me trough the winter :-). Really cool game.Here are my critics, positive and negativ:+ cool and awesome graphics, a lot of great detail in the game (stadium, bikes, drivers)+ really good game performance+ no bugs in menues or game found, or nothing is obvious (1 found, see bottom)+ great sounds, sometimes a bit tinny- the game loop is really short, yes you can choose a driver, but all are the same skill wise, body height, body, physics, knowlegde, etc.- no ""create own driver""- look into the box area, with all mechanics- no league racing- really bad rule set. when someone crashes in the first corner, normally all 4 rider go back to the restart, not here- when you are involved in a colition, someone it touching you and you fall, you are disqualified. this causes a lot frusttration- mentoring function for how to setup the bike. the standard (F) configuration of the bike is always the best, pretty strange- more voices, eg. from Kelvin Tatum, after some races you can predict everything ^^*Bug found: Single Heat, picked Tai Woffinden, no matter what happens, after crash or 4 laps > Re-run (loop?). Earning no stars(?) to unlock further races / stadiums.Looking forward to the next updates, season 2016 or even 2014 would be cool ;-)Thanks & Regards,Jan "

												We this is a surprise now normally when I get sent a game like this that I’ll be honest had never heard of and have no interest in the real sport then I try my best to palm off the review on someone else ASAP. But unfortunately for me no one else on the team wanted the review either, so I thought it was time to man up and review the game myself.So as you can all tell by the pictures it’s a Speedway racing game, now what astonished me was that while I love Forza and Gran Turismo my heart will always go to games like Sega Rally and Ridge Racer. So arcade is what I love and after seeing a trailer for this it looks like Techland had something to do with the development and man was Nailed a much underrated game, although when you see the Steam page it says developed by SoftPlanet so again I’m not sure who did what.So aside from a little lack of knowledge from me time to actually load the game up. This is when it comes apparent that the developer has put a lot of time into this, the game looks stunning on the intro mixed with live action of some fast racing and for someone that has never seen the sport itself even I was excited. So on the menu you have the standard options for a racing game, Season ’15, Single Heat, Single Event, Training, and then you have the options and Driving Mode where you change from Arcade to Simulation handling. Now I do really enjoy a good simulation game iRacing was a joy for a few months a while back for me. But wow I had trouble just getting around 2 corners in the simulation settings.So Arcade it is then for the review, and even in arcade man is this one hard game to get your head around, so I’ll cover what makes sim and arcade different and the simple thing is in sim you get given much more control to every part of the race. Here you have to engage the clutch before accelerating or you stall the engine, you also have full control of the rider’s weight with the right analogue stick so when you do accelerate you need to hold forward or your rider will fall off the bike backwards after doing a wheelie.But back to the arcade setup you don’t have to worry about the position of the rider and anything apart from turning and accelerating the bike itself, but here lies another problem and its one the developer has aced the bike feels responsive but also extremely hard to positon where you want and need it to go during a race. Here is the fun while you are fighting with the controls of the bike trying to get the position on the track and also trying not to collide with the other 3 riders during each race, man it gets the blood pumping.So my PC is not the greatest ever and the game runs flawlessly on my setup the game looks great the bikes been the star of all the attention and the detail is simply stunning. Now I could have some nit-picks with the backgrounds but they look good and with them based on real locations the developers can’t just add buildings and background objects to make the game look better as they have to keep the locations looking like they should and they do just that.One of the better features during the races is that the circuit grip changes between each heat and you have a small track icon that shows where the best grip is per race, you also have a little management options built in the game as with each race things like the engine, tires and frame of the bike become damaged with use and you need to buy new items or repair the old ones to keep the bike from dying during a race.Now I will say the game is missing a good career mode but when you see the game is less than £20 you really can’t complain as the game plays so well, looks this good and is only missing a few little things to get it worthy of matching some of the so called big boys in this field.

												ENG:Yes, really interesting different motor racing game. The game has a lot of Indy Car and NASCAR game like that, this is driven around the orifice ring but, this game is much more interesting and more exciting to follow in real life.In fact, I own all the days approach larger game series of games and I like each of these, and each game version of the game has evolved and advanced, as well as genuine and changed for the better.The game allows all the way during the pre-competition period, the ability to adjust and tune the bike with new parts. The game includes content like any game presentation as the official race drivers and tracks.A very simple but challenging game that is every time you play the diffrence.This, therefore, very exceptional in the game for you. Referral!FIN:Kyllä, todella kiinnostava erilainen moottoriurheilu peli. Peli on paljon Indy Car tai Nascar pelin kaltainen että, tässä ajetaan rinkiä ympäri mutta, tämä peli on paljon kiinnostavampi ja jännittävämpi seurata myös tosielämässä.Itse omistan kaikki aikasemman peli sarjan pelit ja pidän jokaisesta näistä ja jokaisen peli version myötä peli on kehittynyt ja edistynyt sekä muuttunut aidompaan ja parempaan suuntaan.Peli mahdollistaa kaiken edeltävien tapaan mahdollisuuden kilpailukauden aikana säätää ja virittää pyörää uusillaosilla.

												well having only put 30hrs into this game i feel ive done alot in that time, the game is great for any fans or riders out there.it covers novices to hardened pro's in my opinion.its graphically beautiful and very enjoyablei get angry when i get wiped out in a bend and get excluded for it but i suppose alot of desisions go against the pro's tooyour out there trying to get a perfect score and wham! you get taken out and then excluded! WTF but again i kind of like this featurei like the fact the track physics change with every race, and that no 2 tracks race the same.some can be almost full throttle circles and the next will be long straights and tight bends so you need to take your time in the corners. any fan of speedway and racing games should buy this			"

												I've already played 13 hours scince the day it came out. This is nothing like any other speedway game. I personaly think it needs an update because Hancock rode into the back of me and fell of and i got excluded.			"

												Took a while to get used to, but now I am, loving it. Love watching speedway and this game is really good. Definitely get some practice in before racing. The key is to keep it nailed! I enjoy playing with the setups too, you need to, to get the best out of the bike at each track or you will be left behind.			"

												A game of what could have been. Pros-Graphics- That it's actually a speedway game-Gameplay is okCons- The rules-The audio-The customisability-The lack of podium and cut scenes during a grand prixFIM Speedway Grand Prix is definitely a game of what could have been, after years of waiting for another speedway game to be released on pc we are treated to this rushed work where the team seem to have focused on the beauty of the game rather than the actual gameplay itself. The graphics are good with all stadiums looking like their real life counterparts, the riders having the correct liveries, jerseys and helmet designs. However this is where the good stuff ends. The phyics engine isn't bad however riders either fall off to easily or don't fall off at all, and this, coupled with the terrible rules engine, make for a frustrating experience. The rules and refereeing of the game make me wonder if the team that built this game have ever watched a speedway meeting, with the non existence of first bend bunching and the constant wrong decisions for who is too blame for a crash. Many a time have I been chasing down a trophy or world championship only to be knocked off by another rider and been excluded myself. The sounds don't make the game any better with the players bike either being very quiet at the start or non existent at all, with the sounds being just an audio file when the bikes are at the tapes. The sounds do improve slightly but are slow to react to the player letting on and off the throttle or hitting the fence slightly. Other misses are the lack of podiums, celebrations, the abilities to do wheelies over the line and the customisabilty that have been brought in past titles such as FIM Speedway 4.Overall the game is a let down, with many things that could have been, in a title that feels rushed so it can be out nearer the end of the season. The only thing that puts it above other speedway gp titles is the graphics which are enjoyable to look at but don't make up for the failures in the rest of the gameplay. Yes it is a speedway game however expect nothing but frustation with this title.3/10			"

												Overly complicated, too many controls required. Not a fun racing game. Too much time wasted waiting for 'your turn' to race. Complete garbage. Will be requesting refund.			"
