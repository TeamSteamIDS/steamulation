Early Access Review
								24 February 2017WARNING: Potential AbandonwareMy original review is at the bottom of the page. I was going to wait a year to update this review, but the developers are spitting in the face of the community. I no longer feel comfortable recommending this game as they have managed to break the game to the point were the vast majority cannot play it. I have gotten my moneys worth out of this game. This review update is for those who are on the fence about buying it for the first time, to make an informed decision. I will update if the developers fix the game enough to make it playable before they abandon it ""temporarily"" to finish thier other project.Quotes are from a developers response to the community in the linked thread.http://steamcommunity.com/app/307880/discussions/1/135509823662604357/Now, moving on to the game. I agree the state that project is in not a disired one. I understand there is always frustration when ""Your game"" (aka Savage Lands) is not the priority. This is the second time they are abandoning Savage Lands to make a completely unrelated game ""Fury Road"" which has been named by the community as a specific build will not be a roll back option. Currently, we are also not planning on supporting the ""live version"" with more content......and refuse to rollback Savage Lands to a version that wasnt tottally broken, that the community as a whole requested because it was fun to play. I will think twice before even looking at another Signal Studios game in the future.Moving forward I will be spending more of my person time in the forums to either respond to or close and lock topics. The forum has rules and in this post only about 60% of you are following them. The developers are now entering the phase of comming into the steam forum page, and threatening to ban people/delete threads and posts that criticize the game ""to harshly"". 07 April 2016Game keeps improving with the move to unity 5 in both gameplay and visual appeal.  Almost to the point in the dev cycle of being worth the asking price as content is added and bugs are squashed on a weekly basis. The crafting system is really starting to get fleshed out and game progression is gear/ location centric. No levels in this game. You live by  fighting through to the next best metal ore nodes, to make the next set of armor/weapons. Food and heat are very important as you can and will starve/freeze to death if you dont watch the feedback meter. Needs balancing so combat isn't so extreme from on level of gear to the next  as you get one shoted in tin gear by the plague wovles when moving from the first to second islands, but overall good balance between risk/reward during fights. The one game breaker for me is the fact that you can escape any threat by just jumping up onto a rock. The AI pathing will have them running around said rock allowing you to stand in place and bow kite till dead.			"

Early Access Review
								The explosion of survival games in recent years has been fascinating to watch, because everyone has a different idea about what makes them appealing. There are some like Subnautica that go light on the survival elements to emphasize exploration and building in a vibrant world. Then there are others like The Long Dark that push you to learn and master the mechanics to survive in brutal conditions. Savage Lands appears to go in a third way, opposite the ones I just mentioned, and I'm not really sure that's the best direction to strike out in.Savage Lands casts you as an outcast, sent to the frozen reaches of not-Skyrim presumably to die. You can customize your waxy, lumpy character with mohawks and tribal tattoos before embarking upon your exile, but harbor no illusions of making Goku or Kanye West with the handful of options present. Once you arrive in the arctic wasteland you're given a laundry list of survival tasks that act as a tutorial, directing you to chop wood, gather stones, and hunt animals. It doesn't actually tell you HOW to do these things or WHERE to find them, but I was able to puzzle them all out in fifteen minutes or so.From there you're on your own. The landscape is helpfully dotted with ruins of shacks, cabins, and villages which you can repair with the right resources. This makes a good first goal once you find your footing, working your way up the extensive structure tree from workbenches to smelters in order to patch up your new home. In the meantime you'll have to attend to your survival, represented by two bisected gauges. The top one is health/temperature, restored with bandages and fire, and the bottom is stamina/hunger, restored by eating and not running around all willy-nilly. It's arranged in this way so that hunger and temperature can eat into your other resources if left unchecked, which becomes a major consideration in blizzards or on long treks.As you scavenge across the land you'll find notes scattered about that give bits of lore or hints at how features like armor work. You'll also find quite a few points of interest like ruined forts and towers that usually contain some loose tools to appropriate. The other thing you'll find are monsters, and in no short supply. Your starting area is mostly populated with rabbits, deer, and the occasional brittle skeleton that needs to be smashed. Travel more than a hundred meters in any direction, though, and you'll have wolves tearing your throat out. Preparation is a must for longer journeys, as just one tough foe getting the drop on you can spell disaster. They won't give up once they spot you, either, a fact I was distressed to learn after leading a wolf back to my camp.There's plenty more to be distressed about, too. Creatures in the world have some of the worst collision and hit detection I've ever seen, vibrating through rocks and walls and hitting you from a yard away. If you're not beating on monsters you'll probably be beating on mineral deposits, because mining is key to progression and takes a ridiculously long time to dig out anything more valuable than coal. Other resources like clay are bound to be a complete mystery unless you try literally everything or consult a wiki. And in a perfect example of how little quality-of-life there is here, a basic container to place in the world takes fairly advanced materials to make, meaning all your junk is going to be sitting in a pile in the snow for a few hours until you can finally craft a ♥♥♥♥ing wooden chest.I would be more willing to stick out the rough gameplay if the game had some other appeal, but it really, really does not. You may have noticed that the screenshots on the store page have a lot of similar daytime scenes. That's because this is probably the grayest game I've ever played, and that's counting stuff like LIMBO. The world is almost completely devoid of color; the snowfields are gray, the foliage is brownish-gray, the stonework is blueish-gray, even the monsters are all grays and browns. There's not much detail to the models either, and the animations tend to be slower and stiffer than you'd expect.There's certainly potential in Savage Lands, but it won't be realized without some major overhauls that probably aren't within the scope of the project. The visuals are a dreary mess and the progression is needlessly tedious and complicated. And even if you come to grips with that, you're likely to be eaten by a wolf or a dragon and spat out to the main menu. I get the appeal of open-world survival Skyrim but this is missing so many simple balance and accessibility elements that I don't know how you get there from here. If this game ever shapes up I'll revisit the frozen hells therein, but until then I have little interest in sticking it out.			"

Early Access Review
This is an EARLY ACCESS Review and I'll change it after the game is finished.  This is what I think of the game as it sits.Pros   The game runs great on my system.   Around 60fps on max settings (Specs on my Profile)  There's a decent amount to do.  A few different types of wildlife to kill and several different baddies as well as a dragon (Though I'm not sure you can kill the dragon yet, never tried)  The game in my opinion is beautiful.  It seems to be pretty solid at the moment.  I have yet to have a game crash with it and had very few bugs.  Only bugs I've had so far are invisible items when playing on others servers and trees glitching out when chopping, the tree would fall but there'd be another in its place that can't be chopped (Think both these bugs were fixed).  Crafting is really easy and getting the materials needed takes no time at all.  You can get in the game quick, build more tools, weapons and armor in no time.    Crafting buildings is easy as well.  Some are really quick, can build a basic house and fire pit in minutes.  The larger ones can take a little bit longer, like the townhall.  It has multi-player.  This type of game is fun for a while in single player and can keep some people content just playing single, but it also offers multi player with PvP and Non PvP servers (Hostile/Friendly) which just adds to the fun.  Having extra players (Up to 8 as of this review) helping you build towns and survive or to kill make this game well worth it.Cons   The game runs pretty good on my system, but sometimes I get fps drops.  Not terrible or unplayable, but noticable.  I think it happens when there seems to be a lot of loot on the ground when it snows.  That's when I've noticed it.  Mostly the game runs great though so a few times of it dropping like that doesn't really ruin the experience for me.  The combat is OK, real time, but still needs a decent amount of tweaking.  Some things you can circle and barely get hit while attacking it and others can still hit you when you aren't nearly close enough for a hit yourself.  Skeles and I believe a few others need to be tweaked a bit, they can be pretty far from you and as long as they attempt to swing at you, you get hit.  Doesn't have dedicated servers yet (Maybe never) so when the host decides to leave, everything you did on  his server is gone, except the loot you have on you when he does.  Who knows if he plans on coming back either, so basically when you join someones server, you're mainly helping them build their buildings, unless you're there to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and steal their items or just harvest materials and leave.   I don't mind joining others servers though, I like helping out and I've met some great people doing so.  Has a max of 8 players. IMO  I think this game should at least offer 16 players or more.  Needs to have more buildings to craft.  There's really not that many to craft and they bug out easily, meaning that you  have to be on perfectly flat ground, otherwise half your building is floating.  This could be solved by allowing players to terraform or by putting a decent sized foundation on them,  so when the building is on a hill, theres a bottom still.  As we speak, there's no foundation.  Really needs a map, or at least offer a way to craft one or something similar.  The compass doesn't really help as much as I thought it would (Could be I'm just an idiot though)  There's a decent amount of gear to craft at the moment, but couldn't hurt to have a little more.  For those of you who think there's only a few items, you unlock a lot more after playing a while.  This really isn't a bad thing, I just think it could use a bit more. When I think of more items I think should be here, I'll add them.  But for my experience with the game so far, this is all I have.  The game is pretty solid and offers a decent amount of fun so really, I don't have much to complain about.I'll be adding some gameplay videos in a while as well. "

Early Access Review
								This game has real promise! I have spent the last two weeks investing my life into this game. I have become a part of the wildy frustrating cyclical nature of life and death as I attempt to survive in this unforgiving landscape. As a building game I think the interface is great and easy to navigate. It is one that keeps me excited about running out to face the wild so that I can gather what is neccesary to survive. As a ""Skyrim""-esque type of adventure/combat game, I think we have something really special here. The terrain, and varying enemies seen so far provide a challenging and rewarding experience that really keeps players involved. Following the sun and being able to commit to terrain association is a life saver in this and I wouldnt have it any other way. Most importantly, It is the nature of the team dynamic that I have found most interesting in this game. While going at alone is very much a possibility, It is in teamwork that I have found a truly rewarding experience. NAvigating the forests with your friends, staying within line of sight and having constant communication makes for a play through unlike anything i've played in a long time. The need to cooperate in order to survive is illustrated quite well. I've found the utilization of team play to be the most important dynamic of an excellent play through.Things are only getting better with time. Aside from a few hiccups here and there as expected. I would suggest to any and all readers to go ahead and take a chance on this game if it is even remotely in your interests. I assure you that it will be a game that you will always remember, and with the time and work currently being put into the title, It will become the new standard for what we want in games.			"

								PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE EVEN CONSIDERING BUYING THIS GAME!!!! So basically this is a warning about the game developer digital DNA game, DigitalDNA LLC, or whatever they like to call themselves on different games/projects. (By the way, I will not waste a lot of time doing this review so don't expect it to be long). But I am here to say that these guys are full of♥♥♥♥♥♥(you could use the word ""scammers"" if you prefer that word). If you take a look their website, you will find all of their games. Here is the link: https://www.digitaldnagames.com/ they seem to have a lot of games, one of them is called ""Castleminers Z"". And you can find a lot of negative reviews/comments about this game in steam, some is about how they just abandonded their game and stopped developing it. And the biggest thing is that; they are using different names for their company on steam! So let's say you would want to take a look at what games does this ""digital dna games"" have on steam. The result will show that they have nothing at all... And there is where the scam lies. Doing that will show you nothing, and by searching that that name on steam will not tell you, that they have developed some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unfinished Early Access games. So my point is, you should take a look at these things before even considering buying this game. If you still want to buy this game after all what I've mentioned then it is up to you. And if you decide to get it, then I wish you luck and I hope you'll have fun time playing it. But I must say, I do not recommend you to buy this game, unless you really enjoy playing unfinished games what will never be made complete properly. That's all I have to say, cheers!			"

								Oh, the potential here is staggering.  Oh, and death comes in many ways.  Freezing to death, wolves, starving to death, wolves, drowning, wolves, lack of shelter, wolves.  Yup.  It's awesome!  No, it is AWESOME - that wasn't sarcasm at all.I didn't read the forums, read.me file, or anything that would give me the slightest hint on how to play.  I looked only at the controls so I'd know how to move around then I started a game.  I ran around like a moron trying to figure out what to do.  Nearly starved to death, nearly froze to death.  That didn't happen only because I encountered some less-than-friendly wolves.  They didn't starve to death, I can tell you that much.I started again.  Ran around like a moron trying to figure out what to do.  Froze to death after nearly starving to death.I started over again.  Got a few things together but ran into two wolves who decided that I looked like I wasn't close enough to both freezing and starving to death.  Those wolves also did not starve to death.I started again.  I looked around the starter area and scavenged for loot.  I got a lean-to and a fire going, then built a house.  I found out where to get food without hunting so I wouldn't starve once my starting food was gone.  I figured out how to hunt deer.  Then I started to make better gear and keep up on the repairs of what I was carrying.  Now I have three houses (Small, regular, stone), a forge, several lean-to structures, several fire pits and a tonne of ore, logs, blue plants, bandages and gear.  I've got enough food for several days and now that I've finally made a longbow and 30-40 arrows hunting is much easier.The game got a bit dull after I go to the point where I had everything I needed to survive for a few days.  The character moves so slowly I don't feel like exploring too far yet, but as I build structures farther from my initial town/house I'm sure I will explore a lot more of the island - the size of which is still a mystery as are several other things I've seen so far.Still in early access - as of 2015-05-27, so keep that in mind if you decide to try it.  That and I had to turn down several settings so it would run fairly well - and I have a decent system.  Pretty sure once it's out of the EA stages it will run better.			"

								After almost 500 hours of playing this game i can say its been a great ride from the beginning till now, i had a lot of fun times and what i find even more awesome is i am not bored with it one bit. Reason for that is devs are making a great effort, working very close with the community, in upgrading it and improving, making it better and better on a weekly basis.And i think now we should all just be a bit more patient, and like devs have said many times already, they are working as fast as they can on fixing bugs and issues and adding more content which will in the end, i am sure, make this game more fun and more difficult for everyone (like for example adding new creatures, new enemies like idk forest gremlins; tweaking existing ones so they pose a bigger threat; adding combat with Kur the dragon, and a lot of other stuff that is planned).I dont think this game should only be based on basic survival..never ending cicle of gathering food and wood and not moving away from the safety of your cabin on the beach. It didnt make much sense how it was in the beginnings, when cooked deer meat recuperated only 10-15% of your hunger if i remember right, you needed to eat probably over 100 deer meat per day in order to survive one day/night cicle, dont even remember anymore :P not to mention not being able to re-use firepits after they burn out. It also doesnt make much sense to me and its a bit annoying if hunger meter drops that quickly that you need to eat a piece of meat every minute, or cold meter dropping that quickly that you need to ""sit"" by the fire entire day. I think hunger and cold meter are working just fine now and since then there has been a lot of progress made and game is constantly getting better in all fields .I think it is not easy to find the perfect balance between easy and hard, but i am sure that with our help they will do it right in the end :) What i believe will make it more fun and challenging is them adding stuff mentioned above.I am looking forward to new updates :) "

								Savage Lands is a brutal open world survival game that is currently available through Steam Early Access. In Savage Lands you have one goal, survive. Survival is not easy though, not only do you have to contend with your hunger thirst and body temperature you also must fight for survival against deadly creatures ranging from reanimated skeletons to a fire breathing dragon. Savage Lands is effectively a mixture of Skyrim (world design) and The Forest (gameplay) which is in no way a bad thing, in fact it creates an interesting game from a somewhat stagnating genre.+Decent graphics/style even on minimum settings (more on that later)+Great world design, ranging from the environment to the creatures within the game, everything is well done and fits together+Fun resource gathering mechanics which work similarly to The Forest, felling trees is oh so satisfying+Simple and easy to use crafting system, again works much in the same way as The Forest where you have a book of craftable items which can be made once you have the necessary resources in your inventory+Building structures, ranging from tiny lean-tos to large stone buildings, is again simple and works the same way as it does in The Forest where you choose want you want to make and then an outline is placed on the ground where you gradually put the resources such as logs and sticks+Staying alive is genuinely difficult without even taking the creatures into consideration as you battle to keep warm, hydrated and full of food+It's very easy to get lost in the world (how is that a good thing I hear you ask) which again adds to the difficulty of the game which for something like this is no bad thing+There are pre-built structures and villages for you to explore in the world+Character saves and world saves are seperate meaning you can take your characters from your world and play them in a friend's world for example+There are already lots of items to craft and more are being added+The developers are active on Steam which is nice to see, particularly for an Early Access game+/-When you die you lose all of your stuff which makes starting again with that character considerably harder+/-No PvP in multiplayer sessions-It runs awfully on my PC. I have everything apart from resolution set on minimum and I can't even get 30FPS which really is not good enough-Animations aren't great, they don't look overly realistic-No pausing in single player sessions, one of my pet peeves in games, really can't stand it-Some of the hitboxes are way too small for the object they are for, for example the bushes that drop sticksPC Spec:CPU: Intel Core i7-4770 @ 3.4GHz GPU: Nvidia Geforce GT640 4GB VRAM RAM:10GB HDD: 2TB OS: Windows 8.1 64 bit Verdict:8A brutal open world survival game with good mechanics, good world design and a difficulty level that provides a real challenge to stay alive. ***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.

Early Access Review
								Well im not sure how to start this since this is my first review of the game. I purchased this game prolly about a year ago with a few of my friends the game was fun and hard, like just finding enough food to stay alive hard. but it was very early in the games career. we played for a bit and then for whatever reason we stopped playing.Last night we were having a hard time firguring out what game we wanted to play and came back accross this game and were curious to see how things have progressed. took us a few minutes to recapture our bearings on how the game works and before you can make your first bags and boxes inventory management is huge.Day 1: We run around franticly trying to figure out how to build a shelter and such and start to realize we are not going to get one done before night falls. Night hits and we are huddled around a campfire trying not to freeze to death. get warm enough and tired of staying put so i figure i will go get some more stone to work on things. walk towards a rock and i hear them before i notice them. It's a pack of wolves, so i quickly retreat to the fire hoping like real wild animals they will want to stay away from the campfire. we also manage to encounter a few skelletons which we just dodge the easily choreographed moves and club them down. Day 2: notice something about making some bigger bags, so i spend the day chasing down and clubbing boars for food and supplies. wandering around the woods i hear wierd noises i attribute to the pigs. Then i hear the flapping and realize as the trees around me burst into flame that it was not a simple boar after all. Panic sets in as i glance up at the sky trying to see what the heck is trying to burn me to a crisp. so i start running inbetween trees and rocks hoping to lose him. after what i assume to be a few more strafing runs looking for me he must have left cause the sounds vanished.Day 3: By now we have got some decent supplies gathered and have learned how to fight the various beasts in the area: Boars, Wolves and Skeletons. We find a ruined town of sorts with a glowing red skeleton in the center of it. decide we are going to see what hes made of. i go in first to see if i can figure out his attack patter without being murdered. He lunges at me, I sidestep in what i feel is just in time and give him a smack with my stone sword and notice his heath bar barely moves. At that moment we knew we were in for a long fight of hit and run tactics. After what felt like was about 10 minutes we brought him down. Soon after we are making our way back to our base and i hear it again. this time the dragon has now set its sights on my friend. he uses a giant boulder to dodge the dragons 3 strafing runs before the beast appears to have lost interest with him and left.That was our couple day experience in the game, needless to say we are going to be making another trip into the Savage Lands to see what other adventures we have in store.Pros:Dangerous enemies.While some of the moves they have are somewhat easy to dodge. that one time you don't you will pay for it.I have read some of the other reviews complaining about the dragon, as long as you stay out of the open and away from his tower he appears to leave you alone for the most part. but just that fear that settles in when hes coming after you is worth it every time.Fairly In depth crafting system:Me and my friend have only appeared to scratch the surface of it, but so far so goodSense of Survival:From the aspect of staying warm to starving to death, you do get that feeling like there is more than just monsters that threaten your life.No gamebreaking bugs so far:Yeah no bugs we have found so far have made the game unplayable.Cons:Sharp learning curve:not sure if its a pro or a con, but the game is a little overwhelming at first if you are not very accustomed to survival games.Not sure how well this game works solo:As i stated i played this game with a friend, i can see the world and lack of inventory room at the begining very harsh for someone playing by themselves.Conclusion:Thumbs up!It has enough going good for me to reccomend this game to others with what ive seen. It also has enough different with it to justify getting it with the large amount of survival games on the market at the moment. I would buy this game again just for the few experiences i have had with it. I look forward to seeing whats coming next from the devs. they seem to update this game pretty frequently.At least 7/10 atm and will adjust as things change			"

								As of right now I'm only at 90 minutes of play time but that has been enough to inspire this review for three main reasons.1. The atmosphere of the game is amazing.2. Playing with other people and helping each other out in such a well done atmospheric setting is an experience that leaves a very good impact on the feels.3. None of the reviews I've seen so far seem to have touched on the atmosphere of the game much.My time in this game so far was spent in an online hosted game where I started out knowing little but was quickly brought up to speed from asking questions to the other people in the game. They helped me figure out some things I needed to complete the tasks assigned by the game when you first start. At the same time I helped collect resources to continue the development of our little village that was forming and scouting any nearby enemies, mainly wolves and skeletons. Once I finished all my tasks initially assigned by the game (basic ones I'm assuming to help you get into the game and to know what you're doing) I thanked my fellow adventurers for the assistance and logged off.During the above in game actions I encountered a few more things that honestly helped me to fall in love with this game's atmosphere rather quickly. Here is a short list of things I enjoyed:- Standing next to the other players near a fire to keep warm.- Hearing the fire crackling and popping.- Hearing the cold winds howling around and sounds of nearby animals/creatures.- Hearing my character breathing heavily in the cold air as well as almost a sniffling sound during this process.- Witnessing the scenery during the different times of day, especially in the evening/during sun set.Honestly, if you play games for their immersion and emotional interactions, this game is priceless (Especially with a good pair of headphones, as well as a headset as you can hold Tab to talk to other players). Content and basically everything else will come in time and can be added in the future but the atmosphere is something that has to be done right early on. In this game, it is, and the developers seem loyal to producing more content and considering good feedback and suggestions from the community.On another note (and I'm sure this is because the game is in early access) I can see where you can run out of things to do in the game currently, however I have obviously not made it there yet due to my 90 minutes of actual play time. I don't think this will be much of a problem for me though, because I've already found great enjoyment in doing simple things such as the events described above.I look forward to playing this game a lot in the future and as of right now I'm hooked on it!

								Edit 2: I am glad the devs actually responded to this, as it lends to the high opinion of them I have already gotten from their continuous communication with their fans and from the fans themselves speaking of them.  I'm not saying the entire game should be put on easy-mode.  What I am saying is that keeping it challenging and fun is obviously a big deal (for any game) and keeping in mind that not all the player base of any given game does not and will not ever think alike.  Making it so that one person can make it easier for their single player game while another keeps it just as harsh and unforgiving, should be an option.I know that this game has a huge following (and for good reason) and I will most likely get crap for this but it is my honest opinion of the game that I played so far.  I love the fact that the devs are so awesome at keeping in touch with the player base and letting people know about upcoming updates & fixes as well as keeping everyone informed about what was just done to the game to update it as well.  But the game-play is just too harsh.  TL;DR This game is too unforgiving.  I realize it is supposed to be a challenge but to be so punished for exploring in any sort of way is just boring to me.  Every time I turned around there was a pack of wolves bleeding me out.  I was fine with the skeletons, they were easy and making a spawn point was nice.  I made a small house and blacksmith place along with a fire near the coast.  The moment I decided to start exploring any of my surroundings though, this game took a huge nose-dive.  Pros:-Devs keep up with the game and with the players informing them of when they are coming out with the next update and making older updates and their information, very easy to obtain and understand.-Beautiful land-Wide variety of monsters & animals-Love the fact that you are actually effected by the cold environment-HUGE variety of craftable/cooking items that you can very easily learn as you go (the items basically explain themselves for the most part as their titles usually say exactly what would drop them i.e. wolf pelt instead of just more leather)-Devs listen & pay attention to their player base, huge plus-Models are very nice looking, animation is very well done (the skeleton scared the crap out of me lurking out of the forest how it did) -Weather effects are stunning and can impair the player's vision very easily adding to a tense atmosphere---------------------------Cons:-They wanted this to be *too* unforgiving-Sometimes crafting doesn't seem to follow a pattern and can be somewhat confusing.  I.E. I picked up some medium quality metal, suddenly I know an entire Ebony set I cannot possibly make while I don't know how to create a longbow but I can make the arrows for it.  (Having a more simplified crafting system with leveled patterns would be easier to use/understand.)-Bleed till you die, there is no way to stop it without bandages and it will never slow down-Packs of wolves can sometimes come at you in 2-3 packs at once and they will never stop hunting you-The reach of skeletons & wolves is too great, with a tool in my hand I was unable to hit them at the length they were easily able to punch me-Frustration/annoyance/repeat; does not equal good game play-Basically forced to do multiplayer because of the way the enemies are from the get-go is very unappealing to me as I prefer solo/co-op with my husband, not 8 or however many other people-Starvation & freezing to death comes too easily and too fast for someone having to run around at night (after crafting all day) hitting deers in the butt one slap at a time while dying in the dark---------------------------------------------------------Being a big fan of single & co-op player modes, I wish there was a way to set this on an easier scale for people who cannot devote 6 hours of game time a day.

								I've played enough to build a 500 log central building and a forge, Craft the most powerful current weapon, Craft several 15 slot bags, craft both the most cold protection (Fur set of armor)and the most physical protection (Plate set of Armor).Pros: Creepy music and atmosphereCrafting systemAbility to take what you can carry to other servers when you join.Ability to craft a CompassJust the right amount of things to kill to make you work for your survival.ConsNo way to lock your cabin so other can't loot. Or at the very least the ability to Lock your storage chest.AI is not terrible, but not good either...just OKPlaying solo on my computer which is pretty fast, lags a little when I fight a pack of wolves (6).Durability sucks.. I don't mind repairing my items, but they need CONSTANT repairs. I'd say they need to tripple the Armor and Weapon durability. Axe and Hammer are fine.I got booted from a server and it almost auto killed me. Took me down to very little health and bleeding.It would suck to die on a hosted server, go to retrieve your items and they kick you with no way to get your items back.Things to improve game:Developer hosted servers 24/7Ability to lock doors or storage containersAI improvementDurability increaseIf you die, you don't loose your items on hosted games, only on local games.Ability to see other players on a map and where they are in relation to you.2 or 3 story structures or the ability to custom build your own.Keep up the good work Developers!!

								Updated!  I really wish there was a neutral recommendation.The TL;DR:  I still can't really suggest buying at the moment, but they're moving in the right direction on some things.  Check up on it in 6mo to a year and see how it's coming or just wait for it to come out of EA.  I love the concept, the setting isn't bad (decently made, just not my preference), I think it will eventually be worth buying, just not yet.  Alright, so life relented long enough to spend a little more time in-game and check out the last few weeks of updates.  Here's the report:First off, the dragon.  Because who liked ""flaming death from above every 3min"" as a tutorial?  I'm happy to report that he is no longer a spawn-camping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I'm actually not sure how to get his attention now since he ignored me on the first and second island both.  Tsunderagon?  Thankfully, this means players have to chance to get established and figure out what they're doing.They've added some new books laying around that discuss weapon and armor factors, though the books are somewhat widely scattered and don't address some of the missing information about weapons (range and speed, most notably).  There are also a number of new loot items laying around near the starting area.  An extra axe, some basic armor, and more flint help get things rolling; a compass and fur armor (which both require metals from the second island to make); and a tin battle axe rounds out the lot.  Some of them are in odd locations, so I probably missed others.  All together, this helps ease new players in (honestly, the Fur armor might be a bit much, but I can't complain), though it is still a good idea to start a character in a completely new world to pick things up before joining a friend's world for coop since the loot takes quite a while to respawn.There's still a lot of other issues to note, though.  Gathering anything mineral-related is still quite tedious.  Maybe some people like it, but it strikes me as time padding.  12 hits with a tin hammer (the best you can get early) to get a 1 piece of copper ore (of which you need a dozen or so along with more tin and coal to make something useful).  It adds up very quickly into lots of time standing around hitting rocks.  Put another way, some people have found it worthwhile to devise farming runs for the nodes to reduce time spent gathering minerals.  It just doesn't feel right here.The crafting menu is still very annoying to use, especially when you aren't completely sure what something in the miscellaneous section is named (great example is when you go looking for nails because you see they are needed to repair a building, but they are actually named ""Bag of Nails"" in the rather long, alphabetized list).  Not being able to scroll a list when the mouse is over an item is frustrating, likewise the same issue when you have an item picked up in the poor inventory system.  Speaking of the inventory, I hate it.  I get what the intent is, but the implementation is very clumsy and makes finding anything an unnecessary chore.  Buildings/crafting stations are still all together in a 4-per-page list that would really be better served by a section in the crafting menu, though perhaps there is an issue with the coding (since they go to outline-placement mode instead of producing an item) preventing this.Some bugs/design issues:  It looks like they're in the middle of some terrain changes on the islands.  Especially on the second island, there are a lot of rocks and other objects floating a few feet off the ground in many places.With regards to the warmth mechanics, it still feels odd to me that it not only reduces your max health but also your actual health.  I get that it's supposed to be another layer of the survival gameplay, but it's really annoying to need to bandage myself just because I went outside for a few minutes before coming back to warm up.Combat is... dull, I suppose is the correct work.  Yeah, your life is on the line with vicious monsters, but you just trudge around swinging mechanically.  There's no real intensity to it.  ""Strafe around it in a circle while swinging"" seems to be almost a one-size-fits-all tactic, and survival is more about whether you've farmed materials long enough to make the best available equipment than learning the enemies and playing well.Overall, it seems like there is a desire to avoid out-of-character tutorial information, but I'm not sure whether that is appropriate to a game demanding you make survival choices.  If the character has the know-how to make a leanto, it seems reasonable to inform players of how to do so within the system.  Likewise with the fact that some mineral resources are found in discrete nodes while others are randomly generated by bashing any rock.  If they want to keep it completely in-world, a few more books in the starter area mentioning the basics would be great for new players.There needs to be a decision on which direction to focus on for the moment:  Either improve the crafting side of things with better interface and more options (particularly with regards to structures) or emphasize the exploration and combat side with improved enemies (at the moment they seem mechanical, have 1 or 2 attacks that frequently have janky hit ranges, and depend mostly on huge health pools and damage compared to the player).  Right now it feels like the game is trying to do too many things at once, but I think some focused attention in each area one at a time will really help.  My personal preference would be the combat system since the game doesn't really fit the builder/crafter mold.I still think this will eventually be a great game.  While I'm about to have even less time available, I'll try to check in every month or two and see what's changed as long as the devs keep pushing steady updates.			"

								I love this game. You really have to work hard to stay alive. I only wish the hunger meter was slower. You get hungry way to fast.Things I would like to see added:1) More deer.2) More things to build, like walls, pits, shelves etc.3) crouch4) spears to use in hand or throw5) beds for resting6) blankets ( lol. why it so cold all the time? )7) more biomes. not just snow.8) Also, when you build a home, away to designate a marker so you can find it by looking for floaty symbol. Currently been lost 2 days trying to find my home.9) Better collision and clipping (deer aint supposed to walk thru boulders, is this Rust? lol)10) just more, more, more...I love this gameLove the AI of enemies. Really cool enemies I might say. The Forest Giants scared the sh!t outta me when I 1st encountered it. All still, motionless. Thought it was some kinda statue build, then it got up. That Fu##er can move fast.The dragons are beautiful and can breathe fire really far. Nice. The fire FX are really nice to.All in all, I think this game is amazing as is but I am greedy and want more of it.I give this game a 9.9/10 (no game is perfect, regardless of what some 'game reviewers' say. Thank you.EDIT:04/04/16Game seems to have a lot of issues. So I will list what I've seen below:1. Trying to get sticks and logs from trees now is hit or miss. Sometimes chopping down a tree completely, just gives you a downed tree that you can't harvest.2. The ghost overlay on some things you wanna build even after built, never goes away.3. Choppy or stuttery display. Even random frame dips while standing still.4. Starting a new game because of updates. Which is understandable but, you might have to try it several times before it works correctly.5. Back to the ghost overlay for building. Sometimes, even after you've applied all components, it has you cycle through them again. So basically, you're building it twice, in the same spot.6. Cannot seem to make the game run smooth anymore. I have twice deleted/uninstalled and it stays the same performance level even trying to turn things down. And since I've first got the game have upgraded my pc. Confused as to why better pc means worse performance on this game.7. Characters now start off naked. Does Rust come to mind?I will leave my recommend status as is, but in truth no longer recommend this to new users until the game is fully done. This was one of my favorite survival games, now has moved closer to the bottom. So sad...			"

								             I want to take the time and recommend Savage Lands. I have enjoyed over 100 hours of adventure in the game. At some point you will come to a pass and ask yourself, What next.             The sand box is big. Just with the limited amount of items in the game I have clear cut a path from each tower to the center of the map lined it with torches, buildings and campfires. I have set up camps at each ruin area and made a path to Vek.             The game is what you make it. I have had fun and the little bit of money I have paid, I have got out of the current content. If I never played another day of the game, I would not be disappointed in what I have spent.             The down side is that the game has such great potential. Yes you are hearing me right. When this happens to a game peoples mines go crazy. It could be this, it could be that. Purple flying pigs that poop loot. The game is great just simple. Survive the cold harsh land. Our imaginations set us up for disappointment if we let it. I hope the community aiding in the direction of this game keep it true to its nature.  "

								Ok, to start with Signal Studios has acknowledged the fact that they can't leave a broken game out on the market while they fulfill other obligations. so after much conversation, debate and a little bit of nastiness on the forums they have provided a previous version (Build 290) which was not broken. i have to say though that if you aren't interested in playing an unfinished game that won't be worked on for and undetermined time frame then i cant recommend the game at this time. if you don't mind and would like to enjoy the game that most of us have come to love then i do recommend Savage Lands. so until Signal's return to this game i will continue my hunt for Drackonis.

								Let's just say, you don't need to worry about people killing you, like in other games that turned strictly into PvP games. Start looking for resources as soon as you spawn.Definitely needs more work, and that's why it's in early access. The devs are very active with updates and lives streams, and seem eager to make a great game. They seem like they love their job, take it seriously and want to make a good product.

								I love this game, its a perfect blend of Minecraft, Don't Starve, and with a little bit of Skyrim. I would recommend this game to anyone with the stones big enough to face a challenge bigger than blocky faces and manipulated difficulty. Below are some of the things that stood out as good, bad, and some things I believe would make the game perfect.9/10(ABOVE IS JUST FOR PEOPLE SKIMMING THE REVIEWS, BELOW IS FOR THOSE WISHING FOR INDEPTH REVIEWS!)It should be noted that I am at day 4, so some of the ideas covered below are about those 4 days and what was recorded during the process of survival.The Good:- Beautiful landscape, I am left breathless at the sheer beauty the land reveals upon each morning.- Tenacious wildlife, I am often left speechless at the stubborn force of the wolves and wargs.- Unique resource gathering, I cannot help but grin as my axe fells a towering monument of wood.- Unique crafting, I am in awe each time I get to craft a new item.- Unique building, each time I finish a structure, I can't decide what to focus on constructing next!- Harsh environment, I am always in a state of alert as I prowl the wilderness for food, resources, or game.- The scary @$$ dragon, actually I find myself running in fear each time I hear that thing roar.The Bad: - Sometimes when you drop an item bag (like the Tattered one you start with) it stays with you. Not exactly a bad thing, but when you gather resources, the items sometimes go to the dropped bag.- Sometimes when you cut a tree down, the tree will stay up, duplicating a fallen tree unto the ground. While you cannot harvest the tree infinately, it becomes a visual nucience and impairs your building spaces.- Sometimes the Warg-like beasts come out during the day near the tower, they didn't attack me, but I found it to be odd that I couldn't even hit them, as they drifted between underground and overground rapidly.- I'm not sure if you can, but I can't seem to reignite torches after they get snuffed out.- Armor durability, I understand some of the armors aren't exactly ment for combat, and thus obviously would have low durability, but I'm far more sure that they should last at least a day and a half for each set.Suggestions:- Potion brewing would be a nice touch. Gathering berries, herbs, and various items to mix. Maybe as a potion bottle, a reusable metal container?- Going along with the idea of the land being a harsh environment featuring wolves, dragons, wargs and bears, how about witchcraft? Drawing runes on swords or armor to augment them or imbuing a stick to be used as an offencive fire spouting staff/ wand?- Farming? Seeing as how you can build a house, a fire, a forge, and a townhall. Why not a garden as well? You could take unspoiled fruits and vegatables and gather their seeds, plant them, and gather them?- Rain? Even though the biggest fear in the game is not the cold, why not push the fact that it SHOULD be something to worry about?- Fences? Wood walls and doors are good, but to push the idea of building a safe residence, utilizing fences would help some people cope with the night.(Written 3/29/15 at 3:52 AM with 8.9 Hours of play.)			"

								I have been looking for the right survival game for a while now. I tried many and some were solid. Savage Lands is on track to be something special, it has a new update coming this week and is already addictive as hell. I have stayed up late quite a few nights always wanting to craft the next item. All the time having to constantly plan the next meal, keep every item in good shape, manage inventory, stop bleeding, etc. etc. Lose focus for a bit or chase that deer too far and death is the consequence. Oh and there's a resident dragon on the Sundered Isle that will be happy to light the unwary traveler's♥♥♥♥♥♥on fire.  It's far from perfect but there's meat on this bone, some more work and they are going to have something special and very commercially viable.			"

								Savage Lands is a really fun open world survival game with a great theme going on.I enjoyed every minute I have spent discovering the secrets of the Sundered Isle and trying to map out all of it's glory.The developers are quite involved and open to the feedback they receive. I truly feel this game is improving all of the time.The community is really great and I have never met such friendly people online as I have on the servers of Savage Lands.Truly a fun game to splurge for a four pack to get the friends in on.I have a gripe with the optimization as it seems like the more that you clear and build on the map, it seems like the world becomes much more demanding to load, but I hold out hope this will only improve as development continues.I also think it will be much nicer as further incarnations of the dedicated server come out, as right now it is very limited due to several technical constraints.Definitely recommending this game...

								Sometimes I feel like I am adrift in a sea of early access survival games, getting suckered into one after another always hoping the next one will have some magic to it. Well, I'm happy to say this is one of those rare games in the genre that manages to distinguish itself. I've been having a great time with this title exploring and surviving, it has that magic I'm always looking for. Foremost I have to talk about the high visibility of the devs. When I say high visbility, I mean the highest I've ever seen. I see them all over the forums, live streams where they show what they're working on and answer questions, heck the in game menu even says when the next update is going to be. These guys really know what being accountable is and they do everything early access devs should be doing. Come what may I'm really glad to have supported this crew, they should be the example other devs look to when doing an early access game. The topic I'd like to weigh in on most is crafting. I see curators and other reviewers tout the crafting in this game so I think it's worth a minute of my review to talk about what crafting is and is not here. If you're looking at this game from the view point of a craftaholic this game isn't going to scratch that itch. You won't be building massive creative works here, it's not a creative outlet. Crafting is somewhat streamlined and is essentially your means of progression. As you create better gear you can venture to more dangerous areas to get better materials to make even better gear. You could consider this a ""gear grind"" though I found it doesn't feel like much of a grind and really isn't that much of a time sink once you know where to go and what to get. Beyond that there isn't much I can say that isn't said in most other reviews. Great title I'm proud to support.			"

								Savage Lands is a cold and ominous experience. The atmosphere is excellent and can be very creepy. I really did feel like I was alone in a hostile land, and at first it took me a long time to feel secure enough to wander into unsafe areas.You have a health bar, of course. The other two are hunger and cold. Cold is your first enemy in this game. There's no thirst bar, which makes sense as there is snow practically everywhere so you could easily melt some down; it's fair to assume you have enough water.You're limited to pre-designed buildings, and rather few designs. I don't see a problem with basic shacks and such because you'll probably be building a lot of them to give yourself safe harbor as you explore. This isn't a ""design and build a beautiful and complex base from the ground up"" style of game, this is a ""pile some sticks together before you freeze to death and the wolves gnaw upon your frostbitten corpse"" game and I enjoy the roughness of it.I'm coming at this from a slightly unusual angle because this was the first survival game I ever played. I didn't have any expectations of what building should be like, or crafting, or any of the mainstays of the genre. Since playing Savage Lands I have been hooked on survival games and have been branching out, but I feel it's an excellent introduction, partially because of the limits in buildings; it's less likely to overwhelm a new player. I don't know what the devs' plans are for expanding the building system, but I do hope they keep the prefabs in there as an option for when you just need to get a shack up as fast as possible before the sun goes down and the nasties come out.This game also seems to have broken me from my reliance on minimaps. You are forced to navigate with only a compass and landmarks, and this actually becomes surprisingly second-nature. (Side note: there are a lot of people who are confused about how the compass works— the point of the needle always points to the north. That's it. It's no more complicated than that.)Being Early Access there are some features missing, for example there are no female characters yet. However, they are confirmed to be in development and they will have realistic armor. The devs listen to the community (you can even vote on features), are extremely active and give information constantly. Frequent updates are made and I have no doubt the devs will deliver on their promises. This game has a bright future.			"

								If I was giving advice to my past self, I'd want to wait until this game is finished- or at least a sale.There's a lot of potential here. On the other hand, there was a lot of potential when I got the game three months ago, and the progress since then has been... disappointing. I've had this in my library beside The Long Dark, Stranded Deep, The Forest, and Who's Your Daddy, and out of them all Savage Lands has changed the least, even though I've only had TLD longer.In terms of playability, the features that are present are nice. The mixture of construction, combat, and survival means that you're constantly switching tasks to stay on top of everything. On the other hand, individually, each aspect is very grindy and the balance is too straightforward. The starting monsters are ridiculously easy, even with the most basic weapon, and yet until you get advanced weapons the very second tier are almost impossible. The hit boxes for the targets are sometimes awwkard, and the archery system is a joke. On the other hand, there's a decent selection of monsters and the drop rates are very well balanced, so once combat mechanics are refined this aspect should be above par.Building is also above par, with a decent number of structures and an excellent placement system. HOWEVER, having to build an entire smithy just to have a forge feels like overkill and gathering the resources for a new base takes forever. In addition, for noncooperative multiplayer, defensive capabilities could be much improved.Survival is very basic. Don't get cold, hungry, or injured and you'll be good to go. Some sort of meat vs. plant nutritional balance or a more in-depth breakdown of clothing's effect on the cold stat would tremendously improve this option.The UI is... interesting. It's toeing the line between retro and just plain dated, but it isn't difficult to understand, though without information on weather or stamina its use is limited. In addition, colored boxes with the health conditions spelled out and visible percentages seem to be conflicting with the minimalist feel.On the whole, I look forward to changing my recommendation when the game improves. Hopefully the pace will pick up and that day won't be years away.			"

								I was told about this game by several of the members of my Steam Group, so I tried it out.  Here are my impressions after putting some time into the game.Unlike most other games, you can build your character up in offline mode, and then take that character into multiplayer servers, pvp or friendly.  If you host the server, your world becomes the game world, and whatever was in your world, is part of that online world.  Multiplayer servers do NOT require any port passthrough to run a server, (no firewall changes).The game reminds me of Skyrim, both in visual looks and in the theme.  The crafting is simplified, and fun.  Save whatever you ever pick up, and dump it in your base, you will use it eventually.Until you beef up your character, don't venture deep into the forest at night.Build your house / village on the coast and remove several hundred yards of trees and bushes radiating outward from your base, so you can see critters.Get a fire going first, chop some bushes for some berries, make some basic tools and weapons, get wolf armor..these are your first basic steps.The easiest way to defeat any tough creature is to run backwards (backpedal) and swing your weapon at the enemy.I don't know why, but the dragon ignores you, and you can even build a house under his roost.  UPDATE: the new build has the dragon trying to attack you when he is flyinh.  Nice!The game gets updates in a regular fashion, and announces it on the front page in a countdown clock.Multiplayer hosts can kick or ban people, and I have seen some strange and disruptive people and have had to ban people for extremely offensive names.I like this game, and I hope that you do too.

								Absolutely do NOT buy this game. It is in a perpetually broken state, and it is also pretty much not getting worked on anymore. It was pushed aside by the devs for a new ""project."" Do yourself a favor, and spend your 15 dollars elsewhere. It isn't even worth picking up on a sale. I saw potential here, so I was a dumbass and bought it. At least it was only throwing away 15 bucks.			"

								Edit 17-3-22Hello and best to all.Well, a great deal has occured since my first post nearing two years ago. This game has enormous potential.... it's so close to being one of the best survival game on the market. I would purchase newer versions. So darn close. I really hope the developers keep at it here because they have great game. Remember, it's still in development and  has some issues. So far i've seen nothing to lead me to believe the dev's have given up on this game. I remain optimistic for better things to come.Still, it's been a great ride for this early purchaser. Three separate, fun versions of this game have been made and each was just amazing. Hard? Yes,but it get's easier.One problem is, with all the different versions things like maps and information becomes harder to come by. I urge the developers to give us some maps and as much basic information if possible.Many animals are buggy at present and their are ""dungeons"" that once entererd cannot be exited. Considering the time invested in acquiring items it can be extremely frustrating. I really do enjoy this game though. It can be low key gathering or, if you want, all out action. I really like this option in gameplay.I'd like to see more items i could aspire to build, maybe a rare higher grade arrow that i could make. Some additional mining options and rewards for mountain climbers and explorers. Many idea's....i just hope this game keeps going. Developers!? Don't give up on this game please it's been a great aadventure!BUT.....to a new purchaser i would say maybe hold off until the next update unless you're okay with a few, sometimes frustrating bugs. I however do love this game. It's one of my all time favorites out of a library that's fairly extensive. I upvote this still but give a regretful caveat emptor at this moment. ..... but fingers crossed!!!and maps please devs!   ;)Thanks, best to you and yours.(Original Post)First,best to all.I really have been enjoying this game a great deal. With all the disappointments i`ve had in gaming this has been a real pleasant suprise.It`s fun and well worth the price of purchase. It takes awhile, like any decent game to figure out the best way to slay those evil buggers running around but you will get the hang of it after a couple hours.The game runs smooth,the graphics and audio well serve their purpose and for an early release it`s just awesome!Starting off is the hardest part. you're naked and weaponless,competely vulnerable to everything. In time you will have more food and gear than you'll know what to do with. It's challenging and fun. The saved game set up can be slighty  confusing. Just remember the time you first started your game and you`ll be fine. Try to keep track of where you`re going! It`s easy to get lost sometimes, Some numerals on the compass would help for us spacialy challenged folks..lol They`re there,just hard to read at times.Things i`d like to see, if i could be so preumptious; perhaps having the tide bring in the odd item (household items maybe), to be able to find and raise a wolf cub as a companion,caves or underground lairs,fishing and to be able to create targets for improved proficiency in archery.It doesn`t matter though,the developers clearly care and i know they`ll do what they can in time. Remember to not wander off to far when you start or your in for a long,naked journey to retrieve your gear.lol. It`s all good though. Congrats to the developers, you can see some real love in this one.It`s going to be fun seeing what`s coming update wise.Enjoy and thanks for reading my review!Best to you and yours!			"

								Well, I had high hopes for this game. Was fun and enjoyable when I first bought it.  Then they put in new ""big island flop"" content. They broke the game, animals, ores, enemies don't respawn. There is very little content on the new 2nd island. It's full of bugs, glitches and turned into a walking around freezing to death simulator.It is vurtauly unplayable now and to top it off they are ""putting a hold"" on this game to develope another game to get funding to supposedly ""fix and continue"" working on this game. Don't believe me? Just look at the forums at thier own posts about it. I hope that steam pulls the plug on this company for it's unscrupulous actions.....I swear this company hired a lawyer to drop the bad news about ""putting it on hold"" because they fed a good line of BS when they did it, but anyone with half a brain can see right through the BS and read it for what it is.....""we broke the game and made it unplayable. We have your money so we are going to start working on another game and leave you with this unplayable mess that we won't be fixing while we work on something esle....we hope to rob you again in the future......and btw ""trust us that we will work on this game again.""  I was born in the morning, but not this morning. Blacklist this company with extreme prejudice and DO NOT GIVE THEM MONEY to develope another game they will break and leave you with it to work on another game they can break...rinse and repeat.			"

								DONT LET THE GRAPHICS THROW YOU OFF.tldrCons- Starting off is really bleak Graphics can be much betterSome mobs are ridiculously hard to kill, and do lots of damagePros-One of the funnest multiplayers i have ever playedOnce you have a small base set up, then things start to get really funMap is hugeTons of different gear, and craftingFighting in groups on tough mobs is supa funThis game is actually really fun, it does start off very pale and bleak though. For the first 15 minutes of gameplay, i was pretty unimpressed; mediocre graphics, basically just the forest but worse, etc... But theni found a village, started having serious events happen, like a couple dark skeletons attacking and dark wolves, that was pretty fun but alright. Then i had to do something so i stopped, got back on, but this time i joined multiplayer. That was where its at. This game peaks during multiplayer, i had so much fun, co-oping with others to take down a forest giant or even the dragon. Best thing too, is that your inventory transfers. (from single player to multiplayer and vice versa) Got enough resources by teaming up with other guys that i was able to make a nice base on my single player world where i could store all my things.

								This is a really tough review to write because I'm torn between saying Savage Lands is good/fun and it is ""bad""/not fun.After doing some reading I see that the primary issue my husband and I were trying to work around, namely food scarcity/no spawns, is a recently introduced bug that is already being looked at.  However it really soured our introduction to the game and our play experience.  We spent the day scrambling around desperately trying not to starve to death due to a technical glitch.  That's not fun.Conversely we did actually have a lot of fun.  Cooperating and coordinating our efforts to survive, explore, and get our bearings was hilarious and entertaining.  We even had a surprise adventure or two with some other players on the multiplayer public servers.  This game has a *lot* of potenial- and even though it seems to be trying to squander that potential it can't quite snuff out the promise of a good game.  There is a lot of work that needs to be done- bugs to be squashed, performance issues to be hammered into shape, and for the love of God could I please get a female avatar so I can stop playing Trognara the homely crossdresser.After really considering my feelings I have to give this game a ""more positive than negative"" thumbs up.

								If you tracked your gameplay, you'd find maybe ... 70 - 80% of your time in the game is spent watching your hammer hit rocks for mining ore, or your axe hitting trees. The rest of the time is spent scrabbling for food, hiding from things, and running from things. And trying not to freeze. Not freezing is a theme in this game.After hours of that, you've hit enough rocks to get enough things to make a better hammer, so you can hit fewer rocks. This takes the pressure off a bit, and not long later you'll have a leather vest, a tin hat, a tin axe, a backpack full of food and bandages, and you'll be ready to cross the ice to the next island. Where you will be one-hit. Tin hats aren't very good.This should be really boring. It sounds really boring. But after lots of rock-hitting and pig stabbing, you build a shack and step inside. You feel funny. It's quiet. There's no wind. You're not scanning the area for things that one-hit you, or edible meat creatures. You're not eyeing your freezeometer. You feel safe. That's when you see you've been tense since you fired up the game. Something's always coming to kill you, if only hunger and cold, and if you're not paying attention, they'll get you. You've been a hunted animal. But now you have shelter, and some stuff, and you can think about turning the tables. Carefully.In short, it's got the things I look for in a good survival game.It's not perfect. It feels like it hasn't really gelled into a coherent game yet, but what it does so far ( survival ) it does well.p.s. When you are just starting out, you'll usually encounter a giant boar and maybe a wolf or two. You will die if you wail on them with your stick. Don't panic. You have more time than you think. That giant boar will run towards you and stop. Then it will do some yoga, which apparently is what pigs do when they want to kill you. Then it will leap at where you were standing when they started their attack yoga dance. Just step to one side ... and wale on them with your stick. And repeat. Then you eat them.			"

								This game has been on my wishlist for a loooong time. I finally bought it a few days ago, despite all the recent negative reviews about it on steam. So far, I'm not dissapointed that I bought it, but yes it does have negatives which should be mentioned.Pros and what I really like about it: +Sounds: The creepy factor is really well executed. You'll  never feel safe when exploring or gathering resources. +Atmosphere: Snowstorms are surprisingly ""nothing-you-can-do-about-it"" but sit and wait for it to pass. Also the night is definitely a hindrance to exploring, and brings a risk vs reward factor.+Creatures: I can't emphasize enough how this game will wash away any past RPG experience where you play as warrior and just run into the battle no matter what. Let me tell you my experience so far. A couple of times in the beginning I was running for my life from 4 wolves, and if I didn't have like 10 bandages which I thankfully prepared I would've died for sure. Even 1 wolf can do massive damage if you don't dodge properly. Today, I finally made it to the second island, only to get my first taste of death at the sword of a undead warrior skeleton. His blade effortlessly sliced through my tin armor in just 1 hit and I was dead. +Crafting/Building: I like the interface, and how you can place anything even if you don't have materials for it. It's the first game I played where the buildings are premade, but surprisingly I don't mind. Before I bought this game I thought it would be a minus because I'm used to building my own structures (like in ROK)+HUD: The health depends on cold, and stamina depends on hunger. I think it's tough, but enjoyable, especially when you are lost after being chased and then you realise you don't have any logs to make fire :)  Cons which I'm sure will be fixed or improved:-Lack of bow and arrow variety: At the moment there only seems to be 1 type of arrow and bow in this game, which is what you can make in the beginning. -Glitches: Animals walking through rocks or going underground is a bit of an issue on the second island.-Lag/Performance: I lowered everything to low, turned off most things but anyway I get temporary freezes, low FPS. Overall, I give this game 8/10. This game would be excellent, but performance issues right now is why I can't give it higher rating.			"

								I went ahead and bought a 4 pack for me and the minions. After playing it for 2 days, I am ready to recommend it as an ongoing project. I am happy to support the devs with my purchase, but do not suggest this is a 'complete' game experience. It is a solid foundation to be built on and should be pursued.Savage Lands.It's a survival fantasy world. You are on a Skyrim looking island with just the clothes on your back and must survive the elements, starvation and the various baddies. The content is not as heavy as I'd hoped. At this stage of the game, they have put more energy into weapon and armor crafting than most anything else, leaving some holes in the overall game experience that should be filled as soon as possible. SL is dying for a dynamic questing or dungeon system... with about 3 times the monster mobs. It definitely needs more stuff. MOre active POI destinations .But... it is an early access game and the devs appear to be very responsive.Here is my first game experience before restarting with a hosted game for me and my son.Game starts with my on the shores. Cheap clothes, a tiny sack of starter food and a few little sundries lying on the beach. There is a checklist of things to do to get started, including gathering and building the first camp fire and leanto.Stone axe to chop trees(which fall nicely). Must craft a stone hammer to mine rocks for stone, flint, ore, coal, etc...(this needs to be developed into caves and proper mining). Cotton for cloth to make bandages(wolves cause bleeds).It is dangerous and cold our there. You NEED a campfire and a home. Night time is frigid... and a blizzard at night will kill you in minutes with just the starter clothes. There are pre-mades. They are god. I found a couple of small ones to move into... and created another one to make a settlement. I started working on a blacksmith house to get the critical forge.I figured I had a handle on it enough to get my son going, so I abandoned that game to host one for the family.It went very well, and my son and I had a great time. We found another settlement to claim and started work, but I didn't get the items to make a hammer... and ran out of flint. I froze to death on night number 2. Because we had not finished the respawn totem, I had to run naked and unarmed in the dawn's early light.And I cam across an abandoned village with 5 buildings... including a working forge!!!It was an exciting surprise and we moved right away to the new homestead. Unfortunately, these structures are not procedurally generated, so there really is no reason to build one once you know where they are. This takes away the need for the intriguing structure crafting system. It literally invalidates it. They only think I HAVE to build...is the respawn point. AN entire path of advancement... POOF!!!My hope is that the devs nerf their usefulness... perhaps by halving the heat protection and requiring constant repair to eat resources and time, making a player structure desirable. My preference would be to also have viking like mobs that already live there that need to be conquered.Still... there is a good game here with much potential... and the impression I get is that the devs WANT that potential and are very active with the community of players to get guidance on what the priorities should be.In the meantime, my kids and I enjoy the coop experience.

								*Note: There is a Tl;Dr at the end should you wish to scroll down a little bit.Let me just start off on a positive note here. This game has a lot of potential, and here's why- It's an open world game where you can do whatever's in the game's boundaries to survive- The plot is actually pretty good for a survival game, though I have seen much better- From what I've seen it takes place in the medieval era, and that gives a very wide variety of weapons and armor to utilize- It's still in beta and improvements are bound to happen, especially with a community that's willing to recommend things.However, despite all this, the game is flawed beyond belief and this is why I can't recommend it- The hitboxes and combat are god awful.-- For one, the hitboxes are buggy. You have to be aiming at a specific point on the enemy (if it's not on that one point, the hit won't count) and be within range (The range is never specified).-- Enemies will glitch all the time by trying to move somewhere, then being teleported back, then moving again and being teleported-- Enemies also have god awful pathing (They walk directly at you, even if youre above them on a cliff) and never think to go around except on very rare occasions-- The enemies all seem to randomly hit you, even when it appears as though you're not in their range or sprinting a safe distance past them.- Two, building up broken down towns or creating your own is tedious as all hell and barely anything comes out of it. From what I can tell, the most you'll ever get from building a town is having more than 1 spot to go and warm up or perhaps having a safe-haven in a PvP server. Other than that, there's only the pride of building something from the ground up, which I suppose is good in its own right, but done poorly in this game.- Three, the resource gathering is very tedious and unforgiving (For a person doing a fair-playthrough who didn't look anything up, it took me a good 4 hours of constant gameplay to find 1 vein of iron ore, though to some that might just seem like idiocy). Also, each vein of ore holds 5 ores while stones, which contains clay, whetstone, and stone, give 20 of any of the 3 listed. To me this seems fair, though to others the fact that certain stones/veins are larger or smaller than others and still yield the same amount of minerals is bothersome.- Four, the models are less than satisfactory, and what I mean by this is that each armor set (except for fur and mithras) are basically just reskins with different stats and colors. To me that's very disappointing, especially when I have a steel spear that looks like junk all the way through or a silver sword that's dented and broken in certain parts even though silver implies it's refined and strong (though in real life it isn't quite good sword material, we aren't talking about real life).- Five, it's a RAM hog. While I do believe this is a product of poor optimization, and will be fixed eventually, as it stands right now the game tends to use all 8 gigs of my RAM and crash itself after a good 3 hours of playing. This might just be me, I haven't heard of anyone else with this issue yet, it very much ruins the experience if I plan to do a long run.- My sixth reason as to why I can't recommend it is, as discussed in the comments in a civil manner (Credit to Pyrithe for telling me to add this), is that there hasn't been an update trying to fix all this. I get that certain aspects of the game are hard to program or fix, like AI or optimization, but in my time owning this game I have not once seen an update patching even the most minor of bugs. This is one of the main reasons as to why I can't recommend it, as it would help to not only increase the trust the player has in the developer, but also build the developer's credibility. I know that scheduled updates can also be hard to do and are often only managed by AAA companies; however people need to see that the game they've bought IS being improved in some way or another.- My seventh, and last, reason as to why I can't recommend it seems very nitpicky and minor, but the chewing sounds. They are obnoxiously loud and annoying. Everything about them is awful, even when eating an apple, in which a simple crunching sound will do, you get to hear the god-awful sound of lip smacking and messy eating of a barbarian who barely understands what happens when you take an axe and slam it into a tree multiple times. As I said, this reason seems very small, but to some people these sounds are so god-awful you have to turn off the game's sound completely, and this can be very detrimental to not only the immersion but also to awareness, as it is often times the sounds of enemies that are the only indication of their presenceOverall, I very much enjoy the game, I honestly do. It's a very nice game once you not only look past all the flaws and toward its rather bright future, but also have built a nice town to look upon with pride and say ""I built that"" while in the comfort of your town hall. However, as it stands right now, I can't recommend it due to various flaws that can break the game, cause it to crash, and make it too tedious to really hold onto for a long period of time without becoming bored to an extent.Tl;Dr: While the game isn't inherently bad and I do believe it will improve over time, it's not worth buying in it's current state due to many flaws.

								I don't have a lot of experience with these kinds of game, but this one got me hooked. I was at the 10-hour mark and I was feeling good. I had built a couple of houses and had 6 boxes filled with goods. I thought I was in good shape and I was very confident. I had a weapon that did 24 damage and some leather armor. So thinking I could take on everything I went exploring. Well a chase from a dragon fighting a pack of dire wolves at the same time as a dire bear, dying to have to run so far to get my body. It dawned on me that I was not so ready. I have played this game for about 15 hours and I can say I want  to play many more. Pros addicting big worldgathering resources is fundifficulty seems faircons nothing really because this is still in alphathings I would like to seeI would love NPCs that you can recruit and have them help you gather or follow and help fightI would like to see some sort of crops that can be farmedI also would like a lot more customization to building. I would like to clear areas and make my own little village.Over all this is a great game that seems to be on the right path. I have not seen too many bugs just a few animals seem to jump. but other than that nothing really. the developers seem to care about the game with regular updates			"

								As of right now, developers seem to be advancing the game quickly and improving it in the right direction.  Their updates balance improving performance, graphics and content which is great to see.  Many early access games i have bought fail to keep such a balance so i have high hopes for this game.  The only thing that i have a problem with the game which i dont know if the developers can do much about, besides more marketing is the fact that i can never find an avalible public server to play on.  To me, this really takes away from the appeal.  Just somthing about playing with others, even if i am just going out on my own and having side conversations with others makes the game more fun.  Since this is early access and the pros way outweigh the cons, i would still definately reccomend this game, it definately stands out among all of the other ""survival crafting RPG"" like games that i have played or seen come out.

								I absolutely love this game. The atmosphere is what does it for me. You really feel isolated and alone (I mainly just play single player.) Every single thing you do and decision you make is based solely on your continued survival, and it's so much fun. I explored an (in-game) day and a half away from my main base, and getting back (srsly make a compass and trust it) was an adventure. I questioned myself, I wondered how long the night would last... and I was elated when my compass led me back to the ocean and the landmarks I built to get me back home.You can max out stuff to do fast enough, but the devs always seem to be adding more. I'm very much looking forward to what comes next.I can't stress the importance of a compass enough.			"

								Savage Lands, What a Huge Dissapointment. I've played for almost three hundred hours and have accomplished nothing except waisting my time on a bad build. Animals still glitch out sinking into the mountains. Still cannot kill KUR. Love the concept and would love the game, but there has to be a resolve. It was a great game with a great concept. I'm not fully understanding the updating when the updates are making this great game worse. Weapons suck compared to enemies, Armor sucks compared to enemies damage. How can you build dragon scale armor if you can't kill the dragon. The hunger aspect sucks. It's hard to enjoy the game when you spend two hours hunting for food to run out in 10 minutes. I have to hunt for the game host since they can't hunt on there own, due to the animals running from the  host. Animals kick wooden chest all over the place even inside a building. Can't build where I want or need to. Way to much sinew and hide. trash been is working better, but takes too long to empty and you can't get rid of your heads off your dead bodies. I could list alot more... I don't cheat on games. Is that what I have to resolve to just to play this game. What a joke.			"

								Rating: 10/10 (For an early access game) Pros: -A sizeable island to explore including abandoned towns, small camps, large ominus towers, etc.-Enough weapon/armor sets to have a sense of progression (Currently 7 armor sets and 20+ tools/weapons along with uniques)-Enough mobs for diversity (Also, with uniques)-Constantly evolving lore-Nice looking textures and models for everything-One of the most active and ""in-touch"" developers (They have a timer for the next update on the title screen and wonderful livestreams) -Developers look at suggestions from players-Ability to construct buildings-Host/join games and play with up to 8 other people Cons: -Issues you see in any other early access game (AI Issues, occasional lagging, lack of many features)-Servers disappear when full/ no dedicated servers(yet)-Quick progression (I have end-game equipment after roughly 13 hours of play)In, short this is a great survival game that has a nice balance of brutality and playability but it isn't for those who want to go strait into the action. It stands out compared to other games like it with it's backstory/lore and most of all its developers. I'm looking forward to seeing the future updates with new content.			"

								Savage Lands is one addictive, open-world survival game. From the moment you set foot on the beach and begin freezing to death, Savage Lands does not let up. Scavange the land, collect resources, build a shelter, fashion weapons and armor, because the beasties that attack by day, have even more dangerous counterparts at night. Skeleton's attack relentlessly the further inland you travel. Other horrors await the explorer as well. I only intended on playing a short while, just to get a feel for the game so I could write about it. I ended up spending 6 hours playing Savage Lands, before I realized what time it was. I had a blast with this game. Savage Lands is in Early-Access so they are making changes and developing it. Multiplayer is available for those interested, according to the website, so this should be of interest to anyone who wants to Co-Op, or PVP through Savage Lands.I would hope they eventually increase the crafting recipes and allow you to make more things. All in all, I think it is worth picking up even in early access, as they are definitely on the right track with the game.			"

Early Access Review
								Normally I wouldn't write full in-depth review for an early access game. It would be kind of unfair to do so considering the full experience of the game has yet to come. However there are things I would like to talk about and address to both new players and the developers.The best way to describe Savage Lands, it's like a combination between The Forest and Elder Scrolls.Keeping in mind that this game is early access, it does have its problems. Unlike the typical early access game where you usually experience connection issues, lag, glitches, etc. this game is actually pretty well built without these issues. Loads times are actually pretty phenomenal and there are little issue involving bugs/ glitches, at least from what I have experienced. A couple de-syncs every so often, however that is most likely becuase we had three players connected to a private hosted server via the same local connection. The main issue with the game is the lack in overall content however that is to be expected. In the feature list under the game description, there are two 'features' I would like to address.Robust Item Crafting and Intuitive Build System.Before I delve into the issues with these features, I would like to state that I am fully aware and understand that Signal Studios has not released all the content yet, hence 'early access', however at this time, the descriptions of these features are not accurate. Mind you, these are listed as ""Early Release Features"", which means that they were intentionally listed as features being currently in the game. I disagree.Robust Item CraftingCrafting works and it's not bad, however in the description for this feature it states ""Limitless Options"". There is a lot of potential with the crafting, so I have no doubt that the developers are going to be progressing the possibilities making this description more accurate, currently however, it's just to far from limitless for this description to be accurate. There are only a handful of craftable weapons/ tools and armor, and a good portion of them require harder to get and rarer materials. Intuitive Building SystemIf you have ever played The Forest, the building system is exactly the same. Its simple, but there isn't really much you can build other than a few structures. I would really like to see more structures added as well as customization, decoration, and more function added for the structures as well. As of right now, other than getting a couple of achievements  it's really not worth the time and effort to build anything. Find a pre-existing city on the map and make base, it will have everything you need already minus strong boxes.As for the rest of the listed current features, the descriptions are fairly accurate. The world is anything but forgiving and you never know when an enemy is going to charge at you out of nowhere unless you are in an open area and even then, if you aren't paying attention to your surroundings, you will find trouble pretty quick, or rather trouble will find you. The AI system is spot on and the combat is indeed brutal and can get pretty intense. Perhaps a little too intense. One minute you are chasing a deer, then suddenly you are fighting a Dire Wolf that popped out from the bushes. Next minute you are fighting a whole pack of them. But hey, what fun would the game be if the combat were too easy? The game certainly teaches you to stay aware of your surroundings. The game is more fun in multiplayer, albeit if you want more of a challenge, play solo. Overall, the game is very fun and addicting. I would even go as far to say it is the best early access game I have played to date, even with its limited content. With that said, there is still plenty to do while the developers are working hard to bring us more content. I actually would not mind collaborating with the developers and sharing ideas for future content, as this game has some great potential to be one of the best open world survival games to date and I would love to see this game succeed. So if any developers are reading this, feel free to add and/or message me. I would gladly share some ideas and options. Nonetheless, keep up the great work.			"

Early Access Review
								OK, I love this game and my first few weeks of owning it I could not play anything else. It has its own unique storyline and lore, The AI can be very challenging at first but you learn how to fight each type of mob you face as you progress to tougher mobs further inland on the island. You are shipwrecked on an old ancient island filled with ghost towns (not ghost) undead, mystical creatures and even Dragons. You hunt for food, deer, goats bear etc. and besides meat you need to farm skins and other things used for crafting. Crafting is fairly detailed, You can make better weapons and clothing, prepare food and even build structures to get you through the cold winter nights. Crafting is a key feature to this game and to get some of the better wapons and armor to craft you need rare ingredients from tougher AI to craft certain things. The game does a good job at building up to be able to kill the more tougher AI and so on.  As you build better armor and weapons you can fight tougher mobs and get better and more rare ingredients so you can build even better things to fight even tougher mobs and so on and so on. The balance in this respect is very good indeed.The game is going through a change right now, and it is for the better. The game is in the middle of an engine upgrade that touts a brand new map and a much better layout that improves the progression from being a noob to a full outfitted badass ready to slay some dragons.  The new map is a beta op-in and as a new player you will get the relativly bug free old map to start with until the conversion is complete. The devs have gone out of their way to ensure old toons can be carried over to the new map if this is something you want. (and I did) The old map is fairly bug free and very enjoyable the new opt in beta map, although MUCH better still hosts a lot of bugs and this is why it is opt in only. It is meant for veteran players who know the game and can give good bug reports.Now this review would be incomplete without makeing a point that I have never had the privledge to make in any other steam game. This game BY FAR has the best Devs around. They are here everyday. helping, answering, listening to feed back. If you ask a question you will often get more then one dev answering to it. They will go out of their way to listen to you, help you and listen to your feedback both good and bad. I want to give you two examples off the top of my head.1st, Someone had a bug that made him loose all his gear, Put it in the bug section. and was probably ok with laving it at that. Not for the Devs, They started an MP server gave him the info and replaced EVERYTHING he lost.2nd, My family went away for xmas and I was home alone and decided to get into the firewater and light myself up while I played some savage lands. I ran into a prob or question (do not remember which) at 2 am Xmas eve. and guess what, there was a dev there to help me out within 10 minutes. They should have been sleeeping or with family and friends for Xmas but they CARE so much about this game that even on Xmas eve they were there to support their customers.I can not tell you enough about the commitment to this game these devs have, it shows in the forums and in the love they have for this game itself.  If there was a reward for the best Devs in steam forums these guys would win hands down. We all know how toxic steam forums can get when customers are not happy and they are not getting answers and the devs are know where to be found. I have yet to find a toxic or even negative post in the forums for this game and it all starts from the top down. The game itself is great but the commitment and openess of these devs makes the atmoshpere around here second to none. Updates are very frequent. Every 5-10 days or so. The old map is no longer being updated and it is all on the new map. Of course this makes sence as the old map will be gone once the final switch to the new engine and map are complete. It is fair to say that if you are new and get the old map you are still getting a very complete game even for it being an early access title.  Starting on the old map is still a great play and in no means a lessor experience do to the fact it is no longer being supported. Of course there is nothing stopping you from opting in and starting off on the new map but I would not reccomend it yet. The old map is solid and complete and is a great way to learn the game in a relativley bug free enviroment. The game has great replayability and I expect great things from it for no other reason then how much the devs love this game. These guys are building a game for the love of seeing a game they made and to make it great, not for money or any of the other things some dev teams do to get their name out there or whatever. It is a SP and MP survival game that has been a great add to my collection of survival games I love. It has been a good 2 years for EA survival games for me with other titles like, The Forest, The Long Dark 7D2D and of course Savage Lands and just like the others I am happy to own this title in my collection. It is unique in its own way and well worth the price for an EA title and would be worth full retail of a finished game, if you get it on sale (like I did) it is a downright steal. If you enjoy survival games then I reccomend it, If you like supporting small EA dev teams then this is by far the most worthy team I have ever seen. Most of the EA titles I own I do not worry about, they will see the light of day and full release. But this one, I have never even considered anything otherwise. This dev team loves this game so much they would finish it in a coffee shop stealing free wi-fi whilst living on the street and panhandling for food money in order to see this game finished.Game 8.5-10Devs 11-10 "

								Will not be buying Early Access Games from steam anymore, too many games become abandonware and steam does not support its customers on this, they even leave the game up to get more of your money. Developers took down the website for Savage Lands and no word in several months, going to assume this one is yet another get your money and run game.			"

Early Access Review
								Critics, commends and suggestions:Okay, there are many things I have to say about this. Firstly, the game is amazing. My friends and I basically described it as „Minecraft meets Skyrim“ game, which, to be honest, is amazing. The whole progressing aspect of the game is very pleasing. The whole story of the game is nice (at least the story that's made for now), enemies are great (but I'd personally like to see many different types of animals and a whole ton of enemies to fight). Weapons and tools are cool and I expect more of the same sort. Overall, game is great and I hope that there will be many more things added.Commends:-Weapons are great, different types. You've taken attack speed in count, damage, building damage and special item effects (soul storm)-Many different enemies with different attacks and item drops -Overall graphics of the game are amazing!-Progressively advancing through the game-Amazing with friends-Structure building-Survival aspect (game can be harsh which, in this case, is good)-Weather aspect (snowstorms), maybe add in some other.Critics:-No fall damage (at least what I've witnessed)-Enemies should have more animations (attack, death, running, etc.)-Animations for certain actions (for example that you cannot simply take animal skin from inventory but rather skin the animal for it)-Not being able to place chests yourself (they basically just drop once you remove them from inventory and that's where they'll stay). Should be placable like structures, campfires.-No information to tell you when you armor is broken (which may be important in some fights)-Stacking of some items is low (I'm not having a problem with that but when you can't place chests the way you want and the amount of items you can collect, this, sort of, becomes a problem)-Getting more than plenty of some items that are required in only one or few recipes (Bear claws, pelts, bones (well, this isn't a problem because logically is that every animal has them but just put it as an example), blood of the brood, etc.)Suggestions:- I would like to see the ""Thirst bar"" which would be another variable that you'd have to take care of (I don't know much about developers' plans for the future, but if there ever will be something like a desert type area this could come in handy; also this is just a personal suggestion which would fulfill me personally but others may hate it... it's a situational thing).-Many more weapons with different effects (elemental weapons (fire, ice, poison, etc.), more types of ranged weapons (throwable axes, daggers, more bows, crossbows, etc.)-Many more different armors (light, medium and heavy category)-Shields (same as armors, light, medium and heavy, also from different materials, etc.)-Collectable herbs to make something like potions (maybe something to give some buffs like increased staming, strenght (more damage and ability to wear harder armor without penalties)-Speed penalty while overburdened (this would make game much more realistic)-Many more creatures that can spawn both during day and night which will add variety and much more droppable items that can be used to craft new and different things (humanoid, beast, animal, undead, lizard, etc. Types)-Mounts that can ease your travel (whatever that may be)-Dungeons of some sort (Caves, temples, ruins, etc.)-This may not be taken well because some games have added this and had problems because of it, and I myself am also sceptic about this, but you should consider adding some type of skill factor based on the amount of time using some tool or weapons (sort of like adjusting to your weapons, armor, and anything else) that can make farming easier for you.-Agriculture, growing your own plants (whatever that may be) could add variety to the game.-More tools (such as pickaxes, hoes and so on)-More special creatures (such as Kur, Helion, Lycor) that have their stories and that can be a challenge-add some sort of guideline structure (road signs) and maybe some sort of a blank map that you can draw yourself (with some sort of ink maybe)-Not sure how you feel about this but it may be nice to, along with complete blueprints for structures, add something like walls that you can place in a way to build a bigger house with more room and some inner decorations (something like a tavern or a guard post).-Smelting would be nice since you could smelt all the things you don't use anymore and get some extra from themI usually don't rank things that are in alpha, beta state or pre release but just for the sake, subjectively I'd rate it (on a scale from 1 to 100) a solid 90+ because of not so many things in the current state, so not a big deal. Haven't experienced any specific bugs or glitches. Game is running solid and the graphic settings are various and on max settings the game is beautiful. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes survival games.I know that you may be annoyed with all the „add more stuff“ and I know it's gonna be added but I had to say my word. I can't think of anything else at this moment but I'll be playing the game in the future and will see the further development. I also see that Developers are very interested in their community and listen to our suggestion, critics and commends. You guys do an amazing job and it has been my pleasure playing this game for more than 30 hours now and continuing into the future. Keep up the good work and if you want any more suggestion that I may think of in the future, I can always help you out. This game is an amazing jewel of survival games and I hope to see much more blossoming  for this seed you've planted.			"

								I really love the game and it is fun to play for about a day but after that it gets too easy and boring.Still worth the money too help the devs finish the game.There are constant updates and the devs actually respond in the discussion forums.It needs to be harder in my opinion. The game needs a larger variety of monsters and magical items. Always fighting the same thing is what I dont like.Maybe the map should have different biomes of different monster types. Also there should be some caves and dungeons to explore. A boat to go to another island when a player if finished on this island.This game has the potential to be one of the best fantasy survival games. "

Early Access Review
								You're an ugly, naked bald guy who wakes up on a frigid island next to some conveniently-placed starter gear.  The game has a definite learning curve, and it doesn't hold your hand much aside from the starter gear at the beginning and the codex that shows you what resources you need for the items you've unlocked thus far.  You'll probably die every night until you figure out what the hell you're doing, and even after that it'll continue to beat you down at every chance it gets.  You'll need to fight off starvation, wild animals, risen skeletons and the biting cold as you struggle to carve out a foothold in the unforgiving wilderness, from crafting a bow to hunt deer with to bulking up in armour and wondering how the hell you're supposed to kill the dragon on the top of the tower looming over the forest.  Rapidly becoming one of my favourite survival games, though while in early access there are still a few bugs that need to be taken care of.  I'm looking forward to playing it upon release.			"

								40 enjoyable hours in and I think Ive tapped out most of what can be done.  Only thing left is to grind for gear.  Played this both solo and multi and enjoyed both!  I did find the balance for resources was good until I had to start getting more High Quality ore.  That became the only turn off I had with this game.  Hell, this game had fewer bug and issues then the majority of the released games out now.  The world is massive, there is plenty to do and explore, and the Giants are a nightmare to solo.  Made me think of my Dark Souls playing days.  All in all this was worth the pick up even in early access.  Great job with this one and I look forward to returning to it in the future!			"

Early Access Review
								8/10This game not only has a lot of potential as an alpha, but it is already a ton of fun in its current state (as you can see from the hours I've spent on it).   Sure, it has a lot of content yet to be added, but the foundation that has been laid is quite extraordinary.POSITIVES:1) Graphics - Very high quality, professional looking graphics and models2) Sense of Progression - This is what drives the player to keep playing, and they've done it well.  Collecting resources to craft better weapons and armor, build bigger buildings, and make larger packs to increase carrying capacity.3) Variety of Enemies - Skeletons, wolves, plagued wolves, forest giants, dire bears, furies.4) Size of Island - The size of the world is quite large.  After 60 hours I can't say that I've explored the entire thing.NEGATIVES:(Keep in mind that many of these negatives may very well be resolved as the game develops)1) Grinding - Collecting resources can become a chore, especially mining.2) Limited Resources - The resources in this game do not respawn, but that may change in the future.3) Cost of Repairs - Many of the higher end weapons and armor are so expensive to repair and the resources required to repair them may be scarce, especially if you have several players on your server.4) Base Building - Right now, it's so easy to strip an area of usable resources that there is no reason to spend time and resources on base building since you'll just have to move on anyways.5) Map Reloads - Once you've stripped most of the island of resources the only way to keep playing is to load a new map.  Fortunately, you get to carry your character to the new map, but anything you've built is gone forever.			"

Early Access Review
								If you buy this game, make sure you do while it's on sale. In its current state, $25 is going to feel like a bit of a stretch. Here's the concept - It's Elderscrolls meets Rust. I think this is a good thing. While it's early access, most of the visuals are pretty good, with the exception of a few things that I would consider placeholders. The combat is a bit wonky and clunky; the mobs have a melee range that is crazy. Overall, the system needs some work and that should be expected in a lot of these games. My friend and I were having a good time and progressing until we ran into a bug with the storage box and that basically put an end to the session. I'm usually extremely cynical about Early Access games and think that is how most consumers should be, but I've already gotten my investment down to ~ $5 per hour of entertainment so far could probably get more. So there you go; in it's current state I wouldn't pay more than $15, but picking it up cheaper than that would be worthwhile.  "

( Should be able to fish or harvest fruits from trees).- Very little objectives besides staying alive and completing day one task.- Should have some quest or other clear and defined objectives.- Limited Amount of structures that can be built.

Early Access Review
								First off I just want to say this game would have a better overall rating if people did two things.1) Got into character. You're a hardened outcast on an unforgiving, icy and hostile excuse for an island. The game is not going to hold your hand or tell you how to play. You'll struggle. It'll be hard. That's an ongoing theme for this game. Don't buy if you're weak of heart.2) Used Google (other search engines are available). There are a plethora of people who have posted negative reviews based on performance issues. I encountered a solitary hiccup that was easily fixed, and there is a host of info outh there for dealing with other issues. Not to mention the devs update the game on a bi-monthly/monthly basis. The bottom line is thzt this isn't No Man's Sky, the game works, just work with it.On to the review: My pasty criminal scumbag by the name of WolfBait has yet to die. He has been bitten, stabbed, cursed bludgeoned, starved, frozen, poisoned and very nearly burnt alive by a grumpy dragon; but the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ just won't die. How you might ask? He's not your average cutpurse. No, WolfBait is smart. He knows his enemies attack patterns, he brings plenty of healing for when he is sloppy and he balances his gear around mobility and DPS. He also runs away a lot. No one said he wasn't a coward. But when you play this game, you aren't a hero, you're the garbage society has tossed away, come to thrive in the dumpster. And I love every second of it. If you think you can make it, I recommend you give this game a try. 8/10 Would be a dirtbag trash warrior again.			"

								first review ive written. its beause i really like this game. i really like the genre.this is for game update #26 i played the unpatched #25 and then moved to beta.good for the money if you dont mind waiting for new content. waiting for new content means you may have to start over but thats okay. thats the fun of the game, starting with nothing and working your way to sustainability.things about the beta patch that i like.-Land is easier to navigate.-dual weild is amazing but maybe over powered?-we got more rocks with a pretty decent amount of ores.-i like how theres more enemies but the first island is nearly harmless.-theres a stamina bar lets me know when i can run again.things that need some work-the interface, i like the old one thats in the top left corner. i do not like that cold and health are integrated. pre patch was better.cold shouldnt affect max hp and i think you should make the cold strongeragain. imo this is about survival make the player choose over defense or warmth.-i want this game to be HARD, i want to thank god that i have a friend to helpbut worried cause we need MORE food. right now i can walk around all day long.and most of the night. cause im munching on the countless wolf meats i got.-making wolves drop less meat would be nice. or make them stronger and lessabundant. that would make me worried when i hear a howl at night.-i cant fight the dragons besides shooting a thousand arrows at them.-fall damage, i can skyrim my way up anywhere and jump off freely.-the strongboxes suck cause i cant place them-sprint isnt long enough.things i would like to see added.-theres not enough content such as weapons and armor, everything feels verycondensed, you need more low level items, bone tools and such. it should take a while to become ""civilized"" i can do this within an hour or so.-i want to choice between warmer armor or higher defense. or possibly the optionto customize my armor by lining it with wolf pelts cause i have like 100 of them.-quests-enemies that are rare that build structures that create more mobs.-trapping would be neat, get nice furs and such that provide more heat and traps for bigger creatures or humans.-herbalism, i need remedies man. poisons. buffs like stimulants that make you harder to tire.run faster. or eat less.-maybe a metabolism, the higher fat % you are you get cold slower but move slower. keeps the playerfrom relying on food as a source of health.-sleep. we all need it.-hardcore mode?-i need something to kill deer more efficiently. like, if i hit them in the shoulder area or the head its a 1 hit.maybe arrows can cause bleeding on animals and a chance on humans. following a blood trailwould be cool. but there is a high population of deer.-wolves are working with skeletons to kill me, they dont eat deer.these are just a few of the things i would like to see. keep up the great work. hopefully i will get some feedback from the devs they seem pretty interested in what we have to say.

This is one game that actually has good ninja updates with large and pre-announced weeklyish on the main loading screen. NPC's - Everything attacks on sight with a decent detection radius, blinding whiteout snowstorms, great graphic's, scaling enemies from pigs, bears, wolf packs, skellies, night furies, giants to a dragon [not implemented in beta yet] and really user friendly UI. There's no questline as of yet but just staying alive here keeps you on your toes, health, cold, stamina and hunger all need constant monitoring. Yea it's EA and beta so there's bugs but hey , what game doesn't have glitches here an there. and the thing is you can see them disappear on a daily basis, I have an old i5 and gtx560 which runs this fine. Map loading is vry fast, with player an map saves usable in SP or MP. I have been nothing but impressed with this game from the get go. Jumping in with no knowledge whatsoever of how things worked I starved, froze and was eaten to death in quick succession many times. so funny. Now I roam the lands in armor and weaponry looted from once feared adversaries that I spent the 1st night cowering from in a chanced upon hut - lol. The communities great, Dev's are obviously involved an keeping a close eye on things. There's a lot more I hav'nt touched on, you can find out for yourself. So yeah, no complaint's or regret's whatsoever here. I absolutely recommend this game			"

Early Access Review
								I'm aware it may seem unfair to give a game a bad review with so little play time, but I feel I've gotten a good idea about everything there is to this game. If any developers are reading, I'd like to offer some constructive criticism. Conceptually this game is pretty unique, apart from the early access survival aspect. The atmosphere of waking up on the shore of a cold unforgiving island, plagued by undead creatures, and a dragon (which becomes ever so annoying once you realize it simply flies in circles for eternity) is truly awe-inspiring. Intrigued by the atmosphere you soon realize that there isn't much to offer upon exploring the crafting, combat, and building system. You will find yourself running back to the beach over and over trying to collect flint and other resources, which is very tedious. Simply, the game suffers from poor structure. I'm not sure if it is technical limitations caused by the game's engine, or the lack of experience from the developers. The map isn't big enough to leave any room for exploration, you simply spawn in and see what appears to be your main objective (the dragon). If you're going to leave this big of a gap in map design, atleast make it randomly generated. I recommend starting from scratch with the map, perhaps hire some new employees with the money generated from the Steam sale, maybe even invest in using a better game engine. It all just seems bland, next is combat; after interacting with some skeletons I discovered they had some sort of disability that allowed me to simply run to a safe distance, get a whack in and continue running. There needs to be a proper block and parry system, and more intelligent A.I. I hate to continue to bash, but I'm simply trying to conceptualize some ideas for the developers, so I can get my money's worth from this game. For example, the building. It's simply a bunch of pre-fabs, to build said pre-fabs you must go spam left click countless trees until you die of old age. After you've collected enough resources to build your desired structure, you simply spam ""E"" until this structure magically appears. (This system is similar to that of The Forest"". Referring to the gathering of resources, perhaps players could create a lumber-mill of sorts allowing for increased productivity in wood gathering, and rather than running to the beach to collect flint, you could find nodes (these nodes should respawn eventually) scattered across the map. But, once again with the size of the map, after building your pre-fab riddened village of nothingness the wilderness becomes barren due to the lack of trees. Ultimately, this game needs a fresh-start. I do not intend to insult any developers, I simply would like to see this game to shine in the way it should.			"

								It is a survival game, uh? Don't we have already bunch of those?Compared to other survival games that have shown up recently, this is only survival game that does not feel like a joke.Pros:- First time playing, it is hard to stay alive, even if you try really hard.- Day night cycle is just right length.- You have to plan ahead, when to build shelter, when to get firewood, when to hunt etc... if you don't, well... lets say that the adrenaline I get from almost dying... is rewarding.- Crafting system is intuitive, no outside documentation needed.- Item repairing costs seems mostly balanced.- You never know how though the monster is that you are facing for the first time, until you win/die.- Savefiles are automatically saved in steam cloud- Community management of this company is 10 / 10 (not kidding)- I haven't found bugs in this gameCons:- Combat system is too simple- No possibility to create dedicated servers- Work in progress (well duh, its early access, don't expect it to be a complete game just yet)- Game is based on older version of Unity game engine, thus performance is lower on Linux than on Windows, but game is still playable on ""fast"" graphics setting. (engine will be upgraded in far future)First time I played this game I was just happily running around until I froze to death.I once went mining for some ore at night. . . . ONCE.8 / 10And I want to believe it gets even better than that :3			"

								I really want to love this game but right now it is an unfinished, buggy piece of work. Animals that don't fight back, snow coming through house walls, no npcs, barely any cool boss mobs, no alchemy, no sorcery, lag, takes ages to run around, only a couple houses to build,, no thematic music no castles, etc. This game has so much potential to be great but as of now it is a half baked mess. 3/10 in current state, save your cash.

								This game is one of the few that captures almost everything I want in a survival-style game. I don't really see why people say it's SO difficult though. It's not easy, but it won't kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you play conservatively and don't run around in your underwear swinging a hatchet at a dragon. Focus on survival, and you'll find a rewarding game filled with crafting, building and exploration.Also deserving a special mention is the amount of work the devs continue to put into this game. There is a counter on the main menu telling you when the next update is coming... There have been a huge number of updates since I've owned this game. It's not perfect, there are still some rough edges but it's getting better every day.			"

 Early Access Review	  31.5.2015	Okay, guys...It looks like just another Open World Survival Game.And that is exactly what  Savage Lands	 is.But it's damn well set in scene, for an early access game.It's like this:You stranded on an island.And everything that is not you (or another player),  Wants. To. See. You.  DEAD.	 •There's a huge♥♥♥♥♥dragon that will wreck your♥♥♥♥♥♥if you don't watch out.AND the night's even more dangerous.•Now,besides all the monsters and wild animals that want to devour your mortal soul for whatever reason, there's yet the cold and hunger that you have to fight.•You HAVE to hunt and that pretty often, which means you can't just build a base and stay there,hoping for deer or something to pass by.•Your houses/leantons/fireplaces or whatever you use to scare off or fend against wild animals will soon be able to get wrecked too by mentioned monsters.•It's really hard to keep a good sense of orientation too, since you only have a little, pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ compass that you can craft and the dragon towers to set as markers, if you don't place down a totem or torch or whatever as ""breadcrumbs"".All in all, for newcomers, this game's tough as nails without a dull end.And for those who know their way around in this game already, it'll become harder too, since there's a lot to come.It's a refreshing challenge from all those easy games out there that just want to give you the feeling of satisfaction through unbattled superiority, which is not what a survival game is about. Savage Lands	 brings back the good ol' feeling of insecurity that keeps you alerted at all times,because you know that whatever might come around- it wants to kill you.There's even that handy Countdown on the main menu that displays when the next update comes.There are a few little bugs here and there and the servers are not yet working so well, but it's still in work, guys.If you're too impatient to wait for it to be fixed and expanded,don't buy early access games. Summary	 Graphics- [7/10] 	•I've seen better, but there sure will be a lot of modders coming to give it HD patches etc. It doesn't change that the game is fun.•Sometimes when you equip a chestplate, but don't have boots or gloves yet, your ankles and wrists are simply not there. And sometimes even your whole head is gone when you equip a helmet, so you have to relog to fix it. Gameplay- [7/10]	It's early access,I know but I'm rating the game on it's current state.•The moveements tend to be a bit cluggy here and there. •It happens that you bug into the floor sometimes, so you have to walk up anything to get out of the floor and be able to jump again.•Super Air Launch when a wolf rushes at you sometimes. World- [6/10]	•It's yet only forest,coasts, some abandoned villages/ruins and the dragon towers. It lacks some natural structures like caves or rivers. And some new biomes would be cool. The frosty and snowy forest tends to become boring after a while. Bugs/Glitches- [7/10]		•For an early access game,there are surprisingly few bugs and glitches. The ones I noticed so far are listed above in the gameplay and graphics part,since they only affect those parts of the game. Nothing gamebreaking. Challenge- [9/10]	•Absolutely great. It's a fair but yet cruel world that will have you dieing very often at the start. But if you get to the end game items, which can happen very quickly, it tends to become a little boring,since the last challenge would be bosses somehow. But there's a lot to come that will have you ragequitting because you lose all your end game stuff to cruel new badasses of monsters. Multiplayer- [7/10]	•Hosting a game is easier than ever. Click ""Host Game, choose char, choose/create map, game's open and joinable for whoever you set it for. You can even ban/kick players already, which I don't see very often in early access. On the other side somehow, the ping display doesn't tell you a lot yet and if you're from europe with average internet,you'll have lag issues on Servers hosted in US. Dedicated Servers are non existant yet. End Rating- [8/10]	People who would rather have a game with full content right away, rather than waiting for it to grow in steps should not buy this or any Early Access game.People who like to have an actual influence on how the game grows and who can stand small bugs here and there-This game's something you should definitely buy.I bought it for 14,99€, but I would've paid 25€ to be fair.It's really worth it.

Early Access Review
								*Warning this is an early access game*Savage Lands is the more fantasy counterpart to Hitherland Studio's ""The Long Dark"".The main goal like that game is to survive either by yourself. The only notable difference is you can team up with other players as you carve out a living in this world. The only negative issue about this game is the framerate. Unless you have a great PC rig, prepare yourself for a lot of lag and a lot of studdering about. I would like to add that the save system in this game is like the Long Dark, where there is none it is relied upon certain actions or exiting to the main menu, possibly when the days go by as well. (Now this part about the ""save"" feature, might change as well. If the developers decide to add a save feature).The game also gives you a supplies list. For what you need in order to craft that particular object. (Now i say this now, but maybe the developers will get rid of this aspect in a future update. So this part of the review will probably change). This game isn't brutal like the Long Dark where every minute, second, hour could be your doom. But finding things in this world could take a while to find. So consider that to be your ""every x could be your doom"".This game has modding potential. But in my opinion, if this game is tuned just right. You won't probably need mods for this game. Maybe translation mods, but not actual mods.The developers like Hitherland Studios. Are very active and supportive of their fanbase. If you have any suggestions, issues, etc. Ask them and they will answersIf you love Hardcore survival games particuarly taking place in a fantasy setting. This game is a recommend. "

								This is a pretty great survival game. I loved the great de-forrestation it took to build my Mead Hall. My friend hunted for food and minerals to keep my tools and stomach well supplied for the undertaking while I chopped down a whole damne forest.HOWEVER:The game lacks content as of the time of this review. Less than 10 hours in and quite a bit of the content has been explored already. Date written: 7/4/2015UPDATE:I recently played this game again and found it abounding with new content. The developers have clearly put in quite a bit of time to enhance and extend the content. I find my interest in this game revitalized and going strong. Great work so far. I am looking forward to exploring even more and discovering all of the new things added to the game. One thing I do not like but understand why they did: the start of the game is so much easier than it used to be. The devs left drops of supplies and put you directly next to a cotton farm. I would suggest placing the player a bit farther away from that little starting farm. Date edited: 7/2/2016			"

								Potential abandonware that's in a perpetual state of being broken / borderline unplayable, the developpers of this have a tendency of going 1 step forward then taking 2 steps back, never settling on mechanics or the playable terrain and then ""revisiting"" them while breaking vital elements of the game and taking decisions that are outdated.I would not recommend this under any circumstance as of today until the developers show interest and competence, the latter which has been more than lacking for the past year.Conan Exiles, Subnautica and The Forest are all much better candidates in every ways, with a large emphasize on The Forest.

								I'd recommend this game to anyone as long as they realize it's got that sorta crappy, never-gonna be finished feel. It's not some fantastic alternative to skyrim or minecraft, but it's fun enough to warrant a couple dozen hours of time to kill.If you get it on sale, or you have a few bucks to spend, get it. If you are looking for a game to invest a lot of time into, or you're on a budget, don't.It's got challange nailed down. Progression is slow, but it feels rewarding, even though it is incredibly monotanous. Armor and damage is fairly ridiculous, since you will go from knocking out enemies in 1-4 hits, while it takes a mob of them to kill you, to a goblin-looking fellow that can knock you down in an instant, while your attacks do nothing. Mobs now seem to freeze at random, especially the dragon, which will get stuck in the sky off in the distance. There are several spots which will get you stuck, which makes that map unplayable for that character, unless you kill yourself. PVP is sorta fun, though I haven't explored it thoroughly.Overall, its a crappy game, but I have fun playing it.			"

								This game seemed to have potential about 6 months ago when I first bought it with my friend. We got pretty far and it was fun. We decided to boot it up again and restart to check out all the new content. But for some reason you added a god damn super dragon that kills you every 5 minutes. We bled and cried and sweated our way to the next area through a portal after getting the key from lord kruul and thought we were rid of that accursed dragon, buy were we wrong. After dying about 10 more times from in an hour we were done and not happy. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING.OH and be prepared to spend many hours mining because it is slow as balls.			"

								This game is amazing.End of Story, or is it?Prosso savage lands atm the an amazing game, no question there. it is very entertaining, and for early access has little bugs.it has an amazing community, when i first logged on me and my friend started a server and couldnt find each other, then this other guy joined and helped us out then gave us leather armour to start us off, and as such i have done the same for many other people to repay the favour that, that random guy did.its Dev's are also amazing, streaming weekly and constantly updating to community as well as listening to them and taking their ideas.the Dev's also have amazing future plans for the game and unlike some other early access games, i do not see them ditching this game once more people buy itKur, Simply Kur...Conshonestly the only cons in this game is because its early access.while it has amazing game play you may get bored from the tough farming.kinda boring if you pay by your self.some people that have no life (like my self) may find it alittle boring, as after 30 hours, or alittle less you may find your self with nothing to do. (i would like to note that my friend and i made a massive town, of 32 buildings, and spent about 3 hours just jumping from roof to roof, and trying to get to one end to the other (note we succeded after alot of rages xD)) other than that if you just wait for the updates every week - 2 weeks youll have a great time with this game.

Navagation can be tricky  and forgetting to set your respawn location can result in possible hours of trying to run back to your corpse naked.Ahhh Brisk.

								Right from the beginning I was hooked. Love the atmosphere, the sounds and feel of it are great. The building and survival aspects are just what I was looking for, coupled with the combat and co-op games even make it better. Yes, there are a few things that need to be tweaked, but it's an early access, so give them time.A couple of things I hope they might consider.....the food intake doesn't seem that even, I seem to be needing to eat way too often and yes I know it's cold, but I took winter survival training in the Army and never ate that much. Would love to maybe add a sleep option at night, the chance to build outer walls or mini palisades with a gate and for a few of my female gaming friends the option to have a female character seems to be on their minds. I'm sure they have a great many things they are working on and I am looking forward to each and everyone. All in all, a great game to explore, build in and share with friends or just visit other peoples worlds. Keep up the great work.			"

								beautiful game, graphics and scenery are stunning.game can get too easy once you know what you are doing, but starts out with a Guaranteed to Die format. there is a steep learning curve, but when you get to the top, you pretty much prove the quote from the matrix ""Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus.""this game is still (at the time of writing this) early release... so keep that in mind... if the designers add some to the end game, or hike it up a bit, this will be one to watch... the team working on this game also seem to be working actively to add features and update - something lacking in a lot of other early access games.

								If I could give a neutral review I would. The game has a lot of potential but right now it is frustrating to play. There is no map and when you die you lose everything. Finding your corpse again is bloody hard. When you die you lose everything so then you need to wander around till you find more equipment laying on the ground so you can start over. You can not build even the most basic equipment without killing a NPC which you can't do without equipment. A nasty catch 22. There is little to no help available on the game so its a matter of stumble around and try to figure stuff out on your own. Food is super scarce unless you can fight and kill NPC's and even then you get very little. The food itself does not fill you much and you end up eating the equivalent of about 2-3 wolves before you are full. Also most NPC's gang up on you. If you kill a wolf don't bother looting it a skeleton will be attacking you in seconds or another wolf.  Also items decay at a rediculas rate. You wear shoes and expect them to be gone in about 30 minutes play time. The same with all armor, tools and weapons.This is a real early release so I am hoping that some of these things will be addressed.I realised I mentioned all the negative stuff and its not all bad, the game really is fun to play when you actually get to play. I like the crafting though its very basic I am sure it will be fleshed out soon enough. I think if we could spend more time exploring the game it would be great. Maybe better players than I are able to do that. I am by no means a pro gamer. I just play for the fun of playing. I love games where you have to survive off the land so to speak but I do like the idea of being able to do more than just survive.Just know that it is so very early release that it is frustrating at times. If you are asking yourself if you should buy it. I say sure why not, if you have the cash go ahead and support the coding team and see how it goes. It has some amazing potential I can't wait till see how it turns out.			"

			Savage Lands: Early Impressions (Early Access RPG sandbox survival, gameplay and review) Savage Lands impression made on: Version 0.2.5 Build 16561 Savage Lands is an Early Access open world sandbox...		

Savage Lands attempts to blend RPG with open world sandbox survival. You'll be struggling to look for food, shelter, and assorted materials for crafting like most other survival games, but within an RPG setting. You'll be facing off against dire wolves, skeletons and dragons just to name a few.The concept of melding RPG with survival seem so obvious, and being a fan of both genres, I'm happy to see Digital DNA taking a shot at it. The survival mechanics would be something I would compare to The Forest, chopping down trees, and crafting your own little village while fending off monsters. It pulls it off quite well, even at this early state of it being on Early Access. There are plenty of things to craft and a fair amount of wild life and monsters to hunt. While the survival aspect is done relatively well, the RPG elements that it tries to fuse does leave the player wanting. There's no XP to gain, not many stats to min-max, no story to speak of, or characters skills to customize. Basically if you're looking for an RPG experience, you might be disappointed. The best way to look at Savage Lands is to think of it purely as a survival game in an RPG setting.Visually it goes with a realistic aesthetic. It's not overly unique looking, but does the job. It does show a degree of graphic fidelity, as the landscape is well populated with foliage, and at certain time of the day, the lighting can impress. The game also shows a weather system and a day night cycle that's done pretty well as far as visuals are concerned. It's nothing too memorable, but it's not too hard on the eyes either.Overall, Savage Lands shows potential and is already quite playable. Mechanically it might not be the most original game in the world, but it is very competent in what it's trying to achieve. Don't go in expecting an RPG experience, instead, expect a survival experience and I think many would enjoy what it has to offer.Pros:- Survival gameplay in an RPG environment can be very interesting to explore- Stable, playable, and enjoyable from right on launch- Lots to craftCons:- RPG elements are weak- Combat uninspired			"

								Due to its low performance I can't recommend it to anyone at the moment. I tested the game with a GTX 1060 6GB and an i5 6600k (full specs can be found on my profile). I hardly get over 30 fps on extreme settings, but even when everything is on low the average FPS is between 30 and 50 fps.  For comparison, I can run Arma 3 (Multiplayer) on Ultra with up to 140 fps.			"

								Another one of those ''Has potential games'' and it's true, it could be... but not in the near future. Once you get a few items e.g a house, axes and some food that's basically it. Theres not even one little objective to go for and that's even if you make it that far.... there's so little to survive on that you'll probably die 2-3 times before you get anywhere and when you do it's simply not worth it. I'd like to enjoy this game but right now it's just not happening. WAIT UNTIL FULL RELEASE.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is not ready to be offered to the public, even as early access. This could eventually be a Long Dark/The Forest type game with dragons, but I think this team had a neat idea, no money to make it happen, and figured, ""eh, screw it, lets offer a first round build for some capital."" Does this remind anyone of, say, Towns? I WANT to like this game, and as the build version grows, it suggests they're working on it... but come back in 6 months (like I plan to) and try it then. I plan to revise my review, if enough progress is made come July. If not, it'll stay as is.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is part of a series of survival realism games which have floaded the market recently.This game does have a few noted perks however;1)  Nice graphics2)  Working (although a little buggy) mulitplayer for more than 4 people3)  Reasonable netcode, allowing you to actually hit what you're aiming at4)  Tough, but not unreasonable creatures5)  Grinding is realistic (and lots of upgrades)6)  Great multiplayer (with friends) upscaling.  Meaning that if you're the last to start playing the game, your friends can get you up to speed easily enough.It lacks;1)  Any real range weapons (big draw back and I don't see why)2)  Some minerals are hard should have alternate methods of creation (coal for example, could be made by burning logs)3)  Enough wildlife (food can be a problem after the starting arrea)4)  Wildlife does not spawn fast enough.Given all of the above, the creators have made great strides since its creation some years ago and I see this becoming a great LAN party crowd pleaser.To promote more servers, it may be worthwhile creating more time based mineral and food gathering tools.  This would increase the amount of active servers and held promote more active game play.Good fun game though :)			"

Early Access Review
								I can understand that there would be a lot of things missing as it's early access, but the devs need to ask themsleves where this is headed. Very basic atm and plays like any other survival/crafting game.""Brutal Combat"" -- it isn't. The only brutal thing about it is getting azzrammed by a pack of wolves that have longer reach than you do. Make the combat actually brutal. Blood effects are poor, the sounds aren't visceral, animations are sub-par (aren't even ragdolls lol) and all you do is click click click like Skyrim. C'mon guys this is called SAVAGE LANDS, make the combat SAVAGE. Add some mad combat effects like blood splatters and sick, bassy growls from the wolves, groans to the skeletons, give the dragon a roar, make me afraid to go out into the wild. As for combat it really does feel like a basic Skyrim. You need a way to differentiate it combat gameplay wise otherwise if I wanted a repetitive click combat game with survival elements I'd just add a couple of mods to Skyrim and it'd be a more comprehensive game than this would ever be. Do something like Ryse or SoM, or even LoZ (each enemy has a weakness you need to exploit). Change it up for each creature. Wolves? Use a torch in one hand to keep them at bay while you swing with your weapon. If it's a pack, have them stay back growling and one jumps in to atack you every now and then. Skeleton? Aim for it's legs so it becomes slower and has less reach. etc.All the weapons feel the same, too.Add a crouch/prone option so that when you spot the dragon (or even other hostiles) you can lay down and not get spotted and rekt instantly, allowing you to wait for it to fly out of range. Make me feel like I'm actually trying to survive.Add a realistic mode. Allow the players to select an actual 1:1 24 hour mode with hunger that takes a few hours to develop. This would be awesome and would actually make the game diffuclt in the right way. Instead of continuosly having to hunt, you can put it on the backburner and actually plan out exploring the wilderness so you don't get gangbanged by wolves.You don't need a whole hand dedicated to a compass, either. Make it a hotkey, you press it and his left hand goes down and comes up with the compass untill you let it go or press the button again, at which point it goes back down and comes back up with whatever you had equipped before pressing the hotkey. Animations are pretty crummy and it would be cool if you made enemies ragdoll upon death instead of those average death animations you have now that remind me of the horrible dragon death and spin death animations in Skyrim.tbh I was going to write way more, but I realised the chances of the game improving or being differentiated from other games is very unlikely.tl;dr: even if you want this game, don't buy it. Install some survival and realism mods in Skyrim, turn the difficulty up and play that instead while you wait to see if this becomes any good.			"

								Game Review for Savage Lands early Release 0.2.6Cons    -Random spawning without admin controls to bypass    -Difficult ""if you dont like that kind of thing""    -Graphics are a bit dated (vegetation wise) ""the art for the sky and sunset is balls to the walls amazing though""    -Running up hills causes you to collide with environment ""worst bug in game IMHO, And obiously will be fixed by release""    -Not quite optimized yet ""bust out your good videocard""    -No clear purpose or story element ""your marooned on an island... cool, now what?""Pros     -Hit boxes are solid ""no guessing where you need to attack or dodge when fighting""    -Crafting is satisfying ""large list of craftable armors, weapons, and buildings with stuff still being added""    -Aweasome environment, ""captures the feel of an island off the coast of Scottland or something awesome""    -RPG element.    -Craftable spawn points ""for when the dragon kills you""    -Persistant character save over different servers    -Dragon!    -Undead Stuff (wolves, skeletons)    -Dragon!!     The game has the look and feel of an Elderscrolls game, it needs magic and projectiles but we have been promised this and more. The graphics aren't top of the line (minecraft anyone) but with this kind of solid gameplay from a game that updated already with countdowns to next release, I cant help but indorse it. 15 hours into this game and i've already had adventure after adventure with strangers from the web and friends i know in RL. There is currently a lack of any questing other than a page of to-do's that one should try when first arriving, but this only leads to the assumption that the devs are going to install some sort of purpose for the character for being on the island other than a marooning. most likely this will be a quest line and series of bosses. I definitley indorse this game for merging RPG elements with the craft/survive genre, and I cant wait for the release of the dev promised bow and arrow! :DD     Buy this game if you like the Survival crafting games like Rust, and H1Z1 but are looking for a more fantastic theme like Skyrim. $25 for the game seems a bit steep for how much content is offered so far but it is alpha early access and if the devs put half as much content in this as bethesda did skyrim i would shell out a full price $60, but there just isn't that kind of content yet. craft, survive, and fight monsters is as far as the devs have really gotten. Nailing down a solid game before gorging it with content seems to be the path Digital DNA is taking.			"

Early Access Review
								There are already a lot of precise reviews out there, so I just want to mention some major points, which made my gaming experience really bad.But first, let's be honest, this game is far away from being garbage - but it is not good either.The approach to the genre, the setting and the core gameplay mechanics are good and fun and the game has huge potential. Thing is, that I strongly doubt, the devs will be able to address all issues before calling it a day and releasing an unfinished product.As of now, this is early access and here are the major points, why I started to hate this game:- Multiplayer: Not playable as of now. The game get's unplayable, once players starting to spread out - not to mention the odd process to configure a server.- Lack of depth: No content, no challenges, just random deaths and a running simulator. Fun for an hour - pure suffering after that.- Bad game design: Fighting/AI is not fun at all, loot- and inventory-design are more a joke than a feature, world is way too large and grinding is all you can do right now. If you die, it means, you have to get back to your corpse, which is most of the time a huge mess and can take forever, because you either freeze, starve or end up as a snack on the ten-hour march back to your corpse. One day in the field and your equiment is completly destroyed and needs to be rebuild, which is okay in the beginning, but get's really annoying later on. Equiment should last way longer than it does right now. It feels like a mechanic to prolong the suffering through this game.- Bugs and crashes: This is early access, I get it, but guys, really? There are graphic-bugs, before you even enter the main menu! I wanna keep it short, so I won't go into detail, but I could spend more time with bug reports than with game content.- Graphics: There are a view highlights, like chopping down a tree or watching the dragon, but the rest of the game feels dead and lacks all kinds of detail. It feels like the devs stopped working on it at some point to reach out for money even sooner.All in all I wanted this game to do well, but it didn't. It had a fair price during the sale, but it is weak compared with nearlly any other game of the survival genre.Update 1:I am really impressed by the response time of the dev team.It seems like they really care and are trying hard to make the game better.Right now I don't like the current state of the game, but this game might have a bright feature, if the Dev team is willing to work hard on it!

Early Access Review
The GoodSavage Lands is an early access game that has a lot of potential, just as many games in EA do.  The game is already playable and enjoyable to some extent if you like a great challenge. The crafting system is well implemented giving you a wide variety of items to craft such as food, clothing, armor, weapons, and enough building designs for a small town if you can live long enough to gather all of the materials. The graphics look decent, not great.  The hands and the animation for eating need some attention. The gameplay is smooth for the most part and I did not run into any bugs during my time in game which hasn't been much.  The enemy AI also seems decent from what I have experienced so far. The BadHowever, the game is plagued with the same faults that plague many survival games.  Savage Lands currently requires that you gather items at such a high rate due to hunger, cold, sickness, & injury that neither your desire to explore nor build is satisfied due to you ultimately meeting your doom if you choose to do anything other than search for supplies. Did I mention that you start naked so as you can imagine, inventory management is also an issue.  Note to the DevsThis game has a lot of potential. Howevr, I would like to see the following changes so people have a chance to explore, craft and enjoy this game as pve or pvp without the constant grind of resources being so vital. If the game presents itself as to much of a grind, people will be less like to play it after initially burning out on the contant grind for supplies. So making small changes could improve the gameplay experience while keeping the survival element in place to present a challenge other than the enemy AI and other players. First, the need to eat greatly reduced. People can go several days without food and water.  You should not need to eat every few mins to stay at peek stats. Every 30 mins to an hour would be more reasonable. Keep the need to eat more in line with other survival titles so people have more to do than just focusing on eating or building fires which leads to my next area for improvement. Next, the element of the cold environment which truely makes this game challenging, needs to be less harsh. For example, you become susceptible to illness which deteriorates your health at a slower rate, lets say 10-20 mins, rather than dying a few mins after hitting 0 on your cold meter if you can't get to or build a fire in time and get rest. Also, the torch should provide some warmth and so far as I can tell at the moment, it either does not or does very little.  If the cold is so severe in this environment, I would think we would have been better equipped upon being ship wrecked there.  Granted, so long as you have a hammer and an axe, building a fire is not too difficult, but my point is the current design is a bit much to truly enjoy the experience I believe is hinding in plain sight. Last, servers period.  I did not see any servers in the menu when I started my game so I hosted my own.  This may have been a bug but during my hour and a half of gameplay I did not have anyone join me.  This could have been due to firewalls, but honestly I do not know it the current build even allows one to join others accross the net.  Servers are needed for people to enjoy this game for co-op and pvp. Final VerdictI do recommend this game if you want a challenge and  understand this game is in EA and may turn out to be great or a great disappointment. Otherwise wait for the game to go on sale as I did or for the finished game prior to buying.			"

								Unfinished game - definitlyBugs - who hasn't seen goats flying in mid air?!More bugs - Don't get me started on those skeletons...Performance issues, crashes etc - happens yesOptimisation needed - hell yes!Verdict would I recommend the game - well yes.This is an unfinished game that has received numerous, regular updates from the developpers and continues to change and improve in leaps in bounds. Yes I appreciate that at times improvements to content impacts negatively on the performance of play but this can be compensated for in the settings sometimes, and at worst you can just wait until the next update. I have followed this game for some time and have had my fair share of frustrations, but this is not a completed product. If you come to SL expecting a AAA polished game you will be sorely disapointed and no doubt write a poor review. Remember this as a work in progress from a smaller studio, who enjoy trying out different game balances (remember those hordes of wolves who would chew up your newbie self the moment you spawned on Snowmere?! Miss those days). So go enjoy shooting boars, dying of cold or starvation, mining until you little axes break, screaming when you FPS drops to 2, and don't forget to check back for the updates. :)			"

Early Access Review
								Honestly, when I originally got this game, I thought it was all right. There wasn't much to it aside from survival, and I knew it was early-access, so I went in knowing that the finished product would probably take a while. I was pretty surprised when I went in plenty of updates later, and was faced with some pretty cringeworthy animations. I would like to like this game, but I can finally see just how far from finished it is. I really hope the developers do continue to improve the game, but for now, I can not see any progression over the months I've owned this game. Given, I haven't played it much, but I can at least see the issues. Anyways, for a quick summary:Pros:Nice sound-effectsPotentialNice RPG feel to itExceptional contentCons:Animations are wonkyHitting things doesn't have ""heft"" to it. You can't really feel like you're doing anything to the enemiesThe threat of death doesn't seem all that threateningLack of character customization (that's a personal taste for sandbox games)As for something that I found hilarious: There's a nudity option for your character (there's only the option for a male character).

								While this game has a lot of content packed into it, I still feel it comes up short in some aspects. I have some very memorable experiences on this game and I am happy to see that the developers are steadily updating it. I feel like this game has some major room for improvement but it is getting there and is heading in the right direction. While it doesn't feel like much, this game will keep you enthralled for hours. Would I recommend this game to people? Yes! Why? This game's single player is tough but fun, but it gets a whole lot better when a clusterf!#k of you're friends are messing around and building villages to live in and makes (depending on the nature of you're friends) gathering resources much easier when spread out among each other.

								I bought this game a long time ago, played it once or twice, and it sucked, so I uninstalled it but decided against refunding it because I had hoped it'd be worked on and improved. I thought it had enough potential to keep in my library, and I hoped the devs would tap into that potential and make something cool.I was hoping to later reinstall it and find a better experience, but all signs seem to point to this game being abandoned, which is a shame and makes me regret not getting my money back.This is a problem with Early Access titles. You buy 'em, try 'em, see potential and decide to give the devs time to improve the game, only to have the refund timer run out and the devs abandon the game and run away with your money... While I admit that's not always the case, it is the case with Savage Lands.Don't give them your money. The game was never worth it, and will never be worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								First off, at the time of me writing this review, be reminded this game is in Alpha and has only just been released on Steam as an Early Access game. Therefor make sure you know what this means and implies before buying this game!I am happy to see that this game gets a 'very positive' response in the reviews, but I also notice a lot of complaints, negativity, opinions without proper explanation and more on the forums, Live streams and other media. This is a shame and in my opinion totally not needed. This game is certainly not finished yet (Alpha says it all), may contain bugs, could be unbalanced, lacking content and whatever else needed before this game may or may not become a final release. Taste differs as well, so you may or may not like this game, so be it. Personally I love survival games, but I would like to see a certain degree of difficulty as well which I feel many of the similar 'survival' games tend to lack. I found this game through a reddit post and it right away caught my attention. I looked into it some more and certainly liked what I saw and read about this game. Then I got lucky to receive a key to try the game just before Early Access release on Steam and as a 'tester' felt obliged to actually test and report any issues.So far I have been really enjoying this game as is, knowing it is still in early stages. The atmosphere is very good with the graphics, environment, sounds, weather conditions, (mostly hostile) animals and creepy monsters. Menus and overall GUI is pretty good and I love the unlocking system for new items to craft as you progress in the game. It is hard to survive in those conditions in this environment and forces you to pay really good attention to many things. The game does feel intuitive and logical most of the times. Gathering resources next to staying alive is pretty tough at first, often learning the hard way but certainly possible. My first impression is certainly very positive and I like where this is going according to the developers and discussion with the community. The involvement of the developers with the community is great and worth mentioning when it comes to a game that is still in its alpha stages.However, at the moment a lot of content has yet to be implemented. Many bugs still need fixing and balance sure needs some tweaking here and there. The environment can use more variety and villages look pretty damn similar. This would make it easier to figure out your location in the world without the need of a map (please no, it's survival after all). The fighting and animations with it can use some improvement. Being able to abuse death without losing anything needs fixing. At the moment, I have pretty much seen it all (apart from the Tree creature) and been able to craft all after plenty of hours put into this game with great enjoyment.I would sure recommend this game if you are into tough survival and like where this game seems to be heading. It is however far from finished yet, keep that in mind. Make sure to post any issues/bugs as well as suggestions, join the discussion, because we are also part of what this game may become.  Although no certainty, the future seems to look great!			"

								Me and a couple of friends found this game on sale and decided to try it out, what followed was a weekend of fun gaming with 5 dudes... but thats about it.This game has an amazing concept, the lore is good and gameplay is really enjoyable.But as you can see.. it took us about 15 hours on a multiplayer server with 5 guys to complete everything we could.We even got as far as to trying to kill the dragon... but at the time it was bugged and could not be killed.Do i like this game?  -Yes!Do i recommend this game?- No. if you wanna play a survival Skyrim just mod Skyrim (wich if you are considering this game you mot likely have)If not then go ahead and buy this game!there isnt actually anything bad i can say about the game since it still hasnt been finished, but the makers have been abit lazy the past couple of months so im fearing that they will never fully finish this.TL:DRThis is a Skyrim-like open world survival game wich doesnt have that much content at the time, but you can sink a easy 40 hours into it solo and a easy 20 with friends trying to complete it.I dont recommend buying this, but i recommend it as a game.hopefully the makers put in more effort, because this game has potential.

								This game was fun in the beginning, it was what you'd think mostly of surviving and building shelter for yourself. But I've had this game for awhile now and really it gets so boring after while. I find myself walking around for a very long time finding nothing but deer and skeletons and boring out of my mind.This includes (night/day) both times of the day. There aren't many weapons or tools in the game.... With all my hours I've only seen a handful of good monsters. I would not buy this game anticipating for you to play it for very long. This game has potential although and if it does get there I will change my review but i dont see that happenining soon at there speed.			"

								Very promising 3D 1stP Minecraft. Stable Alpha, workable recipes, nice world.It already has that ""just one more tree, honey, and I'll come to bed"" and of course for that tree you need a new axe and oh, you are out of stones and wouldnt a steel axe be way better anyway and the forge is almost finished too and ....Mind you, it is ALPHA PHASE! So unless you know how to alpha and beta test games, dont bother playing it.Its worth supporting it though. Could get to be one of the next big things.I am very much looking forward to beta phase and content filling. Count me in!			"

								At the time of this writing I'll say this.The game has potential. The concept is pretty cool. But it's fairly shallow in scope. I grew bored fairly quickly after getting high in the tech tree. Which only took a few hours.Hopefully the Devs keep up the hard work. Because the potential is there!			"

								Take ""Gothic 3"" and ""Skyrim"" and mix them together, then add loads of craftable armor, weapons and gear, then add a survival element to the mix where the day and night cycles actually bring their own hazards. Chop wood and collect flint to survive the frigid night, defeat animals for meat and in self-defense during the day, wrap the whole thing up in some outstanding programming and a graphically awesome environment and you have Savage Lands.

								The game is still being developped and updates are farely frequent, however the idea of the game is a real world survivor game against a truly brutal environment.  I will list both Pro's and Con's.Pro's:  This game is a great concept and I believe with some changes it can be an epic game unlike any other.  Con's:  You are shooting for realism the human body can survive 14 days without food, in the game you cannot survive one night even after eating 2 apples, 2 tree nuts, 2 meat.  can we make this a reasonable time say maybe 3 full days from 100% before starvation starts taking your health?Please stop the animals from running into the ocean, which kills you as well.Over all, I believe this game will be awesome just needs a few tweaks.

								This is a beautiful game. People need to realize, Savage Lands is Still in Early Access.  Of course its gonna have bugs, and it's not gonna be perfectly optimized. Don't listen to all these negative reviews complaining that the game is unstable and saying that it gets boring. Is it an unstable game? Yes. It's early access. Of course it's unstable. Is it poorly optomized? Of course it is. It's early access.Does this game get boring after a while? If you get bored you obviously still have tons of content to discover.Does this game get updates frequently? ♥♥♥♥ yeah. There are pretty huge updates every two weeks or so with tons of new contents and things to craft, build, discover and fight. Plus frequent optimization updates and bug fixes to go with.I'm sick of reading all these negative reviews by horde of angry 12 year olds that just got home from CoD daycare.  Chill out. There's a ridicous amount of crafting to be done, items to be found, storyline to follow, creatures to kill, portals to go through, dimensions to explore, bosses to fight and underware to be changed. This is a truly wonderful game that doesn't get anywhere near enough credit.One of my fondest memories is wondering through the wilderness with my friend, having a conversation, just exploring and hunting for food. We were chatting about deer meat and sinew when suddenly.. ""EVERYTHINGS ON FIRE"" ""RUN FOR YOUR LIFE ITS SATAN"" You guessed it, we were being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a big black dragon♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ To conclude this rambling, should you buy this game? Yes you should ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game why are you still reading this. Go ask your mom for her credit card  and buy this game for yourself and six of your closest friends, and maybe an extra copy for yourself. Because it's that awesome.One of the best early access games I've played, cant wait to keep playing and exploring the endless stream of new content.			"

								Even though this game is early access, its amazing!!! I bought this game in a 4 pack when the game went on sale and i gave 3 of the copies away to my friends, and I'm glad I did. This game contains a very Large map, Many Monsters items and a huge amount of craftable and collectable items. I would reccomend you play this game with your friends, expecially when Kur is chasing you through the forests and villages :D There are some minor bugs that could be fixed, (glitched out corpses: cannot loot them) but i'm sure those wil be fixed in the next update. I CAN'T WAIT TILL THE NEXT UPDATE. THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!!!!			"

								Woke up naked on a beach... seems like I been in such a situation before. hmm.... Anyway, so I am freezing my butt off, and build a campfire. Nicely warmed up, I thought I would explore a little and get food. Some rags over my back and a axe made with a stone and a stick, I set off. Not for long. Off in the distance I could just make out the wings of something so massive it dwarf the mountain it seem to perch on. Back at the campfire and new set of pants, I head out in the other direction. After running after some deer with no success I came upon a abandoned village with only couple of wonky skeletal defenders. So I triumphantly claimed the village for myself...not for long. The skeletal warriors returned, armoured and with proper war axes. So back at starting point after not surviving one day, I am left to rethink and better plan my strategy for next attempt.So next attempt....not for long. Thought I would see if there is seafood. Hypothermia soon answered that question.12/10 So far.			"

								The concept is good but for the length of time this has been in early access and its progress to date suggests that it will never be in an acceptable state to spend money (not in the near future anyway!) Unfortunately this was a very short and sweet encounter with the game which i may check back on in the future but currently i cannot recommend.Pros are:- Open world- Vast crafting optionsCons: - Too many bugs to talk through- Invisible mobs killing you !- Clunky and not ""newb"" friendly (i picked it up easily as i have played rust / similar games)- FPS issue- AI is awful.

								If you have played survival early access titles, like Stranded Deep, Long Dark, or The Forest, you will figure out the angles a little faster. I spent less than $10 on this, it is early access, and I am 2 hours in at this time.In the first 2 hours, if you stick close to the (safer) beach spawning point like I did, you will likely:- Build your first fire pit, which doubles as a crafting location- Gather resources (stones, chop trees etc.)- Learn to create and repair weapons and some clothing- Fight and kill your first boar or deer- Build your first house structure, which offers a little protection and warmth- Begin to starve, which forces you to venture into the interior before you are fully ready- Die, either by cold, starvation or creature... as you realize too late you need more food- Respawn, and live again, wiser this time (and better equipped, if you can find and loot your old body)During all that time, there was a constant feeling of being watched by creatures that lurked further into the island - and a sense that sooner or later survival and wunderlust would force you toward those dangers. If you have played The Long Dark, this game likewise will not let you get comfortable for long. Crafting is on the whole is satisfying so far (multiple things to make to achieve the same purpose). Artwork, physics, and performance seemed quite good for early access. I have not tried multiplayer, but I assume that will add layers of fun.At $5 per hour (so far, and that number will go down) easily one of the better purchases I've made. Looking forward to seeing this one develop further. "

Savage LandsSavage Lands is a open world survival game that can be played in singleplayer or multiplayer.It was released on Steam on the 5th of March 2015 and it is still in Early Access in October of 2016.CraftingThe crafting in this game is the same as any other EA(Early Access) survival game.And by that I mean,basic,boring and confusing.You need to grind for materials or you can find them on the ground.You can craft better equipment for fighting/grinding for materials or you can rebuild the ruins that you find across the island.CombatOn the island you can find deer,boars,pigs,rabbits,wolves and skeletons.Wolves,boars and skeletons will attack you on sight but their attacks are sluggish and buggy.Most of the time they will completely miss you and get stuck in a rock or something.Deer will run away from you but you can chase them until they hit a wall and just stay there.I found 2 deer stuck in a rock and I just clubbed them to death.The hitboxes of animals/skeletons are either broken or get glitchy every once in awhile.Basically the combat is kinda broken.SurvivalSurviving on the island is not hard because the game is hard or too complex,it's hard because you need to fight the broken game mechanics.The cold/health systems in the game are broken for example.You will get cold up to 100% and die even if you stay near a fire.Your health will go down even if nothing happens and eating/using bandages won't fix it.The game doesn't have a natural progression.If you walk 200 meters from spawn you can encounter monsters that one hit you.You constantly find axes/resources on the ground so what's the point of surviving if you already find stuff on the ground?The island is full of ruins and you can easily repair them with just wood.Food is easy to find because animals get stuck in walls/trees/rocks and you can kill them.TechnicalThe game looks decent from pictures/trailers provided by the devs but in-game it doesn't look great and it runs really bad on medium settings.And even on medium settings I don't think I get 60fps.It's clearly not well optimized.Achievements on Steam are broken for this game.Even if you stay in a house,it will snow inside.The game consumes a lot of resources for no apparent reason and crashes from time to time.ConclusionSavage Lands has tons of bugs,glitches,it's badly optimized and has boring gameplay.It's still in EA but I think it's literally impossible for this game to get better than this because the core game is broken.Not worth the price it has on Steam.

								I like this game. I love the concepts, I love the environment, it does not love me though. Good, I like a challenge. For an early access I admire the dev team dedication to this, I support it wholeheartedly, if they can pull this together then it's a wonderfully engaging game. When you first get in then the early access aspects of it are obvious, the creatures do wierd things when trying to kill you, the wild boar will do a growl and then fire off three rapid jumps down the road. Wolves will growl at you and pounce on where you are standing, if you move anytime between the wolf getting ready to attack and the 30 second warm up routine before it does then you are treated to watching it jump into empty space, at which point you smack it (if you haven't figured that out then you were eaten by your first wolf). You will freeze to death the first time you are in thereYou will freeze to death againYou will starve and freeze to deathYou will begin to know what you are doingYou will know why you froze to death, you are learning, freezing, and learning.You will figure out the crafting system and make some stone toolsYou will freeze to death again. So after much of this, you eventually build a place and start getting armour together. You will go adventuringYou will find Kruul and you will take him on with the stone axe you made.You will dieYou will try and retrieve your stuff, Lord Kruul will kill youAt this point you begin to understand that you need to think about what you are doing and why. You need to plan your moves, or you will die. You will build stuff and become stronger. You will venture forth with confidence, you will die again. I love it. The game has its bugs, but I'm confident that the dev team are comitted to this. I do recommend it, certainly if you like to see something being made and anticipating how the next version is going to take it, it's an adventure in its own self.If you like finished products, this isnt for you, it has a way to go, but I am already hoping that there is a version I can run on a dedicated server, I need help beyond the first island.

Early Access Review
								The storm had been savage, the ship lost and no sign of other survivors.  I crawled away from the icy water onto the desolate shore.  It was cold, so cold.  The wind howled around me carrying tiny frozen shards which pierced me like a needle.  I was desperately in need of shelter and warmth and hunger was coursing through me.  I made my way along the beach picking up useful looking stones and pieces of timber as I went but the cold had numbed my hands and I was struggling to keep hold of more than a few items.It seemed my luck might be returning when I stumbled upon an abandoned fire next to a crude shelter.  The fire had long since extinguished but the timbers which remained seem dry enough to light if I could find a way.  My fortune continued when I discovered a small stone hammer and axe lying next to the shelter.  With the hammer I managed to chip away some flint from a nearby boulder.  Sparks erupted as a struck the flint and finally faint wips of smoke emerged from some dry moss at the base of the fire.  I nurtured the tiny flames and soon they grew into a roaring fire.  Life flooded back into my body as the warmth embraced me.  I stayed next to the fire staring out across the ocean for a time but I knew that I couldn't stay here forever.  I had to keep moving, to find proper shelter and food.With a heavy heart I left the fire and grimaced as the cold tore into me once again.  I walked for what seemed like hours without any signs of life when all of a sudden I caught a sharp movement up the hill to my left.  I hid behind a bush and watched as a deer emerged from behind some nearby trees.  In my weakened condition it would be a struggle to catch an animal such as this when it ran but a series of bushes allowed me to sneak close enough to launch an attack.  As I leapt from cover I muttered a prayer to the high father R'ahkselt asking for his guidance and protection.  My first blow landed true and stunned the beast which gave me the opening I needed.  I rained down a succession of strikes with my axe and soon the deer collapsed dead.  I scavenged the corpse which provided me with plenty of meat and some leather hide.  I carefully extracted the sinewy tendons for when dry these would make adequate binding materials.Unfortunately I was not the only hunter that day.  As I was finishing up with the corpse I heard a snarl from behind me.  I barely had time to turn before a ravenous wolf fell upon me.  It was all I could do to raise my arm so that his teeth which were for my neck, instead sunk into the flesh of my forearm.  I struck the creature several blows to the head with the axe in my free hand and it soon shared the fate of the deer it had been stalking.  Using some cloth I had picked up on the beach I managed to bind my wound and stop the bleeding.  The wolf carcass provided me with yet more meat and hide, a fair trade for the wound it had inflicted.The adrenaline coursing through me had blinded me temporarily to the cold but it soon set into me again with a vengeance.  The dense foliage around me made me wary of further wolf attacks so I turned back towards the shore and started clambering down the hill.  I was almost to the water when a clacking sound stopped me in my tracks.  From behind a nearby boulder emerged what I thought was a man but as I watched I realised that this man had long since lost the flesh from his body.  A skeleton, an animated corpse.  What kind of fel place had I been stranded?  It seemed to have not noticed me and knowing nothing of how to fight the undead I decided to sneak away.  Was this a freak occurance or was this land infested with more of these shambling horrors?  I was certain I would find out if I lived long enough.  After walking along the coast for a time I found the ruins of a small stone hut, the roof which had long since decayed.  Even so this offered more protection and shelter than anything else I had found so I decided to make it my home, at least for the night as I noticed the Sun was rapidly setting over the distant horizon.  I set about gathering wood from the trees around the hut and soon had another fire warming me.  I cooked the meat of the deer and wolf I had killed earlier and vigorously tore into it, satiating my hunger for the time being. The darkness had now set in completely and I dared not venture away from the fire.  At night the freezing conditions had worsened and who knows what manner of beast was lurking in the shadows.  Perhaps the fire would keep them at bay...perhaps.  Some time later a noise startled me and I leapt up, axe in hand.  A shadow approached but when the light of the fire bathed the figure I was relieved to see that it was nothing more than a deer.  I relaxed and welcomed her to my home since it would need be a good idea to go chasing a deer through the forest at night.  Unfortunately the deer was not alone.  She had innocently come to investigate my fire not knowing that she was being followed.  I had only just sat back by the fire when the wolf leapt from the shadows towards me.  The deer bolted into the darkness leaving me alone to deal with this rotten carnivore.  As he bore down on me I managed to kick out and knock him away but in doing so I fell towards the fire and burned myself.  As I cried out in pain he leapt again but I rolled aside and took up my axe.  We circled one another for he was wary now and not so eager to attack.  In a moment of madness I charged forward swinging my axe in a huge arc which cleaved into the beasts shoulder.  He howled with pain and rage and bit into my leg as I pulled my axe from his flesh and struck again with a final killing blow.  I slumped back breathing heavily and assessed the wound on my leg.  Luckily I had some cloth scraps left over from earlier and managed to apply them as a makeshift bandage.  I had no idea of the time but it was still pitch dark with no sign of the morning light arriving to comfort me.  This truly was a savage place and I found myself questing my resolve to survive here alone.  No.  I must remain resolute.  The dawn would arrive soon and with it new opportunities.  Surely there must be a settlement here where I could find aid?  A howl in the distance. More wolves.  Another howl much closer this time.  Snarls from the darkness surrounding me.  I pick up my axe and look all around.  There was still no sign of dawn.'You survived for 1 day'TL:DRPicked up some rocks and sticks.  Killed a deer.  Killed a wolf.  Made a fire. Killed another wolf.  Got killed by more wolves.10/10 will get killed by wolves again.I suppose on a serious note it's worth saying that this game is very much an alpha so don't expect polish and tons of content.  What there is seems decent though.  Animations and combat are a little clunky but the foundations are there.  Crafting and gathering mechanics are pretty solid.  The survival aspect of this game is brutal, at any given moment either the cold, hunger or bloody wolves (or worse) are trying to kill you.  If you're unlucky all three at the same time.Tip of the day - don't run into the Sea.			"

								So... You start the game with four inventory slots. you are immediately told to go out and collect wood and stone. along the way you'll find mushrooms, sticks and bark. five items for four inventory slots. so you start putting items on your hotbar, of which you have 6. stone hatchet and a hitting stick at first. then you kill a skeleton and he drops decayed meat and bones. then an animal drops leather and animal meat. suddenly you find yourself overflowing with items you have no room for. so you ignore the tutorial quests that are leading you astray to search for the answer to one simple question: how the hell do I get more inventory space? the answer was simple. you craft a bag to store stuff in. after twenty minutes of fiddling with the recipe menu, you discover there is a seperate building menu that is apart of your knowledge and tips menu. looking through the list of craftable items, you find there are many ways to build different kinds of bags- all requiring you to gather specific items that you don't have room for, from specific creatures you can't seem to find- and by the time you figure out inventory management, your character has either died from disease from eating the mushrooms you thought were food, or died from the cold because you weren't paying attention to the tutorial instructions. ...the monsters are slow, unintelligent and easly bashed to death with a stick... the only challenge here is memorizing the lists of craftable items, spotting the correct creature to kill for the item you want, then finding four more of that creature to get enough reagent to craft something you want/need. I have played Ark, Rust and the Forest. they all have their downsides- but they also have their upsides and potential for fun. Playing Savage Lands- I enjoyed the first 5 minutes of it because I was enjoying the scenery.But then I started actually playing the game and I just felt like I was being tasked and encumbered... also the community is non-existent. out of the 6 people hosting games today, only one was public and he kicked me from his game as soon as I entered, then banned me for trying a second time. I hosted a public game for my adventure, but never recieved company.			"

								Postive Big world.Got real survival feeling to it, as cold, health and hunger.Slashing trees, mining rocks, and so forth.Very postive for being a alpha-beta.Can build various of buildings, weaponry, armor.Collectables like cutton, berries from trees and so forth.ConsNot enough added monsters, what I've counted to is around 10 different monsters - and they do not spawn often.Only one world so far.To few armor and weapons.Can't kill the dragon yet.Too few updates for being an alpha-beta since there's a lot to fix.Takes a lot of processor, and I have a pretty solid compute but it still doesn't run smoothly although it should. Once you killed everything and so forth, you're getting quite bored hence why it should be added more things to the game.Havn't really found a forum on the updates, unless its on a steam-page so maybe an own website where I could see the upcoming updates.Little shoppy graphics (Although I don't care about this, but rather the feeling of playing it)			"

								Savage Lands has such huge potential. I have done everything there is to do, at least twice, and I can't wait for my friends to come online again, so we can play it through another time. It is really fun at the beginning, challening, scavenging for food with your friends, fighting wild animals with nothing but sticks, and gathering materials for buildings. I must admit, the gathering materials for buildings quickly becomes a chore, but the rest of the game makes up for that. I can't wait for the next update. There is also lore to read through while you're running around the savage lands.  Developers push out updates every now and then, and there has recently been added lore. This makes the game more fun, but if you want more than 100 hours on every game in your library, wait for more content.Gameplay: 7/10 (Fun and enticing. EDIT: There has been added lore to the game, and it feels much, much more fun to play)Optimization: 5/10 (EDIT: I played the game again, and I am getting a better framerate, but still only topping at around 25-30 FPS on lowest settings)All in all, I would recommend the game. You can feel the chills when you see a boar coming charging at you with you having nothing but a stick to fend the boar off.			"

								In it's current state it is an excercise in frustration.  Why give the option to respawn when you respawn miles away from your corpse or camp.  You actually have to delete the world and start over every time you die and since everything is Random you may do that a hundred times just to finally get rolling and then have a group of Skeletons come and kill you.  Wait until this gets more stuff done.  Like the fact that there is ZERO documentation on the current build.  there is a scroll along the bottom saying that campfires can be relit yet no explantion on how.			"

Early Access Review
								There are things I really, really love about this game.  For one, it achieves almost an RPG-like feel with the notes that are left all over the island.  The fantasy creatures are an awesome touch, and I actually enjoy all of the crafting stations and the opportunity to rebuild ruins.  The ambient noise in the game is actually really good, and I enjoy a lot of the graphical composition of the game.However, all of these good points are sadly overshadowed by the bad points.  Although the crafting really looks like something I'd enjoy, it ended up being a nightmare.  It lacks any search or organizational functions, which drives me absolutely insane.  The combat in the game is easy, with many AI being completely broken altogether.  Those are the only big downsides, but for a game like this those two aspects are completely vital.Graphically, the game is very poorly optimized (not a big deal, but there are those out there who really care about that sort of thing).  In addition, it seems that many of the achievements are broken (also not a big deal, but definitely something to take note of).  I really, really hope that the developers come back to fix this game.  I could genuinely see myself enjoying and playing this game for quite a long time if they made a few minor adjustments!  As for now, it kinda feels like you're playing the demo of a game in some ways.			"

***update to previous review***well, i've been testing this for a while. i got in on the beta and now the early access. it has a few bugs but i think the game has a lot of potential and going by what i hear from the devs they are polishing it up nicely. do i think the game is worth $24.99 right now.. it depends how much you like the genre so i'm going to point out a couple good things and bad things about the game in it's current state and you make up your mind.**update**i can now reignite ruined fireplaces, thanks devs!!i can make a basic axe out of some wood and flint so if i die there's still a chancesome good things:the graphics (obviously). i could take a date for pizza on the in-game beach at sunsetthe feel and style. the game feels adventurous, can't deny thatthe way it shows all nearby stuff on the ground in your inventoryco-op support (i would have liked some free for all pvp and pve rooms though, that would have been super awesome!! and considering how large the landsscape is, no room limit??)the crafting system. not the best i've seen, but better than most, and i'm not sure how i would make it any better so i guess it's pretty good thenthe way you start off with just about nothing and are expected to survive (very difficult singleplayer.. in my opinion anyways)the devs are active, thanks devs!!some things that could be improved or implementedwhat do the anti aliasing options mean?? more descriptive options or tooltips would be nicenormal sticks, rocks, and flint are quite difficult to come by, although that could be the choice of the devs and isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just makes singleplayer quite difficultquite a lot is expected from you at the start even though can can now reignite camp-fires. it's not too bad, just quite difficult singleplayer which brings me to..the way it's very difficult if you're playing singleplayer and because there's no objective or point to the game yet (hopefully there will be one. even in real life i have objectives the whole time), why even play singleplayer??if you die, you lose everything which is not a necessarily bad thing considering it's a survival game, but early game if you die it's game over. if you lose weapons, materials, food, clothes, etc.. it's super difficult to get going again. it's not a bad thing if you're trying to be realistic. i'd just like it to be able to fight with a stick or something, and keep my clothes and some of my stuff (if you want to be realistic, why would a wolf kill me, take my clothes and bag and then drag me to the beach.. or the other way around)verdicti think it's a good game and it's getting better thanks to an active development. don't drop this one please devs!!. with some more polishing and real objectives or quests please!! (it feels kind of empty without a point), this game will be the awesome deluxe, not just normal awesome!!]			"

								As of Build 17705 (July 2015), this Early Access game is in a playable and enjoyable state.  Core survival mechanics are implemented, which is more than enough to make the game worth the cost of admission.Combat and construction are still rudimentary, so if you're looking for Skyrim-style sword and board or some kind of world-builder, this title is not (yet) for you.Otherwise, gathering, crafting and resource use are already well balanced and compliment the game's style elegantly.  Lore and atmosphere are starting to bloom from interesting to compelling, fuelled by an active community and responsive developer (Signal Studios).Compared to other players in the genre, this game is satisfyingly difficult.  Be prepared for a real challenge as you fight for survival in a barren, unforgiving world with little more than your wits and the wreckage of your boat.			"

								I purchased this game thinking it would be a high-fantasy version of Ark: Survival Evolved. Sadly, I was wrong. Don't get me wrong - the game definitely has potential and the framework is all there, however the game suffers from numerous bugs and a lack of things to do (once you kill the dragon a few dozen times, what's left?). Not only this, but....no female avatars? Seriously? This is a really odd thing that I see in a lot of survival games - most likely because the dev team is made up entirely of guys. But still....for a multiplayer game, that's kind of a no-brainer, don't you think?At any rate, at this point in time, I really can't recommend this game. If the devs manage to secure enough funding to add additional content (and bug fixes!) then the game could be really great. Right now, not so much.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game about a year ago and at first I thought I would enjoy the game. Although there wasn't much content at the time it seemed promising, there was a whole list visible to players of gear, unique materials, creatures, and buildings that would be available in future updates. Well it's been a year and there are practically no real changes to the game. maybe 1% of those yet to arrive bits have actually been added to the game.Short of a day/night cycle, a couple enemies, and a tower with a dragon on top, there is nothing to speak of. MINIMAL amount of story telling (told in notes left around the island) and no real direction in the game beyond build a hut, make a sword, kill a skeleton and try to kill a dragon. Btw there isn't any clear path on how you get from killing a skeleton to slaying a dragon that can insta kill you.The only real change to speak of is the landscape. Before it was rather large, (I completely forgot it was an island). Then all of a sudden it was a very very very tiny island. That's it. That and one pathetic boss battle were all that was added to the game. Seven Days updates their games more in a month than this has in a year. I regret buying this game. I deeply regret it and wish I could get my money and time back. There's no real work going into it, and it's just depressing to come across it in my library. I avoid it at all costs.Do not buy this game. It's not worth it.			"

								I can't reccomend this because even though I had a four player game going with friends I couldn't seem to find hardly any content at all. I mean baron, desolate.There were tiny dogs near the coast, some skeletons, and a few ents. One village. We wandered for an hour straight through endless generic woods only to find apparently some sort of skeleton boss, whom is same as the other skeletons with a slightly bulkier armor, and a charging attack.We crafted our armor, hunted generic deer, stayed in our first village. Saw a dragon on a tower we couldn't interact with and just wandered hoping to find something...anything.... I feel like the mechanics are there, the crafting, the survival. Maybe needs to be tuned to be more difficult but there is a serious lack of points of interest, and meaningful enemies/combat.			"

								Everything about this game is challenging. 25h in and I'm completely amazed by it. Your only true objective is to stay alive, which can be tricky when you're walking around with nothing but a compass as reference, shivering from tha harsh cold of the Sundered Isle, with wolves silently stalking your every move. You should also watch out for the sky, fire may drop upon you at anytime. Kur does not take any free folk wandering lightly.The game is still in Alpha phase and I'm not even close to being done with its current content. And I can only hope for more and more of it.Great job, Devs. Keep it up.			"

								Gonna update my reviewSavage lands is a nice game, not worth the price tag they're asking for it however. I have played both single and co-op and found co-op to be a lot better as there are more of you running around getting food and getting materials for your buildings and survival. You need A LOT of food to make it through the nights and days. They have updated the game so the deer are easier to kill, which is nice, but you still need a lot of meat to make it through the day/night cycles. It has a nice consept and I'll be continuing to play this game and revisit it as I see updates but there isn't much. Once you build your house all there really is to do is do around and kill animals and the mobs that spawn. It does seem like a deer chasing Simulator in the start but once you have your house you're pretty much done with the game at the moment. You can explore and kill but other then that, that's it. It does need more of an objective at the moment or maybe even a multiplayer server where there is stuff to do.			"

								Ok...initially this was a long-winded review about how fragile most of your tools are, this is no longer the case, as it seems the released a patch to make the tools a little more sturdy, finally players like myself can break the unending cycle of rebuilding their tools, and focus on the next hurdle: rebuilding campfires. Despite stating in one of the patches that campfires can now be relit, theres nothing to suggest thats possible in-game...this is likely one of the things they should add to the tutorial, because i'm sure i'm not the only person who was standing, staring at the campfire, trying to relight it with everything I had in my inventory.Deer and the like are now easier to kill, you'll still have to run around in a potato sack for clothing and a half-broken stone axe instead of a bow to kill them, its just faster now, I think wolves have less health and deal less damage (I forgot most of the patch notes pretty easily) hard to tell the difference honestly, even harder to tell when you're actually injured, given theres no animation or recoil for when you're actually damaged, though your eyes start bleeding when you hit about 30% health, so theres that.All in all the game is starting to make things a little easier for the starting gamer, and after a couple hours I finally found a town, only to have my face bitten off by a zombie dog. I will not promise anything about this games future, I don't care what the developer contacts me with, I don't care what the community says about it, but until I see the words ""early access"" removed from the games tags, I have about as much faith in this games release as DayZ, but for now...its playable atleast, moreso than before, out of a potential 10, its probably a 6, not great, it doesn't excell at what it does, but its not horrible either.P.S.To back up my claim about the survival genre, try this: click on the survival tag, and...say until page 3/4, count how many games have early access in their tags...or better, count how many don't, and you'll see why i'm skeptical of this one.

								I dont really write reviews but for this one I will make an exception. I got this game when it came out 4 years ago, yes for 4 years it is still in EA. They had a lot of promises, a lot vision to fulfill, clunky but fun mechanics which made me and my brother kinda overlook its initial flaws, but hey it was still in alpha back in the days. I was still high school. Now I am an engineering junior and when I launch this game all I can think is, ""Man... I am getting old, like really old... 4 years right off the bat in the blink of an eye..."" So does this game, it got old even before it came out as a full game. The development is painstrakingly slow and the dev team appearantly dont really know what to do with the mess in their hands, yet kudos to them they could have abandoned this nonsense of a game a long time ago. The graphics were okay for a pre-alpha game 4 years ago but now, the graphics are just plain outdated, even the 2009 Dragon Age Origins rocks much better than this. Gameplay, nonexistent, survival mechanics are too punishing for a beginner and you have to lick the ground many times before you can grasp what is going on. Of course I didnt put so many hours in this game but the fact that any computer other than my super saiyan fails to run it and I cant play it with my friends and my brother (which was the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ point of my purchase 4 years ago). I couldnt play it back in the time and cant play it now. Terrible optimization and resource utilization for a game in development and milking money out of people for 4 years... Dont make the same mistake and try to put in money to encourage some promising idea only to be failed like me. This is just another No Man's Sky...			"

Early Access Review
								I don't understand all the positive reviews.  Granted, I only wandered around for about an hour, but in that time I completed every item on the ""beginner checklist"", and then went on to make a base and hunt quite a few different enemies.- The building system, crafting system, and the map are all complete rips from The Forest.  An exact copy.- The art isn't great - it looks like old Unity 4 graphics, before Unity spent time working on PC shaders.- The animations also aren't great - they look like they were bought from an asset store.- The AI is incredibly simple and lifeless.  Every enemy in the game walks up to you, waits 2 seconds, then attacks.  It repeats until one of you die.- The inventory system is painful to work with.- There are no other features in the game that I can think of.  I crafted armor, weapons and food, I built structures, and I explored and killed enemies.I'm not going to reference all the bugs and odd game design choices (like spawning an advanced weapon next to where I first spawned) since it's Early Access.  The graphics and the animations I can also get over since it's Early Access (though the developers behind this game aren't indie and won't improve either category before launch, I applaud them for taking advantage of this marketing tactic).However, the outright stealing of not only the concept but the implementation of this game's core features (building, crafting, map) is appaling.  I don't see any way for this game to rise above the other 400 piles of crap that have hastily flooded the 'Survival' genre looking for easy money.The first response to this might be ""well you haven't tried playing online with others - that's where the fun is.""  Why would I want to repeat what I just did with others?  It's still the same crap AI, stolen building and crafting systems, and empty, desolate environment where the fog is so heavy you can't see more than 20 meters in any direction?  Why does the developer need to rely on my wanting to kill another player (or build something with him) in order to have fun?  Bottom line, I'll go play ARK or Rust or The Forest or one of the other 400 Survival games that have done all these things much better.Even though this is Early Access, no developer is going to fundamentally change all of their core features prior to ""launch"".  I expect almost no changes or additions to this game for a long, long time.			"

Early Access Review
								So I've done a lot of what can be done in Savage Lands, and I've got some things that I believe could use some improvement in the game. (I was told to leave a comment in the discussion board, and to leave a review, which I'm doing). I've played 32 hours, beaten most of the bosses, crafted most of the gear, and explored just about everywhere. I realize some have played WAY more than 32 hours, but honestly, I don't think there's really a whole lot of content to the game yet, so I'd say probably 40 hours in game and you could have done just about everything.Overall, I absolutely loved this game, and really enjoyed it. I think it's a cool genre, and has been implemented quite well. I DO really like it, but the below is critical, to try and make it better.So here's what I think could use some work.Armor and WeaponsThe armor/weapon tier system is really cool, but HEAVILY unbalanced. You go from not even being able to fight an enemy, to being able to kill it with absolutely no problem! I remember forest giants one hitting me, then I went to steel, and their hits felt like scratches. I just feel like the game would be far more interesting if the next level enemies didn't one hit you with your gear, and that when you upgraded, they were still somewhat of a challenge. The game feels more like a rush to get good gear while avoiding mobs, and then just easy kills after that. There's very few moments where battles feel difficult but enjoyable.The stats for armor are incredibly unhelpful. For example, a full set of steel vs a full set of silver is different by only 5 points of damage reduction. But it makes a HUGE difference. Each hit from a fury when I was in steel did at least 30 points of damage, but with silver, it went down to like 5-10. That's at least three times the damage reduction, with only 5 points showing in the stats. I have no idea how the math is working for that to make sense, but for it to make sense to the user, the numbers should be adjusted.Houses and StorageHouse placement sucks. I've found large open areas, one REALLY good spot, but it doesn't let me place a house... No idea why. Really frustrating, considering the majority of the land is hilly or has stuff all over it. Where am I supposed to build?The houses also suck. All of them have no room for stuff. I want to have my crafting table, forge, smeltery, and chests, all in one spot, but even the largest house doesn't have enough room for that. They're all just really crammed feeling.It would be awesome to be able to actually place chests, rather than remove my bags onto the floor, put the chest into my inventory, find the place I'd ""roughly"" like it to be, then throw it, and have it land totally sideways or backwards.""Oranize by type"" instead of name would be AMAZING (just as an option at least). I'd like to see crafting in terms of bags, materials, potions, etc. This would also make the game WAY less frustrating to start out (I would actually know what bags I can make).Item management is frustrating. Single clicking (or shift clicking) to instantly move something over would be incredibly helpful. That way, I don't have to drag dozens of things all around all the time. Also, just a thought, make bags just make more space in your inventory, rather than making a whole section for a bag containing 6 slots. Just something like a big green line could show where one bag ends and another begins. It's just a bit frustrating to scroll through a whole huge list, for very little content in my bags. It's also incredibly difficult to move items around from bag to bag (lame junk I pick up goes to my first bag... which is what I would like my GOOD stuff to be in).Game ProgressionI like that the game is open, love that. However, there actually is one specific thing you're supposed to do at each location, and you have absolutely no idea what that is. I ended up having to check maps and online guides, instead of just enjoying the game experience. You honestly expect someone to just wander around, randomly finding four different giants (that can't really be seen that well)? Then somehow to know they're supposed to try and get an Everwood drop, then keep that in their inventory, and use it to ring the gong? I know the journals give some hints, but not much, and they're hard to find too. I'm not saying I want a game where it holds my hand the whole time. I love that it's scary, you don't know what's coming, and it's totally open. I would just like to know what I'm supposed to do without having to check guides online.Many items can be figured out on their own (I need to find tin in a deposit). Others cannot (where do I get searing blood?) The journal should be the place to learn these things, but there are many things that aren't in the journal (searing blood, blood of the brood, etc). I got totally stuck at times, and had to check the internet, just to figure out what I should do next, because I honestly had no idea. That's a mark of poor design in game flow.Also, mobs can hit through walls. That kinda sucks when you've got a small house.The endgame just feels like a huuuuge grind. Bandages aren't that bad (new world, raid nearby cotton farm). But the frost ferns are a pain to farm (they're randomly all throughout the first island). Making the hal potions is a huge grind, finding those random ingredients. Don't even get me started on the Drackonus shards... Then killing the late game mobs is just sitting there swinging your sword at them for a few minutes. And the dragon fight is a terrible grind too. It takes like half an hour of stabbing it over and over and over again, using up all the valuable items that took you hours to make. It's just sooo grindy, I kind of lost the will to play right at the end of the game, because I knew how long it would take to set up.HOWEVER, overall I still really loved this game, and highly recommend it. It's enjoyable and well done, but it IS still in the development phase, and the devs are updating constantly, and are really attentive (they seem like really awesome devs).			"

								Super fun game, ridiculous amount of potential. Graphics are beautiful. This is an Early Access ReviewGame could be improved by: - adding new/more diverse enemies- tightening up the craft menu (perhaps searching/filtering by ingredient)- tightening up combat- adding things to build, like a CASTLE!!!- allowing you to tear down a structure you have built, getting a portion of the materials back- allowing you to complete structures you happen upon, like stone houses- ability to build walls (ensuring you can connect them to existing walls)- ability to craft traps- weapons with more reach (great for slow enemies like skeletons)- maybe a hotbar with more than 5 slots- revise the armor, either reduce materials or increase durability (wolves shouldnt scratch my metal armor)(i know this is coming in an update, i hope it works out well)- i havent seen any boars or bears, are they implemented?- farming... my diet of meat only can't be good for my GI tract.- ensuring that all houses connect to the ground on all sides, so my stuff doesn't roll out the bottom gap- DUAL WIELD! two axes would be a great way to make sure wolf is what's for dinner.- ability to reignite torches- ability to destroy things permanently (instead of building a house to keep all the skulls in)But yeah, i dont even really like survival games, but this one is quite fun for you and a few friends.

Its not perfect by no means but it recieves regular updates and the devs are very active in the community.

								Just purchased the game and only the host is able to see enemies / creatures etc. I had a look at the forums and this bug has been present for quite a while. The game is not playable as co-op and therefore a complete waste.			"

								I enjoy this game very much.  Right now it is early access, but it has so much going on for it already. When I play, I get lost in the game and several hours has gone by before I realize I have to get up and be an adult again. I recommend you play with one or more people that way you can collect resources more easily, and help each other with battle and building stuff.Play this game. Do it now.			"

								Very good game. Not complicated, but plenty of things you have to watch out for and learn about so you are never bored. Go exploring, but be careful. Or build your own town.			"

								Do you like to explore ? do you like to craft your own weapons , armors and more ? do you like to build your own house ?ok then, what about to do this with friends ? what about to do it with people you dont know and that might attack you or that you could attack ? that's it,  Savage lands bring to survival sandbox crafting genre a really promising medieval snowy and harsh world where hunger and cold will be your worst enemies even if there are creatures around that could kill you even faster ...     I have been lucky enought to join it in alpha and even there it was already enjoyable and there were things to do. Dev team is so close from community that we would have to sleep with them to be even more close , Savage lands is and  will be a great game no doubt about it !			"

								I'm a survival game junkie. Played 20+ of them so far. Rust being a favorite for a long period. But this game stands out. The atomsphere in the game is very well made. And it's very challenging to survive in the beginning. You will die a lot, but will eventually understand what is required of you to survive. Game engine is rock solid. No noticible glitches. Sound and animations are pretty good. Even beats Rust in same cases.			"

Early Access Review
								This game can be fun with friends but after a while gets very boring, not to mention the optimization for this game is terrible. I cannot say i have ever seen a big update for this game in a very long time. Also I have noticed a huge lack of information on the wikis regarding things in game, even noticed some things in game that never appeared on any wiki. If this game can start pumping out some updates and some bug fixes then I would say try it but at the current state this game is in and how development is moving I cannot recommend it.*EDIT* 3/9/16So since my Review there have been a few updates addressing bugs and crashes, but sadly the game still runs pretty bad my friends and I get major FPS drops even though we have pretty decent Specs. There still isn't very much to do in this game and gets boring real quick, there are games out there for the same price that are way more fun to play.I still stand by my original review and do not recommend this game unless you have a disposable income. I hope this game gets out of EA eventually but I am afraid by the time that happens there will be bigger and better games to play.			"

								The game tries to copy from RUST, The Forest and Skyrim and fails miserably.1.Punching bushes that has terrible hitbox only gives you 1 stick.2.Mining rocks show no changes at all, hell RUST did it right.3.Cutting down trees in the game is just like the forest only difference is you gotta give it at extra hit for it to finally break into piecesThe trailer looks nice and so are screenshots but once you start playing everything thing looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the water is still nice thats really the only good thing about the game, the water. I wouldn't even recommend it for free, chances are this game will be dropped or in development hell like a lot of early access games.			"

								From the brief amount of time i've played this, I can already say that this game is awesome and will be something great in the future. However, what this game lacks most is Reason to play Singleplayer (Multiplayer is 10x more fun), Optimization (average 25fps on populated servers, though to be fair, my PC isn't all that poweful), and Engaging combat (cannot block, and attack animations are clunky).  It makes up for these few demerits with everything else the game has to offer. I'd definitely recommend you buy this game if you're a big fan of fantasy and survival.			"

								WOW!  What a fun game!  This game has enormous potential!  Even in it's current Early Access state it is really FUN to play and has a lot of content to mess around with.  I felt like I was playing a new Elder Scrolls game with a rogue-lite twist! It's pretty awesome IMO and works great! :-)  It is a very atmospheric game!  Checkout my screenshot right before sunset:


Savage Lands has some awesome atmosphere!  That's for sure! 
A Screenshot of Savage Lands
By: Suma




In just my first hour of playing, I  setup camp.  Went exploring and gathered supplies.  Crafted some items and weapons.  Found a deserted town.  Killed two skeletons, saw some huge flying creature atop a tall black tower.  Then I ran from two skeletons! lol   Didn't get away and died!  Respawned and looted my dead body.  I got everything back that I lost and the random loot in the area had respawned!  Savage Lands is really FUN to play!  The game name suits it perfectly!  I fully recommend Savage Lands to anyone that likes this new genre of survival game!  It is really fun in it's current EA state and will only get better!  It shows signs of professionalism and these dev's mean business!  The game Rocks!  If you have been following Savage Lands and have thought of getting it... Don't think any longer! Buy it! You won't be sorry.  I'm very happy! :-)The game runs silky smooth on my iMac at full 2560x1440 resolution!  Here are my system specifications: Apple iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard), Journaled HFS+ Extended file system, Logitech optical mouse.The game runs on my older laptop also. It's a little choppy, but it runs in 1280x720 resolution!  Here are my laptop system specs:  Apple 15"" PowerBook Pro, Intel Core 2 Duo 2.66 GHz, 4 MB system RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT with 256MB dedicated video RAM, running OS X version 10.6.8 (10K549), HSF+ Extended file system, Dell 24"" External LCD Monitor.Edit:  I am still playing this game on and off.  It's a really hard game in single player.  You're constantly gathering supplies!  You also need to keep a fire going in a camp somewhere near by or you'll die from the cold.  You also eat like a freaking elephant and need food every 5 minutes!  You're constantly dying from either hunger, cold or both.  It's pretty hard IMO.  Almost too hard and takes away from the fun.

Early Access Review
								So my first experience with Savage Lands was great. I wandered around the island, got a friend to play with me, built a house, took over a small village, got killed a bunch of times, eventually learned how to hunt wolves... we got pretty far. There was a LOT of cross-country running because we died and had to go back to our bodies across the island. But it was fun.Left it behind for a while. Picked it up a while later..... here's what happened.- friend and I both made new characters- Loaded into the game- friend loaded into the game- found ourselves dying repeatedly on an island- we just screwed around next to a tower with a door that wouldn't open- random person joined our game, immediately made the best gear and gave it to us- random person proceeded to lead us through the entire game in what might be a speedrun, from one island to the next to the next- random person helped my friend and I reach the dragon himself (who, by the amount of limbs, is actually a wyvern not a dragon but that's neither here nor there)- three more random people joined the game- cue twenty-minute battle with the dragon in which we died a lot and there was a bunch of random naked people running around in the ruin trying to pick stuff up off their own dead bodies- dragon was killed- my friend and I decided to stop playing the game for the night.....so that's what happened. The game was super laggy for both of us, which wasn't the lovely old Savage Lands I had remembered, but I think that in the future that issue will be fixed. I wouldn't necessarily buy this game right now, but I'd definitely keep it on my wishlist or keep following it for updates if I were you and I hadn't bought it yet.I should probably also point out that I didn't buy this game, I won it in a giveaway. So this review isn't altered by anger or pleasure at spending money on something.			"

								Fun game so far, looking forward to more updates.  It is a lot of fun when playing with friends, not quite as much when playing solo.Grinding through resources can be a pain, hopefully they will address this by allowing them to respawn at some point.  Maybe add more questing and story to the game as well.  But as it is, for an Early Access, it's quite fun already!			"

Early Access Review
								Revised Statement:  The game has been upgraded to be much more playable.  I think the developer listens to us and really is working hard to make this better and better!  Thank you to the developers!!!Game Start Up Time:  I have to say it was good until I tried to join someones server and there I sat for a while.  So I started my own.  Survival/Crafting:  Definately is a sandbox crafting survival game.  Don't expect others to feed you because there is not much food to go around, you need to get out there and chase some deer down.  Playing with others did help because a lot of people shared what they could.  We all helped each other.  You practically need others as the game is that hard.Please can we have a basic club to start with.  Getting Sinew is so hard in the begining.Settings:  There are plenty of settings to help you scale the game up or down to your computers capabilities.  I was a bit amazed that I had to turn the settings down as I am running a Mac/Windows Dual Boot with 16 GB Ram and a Solid State Drive.  At the higher settings it was very laggy for me.  Most games do not do that to my machine.  So I hope you have a decent machine or are willing to turn the settings way down.  That being said I have overloaded my comptuter with Game Development and 3D Graphic Software so maybe it is a bit overloaded with programs and it may have nothing to do with the game, just being honest.  Daytime nighttime is not settable but I wish I had more control over how long night lasts, it's really long and I hate nighttime, you freeze too much so you can do very little during that time.Play:  Yes it is playable but be prepared to die a lot.  Basically I played all day and accomplished very little due to dying a lot.   I was glued to the game since it was so fricking hard to survive and to my medival brethren who joined me in suriving the harsh weather and we all were whining about how hard it was to survive but secretly all hoping they really put some more work into this game because it has a lot of potential.  I was able to get a large group of people together and we build a makeshift town at the beach.  It has a really great potential to be as good as say 7D2D ""but"" it does need to be updated to be more fair and more accurate especially regarding materials and weapon durability as currently they are very unfair and not very lucrative making the game painfully difficult.  Having lots of players does make it a bit harder to get some resources but I know the developers will hopefully improve the resources.  Especially food needs to be more resourceful.  I died so much from hunger and cold.Lag:  There was a small amount of lag, but all in all I was able to serve the game easily to about 8 players with small amounts of lag from time to time on my mac with a dual boot of windows.  It was served on the windows side of things.Environment:  Top notch, very pretty, beautiful water effects, beautiful landscape and buildings, very difficult to see past clouds, smoke, etc.  Really gorgeous and somewhat like Skyrim.  The buildings are really nice and unique and it was fun everytime we finally did accomplish building something.Building:  Building is fun but hard because the bigger buildings require so many materials however lots of players will work together if you open a server.Characters:  There is only a male character so far, he looks great, armor can be made or won for him but mostly we all ran around naked in a loincloth because nothing lasts long on this game or you lose it really fast.  I would really like to see a female character made.  You lose everything when you die...good luck finding your body.  Not sure about the dragon yet, he has not attacked me but he does fly around so keep your eyes up!Crafting:  Crafting already has a lot of recipes and I liked everything I saw ""but"" crafting is near impossible as it is near impossible to get much done or saved at all.  Loot:  Everything you get is at risk when you die, which is like really often but it is fun to steal other peoples loot when they die and when they spend all day finding it and you see them come back and it's gone, you at least help them by giving them their hammer back haha.Tools:  Need work on making them produce more or making them last longer.  Nothing lasts long and it is a BEAR trying to survive.  When they said Savage lands they meant it.Interface:  Very nice, kudos for a nice looking interface but we need a loot all button, come on people it takes forever to move your junk from your dead body to your new body.Bots:  There are plenty of wolves, deer and skeletons around to fight, hunt and the like.  I did see a bear but never got to him.  Deer are skittish but can be gotten with some work.Survival:  Your life sucks to be the character in this game, it is very, very hard work to survive.  I almost felt like saying I hate this game a thousand times but honestly I really liked it.  I know eventually they will pull it together and make it perfect.  But until then I will hate it and love it because of it's current state.  I really felt dissapointed at the current state of how hard it was to survive.Over all, I think it is worth the money if they continue to upgrade and work on the game.  I loved it and it was really something I would love to play again and again if it were tweaked and tuned better.  I hope to see more content added in as it is pretty fun!MY personal review:Game: 6/10Scenery: 10/10Character Development:  5/10 (hope to see a story line develop - and hey lots of us gamers are girls - we need a girl model)Crafting: 7/10Survival: 5/10 (needs work - its very difficult)Kudos to the programmers, they are doing a great job!  Keep it up!			"

								was worth the buy, got my time out of it. easily 20-30 hours of content, friendly community thats more than willing to help usually if you need it, so if your thinknig of buying this game i'd say give it a try. this games got some real future potential.few things to note for beginners: night time is when all the really bad things are out more frequently, and in packs.making friends makes for faster progression.(refer to 1)everything collectable has some sort of use, that includes all bushes as destructable objects.the beach is the best mining area for quick ore, and gems only come from huge rock formations, typically ""pillar"" looking stones.their are doe and bucks as the deer in the island, the bucks you gotta sneak up on, but the doe are dumb as bricks and you can almost wail them dead in 3 shots with early stage tools 9/10 times if you can get infront of their face to redirect pathing.you can throw stones, their not really that effective as a damage weapon, but their reusable as long as you find them all and they provide a lot of stagger.berries cure disease.making our dragon overlord kur angry is a bad idea, but you can collect scales from the towers when he leaves which make high end items, or can be used as a trading resource, people prefer ore though.armor wise ebon steel has a very high upkeep, so id say its only a boss use/crowd armor, use one of the other sets by preference to keep your repiar bill low.armor will obsorb damage before you take any.live inside your blacksmith, works just as well as a house.you can make your pine chests can store bags full of items inside them to maximize storage.resources don't respawn as far as i know, the method of farming is creating a new world if you don't want to exaust the one you want as ""Home""-MAP of the island,v4 Credit:Apophiss & MythN7 http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/389916836634115531/9169FA3081239C479E8B1943D88E66AB06DFA164/?interpolation=lanczos-none&output-format=jpeg&output-quality=95&fit=inside|1024:* any questions about things i may not have posted, feel free to mail me and ill get back to you asap.i might even toss you a few items if i have the time.

								Savage Lands is still in EA and going to have bugs or it's not gonna be perfectly optimized, but its already strong game with fun aspects. Does this game get boring after a while? depend of how you look at it, its a gameplay that is based on surviving on hostile enviorement, crafting resources to progress and explore beautifull islands, if you get bored by that, stay away because this is a very important aspect of the game. There's a ridiculous amount of crafting to be done, finding itens and get a somehow storyline to follow, many creatures to kill and portals to activate and other dimensions to explore, bosses to fight and grind for rare itens.One of the best early access games I've played, cant wait to keep playing and exploring the endless stream of new content, you should try it and judge by yourself, by the way support the devs bc they deserve your support.

								Savage Lands is very fun, and I could recommend it to anyone except for a few problems... Its takes up alot of priority on your computer, overheating your GPU for no reason. Very unoptimized. Its Difficulty is EXTREMELY steep, and you will die alot. Crafting is not too hard, but finding things can be difficult, especially with monsters around that can one, or two shot you.The game has a lot of potential, and is very entertaining with friends, but if your computer is not beefy you won't run it well.(A good tip: Instead of running up to enemies, try to jump dodge them, and attack. some attackers have slow animations which can help you land a hit.)

								Savage Lands is a fantasy, survival, crafting/building game. Reminiscent of games like RUST, and ARK, or even at times, similar to games like Minecraft. Savage Lands features some realy wonderful aspects, and a challenge that is sure to be rewarding when you succeed. You're stranded on an island (procedurally generated) and it's COLD! As you try to survive, you must gather wood, stone, ores, and leathers to build fires (for keeping warm), structures (again, helps you stay warm, and lets you build a base of operations), tools, weapons, armor, and lots of other items. The crafting is robust, and fulfilling. The gathering is beautiful and less monotenous than games like Minecraft. As you start to get better tools, weapons, armor, and a base, you are able to take on bigger challenges, and eventually, you move on to different areas and really lets you feel progression.Pro's:Strong Survival Elements (You are constantly getting cold and will die if you don't warm up. Clothes, and fires, and houses help keep you warm)Strong RPG Elements (build weapons, and armors, and fight enemies and get stronger to take on stronger enemies!)Great Multiplayer (Whether playing with friends, or strangers, the multiplayer is VERY rewarding and fun. Surviving is always better with a partner.)Fun Server System (You can create your own server and make it public, you can turn PvP on or off for extra challenges and even a fun role playing (pretending you're the actual character, not a player in the game, but the person surviving) experience!Con's:VERY High system requirements ***Game is not very optimized (Even on low graphics settings, you still may experience some lag or hang ups)  ***Secondary Notes: (not pro's or cons)Frequent updates and patches (with a timer on the main menu showing when the next update will be) show that the devs are active and trying to offer the best game they can. Sadly, they aren't working on some very important things, like optimizing the performance. Also, because of the poor perfomance on most machines, some people are unable to play (I can play just fine, but I was not able to play with my brother) and this makes some people upset that they can't play with friends, or even they can't play themselves. The game is absolutely terrific, but it requires an omnipotent machine to play.***EDITSThe system requirements have been fixed, and this game is far less taxing on your system. They've also worked wonders with optimization as well. This game is better now than it was when I purchased it!			"

Early Access Review
								So there is a bit of a 'mixed' review for this but I'm going to start by summing it up. Yes. I highly recommend this game.I was looking for something to play that was multiplayer but more coop without being forced to be online with others or have constant server wipes. A server I could run from my house but have the experience of crafting, surviving and hunting on our own without others coming to sabotage us. Just us against the elements. This game has it.Let me start off with: Yes it is early access. Yes there is bugs. Yes there are glitchy animals (that have been addressed by the devs as an issue) Yes, there is not that much to do just yet. BUT. In 25 hours we managed to go full speed, two people and not complete the game.If you are looking for a competetive game without constantly dying and restarting and being able to steal resources for others. This is not the game for you. Now - on to the review.Multiplayer: There is public servers or you can set them to be friends only or password. We constantly played multiplayer and found no issues connecting to each other. Even hopped on to some public servers to see people helping each other and working together. Crafting: The UI has seen a major improvement but could still use some tweaking. There is a crafting journal for buildings where you have to put down a 'holo' version of the building then you feed it materials. Armor and other things that don't go on the ground are crafted at a crafting table, forge, and so on. There is not a good sorting system, just one long list. Things are a little difficult to find but there is a LOT of stuff.Enemies: There are a number of enemies in the game ranging from easy, slow swinging to crazy run after you and blow up for 90% of your life. If you die instantly, you will know you're in the wrong part of the game. Try somewhere else! Some of those enemies are dangerous animals such as bears and large saber like cats. They hurt a lot. Food: There seems to be a small issue with how the animals spawn sometimes and you might clear a place of deer and get no more spawns. This seems to be a bug remedied by just reloading the game or starting a new map. There is other ways to get food such as berries. There is 'salmon' but there doesn't seem to be a way to fish yet. Survival: There is freezing to death, starving to death, bleeding to death, poison, so on. Have warm clothes. Oh yeah there's also 'encumberment' to an extent. Heavier armor you run slower but it doesn't seem to make you really slow or be anything past just slower run/swing speed. Very realistic to a sense. Being inside buildings makes you warmer, standing next to a fire makes you warmer, running into a frozen lake makes you wet and cold very quickly. Eating warm food warms you slightly. Fur on armor is warmer then cloth, so on.Buildings: The buildings are all placed and preset. They range from small stone shacks to large 3 story 'castles' However you can't modify them at all. But you CAN...rip down an entire town if you're patient enough and make another one yourself! Walls and everything included.Minerals: Ores have a spawn location, once you find them they will forever respawn at that spot. This could be good and bad, they have a decently long spawn rate and there isn't many of the later ores. This makes the later armor a bit of a grind since they need a ton of stuff. However, while you gather ores, common enemies will drop rare items and you could stumble on some rare special items and even bosses!This game DOES have a good story! Read the notes you find, it does have a bit of a spooky/creepy undertone which is amazing! Night does make you creeped out and enemies running around in the light of the fire sneaking up on you are freaky!Graphics....Graphics....I can't say more. This game is BEAUTIFUL. I have a good gaming rig and have to tone the graphics down a little to run smoothly. Overall: Amazing sense of progression. I got this game for 7.49 on sale but would have gladly paid the 14.99 for it...even 20! Support the Devs! I can't wait to see more of it!			"

								Savage lands, because Rust doesn't have dragons and Skyrim doesn't let you craft amazing things.Oh my god. I love this game. It is as if Rust and Skyrim had an amazing Baby together. But it upgrades the features from both those games. And still in early access too with new updates very often and always big ones. I think it is worth investing in this survival game and I hope to see the final product as it will be amazing. The strong points are the combat and crafting combined to become the best survival game I have come across (Dayz didnt have crafting). And the graphics on the massive open worlds are amazing even on my PC (which is kind of average). It is especially fun if you can join a server that lets you spawn stuff to cheat and build a castle then just kill noobs who join and don't know anything. Would rate 9.5/10. Some things can be worked on but it is early access so what do you expect and is being updated monthly with new content and patches.			"

								I have spent a little over 70 hours in this game and can say with assurity that this is an amazing game. The enviroment feels  authentic both in terrain and indiginous wildlife, (though we are told there will be additional wildlife added). If you are looking for another hack-n-slash zombie game where the only threat is other players this game is not for you. PVP has not been implemented yet but is going to be at later time.The wildlife and denziens of this island are out for blood, anyhting from boar,wolves(in packs or solo),bear, and skeletons there is no shortage and for the hunters out there there are plenty of deer(no ranged weapon yet coming soon i hope). This is the first real survival game i have truly seen. There is a good crafting element here as well from weapons to armor and housing as well as healing items. Looking forward to the growth of this game as time goes on. Graphically the game is beautiful and the sounds really seem to fit. Build a campfire cook your meat and stay warm out there................			"

Early Access Review
								So let me start by saying that while this game is far from complete what it is already, especially for an early access game, is pretty substantial. I tend to describe this as a Skyrim meets Minecraft, like everyone else, but that's purely to help people understand the scope of what you can do. The crafting system while basic is robust and the environments generic but enjoyable. There's a real sense of immersion when you're all gathered around your fire trying to get warm from the cold or fending off enemies as a team. I play with 5 other people so as I have to host the game can be a little laggy despite my good connection as there's no dedicated servers yet. Combat is pretty basic with left mouse to attack and with bows that you simply have to draw and aim but there is still a slight degree of skill required. A block system in my opinion is sorely needed due to the gameplay type but it's still good enough for you to find satisfaction. Enemies vary and the AI is simple but effective in what you want from a game at this stage. Performance of the game isn't bad though I notice my friend who plays on a macbook pro suffers from low FPS. It's not optimised and there's a lot of obvious tearing in the distance if you get to a high enough vantage point. All in all I'd recommend it as a good co-op experience but until there's more variety in crafting and persistent servers for people to play on i'd say the single player element is rather average.

Early Access Review
								I have only just started playing, so far it's not that easy to play, it leaves you wanting, which makes me wanna keep playing.. fights are juuuuuuust right, not to easy, looking for loot is funny, find a million stones, but the moment I started a stone house I found 300 logs, 0 stones?!  I am anxiously awaiting the update, which will provide bow and arrow, make hunting fun I hope. All I was missing is a safe haven somewhere, a fire leaves you warm but vulnerable, in some cases IMPOSSIBLE, a house will leave you frozen to death. Also, some furniture would make sense, as people lived there once.. a cupboard, chest and torch fixture e.g, and NOT freezing in your house would perhaps make the game more fun for a wider audience.. something with settings, easy, survivor, savage, or some such.This game is already cool, I can't wait to see how it will turn out.Tuesday 31st; updateI read a bunch of reviews about this game lacking depth / story, but I suspect that is forthcoming. In fact; the best part can be getting lost in the woods, looking for other settlements, encountering strange towers, and sometimes just actually getting lost and runnin into a bear. Earlier today I had packed LOADS of stuff in flesh bags, and dragged it across the middle past the dragon tower looking for an alledged ""stone city"" which obviously brings to mind a Markarth like setting. After about 10 minutes I discovered what I thought to be a second dragon tower, YAY says me, turns out I cirkled WAAAAY around, found the same shanty town again. rotting flesh and a million skulls still there, singing praise...Ow and I found the safe haven I was missing, just build a blacksmith :P			"

								Ok I was fortunate to be one of the Alpha Testers on this great game and I have seen the significant improvements the Devs have made in such a short time completly reworking player models , player armour & introducing new beasts like the Nightstalker and towering ENT.The Devs also listen and react to what players want in a timely fashion implementing subtle changes. They have a weekly stream and engage with the community.Enough Waffle on to the gameOk this has a very solid singleplayer experience that has not been done before it has the PVE element of 7 days to die matching the difficulty level too it is  a steep learning curve but there are plenty of guides out there to assist coupled with the island feel of the Forest but it has so much more depth with changing weather patterns , different beasts and monsters & ruins to explore.The Co op element is also fairly solid there are know bugs and glithces but like I said its early Alpha they are getting fixed. There is a huge emphasis on working together to take down monsters and generally survive in the harsh environment , larger buildings require tons of materials that are easily gathered in a group.PVP is something that will be added later to the game.For an Early access title this is one of the more completed games & the Devs have a clear roadmap where they are going.  It is very affordable at its current price but will increase in time so snap it up now people.What can we look forward too in future?Lore is being introduced , dungeons & magic mentioned and multiple islandsI dont know about you but i`m going full on viking ""To Valhalla"" Oh & it has dragons			"

								This game has a lot of work that needs to be done. It has the potential to be a great fantasy sandbox but for the most part the development was a little lacking when it was released, meaning it was released too soon. From what I've played it was enjoyable but the bugs make the game fairly difficult to progress at a steady pace.  Sorry but until a fairly large amount of aspects are fixed I can’t bring myself to recommend it.			"

								I want to love this game (and perhaps I shall when it is finished) but as it stands right now. I do not. Not even close.There is no customizable character options. Sure, lets be a bald white man! Thats what I always choose when I play games. Although to be honest, this is something I could live with if some of the other issues were addressed. The graphics for your character are pretty retro though I must say. Which leads me into my next statement ....The graphics do not look even close to the screen shots above and it lags horribly even with a pretty up to date build. Perhaps this is something that will be rendered over time as more updates come but for the price its just dissapointing at the moment. I would also love to see come controller support.The check list they provide at the beginning of the game is pretty basic to start off. I guess it is supposed to be a tutorial of sorts although I didnt find it helped me in the slightest.Just the usual stuff was on it, go find tree, cut down tree, find stone .... and so on. I couldnt even find a single deer to hunt and I searched the island for at least 30 mins.No check mark for me. I did find some sort of village with zombie skeletons whom I assumed were trying to attack me but got stuck behind a fence until I walked over and bashed them to death with my axe/mallet. I would love to see some better NPCs and battle mechanics. Perhaps some defending, crouching, sprinting, anything else really. After defeating my fearsome foes I was hoping I could loot some goods but alas all the buildings were pretty  much empty of all goods and decorations. Just ""wooden"" boxes. Very cookie cutter. :(This game has so much potential and I want to see it come to life. I hope the next few updates really bring it in terms of upgrades because I feel like this could be so amazing.			"

								I've played many survival games such as this. This game is complete trash in its current state. Another poorly optimized, glitchy game made with the Unity engine.The graphics are poor, the ""animations"" are very poorly animated and choppy looking, the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. I'm not one to gripe about visual quality, but even $15 is too much of an asking price for the games overall state.Using a GTX 1070 and the game will dip to 15-20 fps. If they're planning for a ""full release in late 2016"" they've got a LOT of work to do. Another thing is when I played, all of the mobs would permanently despawn after about 2 minutes of playing. Every time.It takes forever to gather anything, and when you do, it's pretty laughable. Cut up a fallen tree? Instead of logs being added to your inventory, or the tree breaking into chunks, it spawns whole logs at the point of impact until the tree vanishes. Same with rocks and such. The only thing I found interesting in the game was coming across destroyed structures, and having the ability to rebuild them and restore them.Don't buy this game. Not for $15, not for $7, not for $2, not even if it's free. As it is, It's not a fun or engaging experience at all. I got this as part of a Humble Bundle, and I still regret playing this.			"

								First, this game has a lot of promise. I hope that the devs are dedicated to see it through to its full potential. Overall, the game has a very good feel to it.I don't have any major complaints for this game that, at this point as an Early Access game, would be a dealbreaker and they're mostly asthetic complaints--the way that buildings sit on hills, etc; these are things that can be, and I'm sure will be, fixed easily.The minor complaints: * Hunger also seems to progress quickly, although I haven't tried to quantify it in any meaningful way; I shouldn't have to eat several pieces of meat during the night to stay alive, and* I shouldn't be in a perpetual quest for more cotton, which seems very scarce but very needed for bandages and cloth strips, and many times I will find a cotton bush only to have it drop zero cotton.Things that would be nice going forward: * Being able to sleep part of the night away, say if you're full of food and in good health, * More content, * More monsters, * More crafting items, and * More building items such as walls, pike torches for some visual security at night, etc.			"

The map is big, and the three keys to live is life,heat and food.There is also some advices I can give:1. lack of servers, So now I can only play single game.2. I hope I can see around while heading to a constant direction, like DayZ you can hold ALT to turn head.3. I hope I can zoom in by press my right mouse button.4. Need a map.5. The elder scroll V gain a great success by support steam work shop. The two games have a lot in common,I believe steam work shop can also help this game rise to the top. "

								3/14/15: I found this game while searching through the Steam sales randomly. At the time, it was only $15 rather than $25. I looked through the screenshots and video and my first reaction was ""Wow this game looks like Skyrim and Minecraft combined. And it has multiplayer!"" I told my friends about it and they thought the same thing. So we all decided to buy it and jumped right into the game. After playing the game for awhile, here are a list of pros and cons I have noticed.Pros:-VERY fun playing with friends.-In game chat (a pro but you will want to use TeamSpeak or Skype instead).-Quite a large world already-Graphics are great for early access (if you have a powerful computer).-Variety of weapons, armor and misc craftables.-Crafting is straightforward and simple.-A challenge many games don't have.-Mulitplayer is easy to set up/join.-Create your own spawn point.-Characters and their items transfer across all servers.-Real fight for survival.-Searching for materials doesn't feel very tedious.-Shelters protect you from unwanted visitors.-Dragon!-Many updates and fixes to come.Cons:-Poorly optimized currently.-Random spawm points (sucks when you want to find friends on a new server).-The best armor wears away quickly when attacked.-Lag spikes when many enemies or items are in the area.-No map to speak of.-Deer run into the ocean.-Haven't been killed by the dragon.-Game crashes randomly.-No real use for shelters yet.I recommend this game in the current state it is at for the $15 I paid for it. However, I would wait for more updates to be released to feel like you got $25 worth of content. Definitely convince your friends to play it or else you might get bored/lonely.7/10 currently, but I believe this rating will go up as more updates are released.			"

								First off I have to say this is the best survival game that I have played to date! The crafting system is simplistic yet lengthy when making large projects. You have the option to play alone, play with friends, host a game or invite only. You can make a bloodbath of a PvP game or you can set it to be friendly and build a community together! This game has a Skyrim feel with the lurking death of the elements and wild beasts around every corner! I must say I am taken by this game and will be playing more! I am excited to see what updates are to come in the near future! If you are unsure of this be sure to check out the devs livestream on twitch, as well as seek out youtube videos of gameplay.I am giving this game a 10/10, Buy this and support the project! :D Thanks for reading!

								This game has plenty of potential. Pros and cons galore. Let's start with some of my very own game play.- Armor doesn't last long at all. If you like crafting armor then this is the game for you.- Adventuring. So much to explore. Not even really sure how large the island is but I get lost frequently.- Hosting is an issue for me. I'd like to be able to host for more than just 8 people. So far thats all I've seen are 8 man server hostings.- Mining rocks, this is questionable on just what you may or may not find. Ores are the most sought out pieces for me. Always making new armors because they take just a few hits before they are broken. Don't know if rocks respawn their ores. Needs to be taken up witht he Devs.- Fun. It's a game for me. I like it. can't wait to see how the community grows on this one. Community is key here.			"

								After the disappointment of The stomping land i deciced to spend $60 on a 4 pack of this game. Do i regret it? Well not at the moment. So far this game has a great setting to it and its content is not lacking. Considering this is a very new release i was impressed by it. No Dinosaurs but at least the Devs are active. For the moment. There are bugs (duh) but they will be eliminated. There are some annoyances though. The hitboxes in combat seem fairly sluggish, Eg Skeleton being able to hit me without me being in melee range, making it really difficult to fight really anything with out lossing hp. So no strafing. So ill cut my review short there. But overall ill recommend you buy this game for yourself if you like Skyrim or rust cos this game is somewhat simular to those games. But the best experiance is to play with friends.			"

Early Access Review
								Early access review, I will update it when the game officially releases but these are my thoughts right nowSavage lands drops you into a medival island where youre the only human around. Deer, wolves, and bears seem plentiful but there are also monsters that roam around (more commonly at night). Skeletons seem to be plentiful in certain areas but and most people will find that unfightable dragon within the first hour or so. The forest giant which is seen in the trailer is probably the most interesting enemy Ive encountered so far both from a gameplay and aesthetic perspective. Crafting is kept simple by not revealing recipies until after you've gotten some of the materials for it. I found this a nice way to do it because I wasnt wondering ""where do I get this and that to make this"" since usually I had already collected those materials. You can make all sorts of weapons, armor, bags, and buildings. You can even make your own town if youre so inclined to gather all the materialsThe game also runs pretty well but to be fair I do have a GTX 760 with 16 GB of ram. Theres very little that doesnt run well on my PC. Ive heard that the game is poorly optimized for lower end PCs but I havnt had that issue myself. The graphical fidelity of the game (detail) isnt all that great. I would compare it with textures that are somewhere in the 2007-2009 era but that said the aesthetics (art direction) is pretty spot on. The shapes of buildings, ruins, towns, enemies, and more make the game feel like your in a european island circa 19th centuryIn my experience the game is pretty bug free at time of writing. The only bugs Ive run into so far are graphical ones like a tree I chopped down disappeared. However to be fair I still consider myself in the ""just starting"" phase so well see if that changes. Perhaps the biggest praise I can give the game is to the developers themselves. They seem very active on the steam forum addressing questions and listening to feedback. I wish more developers were as involved in the community side as these developers are. So bottom line: Is it worth buying? Well I picked it up on sale for 8,99 and thats a little more then what lunch costs me. Ive had more then an hours fun with Savage lands so yes, i think its worth a buy at the sale price. However for full price...honestly I would say wait and see how development shapes up.			"

								Currently love the amount of craftable items already available from launch, would prefer it if the crude hatchet was easier to craft should one die and respawn.I would like to see basic clothing added to help provide a small amount of warmth, not armour rating or anything, then being able to wear armour over the top. Maybe an extra equipment slot for something like a cloak to also provide extra warmth.I've played this game for several hours with a friend and honestly do love the game, with as much content alreadily available from launch. However I'm waiting for the bow and arrow to be released, I needs me a basic ranged weapon.So my rating would currently be a 5/7. Good starting point so far, keep up the good work!			"

								Played about 3 hours so far and it seems pretty good :) obviously for alpha its not that diverse and the content is not much but it has potential ;) I think there needs to be a stanama bar with improved running. It sems to take FOREVER to get places.... Especially to chase down deer @.@ also of course you need a bow and arrows added to the game ;) Just please... NO ZOMBIES!!! There are WAY to many zombie games out there... this could be unique if you left it a little fictional but mainly realistic.			"

Early Access Review
								Rarely do I purchase a game on its first day, but I made an exception for Savage Lands. I have been looking for a Co-op game like this to play with a friend, so we both took a chance on it......and we love it! This game has major potential provided that the devs listen to the community and do not sell out to any big companies.Complaints:1. It becomes extremely laggy when looking at fire and when getting close to the ocean.2. When hunting the doe, they lag forward and backwards and become unto a reindeer and fly up into the sky.3. The crafting for the armor is a bit much for as little as you get when you mine for it. My friend and I mined for about half an hour and still did not have enough to make armor.4. When you are chasing the deer they can run into the ocean, extremely far into the ocean to where you cannot get them. I died once trying to chase one into the ocean and because when you look at the water it becomes laggy I died trying to get back to land.5. One of the funniest things happened when we were attacked by a bear. But even that had its problems. The bear was incredibly laggy and jumping every which way, it caused our frames to drop VERY low and made it difficult to run let alone fight the bear. And finally, the bear is horribly overpowered; one hit from it took more than half of my health.Approvals: 1. This game is like a crossover between Skyrim, Minecraft and The Forest. The crafting system is very in depth and makes sense unlike other games of this genre. 2. There is no, or very little, lag when playing in a Co-op server which is very, very nice.3. The huge world size and all the things you can do in this game with it only being in alpha.4. The homes you can build, although that needs some work, are quite adequateRecommended Additions:1. There should a long range weapon of some sort, a bow or slingshot would be preferable, I would press for both additions as slingshots would be a pretty nice addition and do not really get much use in video games.2. Maybe a mount of some sort?3. A Dungeon system that you could explore and find loot.4. The ability to place fire pits or have a fireplace inside the homes you build. 5. A way to find friends in a Co-op game modeAll in all this game is one of the only games I have paid over 5 bucks for in about 2 years and I would happily do it again. I only played for around 2 hours and can tell that this will become a favorite.As a plea to the game devs, please do not add any DLC that adds to the game in momentous proportions or give other players an advantage over each other. Other than that this game has my support as of now. "

								TL;DRJust don't.This game, in its current state, is a joke, a bad one. The store page says 4GB of RAM, but if you have 8GB it will eat it all and crash your computer. The sad thing is the devs know it, and after a bunch of ""new builds"" this horrible memory leak is still present. It is completely irrelevant if the gameplay is good, the crafting is ok, and all other aspects seems fine IF you can't even load the game on your system, it is just a pile of garbage sitting on your hard drive. I'm sorry, this was one of the games I had some high expectations. There is absolutely nothing in this game that justify anything more than 6GB RAM. Nothing! I can't recommend this game in any way. To keep my sanity, I'm just uninstalling this until a final release. For now, just don't.			"

Can't always loot your kills though.. but the version that is not beta, I do not like at all.  The beta is more like the one I began playing when I first started LONG AGO.. and I like the beta best.  Today is 31 Jan 2017.. I don't know if the reviews are for the regular version or beta but I recommend if you like the older version to just change it to beta..Yeah, I really do not like the regular version at all.. Just clarifying how much I don't like it.  Beta, for me, is the way to go! Hope they don't let go of the original version....			"

								18 Deer in a tree out of 10 ( that's a 8/10  for some of you. Here in a few months, if the game is where it should  be, it will get a 10 out of 10 but as for now it feels like late Alpha moving towards Beta and that's perfectly fine)    Some bugs? Yes Learning Curve? Yes.Most importantly this game is FUN! Haven't  played it with friends or a random server yet.  Let's be clear SL is very hard and if you die it feels like a real set back. But for every food item gathered, every weapon crafted   and building Built , this feels like  ""real"" accomplishments and vicrtories.  That all being said, that's why I love it! It's not holding my hand, it makes you think and work Learning from your mistakes and surviving another night is a reward itself. As for any Reviews bashing the team working on this. just ignore them. I've bought and played many games at a much higher  price tag, that didn't have half the content or a quarter the fun. Also, please ignore anyone with 0.3 hours in any game talking♥♥♥♥♥♥about  how bad a game is.                                       If you're on the fence about the game that's fine, hold out till the end of the month, but do keep an eye on the developer videos and update/bug fix lists that they try and post every thursday.                 P.S. You will die, get over it!   Also watch for the Dreaded Tree DEER.    HAVE FUN!!!Note: When a game or product is in early access, that means it's not finished, it's going to be buggy, lacking in content and not fully fleshed out. This game has so much potential, can't wait. If you can't get behind  SL, then go play Hello Kitty.			"

								From what I have played and seen thus far.  This game has EXTREME potential.  Very hard to survive, not impossible but much harder, on your own and must contribute a little team work.  Lots of pros and a few cons that I am sure will be addressed in the future.Pros:Extremely realsiticYou actually have to work at surviving, it isnt a givenYou have to actually hunt and not walk out the door and pop a random animal Very good AI difficultyGathering resources is the clostest to realistic of any survival game i have layed to date.Your character can freely raom between serversCons:Limited to 8 players unless on a dedicated serverMore deicated servers to provide larger populations on a server would be a big plus for this game for PVPNeed a way to lock and own your own structures, Ability to make the public or private(invite) communitiesWALLS are needed.  Every survival game needs walls.More Hotbar slots!Ability to form clans no larger then 8 i would say with shared structures and such.Overall this is a fabulous game with loads of potential.  Love the atmosphere and the mideval feel to it.  7/10 for me.  Will be playing more and setting up a dedicated server.  ANy new player needs to read the Community Forums, FAQs and Guides via steam to get a handle on gathering and survival in this game.  Love IT!			"

								Love the atmosphere of this game and the survival difficulty keeps you on the edge of your seat, it is well playable in its current state and on 40% sale at the moment cant go wrong. I think the clothing items degrade too quickly at the moment and I spend most of my time running around naked but I am sure this will eventualy be re-balanced. I would also like to see an aditional clothing slot for cloaks as you would need one in these harsh weather conditions. I think it would also be good if they added more cave typologies for shelter and bear spawn points. I am excited to see how this game develops it has so much potential.			"

								Been playing this game off and on for a few weeks now with my roommate. It has a great concept behind it. To survive in this game you HAVE to make friends to get near the ""endgame"". The community, for the most part, is really friendly. The game play is fun as well. The only MAJOR problems I've personally witnessed since purchase of this game is the Player hosted servers.Don't get me wrong, some are great. But others have some insane problems. Between deer walking in the sky to trees spinning through the ground up into the air. I know it's still an Early Access so i don't take it too much to heart that strange things are happening constantly. The only other bothersome problem is the amount of decorative builds you can make. they serve no use in game but to make things look pretty. BUT if they were actually able to be used, it would be FANTATIC. The game is quite well built and i would suggest and crafting/survival fan check it out. My favorite part by far is the fact that when you kill small goats they scream in a way that can only be described as hillarious. 7/10 for the game9/10 for screaming goats.			"

Some of the things that I feel are lacking at the moment are:     - In some areas there are lack of wildlife.     - Needs more explorable areas such as Caves (Wolf/Bear dens), Castle/Forts to go with some of the burnt down villages.    - Outside of the beach there are no other sources for water. Something more inland like ponds or lakes as well as the ability to fish.     - The player should be able to craft a map or a book to make a map (this one sounds far reaching)			"

								ONLY APPLIES TO LEGACYThe game is very fun and challenging. Really fun game to play with friends, and setting up multiplayer games is extremely easy which is a plus. The graphical settings are taxing, at least for my friends' and I's computers, but the game is still very beautiful to look at. The sound is very high quality and the ambience is very well done and really provides a good atmosphere. The hunger, heat, and health aspects are well-done and are a very good mechanism for the gameplay and the immersion. There is a sense of progression in the game, which is good for a game such as this because you can get plenty of hours out of it, and start over if you ever get bored. The character mechanic with individual inventories per character, similar to Terraria, works well with the game as you can create new worlds and new characters separately. There are a good amount of AI creatures and monsters that provide various mechanics to gameplay and can present harder challenges. I personally have had little trouble running the game with no crashing in the time I've played the game, alhough my specs are higher than the reccomended. My only complaint is the structure building system as it takes quite a while to build a necessary structure such as a forge. Overall, I highly reccomend this game.			"

								OK, early access. I've played a lot of the early access survival games and there's a few out there with much potential. SAVAGE LANDS seems great so far. Once you get a good system of gameplay happening then you have the opportunity to begin exploring and working towards crafting better gear. People who complain about losing everything when they die need to learn to strategize so I think that kind of argument is invalid.I've read some mixed reviews on this game but for me, so far, what these guys have given us is solid enough. I hope they come through with their update promises (looking forward to a bow).Well done so far devs and if you continue through to full release this game will top the list in survival games. I purchased on sale and most likely wouldn't pay the $25 pricetag for any early access game. For early access I think devs need to carefully consider their pricing. Anyway, I look foraward to seeing the updates continue to roll in.			"

Early Access Review
								Let's start with saying that this game is early access, so there will be bugs. But new updates and bug-fixes are released all the time, so the devs are realy working on this game, wich is nice.The second thing I want to say is: You WILL die! End of story, you simply will die! Not even Bear Grylls would survive this. on the first try. If the hunger doesn't get you, I bet the wolves or sceletons or those god damn bears will. And if you manage to survive all of those ordeals, the cold will kill you in the meantime. The good thing is that if you manage to find a village or maybe build a home, you can build a respawn point, so each time you die you will still have your stuff you have gathered and you home will be there.This game is a typical survival game. You gather wood/stones/food and alot of other stuff. Then you craft things like weapons/armor/buildings and try to survive the hostile environment.The crafting system is fun and rewarding, with alot of different things to craft.Another good thing is the night/day system. During the day you can run around and hunt or gather stuff or even explore. But during the night, it's a different story. It's very cold so you need to keep inside and have something to warm you. And the night brings out some scary creatures too.All in all I would recomend this game to people who like survival games. But remember: This is not a fully completed game, so there will be bugs/glitches/not very well-thought-out ideas that have ben implemented in the game.But if you don't mind that it's a great game already, and it has alot of potential to be even better.

Early Access Review
								I general the game as a premise is actually very invigorating and has a lot of excitement and urgency involved. I like the realism of the survival situation quite a bit because it makes you think on your toes. While I know it's not a finnished game there is a LARGE list of things I would say should REALLY get added into it to make it a quality game. It is very bare bones at the moment with little technical things like option screens and whatnot, which I understand, but as far as things I hope they're going to add as far as polish, I would very much appreciate an intro (though skippable) or SOME semblance of plot, and some reactionary voice acting from the player character would also be lovely, in addition to some lil tutorial bits, tips and pointers. Next, inventory. It does make a pretty fair amount of sense as is, with logs counting as whole objects and smaller things being stackable. The only thing I would say however that REALLY small items like berries, nuts and leaves shouldn't actually take up any room. The real issue I find however is the hunger clock. In general it's just far too simple to have any semblance of realism. You're constantly ticking down in a way that doesn't have anything to do with your activity level, and at an insane speed. You can litterally starve to death before the day is even over. (What am I a shrew?) The player already has quite enough to deal with in trying to stay warm and actually develop a camp. What I think it should contribute to, which would make the game much more realistic is an energy quality. The fuller the player, the more able they are in doing all their tasks, (makes a lot of survival sense) That way, in a sense of efficiency there's still quite some urgency to get food, but it's not constantly life or death. (Cold is in fact a much more immediate concern and could probably stay as is.) Now in relation to food, we'd have to mention hunting. This game's hunting mechanic is probably the silliest I've seen... in any survival game ever. You chase deer with a sword, and hit them in the but. They only reason you can actually kill them is because they're utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  You don't have to sneak, you don't have to set baint, you don't have to aim, and the only thing around are deer and wolves. (both of which, should be in all honesty an very rare thing to just ""stumble upon"" every time you run backwards into the forrest) So in general it would make a lot more sense to have a more trap-reliant system, with more small game, and more nuts and berries, roots and tubers, and for larger game it should be MUCH more difficult and MUCH more rewarding. (vs, ""Oh, I killed a deer by walking up to it and hitting it, guess that's only enough food for like the next two hours or so"") a carcass dragging mechanic in some form or another would also be good. And sinew is guts... all animals have guts (and bones), not just deer.  I noticed there was a compass somewhere in this game, so I'm not sure how that works yet, but I think a good positioning system that wouldn't take too much away from the feeling of ""lostness"" would be the ability to make a pinpoint on say like a shelter and it will keep track of the relative direction of that point. Not distance or anything relative to any other object, just ONE point, (just... give em SOMEthing please) Then, last but not least. Why in the heck isn't there a sleeping mechanic in this game? Am I litterally just going to have to be awake for weeks at a time? The shelter's are almost completely useless without it. Don't I get tired? Can't someone die from lack of sleep? Also can we make like a box please at some point. I do very much like the ""vicinity"" mechanic, but it does get kinda messy. Overal I think the game has a lot of potential. I wouldn't say that it is ready as-is, by a long shot but I've still enjoyed it quite a bit thus far.			"

Early Access Review
								this game hasn't really gone anywhere I feel like maybe it was a waste of money, This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further.  <----    I guess with that they are allowed to sell games at full price and NEVER have to  finish it, its sadBelow is what my response to a so called Devolper asked and I have yet to see  this game do anything stand out or new and inventive. The game should be free to  $5  max  and all or anything to do put out that is already out there in every  EVERY EVERY other game should be free updates (when ever they happen) also he can keep having his Fanboys say my review is not helpful all he wants,  still don't help his cause :D I will just put a new review upHe used putting a new Engine in as an ExcuseThe Unity 5 excuse is just that, an excuse that many game makers will use. (this  is only an example not directed to you or the game but a generaliztion) Many will  say that they are moving to a new engine and then nothing is done or moved  forwards or they will resell that new version to even the old people who played  the ""pre"" updated. I am glad however that you state that your company/game will  not be doing this. That in my mind is another reason to revisit your game and to  possialby change my outlook and review. I tend you be more lenient to honest and  upfront Developers :)He said they are doing differnt builds, but adding a .1 .2 .3 or other higher  numbers after a build by adding like 1 or 2 litle things doesn't make it a good  updated game.Well for one thing, it wasn't a build from that long ago, unless your saying it  has taken months and months for you to this Boss Encounter? So only thing I  didn't play yet was this Boss thing and will need to (again like I said) re- explore the landscape, as for the new items were not really that big of a change  from what have looked at, more basic things in a common game. As for the  creatures I do like a few of them, more added engagments are always a plus. So  again from what I have played your game does not stand out in any way then all  the many many games that are out there. I do however feel that your game does  have potential but surely a long way to go.I will have no problem revisiting your game later, I will have time in about a  week to do so, I will see what has been added and if its really being impoved and  it contiunes to devlope then I may change how I feel about the game. Problem is  from what I played and from the games out there, this game does not really stand  out. It also has way to go and with out real advancement, but again I will take  the time to play it and give it another go. Also, is this trasnsiting to Unity 5  the excuse your useing for not contiuning to impove? I have seen companies who  say ""but we are putting it into a new engine"" then later put out another Verison  of the same game but with HD files and better and then CHARGE people who already  have the ""old"" version and walk away from the ""old"" version with the ""new""  version and make bank while selling both and getting away with it. Time will  Tell.(later on) I did revisit, still think and feel the same, nothing new, same game  like the thousands of other games out there just like it.  OH WAIT...this is all  winter where most other games have differnt weathered seasons. hmmm....Time has told, and its still a game that feel like a retextured generic game like  many others.  wish I never got it, but live and learn right? !  :DAlso, kinda funny how the developers are all playing ARK: Survival Evolved , I  think they are to busy trying to copy as much as they can from that game then  making thier own game better.  just a thought....P.S had to make a new review because the developers and fanboys all tried doing  thumbs down on my review because they don't want people seeing and bad reviews.also I did a bunch of Achivments so this way they can't do like they are doing to many people and say well if you try it now we can look at your achivments and see how far you got in thier bad game. I guess they want proof that you wasted your time.  oh well...			"

								Note to self- dont waste money on early access games.Now for the rewiew- Textures are really ugly. Fps is bad. Animations are atrocious (character uses bandages by eating them). Survival is easy- food is plentiful and not very hard to find. Combat is boring- you simply m1 things until they (or you) die. Wolfes will always hit you, boars and skeletons are quite easy to avoid by simply moving backwards.No building customizatin- you can only build a few different houses (wooden boxes) that has no windows and floor (snow clips through the roof btw). No furniture expect for chests, you cant even make a bed to rest through the night. Very rough game that gets boring really fast. It has SOME potential and i can only hope that devs will make it more interesting in the future. 3/10			"

								I like the idea and the general looks of the game. It's like a wannabe Skyrim survival edition and there's nothing wrong with that. But alas, the game is near unplayable as it currently is. Unlike some of my friends, I at least managed to get the game to run, but it's still a pretty bad slide show even when I drag the sliders to minimum. There's not much to do, the environment feels empty and kinda pointless. The game has clipping issues and the loading times are insane. Savage Lands shows potential, but it still requires a lot of work to be a proper game.			"

The pvp is a bit glitchy and there is currently some slight lag spikes, but aside from that the game is well worth its $15! Updates coming in every month. Only had the game for a few days and can't wait to progress through it farther. Some of the terrain is a bit glitchy and mobs despawn/respawn right in front of you, but it's a newer game and well worth it. I'll find you KUR!!!!			"

								It is a fun game but navagation is terrible. Once you leave the beach everything looks the same. When I leave my ""home base"" i get lost for 2-3 game days. I have read that the sun works backwards i.e. rises in the west and sets in the east. Just adding a compass marker for your spawn totem would be a Great help. Also it would be nice if the random loot you find in buildings would scale to what you are crafting. I find only things i have already crafted and don't need. I like the ""realism"" but I think it is a little overboard. This is a game. Keep it fun. I know this is an early release and so far it is building to a great game.			"

Early Access Review
								Before even starting the game, I realized that the character creation was pretty lacking, with very few options and the ones that were available were pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ I settled with my bright pink neanderthal with a mohawk and jumped in to the world. You start out next to a charred skeleton, some starting gear and a book which you can read and learn a bit of the back story to the area of the game. I have mixed feelings about these books. I feel like the guy who designed this feature is one of those people who reads the quest giver text in MMO's. Seriously who the ♥♥♥♥ does that? It is kinda dull to stop and read a lot of text, especially if you are freezing your♥♥♥♥♥off and slowly dying of hunger. But there are some certain situations in the game that make this kinda cool - I'll explain more on that later. You quickly learn that you are on a snow covered island where you need to hunt for food, keep warm and ideally build shelters and better armor and weapons to progress to new areas of the island. I do like the idea of progression, with enemies further in the game getting tougher and requiring you to fully explore each crafting tier before moving on or potentially getting your head beaten in by a Silver Surfer or mini Maokai. But it does make it a tiny bit grind-ish by forcing you to collect a large number of materials to make the required gear. This is made even worse if you are playing co-op or in a group as the mining nodes have set locations and respawn times, so you may end up fighting each other for them or having to wait. We did find one solution to quickly get some crafting materials early in the game. You can build houses and shelters to keep yourself warm and your items safe and there are a few little pre-generated unfinished villages around the map. One creative way to keep yourself warm is that you can actually set these half-built houses on fire! Not only that but after they burn down they spew out precious resources that you can then re-use to make armor or new houses.As with most survival games, you get thrown in to the game with very little explanation of what to do. Luckily the intro to the game has been very carefully set up. There is a small town within view that you can head over to and easily figure out that these buildings are incomplete and you need to craft nails and wooden boards to finish them off. The wooden boards are easily - make axe, cut trees, get wood, make boards. The nails took us a bit longer to figure out.. You can click on the item in the crafting window and it tells you what items you need to craft it. You need tin to make nails, you need a smelter to make tin from tin ore and coal.. but where the ♥♥♥♥ do you get tin ore and coal! We eventually noticed some ore deposits around the place, where you can get tin, coal, etc. But we had no idea how to mine them! Turns out, the tool required for mining is a Hammer. Why the ♥♥♥♥ a hammer.. c'mon. I think there are two things to do to help new players here; Firstly, the text on the item that says ""Used for Mining"" is the same color as the rest of the flavor text and blends in. Perhaps making it a different colour would help new players spot what it's used for. Secondly, don't make it a ♥♥♥♥ing hammer! What's wrong with pickaxe?Shortly after settling down in our ♥♥♥♥♥♥ village, we were filled with a sense of dread after hearing loud roars in the distance and after looking up seeing a big ♥♥♥♥ing dragon breathing fire on a tower. Now i've read other people's accounts and apparently the dragon has come and laid waste to them all, but even after shooting arrows at him in an attempt to♥♥♥♥♥♥him off he still hasn't paid us a visit. I have always been one to take on a challenge, so the big♥♥♥♥♥dragon is kinda a cool feature. It makes me want to get better gear and slay that ♥♥♥♥er. Behind the village is a little cotton farm which you can harvest to make bandages. I think its explosive cotton because the sound effect when you harvest it sounds like small explosions. Luckily there is enough cotton to make a comfortable number of bandages for two people, but tough♥♥♥♥♥♥if you are playing in a larger group. Again, you may need to turn your volume down or risk becoming permanently deaf as crafting the bandages sounds like metal banging together inside your ear drum. Food on the starting island quickly runs out, forcing you to move on to the next main island where you are met with a sharp increase in the level of challenge the game offers. You are soon surrounded by tasty antelope and rabbits that you can eat, but also giant blue cats and skeletons that can eat you. The AI is a bit frustrating here because if you stand still you can see that all of the enemies are slowly gravitating towards you.. eventually getting close enough to sprint at you and wreck your day. Luckily they attack slowly, because if they hit you you're ♥♥♥♥ed. You can only take one or two hits because most likely you skipped the tin and copper tier armor because there is just not enough ores on the starting island to make them! We eventually stumbled upon a little town that was completely built! It made us wonder why the ♥♥♥♥ we built up the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ town when we could have just lived here. We grabbed all of our loot from the old place and moved in, even though it felt a little too good to be true. We noticed that there was one of those books that we never read in the town so we decided to read it. It explained that the previous villagers had all evacuated because the town was haunted and that something still lingered. Well,♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sure enough, that night the town filled up with ghost skeletons that wanted to put their cold bony fingers in our butt holes. ♥♥♥♥ it, too late, we settled. We have just accepted the fact that we have to brawl skeletons each night. After gathering up enough food to survive and ores to make bronze armor, we went for a wander. We found giant trees that wanted to eat us, green lumberjacks, Gollum, Shrek and a really cool teleporting doorway! It looked like you were going in to some ruins but when you went through you were actually on the other side of the map in another ruins. It's actually a pretty awesome feature! All of these cool little finds makes me want to explore the game even more.Apart from the pretty buggy AI, teleporting enemies, characters glitching through the floor, getting stuck on terrain, terrible sound effects, character animation being really♥♥♥♥♥♥. the game actually has some very solid game play. I think it does have a fair way to go but looking back at other games like Minecraft and Rust that looked ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but actually had solid game play.. Those games have come a long way and are now really awesome. I think that with a bit of attention this game could definitely be one to look out for. If you want to jump on the bandwagon early then you can grab it at an awesome price right now on the Humble Bundle website. Definitely advise checking it out if you have the time to play as it does take a little bit of time to get in to.			"

								I received this game for free from a friend. At first startup I was puzzled by an out of memory error. Quickly fixed that by changing my VRAM, I had an absurdly small amount allocated for VRAM. This game is definitely tough as nails. If you're looking for another WoW or something easy like that this isn't for you. You can die. Multiple times. All while standing there wondering why you can't heal yourself because you are too cold or too hungry to run... Building houses and campfires and other such necessities are a nice touch. You can set spawn points so you don't have to run all the way across the map to your freshly lain to rest carcass. Currently I have a couple of bronze and copper equipment from getting copper from a friend... Still haven't found a copper vein yet.. I got tin!! plenty of rocks and flints as well. I will be playing this game for a long time to come.			"

								I can't negatively review this game because honestly, I find it fun.  It didn't cost much, and some improvements I'd hoped to see quickly actually came with their latest patch, ""....which was nice. "" /Fast Show UKWhat do I expect from Early Access purchases? That fundamentally, the game is playable (for me, it is). I'm entertained, and find it relaxing to stop thinking about stressful real life crap and just come in here and think, instead, about stressful imaginary crap. So, there's that.  I think it's off to a good start, and I think I'll keep playing, and see where things go.This review has been amended 20-3-2015 following updates that actually gave us some of the items I listed below.******************************************************That said:Does it need more refinement? Yes. Could it use more depth? Yes.  Are there some illogical elements insofar as what can/cannot be crafted? Yes. In what world can I build a house with no shelves? Forge armour and not craft a ranged weapon?  (yes, I know they're coming, huzzah).   Is the weather and landscape lacking a certain degree of variety/dynamism? Yes.  It looks like Skyrim now and then, in some semi-modded capacity...or more accurately, Skyrim: Groundhog Day.  It'd be great to see some climate variation, even if this is meant to be a cold island, light/clouds/tones of the sky still change from day-to-day in the real world.Buggy? Eh...I find minor things - one crash the other day, trees that are apparently made of indestructible material, and the wolfskin helms that bug out and hide your head.   On the whole it's worked fine for me in that respect.Assuming my bows and arrows show up soon, (and honestly you can kill deer without them easily enough, but it'd be a nice touch), this is my wishlist thus far:1) If I decide to plot a house, I'd like to decide to UNPLOT, (or even unBUILD) it at some point. I made the mistake of dropping a stone house plan nearby, only to see it bug out half a metre above the ground, and apparently I'm stuck with it until we have a way to undo these - bleh. Kind of a landscape killer there, guys. EDIT: 20-3-2015 - Building diagrams can now be disassembled by the player by hitting it. Nice one. Thanks for that.2)Houses need the ability/capacity to have fires, or at least hang torches, inside them. I get that wood=fire, but again, if we can craft homes of stone, we can craft FIREPLACES of stone, or at least firepits in homes that include the means by which air/heat/smoke can escape, surely. It's not necessarily about having a fire to keep warm, if the home is providing that benefit - it's about that elusive fine line between ""survival"" and ""surviving very nicely, thank you very much"".   3)As others have suggested, craftable forges would be nice so that players can live where they like and still get this done without travelling to them. EDIT: 20-3-2015 - loving the blacksmithing addition; this gives you not only a craftable forge at a location of your choice, but doing that gives you another heat source, indoor light, as well as a windowed dwelling of sorts.4)I personally think the ""hunger"" timer is too fast - even if you're cold and running around all day, I'm pretty sure you can't eat 5 entire deer, a bucketload of tree nuts, 5 berries and two wolves without at least needing to unbuckle that armour and have a good lie-down.  Conversely, I think the cold timer is pretty spot-on, ESPECIALLY once you gear up a bit, and take the time to whack a few trees for some nuts while you go out hunting - it's very manageable indeed. EDIT: 20-3-2015 - hunger timer improved somewhat/some minor food improvements made. Huzzah.5)IMHO brewing would be cool. Humans have managed to make things-to-drink-out-of-other-things from the earliest days of civilisation.  Perhaps a mechanic where drinking anything alcoholic gives you a boost or small benefit - but at a minor cost to body heat. On the whole, I find this is a promising title and I hope the devs STAY ON IT and flesh it out a lot more. If they do, I think it would have a solid audience looking for something that brings together building/survival and that lovely feeling of an older world.I'm sure there's more, and I'll come back to this eventually, but I've had fun in here, will continue to do so, hopefully.*****			"

								I really loved the theme this game has going, I love most of the island's denizens  and how hard it is to start off (( i spent two hours trying to get a bow so i could get food, surviving off of cured meat that spawned at one of the leantoos, the building mechanics remind me of forrest a bit as well. my list of what i like and dont likePros-Great environment- Creatures look rather beautiful from giants to tortured spooky skeletals- the sense of danger at the begining is great, i was afraid to venture into the forrest near the begining becasue of the sounds i heard.-The push to talk is F***ing great Cons- Severe difficulty drop with friends(( with just two people mea and a friend were near to end game with in an hour of playing))-Holy smoke.....More crafting options and buildings, Add insentive to not stay in a generated village or town for to long.- enemies cant seem to handle two people attacking it, as it tries to swap between two targets frequently- up the damage on some enemies a bit, with chain mail i was able to solo a fury and take 2% damage- Again, up the difficulty on some enemies, the end game ones should cause some caution when facing them- Add more ranged weaponry, and deer spawn, grinding for sinew and hide is fun and all, but needing all these arrows to take down three deer is bothersome , or at least program some sort of head shot to kill deer instantly when hiting the head.- not trying to be picky, but a little more work on the animations wouldnt hurt a bitOver all, this game is fun at the begining, but later on, it loses its hold due to lack of some enemies output of damage, add more crafting stations so people need to refine good at them  before useing them at the forge, that kind of thing, I'm running on blanks for what you can do to lengthen the entertainment of this game , but you could scale enemy difficulty with the amount of people on the server, lock certain types of resource to a certain tool to make it even harder to get so people don't fly up the tech tree.

Killed 2 wolves at once.Made a Heavy stone hammer finally. FIRE WENT OUT AGAIN?!?!?!Inventory is full, cant grab logs. Stash all my un-needed things on the ground in one of the houses. Run for more logs and stones.I really need to make a chest.Jesus, its cold. Finally have enough to craft the campfire again!Press K to craft......SLASH SLASH SLASH.Armored Skeleton chops me down.10/10 will wake up at my respawn skulls and go loot my own body.Good job so far.... just get them campfires a little more lengthy in time so I dont have to make a new one every 15 minutes.:/			"

								This game is entertaining when played with friends.- would love a more obvious access to host controls, when I first played, I couldn't set the server to have a password or be private because I didn't know that those host options even existed because they were hidden within game setting options while I was hosting.  Little kids came onto my server and began taking some of my hard earned high quality ores and etc.- Would love to have an easier time finding dire bears.  Looked on the forums and wiki to find that people say that dire bears spawn on the eastern side of the island.  My friend and I trecked across the fairly uninteresting landscape to the eastern side, only to camp out for 4 days and nights without encountering even a single dire bear.  Would like to have the spawn rate for them increased please,  or have increased spawn rate at night.Other than these few minor gripes, the game seems to have a lot of potential.  Map and level design should be worked towards resembling that of Skyrim tbh. As of now, it's like walking across a massive dome shaped hill.			"

								Very good survival game.It's something like the union of Dark Souls mood, with always snowing land like Skyrim, with the typical craft of survival genre.Seems pretty rough to be launched as Early Access, but I do enjoy Early Acc. politics because that show very well the way developers deal with public, maintain the game fresh with a good timing, and of course, don't make promises that will not be fulfilled.You can notice 2 main experiences with this game:- Keep every information outside the game untouch. Don't play reading walkthroughs and nothing, the discovery feeling it's true and authentic here.- Keep playing after realize the game. That part, if you're wondering if it worth, well, by the price, it's fair enough. You help the Devs, and if enjoy hard survival game with players brain needed, it's your game. And developers seems very concerned about players opinion, making the community very fond.			"

Early Access Review
								I've only played 27 hours and I find the game to be a handful at first, but playing with others makes it ten times easier. In the 27 hours I've played, I managed to craft the best armor and get the best weapons in the game. It's rather dissapointing to be honest. Food is easily manageable so long as you find a deer or what have you. The cold is easy to manage as well, all you need is wood, stone and flint and voila, campfire. I can see how it would be difficult at first for some, but I found it rather easy, like I said, I have the best of everything in the game after 27 hours. It's a bit boring now, I've killed all the bosses barring Kur, the dragon, and there's just not much to do to be quite honest. The game is worth 50 hours of gameplay max right now if you know what you're doing. There are no quests other than killing the 5 or so skeleton bosses. Combat is rather plain as well, but can be difficult when fighting bears or forest giants or any of the bosses. Other than that, if you're well equipped, you'll mow down everything without losing any health. Resource gathering is easy, but tedious, most of my time playing was spent gathering materials for armor and such. Back to combat, like I said it's rather plain and the attack animations are nothing to right home about. There are no shields and you cannot block whatsoever, the archery isn't all that great and there is only one bow as it stands, no crossbows, spears or the like. You're limited to mostly one handed swords, especially the high end gear; it's all one handed swords. There are a few axes and maces, but the weapon variety could be more varied. Shields and a blocking mechanic would definitely spruce up combat, perhaps. Now that I'm thinking about it, theres so much disparity between being well equipped and not being equipped as such. For example, the savage wolf armor I wear for the most part allows me to take on huge groups of wolves without losing any health, but when I first fought a wolf with just basic clothing and a primitive axe I almost died. Now, I know you want to rewarded for your efforts in getting good gear, but the disparity from fighting one wolf and almost dying early on to easily spanking ten or more without getting hurt is a little much. Overall, the game has a lot of potential just as others have said and as of right now, if you go in alone it will net a player around 50 hours or so of gametime if I were to guess, which isn't half bad. There just needs to be more to do, combat could be made a little more interesting and more difficult when at higher levels of gear, crafting could possibly be a little more difficult as well. Through and through it's a solid game to invest a little time in so far.			"

								Just 2hrs into the game and have to say I'm enjoying it so far.What surprised me the most was how fast those 2hrs went!  I was able to build a small house, learn to fight and hunt, and complete the (for lack of a better term) tutorial, but I didn't feel like it was rushed or that I was out of things to do.  To me, there is a very real sense of your character fighting against the environment, you have to worry about food (not water - yet), heat/warmth, and general health.  You get too hungry, or too cold and you start losing health!Everything you do increases or decreases the amount of ""warmth"" your character has, and weather/time of day seems to impact the base speed at which warmth decreases.  Middle of the day with a lot of sun, warmth declines slowly (you're still in a ""cold"" region after all), middle of the night out in the snow, and warmth drops noticeably faster.Because of these mechanics, shelter and fire are an absolute must for survival, as they are the only ways to actually increase warmth, and so are as important as your weapons and armor!Building construction is very much like another ""dropped on an island and you need to survive"" game, where you choose a blueprint from a book, place it where you want/are allowed by terrain, then off you go to gather the supplies to actually build it.  This does mean buildings are ""templates"", so if you want dynamic and custom building designs, not yet, but maybe down the road a bit.General crafting is a sudo progression system, the first time you gather a specific resource you gain new recipes related to it (if any).  So as you advance in your gathering, you gain the ability to make more things, but there are no ""skill levels"", it simply down to your luck and actions.One thing I found I don't like is that animals you hunt can, and will,  run into the ocean to escape.  The problem is that if you go too far out, your warmth (and shortly thereafter, your health) drops like a 1 tonne stone in a 5x gravity well.  So it would be nice if animals had a bit more awareness in that regard, but it's still very early in development, so it is always subject to changing.Overall Savage Lands is a lot of fun solo, but I think once the village creation content is expanded a bit more, this game will shine in Co-op or the faster paced PVP/multiplayer aspects as well.

								I really Love this game, A lot of exploration and different enemy types they have done the combat so well and crafting as well. I am an old school rpg player mainly rooted in asherons call but this games seems to some how bring back some of that classic rpg fighting warrior feel yet stay modern and exciting. You don't get your hand held and the world is unforgiving. I heard the devs say they read every review so if you read this thank you very much and three suggestions that  I would like to see in the game are more points of inrest on the map I love to explore and find new things, caves/dungeons/altars/ruins/towns/mines/etc... also as far as dungeons maybe triggers and puzzles to solve. Last but not least this is a personal request I think would be nice, I watched the Q&A's and heard about pvp and how I understood is there will be pvp and non-pvp servers I like this but may I suggest, On non-pvp servers make an altar/item/potion/quest that will turn you pvp with some visual indicator that you are pvp and allow you to only kill other players also flagged this way. You could remove the pvp flag on death or require another item to remove it. Again thank you very much if you read this review, I very rarely write reviews but this game deserves ones.			"

								At first glance you get a nice little quest chain to get you going. One hour into it you're getting a house, several tools and some other goodies. ""Can't sleep, wolves will eat me."" those punks come from out the woodwork to get you. Keep your sound up and pay attention to the noises around you. Otherwise, it is worth every penny. Graphics are nice but I can see the potential if it keeps getting better and better. Gender selection and a few other *glossy* touches will be nice later but for now and the fact I put more than 5 hours in from the time I downloaded it and I'm barely off the beach and just now exploring the wild. It has captivated me in a way that a fantasy survival game should. Bravo Developer for an awesome Early Access Game, I look forward to future patches. I would gladly pay $24.99 for this title as it's worth every penny.			"

Early Access Review
								Short: it’s like Skyrim with swords and multiplayer.It reminds me a lot of mine craft alpha, but without as much building.Long: In the 11 hours I have played I have managed to build all the different buildings currently in game. I have not seen some things yet (like bears), but I am impressed with the game.Keep in mind it is early access, so it has things it needs to work on.Buildings- the only one worth actually building is the forge. It is the only house that acutely has a permanent light and heat source, and it is relatively easy to make if you can mine up some ore and rock. It needed to make armor, better gear, and repair some stuff. The town hall I not worth it, although it is the only other one that seems to have a floor- it looks like it should be multi story but its jest a box like the rest and takes up a lot of wood. Despite what the description on it says, the forge offers more heat (or at least seems to. Spent most of my time there). There are torches, but something smaller like candles would be nice, that last longer but provide no heat. The only current furniture you can put in a house is a box, which is useful but I hope they expand to include chairs, beds, tables, etc. Or even fur rugs that bring up the warmth of the room. Fences would be nice also.Terrain- it’s a lot like getting lost in a forest. There’s rocks, trees, and sometimes abandoned buildings or towns. Also a lot of things want to kill you. There is also a tower (towers?) that has a dragon at the top. One of the things missing from the landscape however seems to be water in the form of pods, stream, or rivers. There are also no cliffs or caves, its jest hills. Due to the fact that you cant dig your own mines or whatnot, it would be nice to see mines you can use at some point.Mining/logging- One of the things that I do dislike is the fact that ever tree and rock is a finite resource. There is no way to grow back trees and rocks get mines out after a bit. Without the ability to create a mineshaft or other resource gathering things, this means you will always have to venture further and further out. Not that big a deal, until you get to the higher tires of crafting and more so with high tire repairs. I don’t know if items held on a character travel with them to other maps, but there is a point where you could clear the map of all trees/rocks. There are mini spawning points near rocks for some of the things you can get form them, but for large scale crafting it won’t sustain you. That said, it’s kind of fun to look for things and be able to make where you have been before with if a rock is taped out or not.Enemies are hard. The only thing that doesn’t attack you is deer. The damage system could use work, but it’s like mine craft alpha where there was no knockback. A damage indicator as in what direction things are hitting you from would be nice. Low health gives you the blood eyes thing and makes the screen grayer. So far, I haven’t had much trouble with anything other than one enemy. I found a tree giant at some point, but not knowing what they looked like (and because they don’t move) I thought it was a resource… that went well. I lived but he broke all my armor (it would be nice to be able to repair broken gear by the way!) and he went back into the trees.All in all, it’s fun. I think it would be better with people, as I have been playing until this point solo.10/10 got wrecked by a tree			"

								Not a bad game at it's current state, though the firepit issue really gets annoying. Compared to many other games out there that try to follow this same idea of ""game type"", it's probably one of the better ones. Controls aren't too bad, I actually could play it more than 5 minutes and not shut it off because of things walking through solid objects, or animals killing me that were nowhere near me and out of reach. I don't like how things on the ground are highlighted, and labeled.  I also think there is too much free stuff scattered about, needs to be more make and create your own, not just find it. I had four axes within a couple minutes.Some other things that need work, ...enemies can't get you in the water? Some objects and buildings can't be destroyed? When you kill a deer or rabbit for example, instead of fading out, have it turn to bones at least.... looks a bit silly now. I just gutted it, but it's still in the same condition, then it just fades away... not good. What really impressed me about the game, i had a speck of life left, and a snowstorm blows in... it was so bad...it became a white-out to where i couldn't see to find the firepit!! Pretty cool feature!! One of the rare moments where you get a weather related incident that affects your life in a game like this...loved it!			"

								EDIT: Below main body, added info about crafting, character advancement, graphics. Not to copy others, but.Really a good fun time. MP and SP so far are both entertaining. It is like Skyrim meets The Long Dark. Hunger, cold ( COLD!!! ) critters.. and of course.. A mutha' of a Dragon.Online offers 'Friendly' and 'Hostile' game servers.You can simply die from not watching your cold, but you will know your cold.Currently only schniepel holding characters. ( male )Missing a few animations.. like you eat your bandage when applying.Overall totally worth it though. If you want to play online, I suggest you try it now, before everyone starts just killing everyone else.. as always happens.BTW. NO GUNS. NO MAKING NUCLEAR POWERED WEAPONS IN A STONE PILE WITH BUBBLEGUM.Pure Medieval tech.Enjoy!EDIT: Should add some info about crafting / etc.First, you learn to craft things by finding advanced materials, or finding 'things'.For example, on building the blacksmith, you can now create various ores. When you do that, you can now create higher end items... and so on.Levels, there are none. No worry over xp's and leveling a character. Its toughen up as you go!  Inventory. Its actually pretty easy to deal with, and like the ol' soldiers bag of bags. You have an inventory box, in that you can put things, or bags. Your bags are in a box below, in order. So you can sort your inventory by item type etc. The only annoying thing to me, if your hotbar has an open slot and you pick up something it jumps there. I forgot that a few times and just didnt look at the hotbar out of 'forgettting' and was scratching my head looking for something... duh.Graphics. Not to bad at all. I ve mostly been playing on a laptop, and have zero load issue, zero frame freezes, your character in inventory window is very crisp and detailed, the game itself is very sharp, with a hint of 'blur' as a way of replicating the weather of frost / freezing.  I actually expect that will enhance as we go, but its very nice at the moment. Enjoy!			"

								I recommend this game only to veteran survival sandbox game players. It is simply too hard for 96.7% of average game players. I have made it to day 89 of 7DTD solo without dying. I have played other games hardcore, as well. But this game was almost unplayable. The learning curve is wicked hard. Almost none of the people posting game videos online have made it past 4 videos. They simply cannot remain alive.PROS: Great looking game visually even on lower video settings.CONS: The repeated use of the same trees that can be harvested gives it a christmas tree farm look at times.PROS: Great weapons and armorCONS: You can have an Ebon Steel axe or Ebon Steel Armor. You only have enough gem shards for one or the other due to fairly horrid constant repair costs.PROS: The game has a relentless feel that drives you to goals related to survival, such as warmth and food.CONS: The game is developed by devs who are like frustrated teenagers who inexplicably took viagra. The warmth and life bars lose 1 life per second at times. The devs are like the boyfriend who is premature, and the players are the girlfriends who have a moue.PROS: The crafting although basic is doable and has a need to do it to survive element to it.CONS: There are only a few abandoned buildings to stay in, requiring you to make camp fires every couple of minutes as you travel at the beginning. Also there is only one forge in an abandoned town I found to use at the beginning, and it is camped by a patrolling red eyed skeletal warrior. They are instant death at the beginning, but by the time you have chainmail and an Ebon Steel Axe, they are simply annoying, as they cause damage to your armor that is horrid to fix.CONCLUSION: Love the game, love playing it. But it is going to fail in commercial release, as it is simply too hard. Even if they put in a do this, then do that tutorial, the game is simply too hard for the majority of gamers. I had to delete my first 8 games, since bears and wolf packs camped my bodies making them unretrievable. Great game. Too hard. Loses all but the very most stubborn veteran sandbox players. Would have made it a negative review, except I enjoyed it too much.			"

								This game is really like The Forest and Skyrim had a baby and it tried to grow up to be Minecraft, but that's a good thing. The gameplay is amazing and if you have the settings on the highest it looks beautiful. Everything, even down to the littlest details it is amazing. For this being an Early Access Game it is great and seems really finished but there will be a lot more that you can do within the game. There are many surprises within the game. When you think you've progressed all the way, trust me you haven't. This game get's a thumbs up from me mostly because it is fun alone, but a lot more fun with friends. I love this game to death and I can't get enough of it.-Have Fun,                  Pope Kale			"

								Wrote a big review but steam refused to save it.Short version: Snow, Ruins, Monsters and you have a loincloth.Skyrim + Frostfall + campfire (but no civilization - just ruins, and you can build things almost everywhere)Grindy, lonely, a bit buggy.Intended for multiplayer combat - I'm not sure you can beat the second island alone.Multiplayer risks your stuff  - if the server quits you only keep what's in your inventory at that moment - whatever is in your hands drops on the ground when you die. Anyone can grab it.  Your backpack appears safe.Very unfinished so hopefully the problems all get fixed.  I'm not sure what the endgame will be like.Best advice:  - learn each enemy's attack patterns - most are dodgable. - get a bronze hammer (or a steel hammer) ASAP to reduce the time mining for ore / flint / stone / coal. - build lots of spawn points - bandages (Keep 20 in your hotkey bar) - remember that you can always teleport to a new game and keep your inventory (ESC -> Main Menu -> New Game)  - Maybe the compass will help you, but I got lost all the same. - The hardest enemies only come out at nightMost fun - Intense fights - until you get great armor you'll be dead in just a few hits.- searching for crafting componentThe starting location is mostly harmless, Once you cross the big bridge (to island 2) the shore is covered with baddies who respawn instantly. Oddly if you get past them to the mountain it's a lot easier.  Past that is a valley with Silent deadly elementals and then another mountain with few enemies, lots of Iron and a little silver.  To actually use the silver requires a bunch of rare drop from the tree midgets and plague wolves. I recommend a steel spear for the high damage and range - or you can find 'The needle' which is a tiny bit better and requires no crafting.At the moment this game is rather limited.  I got it in a humble bundle, I wouldn't buy it on its own merits.			"

								Earlier today, I posted a snarky, joking review simply stating, ""Why do I even bother with early acces games?"" What I wasn't expecting, however, was for the developers to actually respond to my review and ask for specific feedback. And you know what? I just gained a significant amount of respect for them. Too many people these days just totally ignore people's feedback, and it's very refreshing to see someone who cares about what their players have to say.To be honest, the problem isn't really with the game. I had to turn the settings way down to get the game to run right, I got lost in the wilderness within minutes, and I just couldn't really find anything to do. Really, the truth is I just have no business buying early access games and expecting them to be as polished and content-filled as a full game; I honestly don't know what I was thinking.Dear developers, if you are reading this: I apologize for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Although the game may not be up to my own personal standards, I am certain that when it is fully polished and considered complete, many everywhere will enjoy and cherish it. I wish you success and the best of luck as you continue to make games.And be sure to keep listening to feedback, 'kay? :)			"

I just love the Fantasy setting so much since i loved Skyrim so much and would just get lost in its world, im already getting that same feeling exploring the world of Savage Lands and i think anyone that likes open world Fantasy games will feel the same way. Like i said earlier the game is still very early in Development with a lot of stuff still to be done and many many bugs. But if you can understand that and want to help support the development and help shape the world of Savage Lands while its still in Development and join a great community then i highly think you should jump right in :-)			"

My ears perk when the wind catches the mating call of a female elk in heat (My feeding hole begins to salivate). I stumble through the brush following the scent of my four legged foe...majestic and free i find her standing dangerously alone, most likely sperated from her heard for grazing...a foolish mistake. As I peer through a snow capped bush at my future sustinance, I suddenly feel the now comfortable weight of something previously aquired...the stone.   Millions of year of evolution have prepared me for this one moment, one that will define this island and all its inhabitents. Instinct takes over, my heart rate and respirations increase, my arm muscle swells with the rush of oxygentated blood, adrenaline courses through my body as I release the stone at a roughly 40 degree angle.  What followed is something that will effect me forever in this world, I will never forget the sound of that stone impacting the poor animals skull, or the gutteral painfilled screams proceeding, screams that cut deeper than the cold ocean breeze. I stood paralyzed as I watched the elk run off into the foilage, disapearing as if just a dream all along..a lesson to us all.

								Savage Lands another survival crafting game in early access. Although the game shows promise there are many lacking features but contains some decent features aswell. I am banking the 20 Bucks I speant on this game for it to be worth it when its finished. Pros- Has alot of potential for being a much better game but right now its lacking.- Community is amazingly helpful to new players - Devs are making updates to fix problems around every 12 days.- Easy to Repair Weapons which is VERY helpful- Playing with friends makes the game so much more fun and better all around. I do not think you should buy this game if you plan on playing alone.Cons- ""Advanced Creature AI - Every creature in Savage Lands will be powered by a unique AI system complete with line of sight, collision avoidance, situational awareness, and pack mentality designed to bring the world to life. "" (*Sneezes* cuz im allergic to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T) The AI for anything in the game is horrible. ex. You can dry hump anything from the back and not have them attack or run from you. Even if the game is early access it should atleast have a slightly better AI then this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I could jump a pack of wolves one by one when they were 1 foot away from each other and none of them notice.- The learning curve for the game is a bit higher than other survivals because you have to worry about 3 different things, Warmth, Health, and Food.- The more you play a world the harder it becomes to gain resources since Trees and Rocks do not replenish- If you do not have friends to play with, the game becomes very boring- Some items do not have their own icon (Minor Problem but seeing where they are in the game, I feel they should have fixed this before adding an item)- You need a decently strong computer to play the game with a decent FPS at the lowest settings - Lack of content (currently) "

								Disappointed, to be honest. I've played this game on and off for nearly a year (played time is inaccurate, it's actually 15-25 hours) and it's gone nowhere. Performance is still poor, the game is still extremely limited in scope, and surviving against supernatural hordes in a ""heavy metal arctic wilderness"" is not nearly as fun as it sounds. The game still doesn't support Surround/Eyefinity, but performance is so poor even on one screen that this is somewhat irrelevant. Every time there is a new patch we keep going back to give it another chance and every time we keep ending up disappointed to find that nothing much has changed. Crafting isn't fun, building isn't fun, and surviving definitely isn't fun. Even The Forest is far ahead of this game, and The Long Dark (flaws, limitations and all) is even further ahead. 7 Days to Die is basically 50 times better than this game, and because 7DTD exists there is no reason for Savage Lands to.Deleted, probably for good. It would take 10 years of development at the current snail pace to make me give this borefest another look.			"

								After running around for about 20 mins, I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. For example, the campfire requires stone, flint, and logs. I can't find flint and you would think that stones would be all over the ground, but they're not. The graphics are amazing and I run my video settings on medium. I found a dragon pretty early on and it didn't try to kill me, so that's good.  I have a problem with the mouse sensitivity settings because I don't see a place to change it from the overly sensitive fast zooming mouse settings thats built into the game. There's not much for customization right now but I assume that will come with updates. I like this game a lot more than ARK. It's still early access and this game is getting better with every update. I recommend this game to anyone who likes survival/strategy game types.			"

								Still a little rough around the edges, but this medieval sandbox survival is still fairly enjoyable.  The graphics are my favorite part of the game, though I do appreciate the easy-to-use in-game crafting/recipe menu (I hate having to alt-tab to consult a Wiki as it breaks the immersion).  Besides fending off skeletons and wolves, you'll also need to deal with hunger and warmth.  The map/island doesn't appear to be randomly generated, nor do the items that spawn in the environment.  I have no idea if the developers plan to add this as a feature or not, but I'll be interested to see of they do.  While this game is fairly enjoyable, you may want to wait a few months until they add some more content.

								I think it's a given that Early Access games aren't worth the time or money. Having said that, if you've played a survival game recently then you know exactly what you're in for and Savage Lands doesn't really do anything new. I wish there wasn't just a yes or no recommendation for this game because your tolerance for this kind of genre will make or break whether or not you enjoy the game overall.It's basically the same thing we've seen a hundred times, you chop down trees, collect wood, stone, food, etc and try to survive as long as possible. Crafting requires a lot of resources and they're not all that easy to come by.The setting feels like something out of the Elder Scrolls series but the combat is extremely simplistic. I killed wolves and skeletons and saw a Dragon in the distance but froze to death before I could reach it.If you're looking for another game to spend a few dozen hours getting lost in, then there are worse games out there.Full video review:

								Where's a neutral rating when you need it?I'm probably jumping off the bandwagon way too early, but for now I'll say while this game plays smoothly, it needs a lot more refinement to get really good. Might just be me but I struggle with the inventory being so small. Would probably be more fun with my friends if they ever get onto this game. Also, kinda cruel of me but the graphics look like a very low quality run of Ark... And I have mine turned up to extra high. Recommended but wait for further updates.			"

								I bought this game in a humblebundle and can't recommend the game as it is now. Me and my buddy both had enough of it in 3 hours. Here's my impression:THE BAD-Lots of bugs-Derping enemies, sometimes they disappear inside a mountain or teleport around (not because of lag).-Animals get sucked into the earth so you got nothing to hunt or eat. I only saw animals once out of 5 times when I restarted the server and pretty soon they had all disappeared under the ground again.-You won't die of hunger but it sure can bore you to death. You can't run or jump if your hunger meter is at the bottom. Exploring like this is slow, boring and impossible at many places.-There was no option for setting up a private or password protected server. You also can't see players ping. You connect peer 2 peer so if the host leaves, everyone leaves.THE REST-Poor man's Skyrim: Similar landscapes, dragons and stuff.. (Actually not for poor men as this game might be more expensive than Skyrim during sales)-Crafting system seems good.-At least on non-pvp server your loot and the stuff you drop while dying is protected so others can't rob you.-Survivor models dont have much customization yet, also no female model.-Exploring would be fun if the game wasnt so buggy.-Doesn't hold hands too much, lets you learn the survival.-Weapon type matters. Bludgeoning weapons deal more damage to skeletons and so on.-Dual wield!-Nice details like snow storms and swimming making you freeze faster.			"

								Went into the game with my cousin, communicating through Skype. I'm looking around, picking up stones and ferns. Then I realise that there is no map. No compass on the UI. No problem. But how do I get to my co-exiled? ""Look at the sun, where is in relation to you and the coast?"" We're comparing, come to realise that I am actually on the other end of the isle. I get to treking through the forest, freezing and starving, I chomp on some cured meat. After a while I see his camp fire in the distance. ""Finally!"" Then I hear a growl behind me. I turn to look and there be a bear thing with horns. It charges me, I rush to the camp fire, but it was too late. The creature trampled me and I was dead.Can't wait to see this game develop in the future. It's going to be a lot of fun!			"

								the same as every other survival game, graphics are unimpressive. crafting is okay. however it isn't randomly generated and only provides a very small amount of gameplay at the moment. Bleeding is very annoying. however it IS early access and isn't full of content quite yet. Also had quite a few problems with crashes and freezes... check it out when it actually releases, i feel like it will be a more complete game and wont be such a hassle to play due to freezes/crashes.

								The state this game is in makes it hard to recommand. With the new beta build your last beta save may not load, as was my case after 50hr of lost playing time.  And these new builds occur every 10 days or sooner.The game itself is fun to play and well worth the $10 I spent on it.  Its a typical survival game with little new or unique. I'd recommand  Grav if you like this game type.Wait this one out until they improve the poor performance issues and stop voiding your game time investment.			"

								3/7Before I continue on with my review, let me state for everyone... As if it wasn't already obvious enough.This is an early access game, do not expect a full polished product. The game is prone to bugs and imbalances, if these bugs or imbalances in the game irritate you so much that you don't want to play, don't buy early access games.The survival genre has been beaten to death and the only reason I purchased this game to start was because..1. Dragons.2. Dragons.3. 40% off.The main survival part of the game is coldness. You are on a snowing island and are trying to keep warm while fending off wolves, boars, skellingtons and other creatures. Most games generally just have you worry about hunger and thirst, which can get very repetitive after awhile. The third mechanic implemented into this game is enough to make you think about what you're going to do for the night. Unlike the majority of survival games, you NEED resources to survive the night. It is not optional, you will not make it through the night without food and heat.Things not only fight back in this game, but seek you out if you are near. Wolves are the most dangerous threat of the island as they are quick and can inflict bleeding. The combat is okay, but can be improved upon. The hit detection in the game needs to be polished a little bit, but it's still fairly smooth.Risk vs. Reward in exploring. In Savage Lands the monsters, weather, limited bag space, and other factors make it so other players are less likely to kill you on sight. *cough, Rust, cough* The more people on your side, the faster you can stockpile resources and the more you can explore. This game just hit early access and already managed to do what every other survival game has failed to do, give incentive to work together.The UI, although basic, is informative and easy to use. When you first drop in, you can figure out what you need to do pretty quickly. It may take you a few tries before you get decent at surviving the first couple nights, especially with some current little bugs, WHICH I might add... The Devs have already stated would be fixed in the next patch a few days from now.Overall, it's a very good game. If you like survival games and fantasy, I would highly recommend it. Very fun to play and if development is steady, I could definitely see this being a best seller on Steam.			"

								I am scared of the night, in games like this especially. Wolves,boars,dragons and so on. Watched a youtuber trying out the game, gets motivated to buy it. Buys the game. Plays the game for 2 hours in Multiplayer. Raging because I died of cold. [All because I needed one more stone.] 15 minutes into finding my friend in the cold night. Its morning, builds a house. Lives in house. A strong man chases after me and my friend. We ran and hide in the forest. Staring at the man from behind a tree. He chases me. A wolf saves me by distracting the man. Escapes. Makes armour for friend and me, hunts the man down. Kills the man. Loots the man. Prosper in the game. Run out of wood. Its night time. Sees a boar. Hides in house cause I am ""Shadow fearful"". I hide in the house till my friend comes in. He asks for food. We go hunting for food. Remembers about the boar. Refuses to go out. My friend goes out. I check my inventory, alot of items in the vinicity. Looks like my friend's items. Screams in horror. Opens door.What happens? That is for you to find out.This game looks very promising. Although it is in early stages, I already find it better than alot of games. Although the combat does need improvement [Bows bows bows bows] but the game is VERY REALISTIC [Opinion Alert]. However, it is very rage inducing as very few items are given to you at the start. The world is so big that finding your friend takes HOURS. [Is this a compliment to saying the map is huge?]. I try to imagine the future multiplayer. Sleath take-downs on players/creatures. Walls for defending, playing rent for living in people's houses :3. Archer towers where I hire people to be archers on night shift with their bows, placable torches. BOATS AND NEW ISLANDS [HOHOHO MAYBE NOT THIS MAP IS TOO HUGE FOR ME AT THE MOMENT XD] *Note:This is what I think ONLY.*Overall,This game, Is definitely a game you will want to buy			"

								With almost 300 hours in game, I can honestly say that this game is a total waste of time. The only thing you do in this game is kill for food, and mine rocks. There seems to be an objective near the end to kill a dragon? This dragon can not be beat, he shoots fire so fast you just stand there and die. I am very dissapointed with the complete game play. There are so many bad things to list I will try to cover them all, There is very bad glitch in game play, the animals just run if you are the game host, walls that were added animals run right through, you get hungry way to quick, not enough food to sustain hunger, so 70 percent of time playing is hunting, crap loads of oar and only selective weapons not to mention gold and silver does almost the same damage, enemies do way to much damage versuse charactor, armor sucks, shields are are a complete waste, the life bar being mixed with health, and cold sucks, the weapons suck, animals kick boxes all over area and you constantly have to put them back in place, can't build where I want to, or need to for no reason, way to much sinew, and hide, trash bin takes to long to empty, have to build 4 to 5, 8 hours of game play with 3 people and you end up with 200 heads from your dead bodies that you can not get rid of, and many, many more. The concept of this game was killer, I would love to be able to sit and play this game without yelling at my PC. I enjoyed the fact that the Devs spend so much of their time updating the game, but please stop making it worse, and focus on the already bad.			"

								I know, I haven't played long, but there was absolutly nothing to do.I can't possibly recommend this game at all. It's been so long in early access and yet it's so empty and dull.Let's talk about it, shall we.tl;dr - The game is dull, boring and there is nothing to do. Don't bother buying it.There was a survival Check-List, to guide you a bit around.Sure, not bad. Only thing, it was really just the basic stuff. Chop tree, hunt deer, gather stone, gather log, gather flint, etc.Nothing... amazing. Combat didn't seem to interesting, like in many such games, but with less. No blocking. Using the bow felt bad... Meh. The island itself is dead. I ran around for few minutes to find nothing but emptiness. I needed to hunt animals, to get leather and other stuff, to craft me some better stuff. Took a while to find anything. But then.... Hunting a deer was just terrible. You hit it, it runs away, a bit further away it stops, you go to it and hit it, it runs away, etc. Repeat that for a while and it's dead. Yay.... Now for the next deer.... I haven't even encountered many wolves or anything. There are wild boars, which I haven't even seen. There is a dragon by the tower and flies around, but.... I saw no reason to hunt it. At night... there are Plague wolves, which are wolves, but ""scarier"" and a lot stronger. How fun. I just haven't really seen any wild-life most of the time. Which is kinda disappointing. Especially since you NEED TO HUNT THEM.You could build houses... Which was a huge disappoint them... All buildings are pre-made, so it's a copy+paste building. No custom buildings for you. You gotta use what get. Which are ugly, dull and... Once built, it has no floor! It might even float above the ground a bit! Houses are supposed to protect you from the cold... Just build a camp fire and you are good. Much cheaper to make too. There aren't many buildings to begin with, nor are there really many decoration items. But hey, atleast you can have that wooden cage you always wanted!.... It's just decoration btw.It's a survival game, so that means you need food to survival. But wait! There is more! You can freeze to death! Oh oh! How interesting! In your inventory you can see how much Health you have, how hungry you are and how cold you are. However... Cold and Hunger shown wrong. ""Cold 100%"" meant you aren't cold at all in-game. Normally... that means you are 100% frozen, atleast for me it would be. I don't know. Maybe it's just me, but it surely didn't seem right.Movement is all good and fine. Just wish I would actually maybe have a bar for my stamina. Oh and... you can't crouch.I don't know, this game is just crap and isn't anything special. No reason to build anything. Hunting animals was annoying. Nothing special about this game, really.Oh well. Can only hope this game will get better in the future. But for now, it's total crap. Avoid it.			"

								Great first impression. I can play offline, public online or private with a friend which is a bonus. The game runs smooth as butter and did not lag, stutter. Game looks great and even runs on my friends older PC at high settings. He has a GTS 450 and a CPU from 2010. So if you have an older PC fear not, you can run this game. UPDATE: The hunger system is something that appearantly used to be awful according to some reviewers, let me tell you now that it is great and has been well balanced now. I've only played 1.3 hours so far but for 8$ CND on sale or even at full price and despite there being a ton of games of the genre, this makes a must buy for me.			"

								The first lesson to learn is not to be complacent.... As others have pointed out, them wolves are hungry and they aren't bothered whether you're naked or wearing clothes made out of their cousin.  My first game was ten days, I didn't freeze,  starve or drown > I was all powerful. Then I went out at night hunting deer, got ambushed by a pack of wolves, couldn't see where I was, or what I was wildly swinging my sword at.  Then I was a late night snack.This game, for EA, is truly excellent. There are very few bugs (that I've discovered) and certainly none that spoil the atmosphere. Some of the graphics are a little wonky at times but I wholeheartedly recommend this and cannot wait to see where it ends up.I'd like an in-game clock/day counter (maybe a craftable sun dial?). I'd like the rocks to disintegrate after you've emptied them of ore. I'd like some of the item stacking to be a little higher as it's very easy to fill multiple 30-item pine boxes within a few in-game days. And I think the deterioration of equipment is a little too unforgiving.Tweaks, minor amends, tiddly stuff. Again, it's great and the developers deserve a slap on the back/round of applause for putting something out in early Alpha that is most definitely playable and good fun,Enough chit-chat, I've got a dragon to hunt...

Early Access Review
								NOTE: My experience, I believe, sounds very different from other players. I'll summarize it below.This is a very good game, made by great devs who communicate with their players. It runs well on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, which is always a plus, and fits the fantasy niche for the survival genre nicely.The game might seem unforgiving, and I've heard it is, but based upon my own experiences I can't really fully back that or add it to my complaints. The game world is dangerous, but it's most certainly forgiving, once you have a spawn point.Before I go into detail about my experience/what I think everyone should do, I suppose some pros/cons:Pros:+Excellent... atmosphere? From snowstorms to dense fog, this really affects gameplay and the experience of it all and I really like it as a feature.+Fantasy theme, with powerful enemies that provide a challenge. And as of recent updates, a powerful dragon that also adds to the experience, more notably the experience of running for your life from a dragon.+Well optimized? Well, I think it runs well on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop and that's something.+Consistent aesthetic really makes for a believeable/cool universeCons:-Lack of dedicated servers, though the devs have stated that this will change. Also, maximum size of servers is 8.-Building options currently lack much customizability, though in return it offers a consistent aesthetic. This also is considering the building on hills and such problems.I would have added ""navigation (as in even with a compass) to the cons, but the devs say that with the next update friendly servers will have names visible across a large distance. Navigation usually adds to the experience (of a dangerous/mysterious environment) but its real drawback is in multiplayer when you lose sight of your friends quickly.There are currently a decent amount of enemies, weapons, and armor, but not enough to add to pros or cons... but the devs are consistently adding such things, and seeing some upcoming content in their stream I'm optimistic this will eventually be a strong point of the game as well.Anyways, about my experience, I suppose I'd reccomend to anyone playing to IMMEDIATELY make a spawnpoint (that skull-looking thing). Use it preferably in Argos, that's what I did. Believe it or not I'd reccomend starting in singleplayer.For the first few days/nights, you can make a fire and apart from that spend your days searching for wood and mining, and hunting deer/etc. At night, more enemies will spawn, and you want to kill them. Even if you have to use your stone axe, kill them. You might die once or twice to a Fury but once you kill them (and reclaim your stuff) you'll have a sword, which will deal a decent amount of damage, and you might have some armor.Similarly, fight plague wolves. I can't stress this enough. Anyways, whatever Human Bones, Plague Wolf furs, Rotting flesh, and sinew/leather hides you can get, keep it. The flesh-wrapped bag is something I don't know how I lived without before I had it anymore. It's easily craftable early on, and it's the best bag for maximizing storage space.Just in general fight anything you can. There's no farming in this game, so you can expect to be dependent on hunting, though it's not a problem. Wolves will chase you down if they see you, and are not too uncommon around Argos; you should kill as many as you see and quickly forge yourself a set of wolfskin armor. As for deer, the second that you've either made or acquired a sword/club, stop using a bow to hunt them. Bows are complete crap for hunting, they only are any good for dealing with powerful enemies from afar in groups or drawing aggro from specific enemies. Instead, sneak up on deer and slash them twice quickly; if there are two, you can sneak up on the first and hit it twice, and continue sneaking on to the second... it's easy! And if there's one, feel free to start running when you're close enough, and you'll take it down before it can get away. With that in mind you can easily collect a lot of sinew and meat.If you find yourself running low on ores/stone, make a new world and collect around the beach before returning to your old one. It's as simple as that.Once you have an ebon sword and full leather armor (and preferably a compass) head further north to kill off packs of wolves and even single bears... you'll find that meat and maintaining your armor suddenly isn't a challenge.TL,DR; to start off, disregard any bag but the flesh-wrapped bag. Make a firepit at Argos and instead of hiding around at night make a spawnpoint, and fight all enemies you see (near Argos). Don't use a bow for hunting. If you can rush wolf armor/stone sword/flesh wrapped bag(s), you're good to go.			"

								Its funny how most of the negative reviews are from players who haven't even played at least 10 hours of this game. Sure its early access but there's a lot of things to do. There is no ""quest marker"" or anything of the sort. Its like playing skyrim without the HUD, which i liked. There's also no map whatsoever, but I like it that way. Why? Survival of course! and this is supposed to be some kind of medieval thing going on, why would they put on a map? The compass works great too. Only idiots will not know how to use it. No compass? Use the sun! it always rises in the north and sets in the south! It is also very fun to just get lost and explore the island. There is also no info on how you do things, so most people that just bought the game always ask that question. I also like that though, because you just got shipwrecked, so how the hell can you know what to do right off the bat? Also for those complaining that there is not a lot to craft, the recipes only unlock after you gathered the ingredients needed to make it. You'll be surprised how much stuff you can craft after you have quite the amount of materials. This is why you need at least more than a few hours of game time in order to see the true beauty of the game. NEVER TRUST THE PLAYERS WHO HAVE ONLY A FEW HOURS IN! They're noobs and should'nt go near any survival games at all! Currently there are only a few things to see. I am not going to spoil what they are, though i am pretty sure most of the kids already searched or watch youtube videos anyways. I mean why play a survival game and expect it to be easy? If you play this game to ""beat"" it, then go somewhere else. The beauty of this game, for me, is the survival aspect and just the sheer randomness of being able to build anywhere, There are some bugs and glitches though, so i hope they will fix that. The most annoying one for me is the chat bug. If you play for a long time, the chat just dies on you and the only way to fix is is to relog. Also limited to 8 players per room, but there are people who host a server and go AFK, basically being some kind of a ""dedicated server"" themselves. Anyways i recommend this game to mature players who like survival games. Kids stay away please. If you want an easy game go play rust or h1z1 since they have guns and play your ""COD open world"" there.			"

								Among a world of Early Access survival games, this one actually clicks very nicely for me.   If I had to give one reason this game worked for me over all the other survival games on Steam, it would have to be the setting.  This isn't some modern zombie apocalypse or post-WW3 situation but high fantasy.  Swords!  Skeletons!  A dragon!  Plate mail!  That's my thing and I like the way this game implements elements of high fantasy in to a survival game.It's not all peaches and cream though.  The game runs fairly poorly on my PC.  Granted, it is a fairly old PC but it still runs a lot of new games decently.  With Savage Lands, I've had to turn most of the settings down and there are still FPS spikes.  In terms of gameplay, the worst part is, without a doubt, inventory management.  You start off with a small inventory and it isn't until you start being able to craft bags that things get better.  Moving things between chests and your inventory is also a huge pain.  The cause of both of these is that items stacks are criminally small.  Inventory management would be less of a hassle with larger item stacks.The game is in Early Access so there's not much end game or story content and there still a number of bugs and performance issues but all-in-all, I like it.  I'm eagerly awaiting the next update and that's not something I say very often about Early Access games.  If high fantasy and survival games are something you like, I'd recommend this to you.			"

Early Access Review
								Well i usually dont post comments on games, but this one in particular has got my attention. Usually before i purchase any survival/early access game i read the negative posts first, dont know why, but u gotta see on what you are spending your $$. Savage lands is a pretty cool game for playing both single and coop modes, still has a lot o bugs and the game is a bit poor atm, not too much buildings to create, and if you like creating your weapons, well SL has some cool pre-historic/medieval gear for you to have fun.I do recommend this game if you like a mix of skyrim/rust in one package and dont care on the ragdoll mechanics, for now characters are still a bit rough, like when you are chopping down a tree with you stone axe or any other one if you focus on your shadow, you will see only the arm wich is moving and all other stuff of your body are still.in general, if the game enters on sale again i do recommend it for casual play and some fun with one friend or two.

								The games fun, and the devolper is a very good devolper. The game itself plays out like 7 days to die / rust had a love child with skyrim. That being said, it's very unique and play's like 50% of a survival game and 50% of a adventure / action rpg. It's combat is pretty standard and generic so far, but it doesn't detract to heavily from the game, Most of the game your stock piling supplies, but unlike other survival games, you get noticeably stronger the more you forge and find and build. The relativily huge amount of items is fun and the ability to build prebuilt structures turns out to pretty fun, as it allows for less fort building, and more adventuring and explorering. Unlike other survival games, Savage Lands expects more out of you. Your not just suppose to survive, your suppose to thrive and become dominate as a wondererI am very impressed buy the devolper. He's been updating quite frenquently, is quite transparent and seems very in touch, if not close to the community. He not only pays attention to the bug reports, the bugs are actually fixed within the next update. I've bought a lot of crap on steam. This is the reason i buy crap, because every so often you find a diamond in the rough. This diamond may still be a bit rough but it's getting polished quick and looking very promising. buy with confidence			"

								I can absolutely recommend this game. 10/10Me and a friend started a wekk ago and we cant stop playing trying to figure the island out. The UI is friendly, everything just seems the way it should be for a survival game like this. IT IS EARLY ACCESS. That being said you should expect a few bugs. If you arent ready to deal with a game that is still being produced i wouldnt do an early access game. But as far as survivval game and early access games go, this beats all.			"

Early Access Review
								I really... Really. Like this game. I don't understand why people are complaining about the harshness of the survival aspect of the game. It's like they want a video game like farmville or Animal Crossing or something where they have to grow plants and raise moo cows and chickens or something. I understand it's frustrating when you die but that's hardly a reason to leave a negative review just because you SUCK at video games. When you're naked and in the cold you'll freeze to death. If you don't eat you'll starve to death. If you go too far into the forest and get attacked by a wolfpack they are going to pick the flesh right off of your bones if you haven't crafted armor and a nice sword by then.It's all there. Find materials in the wilderness and don't go too far inland or else the undead will shove a sword through your torso. Until you gather ore from mining and craft some weapons and maybe build a blacksmith so that you have a forge to craft much needed armor. Of course you need a campfire for warmth. Hunt deer, boar and a wolf or two for meat and cook it. Then eat it. Survival 101Ok, so the reason why I like this game so much is the atmosphere is amazing. Especially when you open up a server and allow a couple of people to play with you. I started one night and a group of us decided to venture off to the North East (or whatever direction it was as the sun is kind of screwed up in this game. Meaning it doesn't rise in the east and set in the west.) Craft a compass when you get access to a forge as they really help. We spent hours roaming the coast and through the woods. We came across a neat landmark. A giant dragon statue on the beach just in the water. It was super cool but unfortunately at this point in early access I don't think it does anything or has any meaning besides maybe the lore. Anyway we built a campfire after getting that far as we were starting to freeze and we waited until we were warmed up. Cooked some wolf meat from the wolves we had to kill on our way here and ate it. Then we decided to continue our track through the woods. I knew the player I was playing with was trying to find a village but I wasn't even sure what he was looking for but I kind of knew he was lost roaming the forest but it was a BLAST. Next thing I knew I looked out the window and the sun was coming up and I realized I had been playing this game roaming the coast and forest for over 6 HOURS STRAIGHT. Oh, man. So much fun.VERDICT:Exploring is a blast as well as the realistic-ish survival aspects. I think they're going to put icons where all the players are so you don't have to worry about losing each other so much but I think this is a bad idea personally because I'm all about the realism, and immersion when getting lost in the wilderness. The game needs more content. It needs ruins to explore. Dungeons to find. Treasure to find. Giant monsters to find and kill for rare materials. Where are the underground caverns? The hidden castle deep in the woods? Where's the story? There is NO story. And there are no intense enemies that can still kill you with one or two blows if you venture too far where you're not supposed to after you craft some decent gear. And the reason I'm bringing all of this up because this game has sooo much potential. We need more armor to craft. Higher levels to attain. Stronger weapons to forge or find to kill even stronger enemies in the world.I trust that it will come in due time. I hope. The game is fun as it is but when I play something like this I always hope for more. That is why they call them early access I would assume.			"

								The good: Sandbox worldIntuitive controlsThe art assets are not borrowed from UnityRegular updates. Land is very feudal fantasyCo-Op that is missing from key fantasy AAA titlesThe Bad. The Island is small (for now at least)Fantasy elements are not really there (no magic other than walking skeletons and the dragon flying around, nothing) Limited amount of things to do with some crafting items that are very prevalent. Houses have no floors. The ground cannot be leveled off to help build better flooring Landscape can be repetitive quickly. False sense of difficulty in the beginning (die because of cold but once learned the game drops off in difficulty dramatically)Recommended for the price tag that I bought it on sale for currently. I would not recommend this game at its full price, Nor do I recommend it be played more than novelly until the developers get key systems in the game that enrich the experience.			"

								I am looking forward to all the future patches that they plan on releasing. It is a really fun game if you like or don't mind doing tedious tasks like mining for various rocks, hunting for food, keeping track of meters for cold/hunger etc. It is a game that requires you to be fully aware of your surroundings or you could get ambushed by an enemy. Overall a fun experience in my personal opinion.Within the first two hours of playing I was able to make a stone house, a blacksmith and craft a sword as well as some better clothing. It doesn't take too long at all to make some huge progress in the game. I mean I am also playing in single player mode so I don't have to share anything I find but I hope to try multiplayer out soon. I also tried to climb up and see the dragon's ""nest"" but you can't go up that high, sadly. Maybe with some better armor I can come face to face with the dragon!			"

								Early Access ReviewThis game has great potential and an active Dev. Very encouraging considering the amount of EA that seems to have potential never realized. This so far has been the opposite. Active updates, Livestreams, takes feedback from players into consideration, fixes reported errors, and all around appears to care for the product and it's growth. It still has some balancing issues and needs to be tinkered with, but it definitely is playable and challenging for a player now. Visually I think it's pretty polished for its current state of development and I take that as a good sign. Combat can be a bit wonky and seems to be lacking a bit but it's still very early. The game as a whole is fun, immersive, and has a very helpful community as I've seen thus far.I recommend it, especially when they release a huge update they usually cut the price in half for a week. I got mine for 8 bucks and I'd say just with the time i've played now and the content I've experienced I've gotten my worth and more.			"

								At first this game might seem like any other survival game, and it is. BUT. A BIG BUT. It has fantasy elements. You might not think this changes much.... it does though. Having a dragon flying overhead makes it way more tense than any other survival game when your out gathering. Unlike every other game nights will♥♥♥♥♥YOU UP!!! Nights are dark and you can ambushed by wolves and skeletons hiding in the darkness, Go out unprepared and you will die.Theres tonnes of weapons and armour sets for you to find and craft aswell as quite intriguing lore that is slowly being set up as the game gets updated.The easiest game to compare it to is Skyrim. It Skyrim with a new map and new gameplay. I got it on sale and I recommend you do if you want a survival game that isnt zombies and guns. (Not sure if its worth the full price at the moment because 1. I havent played all of it yet and 2. Its early access)			"

								I wouldn't call it the worst game, but it's not the best game. At this time it's still alpha developement as f***, but if you got some good friends to play it with, you can actually have fun in this game. The game is like a b*stard child of Skyrim and Minecraft. Now it doesn't have the graphics of Skyrim...or the graphics of Mincecraft, but it's got grit, and guts...Wolf guts mostly. An unflagging amount wolf guts. If you love wolves, do not buy this because you will have to kill a lot of these little canine a**holes to survive. JEeeeeEEEeeesus, Ricky, there are so many damn wolves--I've seen packs spawn right in front of me - SERIOUSLY?! I know this is early access, but daym. The creature/enemy spawn alone in this game is like hitting zoobats in caves. Also this game needs a trash/destruction/dropped item decay rate thing badly because my friends and I are up to our heads in wolf pelts, bones, skeleton parts, and other random bits of useless sh*t. And it's makes the game bug the hell out. I love the pine trees that always start cartwheeling into outer orbit(I guess their people need them)All that said with the other items and patches this game needs, this is fun for me, and it's gotten me into the survival genre. It's great fun to play with friends since we all can't uaually agree on one game most of the time. Apart from the flaws, I think this game has great, untapped potential if the developers have the drive and commitment to actually comeplete this game... If so it's Goku, if not it's Krillin. BARRY!

								I am a huge fan of survivor type games. I have to say that I now have two favorite ones. Savage Lands offers what no other fantasy medieval type game does, a chance to pit yourself against the environment and the creatures. This is an early access game so be warned that yes you might find bugs, but so far it is one of the best early access games I have played thus far. The Dev team is very responsive to their players in either offering replies to questions that relate to game and its furture or by directing the player to where they might find the answer. The weekly twitches have been awesome in keeping the players up to date on the over all development of the game itself. Anyone who loves survival games, must try this one!			"

								Updated review based on build #39Just had a chance to test the new unity 5 build, and I'm very impressed with the direction the game is going.  From the original unity 4 which was just one single island with limited resources to an all out adventure across multiple islands with plenty if not unlimited resources.  For those on Linux the graphics are now working properly.The new design pits you up against some amazing new boss fights to unlock the new content as you progress into the now 3rd - Main island. each island containing nearly the same amount of content as the original one island.  with a journal log that gets updated each time you discover a new bit of lore about the area.  There are number of new creatures and areas, also the soon to be dungeons.Beware! --- this game has a very high learning curve for those that want an easy adventure.  If you liked Dark Souls then you will most likely enjoy this game.  Except instead of it being a rolling simulator you only need to be good at strafing and dodging.  there's currently a limited tutorial...It starts off very unforgiving, but with enough enginuity and persistance you will be wipping the ground with the mobs in no time.

								One fantastic ride!!Just what a survival game should be. struggling was never so much fun!Well done guys, it maybe early access but the game has been worth more than the asking price.Died lots of times in the early stages but the game slowly lures you into making you think, if you don't you will perish.As you learn new crafting skills, things open up and you will enjoy working and progressing to improve your shoddy existence.This game rocks folks, don't let it slip by, it would be insane to miss out. I cant praise the developers enough, its obvious you really have thought things through, something early access seems short of on steam.Love the way day becomes night and becomes spooky and more dangerous, really impressive!I thought the difficulty level was going to be to much initially but no, its about spot on.Finding your way around can seem daunting at first but it adds to the game, no map to show you where to go! You can feel your very  life deteriorate, your blood thickens in the freezing, biting air but your lost and your out of food........damn i hear a wolf cry........i see yellow eyes in the darkness......oh damn! Run...Run for the cabin!!This game deserves to do well, wish you all the very  best with it guys, thank You.			"

								Savage Lands is enjoyable, and the concept and structure is great. It currently feels a bit lacking in content.The island is very small, and very 'samey'. Crafting is pretty fun and rewarding, which is very enjoyable.A small gripe I have (which isn't really an issue after playing) is that you can't look directly up nor down, which can get annoying when first trying to get items on the ground.It's a very pretty game, though as said before it all seems a bit samey, being all a snowey forest with rising hill in the center of the island.I'd recommend it because the potential is huge.

								Nearly 20 hours in and I'm still having fun exploring this island.  Brings back a lot of memories of  the first King's Field game on the playstation, including circle strafing during combat being OP right now.Being early access, there's still plenty of balance issues.  Once you craft a decent weapon and can take deer down in one hit, you'll never run out of food or supplies.  Most of the enemies pose little threat to you after you've armored up.  I even aggro'd the dragon and several passes of his flame only damaged my armor (and refilled my heat meter, which made me lol in a good way).  The only enemy that has been able to deal me direct damage are the bears, but you can still dodge most of their attacks, so unless you aggro more than one at a time it still isn't much of a threat.  Hopefully the enemy encounters become a lot more dangerous as development continues.That probably sounds like a negative review, but it isn't.  There's a lot to love about this game already.  The atmosphere is really great, especially at night.  I jumped in my seat when a plague wolf popped out of the brush next to me when I was exploring at night.  My absolute favorite thing so far: I got completely turned around and was lost in the game for over an hour yesterday, even with over 15 hours already behind me.  There's no map, and hopefully there never will be because trying to navigate only by landmarks and rudimentary compass in the dark during a blizzard while you try to avoid the pack of wolves you can hear but not see is one of the most suprisingly fun things I've done in a game in a long time.  If that last sentence sounds like your kind of game, go ahead and buy it.  If it doesn't, you should probably pass for now.There's a long way to go until this is a complete game, but I've already gotten my money's worth out of it.  The devs are very active and host streams weekly and take a lot of feedback from the players, so I'm confident it will continue to improve on an already enjoyable experience.			"

								It's a great game, textures and lighting are sort of lackluster but overall it's really fun to play. It doesn't feel very grindy and it seems very well balanced right now.The game has a lot of untapped potential as well, buy it and play it with friends and you will have a great timeEDIT:By lackluster, I mean everything isn't modded to perfection. Morrowind Overhaul and Oblivion Reloaded has spoiled me.			"

								The survival genre game market has recently been flooded with plenty of early access options, but none quite like this barbaric one. I believe it's a great game in the making, it can start off a little slow but once you understand the gameplay and mechanics it becomes fun. For an early access game it runs really solid and the delivery of constant game updates is refreshing (there's even a countdown to the next game update in the start screen - nice). The sound effects through my stereo headphones sound great and are as I would imagine them to be.I would like to see more content within the game, some examples:- Skills/level up system (status ranking).- Clans/tribe setup.- More random in game events and encounters.- Optional quests for rewards or status.- Better fighting animations.I can't wait for the next and future updates and look forward to the development of this product.

								I particularly like playing survival games. This one has a long way to go however the content that is available is very nice. I think difficulty is just right when you first start. However late game when you have best gear, things need to be a bit more difficult. The Tree Giants are really the only things that have heavy enough damage that makes a battle hard. Thats only if you don't baracade yourself in with weapon racks and shoot arrows. Mobs should beable to destroy your stuff. especially props. Walls will be a nice addition but even walls should be breakable for mobs. just make it take a while. I will be playing this game again down the road when more updates come out. I have put quite a few hours into the game. Waiting for more crafting, mobs, buildings or constructions. Even more props. Keep up the good work Devs.			"

								SAVAGE LANDSDay 1 - Day one starts , its sunny you spawn on the shorline of a beach . You have no clue what to do . A fire , or some food , explains life , and death . A house for wormth and comfort it might save you for a while . Your health suddonly starts droping . When you realize the yellow bar is at Zero . If you were smart you would have picked up some supplies . Either crafted a stone axe , or found one . The bushes start rattling . "" Oh no !"" Wondering if it might be a wolf , or mabey a dire wolf pack ! But it appears to be a treasure , a harmless deer . You slowly sneak to the deer 4 shoting it to death with your sorry little axe . Only thinking your unstopable , a plague wolf appears out from no where and rips you apart . Thats when finaly - Day 2 -  You kind of have the hang so you run to your body look around and you find argo . You craft some stuff . Later about a week in real life . You have savage wolf armor for hunting or ebon steel armor for pvp . PS : I love to pvp . So you go to the Northern East tower to kill bears to get their pelts , wich makes ebon steel armor . So i would highly recomend this I don't realy see any problems exept one . Some servers I almost die on from lag . I love this  game . I hope you use your money wisely and spend it on this .			"

								Great game, especially for a single dev. It's sort of a mix of The Forest and Skyrim. You have to manage the cold, hunt and gather, craft weapons and armor, and just survive. Cut trees, mine, and build structures. The map is a lot larger than it seems. My only knock is that past 10 hours I feel like there isn't enough to do yet. I'm sure once it's fully fleshed out, there will be a lot more. There are also regular updates with countdowns until the next one. Nice job so far.			"

								This is a very solid early access release. It's basic mechanics both exist and work. There is not that much game play to be had as yet; for example, it's list of features are well behind that for Neo Scavanger, 7 Days to Die or Project Zomboid. Thus, if you buy it  at this stage  (14.03.15) expecting hours and hours of hassle free gaming you are going to be disapppointed. However, if you are excited about a survival game in a fantasy setting, like the idea of seeing a game develop week by week and you are patient enough to let that process take place then this is a game you should consider buying.Thus far the developers of the game seem engaged with the community and an update has already been released. I will update my review in about a month to let you all know if this still holds true.5th April: An encouraging number of updates thus far. I am still gorging myself of 7 Days to die but, thus far, I am happy to have bought in early and watch how this game develops.			"

								Since I've now played a 50+ hours I feel I can write a review, without being a total noob. And... it is a Great game with plenty of challenge, once you figured out the basics (what does the ores look like in this game and how to I mine them quick), what's dangerous and what's not (the cold, hunger, spears, cats...), where do I go (portal, no portal, no map). Time flies in this game though, be sure to take some time off before you start. Second, read the guides, it's a bit hard to know nothing when the cold and hunger drains you while you try to find what key to open inventory. It is a game in progress so make sure you hang out in the discussions. Great graphics, great UI, great crafting, great creatures, accually I love the cold part. Sorry bear can't fight you right now I have to go warm up, eat, and fix my hammer.			"

								the BETA version of the game is better then the accual game. the BETA game has nice bright graphic easy item composing menu's, weapons are easier the find and its easier to suvive for a couple of days. and the maps a lot bigger then the accual game. the monster are more spead out making it easier to avoid them or escape. the game runs pritty smooth altho their isnt much to do in the game. the town is also in a lot better condition in BETA and is a lot more usable with rooms with doors on so you can spend the night with out risk of being attacked or getting cold, in the accual game town a complete reck and no use what so ever then accual game in my opinion isnt as good as the BETa versionthe game clitch's on my system its gets dark a lot quickier its harder to see ware your going the monsters are a lot closer together meaning surviving 1 day can sometime be a challange the iteam are harder to get altho their is more iteams to craft. the system isnt as clear on what iteams you need to create them or how to get them. and the process of placing building on the land scape isnt as good as the BETA, the map is tiny and can be memoried with in an hour. again their isnt much to do again in this version.this game has the Potential  to be great but need a lot more work.i wish they would go back to the way things are in the Beta version (Legacy Branch) as that version has a better feel of quality.the game really needs some kind of mission system adding to it as their is littary nothing to do in the game execpt collect iteams and compose them witch gets borring very fastit would be nice if you could rescue NCP's (none commissioned players) and bring them back to the town so the town can expand and maybee open up a couple of shopsanother thing that could be added to the game with the town expanding is town defence iteams as the night falls their could be hords of monster that you have to fight of untill the dawn comes to keep your towns people safe			"

								overall I give it great potetental, I like the gameplay I feel a little more story would be nice but hey whatever its early access and I'll forgive the lack of narative, and the glitches I kept running into, like the ground randomly swallowing enemies, or the  random flying boar. I do fel like this game needs some things added to be ideal for me. but thats for me.1. EXP/Skill tree/ Perk System. don't care if its all three or just one, but getting bonusus based on acheavements you've gotten, or a level up system like a classic rpg or a mix of the two would be emencely helpful, something to make it feel rewarding to be alive, maybe some that stick with you through death and others that only accumulate and help out the longer you've been alive. or maybe pitty bonuses based on what has killed you the most and gives you temporary bonuses against said thing, all sound like good ideas to me.2. Mines, it would be nice to find a series of tunnels with enemys and increasing chances of finding thouse  precious materials we need for better weapons.3. Blocking without a shield, while I don't feel like its normaly a huge mechanic, I like to see the ability to parry/block with my weapon especially when weilding a two handed greatsword. they maybe not as much damage prevention as a shield, but would be nice.4. Improved Ranged Mechanics/ More ranged weapons, I feel like the bow and arrows I was able to make where not very effective, and didn't flow as easily with the rest of the game, maybe just my opinion though, I feel like a few added weapons like a long bow or horned bow would be a nice add, and haveing better arrows.5. fishing, just feels natural in a game like this feels like it should be added,and lastly number 6 my PERSONAL want but this is entirely a thing that I like to see in games, What  with dragons and portals and demons and all... MAGIC, as a player I love when magic is in the game, however I like when its handled a lot like kings field (if you haven't played it.. i'm sorry you missed out or are too young to appreciate aged graphics) but in short the way magic was handled then was crystals, think of scrolls you can find and consume once to learn the said spell, then you have a mana bar that determands the usual how often and if I can cast this spell. just somethign I like in games.now with all that said, I feel like I should address that this is in no way a negitive review, the game is gettting more and more fluid, and its still just starting out. I hope that my suggestions as well as other alpha/beta users are heard, and that they do impliment some of these things. I've been having a blast lately and seriously suggest this title to any players that enjoy the what I call ""build and survive"" genre. thank you for reading, good gaming, and good luck.			"

								I got it with a friend as part of the humble bundle and it's been really fun so far. I don't know if it's just because I'm playing it with someone - but it has just the right level of challenging. We've been having a good time building a nordic town and hunting for undead monsters to kill. I will agree that the monster collision is rough, especially on multi player (lots of mobs bliping about or through objects) but you learn to live with it since they seem to have just as hard a time hitting you. I disagree that you need a bow for hunting, I've had no trouble bringing down everything with just my axe, a bow just makes it easier to pull aggressive mobs into traps haha! In short I recommend BUT, it IS glitchy, I wish they would add in the ability to move objects once placed, or even while placing them down (rotation), and I wish the objects in player made homes functioned - being able to cook in the large hut fire place for instance, or use the chests inside for actual storage. The option to sleep in the bed to pass part of the night would also be a welcome addition.			"

								Definitely a step up from their previous title (Castle Miner Z) which started out as an XBLA Indie game being sold for a little under five dollars. While I enjoyed Castle Miner Z, I frankly find this to be a huge improvement on their part, they are working with brand new tech, the graphics actually look pretty, they've got shaders and a proper publisher now as well. This goes to show that companies like Digital DNA, if given a chance, can come out with some truly amazing things. I love this title and find it a good alternative to the constant grind of PVP games by focusing more heavily on PVE for those of us who hate being shot every 10 minutes.It has it's bugs and downfalls but those are being fixed on a constant and regular basis, showing that the devs are committed to this title and will stick with it to the bitter end, I like that. It's a good game and it's gonna get better as time goes on. If you don't feel like throwing $15 at the devs, you can absolutely wait until it's on sale, but with the amount of content in this game, and with more to come, it definitely earns its price tag.

								Not been able to put this down in 3 days, at first you think there may be very little to do, but simply surviving is quite a challenge. There is no map which is good, you would not have a map of a strange island would you? Thus far I am impressed, I would like to see more content, and perhaps in the future a way to leave the island and discover a wider world. The ability to create your own map, maybe using charcoal / coal / animal blood / pigments from vegitation etc and a little hide would make it easier to get around once you have discovered things, but if this was so I think you island would become quite small.My one reccomendation to the devs, don't make it any easier, keep it tough!

								Positively surprised with the game, it has lots of potential for future updates and such. However I am a bit disappointed with the lack of buildings you can construct and how you can place them. At times when the ground is just perfectly flat and has no objects around, you simply cannot place a building. And at times you can place random buildings on an unbalanced hill-side. I do realise it's still one early access, but that's just what caught my eye the most. I do hope the devs make a good job with the game, and have lots of new ideas for it. One thing I would like to see are constructable animal traps, walls/palisades, watch towers or lookout towers, firepits inside buildings or longer lasting torches inside houses. Also perhaps diffrently sized buildings and houses that can be placed in certain positions and making your village look alive. Sort of boring having just the stone, small and medium sized houses. And most importantly, new maps or at least randomly generated maps, since I've sort of explored the entire area by now, and it's getting a tad boring. I think this is naturally a lot to ask but, well, just something for the Devs to think about.			"

								I purchased this today on sale after reading the comments here and watching gameplay videos on YouTube. It was worth every penny! I have only played about three hours so far (dying once) and I am into the second night of the game. It is great fun and challenging. I found a house that keeps me warm and built a respawn totem and now I am starting to build up some supplies. The time disappeared while playing this.  Great details like the bushes rustling when you walk through them. Amazing game for only Early Access! I have played full version games that were not as complete and not as well done. Can't wait to see what else gets added to this game. If you like survival games this is a must purchase!			"

								It seems with the rise of Minecraft and games like skyrim, many indie level developers have strived to create an open-world, survival, build ""what you like games"". With review, please realize, if you read this, this game has promise. I'll begin with what I like.+ The small, plausible way to manage you item equipment. Yes the slots are small, however there are bags that can be crafted that will make life better.+ Rocks, as weapons... you can throws to hunt and kill deer that have ran away from you. +Relatively light game. I was able to run this game fairly smoothly.+Nice selection of swords, and ""metal"" weapons. I'd like to see more or a way to design your own.Cons-Weapons selections, there's a lack of two handed weapons. Arrows only come in puny flint form, no cool more powerful bodkin, broadhead... or mythical/magical arrows.-Yes you can build houses but there's a lack of ""block building"" where you can spend however you like to build a secure and safe house, and also make it look how you want.- The world isn't procedural. You spawn, on the same island, with the same weather. Meaning you go for the same shebang, worry about the same stuff everytime you start over.-The island map isn't particularly distinctive. You are somewhat forced to build on the beach, there are no roads or real marks that are distintive and can be seen for a long while to keep you being lost and dying in the middle of the night.-Map is really small. I've played Rust, and even played Arma... these games have large maps. This map is puny compared to those. So small that you don't see much, but large enough to be annoying when you get lost (and die from hypothermia)Over all would I recomend this game... for about $10-12 bucks... yes I would. Maybe later as this game updates and add in stuff I may reconsider... otherwise I'd save this game for when it goes on sell.			"

								Not been able to put this down in 3 days, at first you think there may be very little to do, but simply surviving is quite a challenge. There is no map which is good, you would not have a map of a strange island would you? Thus far I am impressed, I would like to see more content, and perhaps in the future a way to leave the island and discover a wider world. The ability to create your own map, maybe using charcoal / coal / animal blood / pigments from vegitation etc and a little hide would make it easier to get around once you have discovered things, but if this was so I think you island would become quite small.My one reccomendation to the devs, don't make it any easier, keep it tough!

								Positively surprised with the game, it has lots of potential for future updates and such. However I am a bit disappointed with the lack of buildings you can construct and how you can place them. At times when the ground is just perfectly flat and has no objects around, you simply cannot place a building. And at times you can place random buildings on an unbalanced hill-side. I do realise it's still one early access, but that's just what caught my eye the most. I do hope the devs make a good job with the game, and have lots of new ideas for it. One thing I would like to see are constructable animal traps, walls/palisades, watch towers or lookout towers, firepits inside buildings or longer lasting torches inside houses. Also perhaps diffrently sized buildings and houses that can be placed in certain positions and making your village look alive. Sort of boring having just the stone, small and medium sized houses. And most importantly, new maps or at least randomly generated maps, since I've sort of explored the entire area by now, and it's getting a tad boring. I think this is naturally a lot to ask but, well, just something for the Devs to think about.			"

								First of all: Potential of the Game.It has potential! But the Dev. really need to keep it going. More Building depth, more useage of the buildings. ""Debug"" the buildings. Bugs encounter so far:When you throw Wood Logs in a House that is build on a little hill, the Logs keep rolling right through the wall. Such little things are really anoying. Ballistic of the Bow is horrible! I think it should need some tuning.Falling Damage? Not at all!Not warming inside of a Building.If you Build a ""Strong Chest"" on a Friendly Server. Theres no option to set a friend of yours to be able to access the Chest. That may make sence on a hostile setting, or in a rnd gourp. But with Steam Friends, i would like to share my stuff.Little distubring Things:The Game is not challenging at all.Direct ahead of your landing position is a little abandoned town, you can pick up a longbow there and it has a forge as well.So there is no reason to build it yourself.because of the not warming inside of Buildings it is useless.Basically you just need a Campfire. It will keep you warm. Thats mandatory.Why is there a Dragon with his Tower when the dragon is not attacking? We build a House right next to his Tower, he wasnt mad at all...The wandering Monsters are not a threat.Reason why we stopped Playing after a three hours:The Maingoal is Missing. Something like: Build a Ship and escape to Home, Kill the Dragon or find more Survivors.Final Words:Get more Buildings in, get a Maingoal in there, More Monsters, More Dangers, Make a Survival Game! At the Moment its not a real Survival Game, because its to easy.			"

If you don't die horribly they'll give you some nice loot.Skeletons Bash their heads back up bash their heads again.Bears, they aren't very nice. If you run into these they'll charge you at godly speeds with weird running animations and then instakill you most likely.Other enemies include the dragon, and upgraded versions of the basic enemies.You - You're a butt naked savage. With the new customization system you can now be shrek, or some other weird looking savage.Lacks content, and professional game design. That's about all.			"

								The wolves won't starve, but you most likely will.  Actually you'll probably become a popsicle prior to being eaten.  Well at least until you get the hang of it.  I've played survival games before so I knew what to expect (to a certain extent).  It took me a while to figure out what some of the usable items are. Once you being to figure out what items are the most helpful and how to hunt this game becomes pretty easy (disclaimer). Don't get discouraged by death.  You can spawn, run to your corpse and get your loot back (if you can survive the run back).  My only complaint at this point is the lack of things to do/accomplish in this game, but I can see that there is unlimited potential.  I'm super excited to see what they drop in next!Disclaimer:  Pretty easy, just means you will be able to cloth, shelter and feed yourself.  It doesn't guarantee you'll survive, because even when you're geared you can get into adverse situations.  Enjoy...			"

								Definitely a step up from their previous title (Castle Miner Z) which started out as an XBLA Indie game being sold for a little under five dollars. While I enjoyed Castle Miner Z, I frankly find this to be a huge improvement on their part, they are working with brand new tech, the graphics actually look pretty, they've got shaders and a proper publisher now as well. This goes to show that companies like Digital DNA, if given a chance, can come out with some truly amazing things. I love this title and find it a good alternative to the constant grind of PVP games by focusing more heavily on PVE for those of us who hate being shot every 10 minutes.It has it's bugs and downfalls but those are being fixed on a constant and regular basis, showing that the devs are committed to this title and will stick with it to the bitter end, I like that. It's a good game and it's gonna get better as time goes on. If you don't feel like throwing $15 at the devs, you can absolutely wait until it's on sale, but with the amount of content in this game, and with more to come, it definitely earns its price tag.

								I have very much enjoyed this game.  While I have to say I'd love to see free-build elements as opposed to set building schematics, that's not a deal breaker.  There are things that need to be tweaked, of course... it's an alpha build.  But again, nothing that's game breaking.  The devs seem to be quite active in the discussion boards and there are plenty of people with servers up and running to give you plenty of opportunity to learn.  Overall, the community seems pretty willing to help one another, which is quite nice.  No PvP as of yet, and I hope if/when that comes there are options to either run a server with or without it.  The bones of the game are great.  Very interesting and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the developers drop in next.  I'm recommending it.			"

								First off, I don't review a game very often, but as far as I can tell this one is worth it.Secondly, this game is far more about survival and closer realism than any of the other games like it I've played.Start out on an island half naked, okay seen that, find things and then build things - it's all been done before, so what makes this one stand out? it's hardness level, okay so you've got a fire to keep warm and its night time, but you're getting hungry, if you didn't stock up on food then you better go freeze to death to find something to kill and eat, but while you're at it, realistic stupid skeletons and crazy wolves will chase you to death. You get the point, but I play this one more than most of them as with a friend trying to create a base, its really enjoyable and seeing as the game has almost weekly updates, we're sticking around.oh and to top it all off, if you did survive everything else, beware the freaking dragon as it will chase you down until it kills you; literally.Pros:+Fun to play+Minimal to No FPS or Server Lag+good amount of updates and content+enjoyable with friends+The server you host, saves locally, so you can open it up for when you and friends want to play again.+the future of the game (in my mind) will be epic (magic is being added later)+most well balanced survival game.+graphics are amazing.Cons:-Server is local, hard to play with random people across the globe unless you organise with them-dragon will chase you until you are dead-buildings have issues of snow falling through them(yes i have a roof), and for that matter, not just snow, but dragon fire (you can build a respawn point)-I hope you like winter, for not only Winter is Coming, but it is always winter.-Resources are scarce unless you travel far and wide and build mini settlements over the place.as you can see the cons are barely cons, they are things that hinder you only due to your own lack of preparation, avoid the dragon, server issue well, i dont know. the winter effect is nice and we built in one place and the rocks and trees are gone... our fault for not having more resources.One thing to be cautious of is the weapon and armor warmth to coolness factor, and on top of that it's durability, if you know you are going to die to a dragon, drop your armor, it will still be there but if you are wearing it, it will be destroyed, which is fair, you are meant to survive and it was my own fault for climbing up his tower =Dlove this game so much.

								Enjoyable alpha with loads of potential.  At the current time more of a solo/exploring game than a crafting or building one,  in fact,  i would call the crafting basic and the building a little less than bacis (not bad,  just basic).   I wouldn't pay more than 20 bucks for it at the current build.  Would like to see more 'survival',  once you gear up a bit 'survival' is pretty much a non-issue.   The winter storms are a pretty nice touch.Would also like to see alot more crafting recipes.  For me the game will need alot more crafting.  The building aspect could be expanded,  say some farming,  improvements of your buildings after built, etc etc,  but the simple approach to it is fine overall,  would just like more of it.			"

								Savage Lands is brutal, if you don't work out in time how to survive you are dead. It's a simple formula.Join a server for the first time you play at night, and you'll probably die through starvation and/or cold. That is if the inhabitants don't butcher you for all your worth before hand.I really like the games potential, it does borrow some ideas from the likes of Skyrim, but with a much steeper learning curve. There is no world map, no fast travel. Can't use a compass? You'll never find home again.I think as the updates come, this game will only get better, there are some basic elements that would make the game better in the future, and it needs to delve deeper into a story line or at least more 'objectives' so once you have completed the initial survival tasks and murdered a few of the heavier enemies/survived to a basic sustainable level there is more to do.When I started I didn't have a clue where I was going, or what I was doing. I won't spoil the fun and tell you, but you do have a ureka! moment when you finally start to survive and craft some essential items.The start of the game sees that you build/craft some essential items for survival - nearly all of them have a purpose or a function with exception to building a ""Leanto"" - it offered me no obvious cover, warmth or protection as you cannot crouch or go prone, which in turn is a waste of time and resource - which being almost naked, half freezing to death on a beach is a luxury you cannot afford. In the latter stages of the initial game you can build stone houses, and eventually a Town Hall, which in my opinion is vastly under-used at the moment as it offers no viable enhancements, except for a visual claim on a piece of land, and perhaps a gathering point for the community. It should have an upper floor which serves as a lookout, or something similar, and offer some other benefits - perhaps have a throne in it and then appoint a ruler of the territory/land.Improvements the dev's could make:I want the game to essentially turn out like a first person ""Banished crossed with Skyrim"" - it would be great to be able to build more in the village, like a mill, a farm and a baker - a market place and then if the resources were scattered around the map, for example corn only grows on certain locations on the map, this could lead to a trade system, as well as a transportation system, kind of like protect the flag, except its corn. (or a territorial war all together) and the building of market places, and larger towns (Even CASTLES!) (Imagine a castle siege by warring factions!) where everyone has a purpose and a house.The creatures could still attack as normal, and there would need to be dedicated watch men/women to alert the rest of the village. The dragon, could at any time attack said village and potentially destroy buildings which would need to be re-built.There could be basic paths and roads added, signposts would be a massive win, and potentially horses, leading to knights, and an armoury.I think that there also needs to be a cull on 'server hopping' and dropping high level items to new players - this spoils the fun.We learned that the players of Skyrim yearned for a sense of ownership, and thus the ability to build your own house was introduced. This kind of starts to fill that void, but once the building plans have been improved, the storyline expanded on and more challenges added I think we are onto a winner. Overall, I would recommend you buy this game for it's potential, but at the moment it does have limited playability based on the objectives you need to complete and the 'bosses' you need to slaughter. Once you have survived whatever perils await you and built your kit up high enough so you and some friends can murder the dragon, that's pretty much the main challenge sorted. "

Early Access Review
								overall I give it great potetental, I like the gameplay I feel a little more story would be nice but hey whatever its early access and I'll forgive the lack of narative, and the glitches I kept running into, like the ground randomly swallowing enemies, or the  random flying boar. I do fel like this game needs some things added to be ideal for me. but thats for me.1. EXP/Skill tree/ Perk System. don't care if its all three or just one, but getting bonusus based on acheavements you've gotten, or a level up system like a classic rpg or a mix of the two would be emencely helpful, something to make it feel rewarding to be alive, maybe some that stick with you through death and others that only accumulate and help out the longer you've been alive. or maybe pitty bonuses based on what has killed you the most and gives you temporary bonuses against said thing, all sound like good ideas to me.2. Mines, it would be nice to find a series of tunnels with enemys and increasing chances of finding thouse  precious materials we need for better weapons.3. Blocking without a shield, while I don't feel like its normaly a huge mechanic, I like to see the ability to parry/block with my weapon especially when weilding a two handed greatsword. they maybe not as much damage prevention as a shield, but would be nice.4. Improved Ranged Mechanics/ More ranged weapons, I feel like the bow and arrows I was able to make where not very effective, and didn't flow as easily with the rest of the game, maybe just my opinion though, I feel like a few added weapons like a long bow or horned bow would be a nice add, and haveing better arrows.5. fishing, just feels natural in a game like this feels like it should be added,and lastly number 6 my PERSONAL want but this is entirely a thing that I like to see in games, What  with dragons and portals and demons and all... MAGIC, as a player I love when magic is in the game, however I like when its handled a lot like kings field (if you haven't played it.. i'm sorry you missed out or are too young to appreciate aged graphics) but in short the way magic was handled then was crystals, think of scrolls you can find and consume once to learn the said spell, then you have a mana bar that determands the usual how often and if I can cast this spell. just somethign I like in games.now with all that said, I feel like I should address that this is in no way a negitive review, the game is gettting more and more fluid, and its still just starting out. I hope that my suggestions as well as other alpha/beta users are heard, and that they do impliment some of these things. I've been having a blast lately and seriously suggest this title to any players that enjoy the what I call ""build and survive"" genre. thank you for reading, good gaming, and good luck.			"

								Definitely a step up from their previous title (Castle Miner Z) which started out as an XBLA Indie game being sold for a little under five dollars. While I enjoyed Castle Miner Z, I frankly find this to be a huge improvement on their part, they are working with brand new tech, the graphics actually look pretty, they've got shaders and a proper publisher now as well. This goes to show that companies like Digital DNA, if given a chance, can come out with some truly amazing things. I love this title and find it a good alternative to the constant grind of PVP games by focusing more heavily on PVE for those of us who hate being shot every 10 minutes.It has it's bugs and downfalls but those are being fixed on a constant and regular basis, showing that the devs are committed to this title and will stick with it to the bitter end, I like that. It's a good game and it's gonna get better as time goes on. If you don't feel like throwing $15 at the devs, you can absolutely wait until it's on sale, but with the amount of content in this game, and with more to come, it definitely earns its price tag.

								Enjoyable alpha with loads of potential.  At the current time more of a solo/exploring game than a crafting or building one,  in fact,  i would call the crafting basic and the building a little less than bacis (not bad,  just basic).   I wouldn't pay more than 20 bucks for it at the current build.  Would like to see more 'survival',  once you gear up a bit 'survival' is pretty much a non-issue.   The winter storms are a pretty nice touch.Would also like to see alot more crafting recipes.  For me the game will need alot more crafting.  The building aspect could be expanded,  say some farming,  improvements of your buildings after built, etc etc,  but the simple approach to it is fine overall,  would just like more of it.			"

That being said, it is a pleasant experience. things you could do to improve the game is better visuals, better menu, the UI is pretty good, more content.			"

								It is a survival game that allows for you to try and fight the savage lands that surround you. Or at least that is the basic run down. The plus side is that unlike The Long Dark, you can salvage sticks and other materials from cutting down tress. Plus you can cut down trees to use for virtually everything. It even has a respawn mechanic that isn't too hard to set up, as long as you are willing to fight some skeletons to use their heads as part of the building for the respawn point. It requires a lot of flint and other things to keep you warm, but you also need to stay fed and keep your health up.Now for the negatives. One thing that I have noticed that annoys me is the jotty camera movements with the mouse and how hard it is to get flint. I wish that you could also do repairs on the buildings that you run into out in the wild. That would be a saving grace for those long trecks into the wild where you can lose sight or track of your home base. I do hope that with the update that is coming in 14 days it allows for a smoother movement of the mouse or the option to set the mouse speed. So if you are on the fence I say get it because it is better as far as gathering materials and creating the things you need from what is around you. Just make sure to gather flint and stones as this will help you out once you get going.			"

								I think this game is really fun to play with someone in real life, espicially if they get scared easy. I decided to play this with my brother and neither of us have ever heard anything about this game, so instead of reading every fact about it I decided to just jump in. That made it really fun in my opinon... I was not thinking about all the aspects other people did not like about the game rather finding aspects I did like about it. So not being much into tutorials myself I kind of just wondered off only half knowing what to do. I found some deer, but scared them off so I began to starve x.x I ended up finding some berries some how and that kept me alive long enough to figure out that you can walk towards deers and get them with a mele weapon. I began to get pretty well comfortable, and I suppose that was a mistake... I ventured out to the forest at night not thinking much of it then something attacked me... I had not idea what it was or where it came from, but I was out of there, well I would of been, but I died... Oops I started to think crap is this one of those games once you die you lose all your stuff and have to restart, but it was not and I gathered my items so that I may began my adventure again. Overall at this point I think this game is really fun to play with other people, not by yourself. This is because with other people you might be willing to do things you wouldn't do by yourself like throw rocks at stuff or try to kill a dragon etc. My pros/consPros-Online Play, Private Servers, Single Player, Monsters, Animals, Food Bar, Healing Items, Different tools, Easy to Navigate Menus, Easy to remember keys, Many ways for food, Dragons, Wolf, Boar, Overall its a nice biomeCons/What I want to see- Controller support (Unless I missed it), Spears or something like that (again unless I missed it), Caves would be cool IMO, A little more animals like rabbits and birds, Some easter eggs would be cool as well  ummmm thats all I can think of at this point sorry if I missed anything			"

								Got this game a few days ago and already it grew up to be one of my favourites.  Can't wait to see what the game will be like once it's fully done. There are already many things to explore, but would love to see something like dungeons, caves, abandoned fortresses/castles etc. The game reminds me really much of Skyrim, which is a good thing. And speaking of which I think the combat system of Skyrim would fit perfectly into Savage Lands. Being able to wield swords in both hands or a shield in the left and sword in the right or magic in the left and weapon in the right one etc. Possibilities would be endless. Also, would like to see more things to build. Building a whole village is pretty dull at the moment since there are only different sized houses + blacksmith. Something like mills, docks, library for enchanting etc.Overall, Savage lands is a solid survival game particularly for my taste as it is not stuffed with overly complicated features and too CPU-destroying graphics. Clearly the main focus has been the gameplay and not the visuals, which is the way it should be in my opinion. Love the game already and it is not even finished. Especially fun to play with friends. Stay on the lookout for this title, because I'm sure it will be huge!			"

								I feel this game would benefit greatly if the following are implimented:1. Map: Especially in a game where you can die from the cold, its nice to know where a fire is. I'm sure I eventually will be able to make one anywhere with the right materials, but there is nothing telling me how at the start.2. Tutorial: What is there now is just a to do list.  I can tell the red bar is health, but what the blue and yellow bars are? I found out online, but I feel a game should teach you the basic UI via in-game tutorial. Gone are the days of manuals, and alt-tabbing out to Google, YouTube, etc. ruins the immersion of the game.  I realize this is a survival game, so something quick and simple so we aren't taking our focus off the experience itself.I feel these features could help get players into the game quicker, and help reduce frustration by making navigation more predictable.Review edited as I felt it sounded too negative :)			"

Early Access Review
								I've tried a couple of survival games and this one, Savage Lands, is the only one that's grabbed me, by the throat, like a gigantic, ruby eyed dire wolf, and won't let go.  Since my PvP days are behind me, whenever I look at a ""survival"" game that has multi-player, the first question I want answered is, will this be a gankfest?  Will I, the lowly PvE player end up in the red square marked ""target-rich environment"".   And in the case of a game like Savage Lands, which has a solo play mode, will solo play deliver such a watered down experience from multi-player (in terms of game mechanics and replayabiliy) that it isn't worth my time.  I took a chance with SL and have been extremely pleased with the experience.   Here's why:1.  Immersion.  You are in the world and much pay attention or be dead.  2.  Simplicity.   You aren't required to turn around three times while alternately touching your nose with your pinky fingers in order to  learn the game.  It's quite simple.  Build a fire.  Or die.  Find food.  Or die.  Learn what resources the environment around you provides and rise up.  3.  Combat.  Combat in the game is straight forward.  Strike until whatever is striking you until dead.  If you have better armor and a better weapon, you win.   Bows are in the game, but fairly ineffective in combat, atm, unless you begin battle at a distance. 4.  Progression.  No, there are no skill trees, thank god.  Progression means that you go from crude axe doing minimal damage to weapons you forge with metal and sinew that do serious damage.  Progression means you wrap yourself in wolf pelt that provides real warmth and are no longer slave to your fire.  Progression is having big enough backpacks that you can safely leave your base, well provisioned for a long exploratory trek across the island. 5.  Server choice.  When you start the game, you create a character.  You can eitiher host a game, join a game or play solo.  If you host a game, you can choose whether PvP is Friendly or Hostile.  If you play solo, you will be the only one in your game and can experience the entirety of it as you choose.   6.  Variety.  You can build in the game, but you don't need to.  You'll find sufficient fire pit rings, and other built resources in the ruins to avoid all that.  Or you can embrace it and build your own town as you fend off the roaming wildlife and disturbed dead that make up the other residents of the isle.  You can take off from your spawn point with nothing more than your stone axe to explore or you can hunker down, get well established and then seek adventure.   However you define enjoyment, the game allows. Now that I've covered the esoteric bits that appeal to me, what about that other stuff, graphics and so on.  1.  Music:  Excellent, a nicely done score.2.  Ambient sound:  You're going to hear the hot breath of those wolves just before they leap on you.    3.  Sound effects:  Well done and realistic.  4.  Graphics:  Superb. 5.  Art design:  Superb.6.  Bugs:  It's Early Access, so yes.  But.  Devs are very active on the Steam forum and respond quickly to comments and messages.  7.  Devs:  Yes, as far as I can tell, they are very involved and responsive.  Lastly, the first question I asked myself:  gankfest in multi-player?  First, the other would have to find you.  Next, he would have to be better armed than you.   In other words, he'd have to start out with his stone axe, just like you.  The best he can do is kill another guy with a stone axe and--take HIS stone axe.  Now he's make progress.  He has 2 stone axes and possibly an extra apple and maybe a fire.  Great.  He goes out in search of someone else to kill, still armed with nothing but a stone axe.   Just before he freezes to death, he finds another player, with a metal axe.  He sets out to kill that player, but oops, the other player kills him because you know stone axe =/= metal axe or, much more likely, he freeezes to death before anything else.   I could go on like this, but you get the idea.If you have any interest in this type of game, it is worth your while to check it out.     "

								This game has a lot of potential, i certainly hope that the rumours of developers leaving this game aren't true.I've picked this game up about an average ~3Hours ago and have been playing it since.What i can tell is that this game has alot of promise, it shows that devs are willing to take risks, risks that haven't been taken much with Survival Games.Savage Lands, is a beautiful open-world sandbox simulation with a sizable map and loads of crafting oppertunities.However, the game is still in its early stages of development but i'm sure it'll be a great experience in the end.(So bugs can be found.)A little summary:Pro's:- Dropped items don't despawn. This makes it easier to make an inventory inside a house.- The UI is clean, the tutorial straight forward and easy to follow.- Night/Day Cycle is longer, you have enough time to farm, mine and craft.- Very good crafting system and overall much usage of items found/harvested.- Wacky Skellingtons (Yes, they are wacky.)- Developers pay attention towards it's player-base and frequently asks for feedback and on what they can improve. (HARDLY ANY GAME DOES THAT)- A huge variety in monster selection. (Ranging from skellies to wolves, even a dragon.)Cons:- The map is dull and gets boring easly, ie; Lack of content. (Devs could focus on adding more content, the map is huge. don't hold back.)- Wonky combat system.Overall it's a good game, certainly worth the money.			"

But I'll always be a fan of Skyrim, and that's where THIS GAME comes in and brings me to this whole new gaming style. Super cool. Devs doing a great job. Looking forward to spend more time in it!

This game has came a long ways, it still has room to improve but it is a lot of fun. Best part is that the game is already interesting and fun to play, yet not even finished. The updates still roll out for this game, its not dead.			"

								I don't know how to rate this. I think it's one of the best survival games out there, it has a great atmosphere, good graphics, and it's not over-compliated either. The framerate is bad but i'm sure they will fix it at some point.Now, what i really hate about this is that they added ores, which can be found around the world.  That being said, i pretty much searched the whole second island and i couldn't even make a full set of armor from the ores i found. I think there should be way more ores, it ruins the game. without the equipment you will die on every monster you envounter on island 2, which makes it even harder to find those ores. And this makes multiplayer pointless, there's not enough ore for 1 players, how could it be enough for 8? It was a lot better when i could just get ores from the rocks.			"

								Having a lot of fun in this game so far, it's pretty unforgiving when you begin, so expect to make mistakes and to freeze to death a fair bit. But once you have half-way decent armour and tools/weapons things get easier. I've been particularly enjoying the drop-in-drop-out nature of multiplayer and have met some very helpful players who've exchanged tips & spare equipment and aided in building bases and taking down giants. I feel that the dragon may have a vendetta though, he's attacked and chased me twice, totally gutting one of my camps.I would like to see the addition of some fortifications you can build around your settlements, maybe a wooden stockade/fence, maybe watchtowers.The game gets a bit laggy sometimes, but this doesn't detract too much from the fun - in fact sometimes a bit of lag works in your favour when chasing down deer...

								I've had my eye on this game for quite sometime since it's early access release in 2015. But recently it went on Humble Bundle so I figured I give it a shot. Now, I did not go into the game expecting an MMO version of Skyrim, Unreal Engine quality graphics, or anything of that nature... needless to say this game is quite fun. Not sure why people are complaining about difficulty because it's not a hard game... Positives:* Easy to pick up - I didn't have any issues picking up the basics of the game, it was simple and straight to the point (gather, hunt, craft). * Story/Lore- despite it being an open world survival sim. There are books, pages, and other things that         really add depth to the world of Savage Lands, including an origin story of the lands.* Enemy modeling- very nice models and the creatures in the world are also pretty interesting, though, nothing original, still pretty awesome designs.* Multiplayer - For you and a bunch of friends.Negatives:There are a few things I would like to point out that are a bit out of place. * First off, there is no female gender (at least not yet).- so fellow female gamers have to create a male character (which isn't game breaking but diversity would be nice).* World details and textures could use more polish. - The enemies and character armors look nice but next to the textures of the world they stand out a bit. (again, nothing major. Just minor adjustments to make it a bit more enjoyable.)* A small tweak in spawns. - I spent about 2hrs in my first playthrough exploring and aside from the dragon on the tower the only things that tend to appear every now and then are grunt skeletons, a few rabbits, and only a few deer. I did however run into an armored skeleton which was pretty tough.Overall I am really enjoying this game. I see the devs update on a regular basis so I hope there are more additions to keep this game alive and growing. I also recommend this game if you like surival or open world games.			"

								Savage Lands is a game for those who do not mind getting killed and traveling back to there death point. The weather is a dangerouse foe; However, with all this the gameplay is fantastic. There is some lag spikes when you are fighting an enemy and the Survival is difficult and places chest right now is strange, but the crafting aspect is very nice you have to create different crafting stations such as a crafting table and a hide rack to create certian items. It has also improved it's interface of health, cold, hunger, and stanima. Before it was cool looking but very difficult to understand; now it is simple looking with a green bar for stanima and yellow for hunger, with red for health and blue for the cold. The only thing that is still a down fall i see is that you have to stay awake the whole night.			"

								If you are the kind of person that buys an early access game then rage quits because of bugs, best you avoid this game and stick with big studio games. It is early access and should be treated as so. Don't expext a polished finished title.You could be forgiven for only playing this game for 20 minutes and never playing it again however. The initial impression is that it looks bad, runs bad and is broken. Some of which is true. It's hard to get past that but worth it.After persisting for a couple of hours you find a great deal underneath the surface including a deep crafting tree, an expansive and interesting map and a breadcrumbs like story line that is worth a look. I think I'm done with Savage Lands for now but with more time and optimisation, a really good game could come of this.For my short time playing here are my tips to the devs;1. The coal dependency is too high. 2. The sword fighting needs more swings and a parry. 3. The stamina runs out too quickly.4. Building from the journal is not very intuitive.All of which might be already set to be fixed/changed.			"

								Here my brutaly honest review of this game.- id say all the negative reviews are from when the game was old or haters that cant farm for an hour to get good itemsPros:I really think this game is good because theres tons of content map wise. Ive heard of the new island that came out all though know nothing about it, it took me an hour to trek all the way across the island and on the way the farther you go the harder guys you face, i found a skeleton boss tree midgets that take 50 arrows to kill and mother ♥♥♥♥ing plague wolves.While there arnt many weapons or gear to make and sue in the game there are those few items that are near impossible to get and while I have a rather low play time on this game as on the writing of this review I can see this. This games combat is very challenging. At the start its basicly you use the starter item and 2 shot all the enemys then you walk past the dragons tower and find the crazy strong guys like plague wolves where you fight 3 at a time and they do like 13 dmg per hit while you take 10 or more to kill them.This game is addicting and I think extremely scary. the first time I saw a boss besides the dragon it was this op looking skeleton with full armor and a big sword then out of nowhere a plague wolf hits me in the back(they say GYAAA or some♥♥♥♥♥♥when you attack you the first time) and I about♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants. If you dont have any urgent need of money and you have 15$ laying around get this game, it gets boring after the about 4 hour mark then you go past the dragon area and start trying to get good items and the game gets way harder and reels you in.The multiplayer is like dont starve where you just make a lobby and people can join ive never had any connection errors even playing with my brother in the same house which you usualy need a bunch of dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥to be able to do.No long load times, max like 1 minuteCons:There is a lack of items or variety of guys but with the hardness of getting the end game items it is still fun and takes a long time.Theres no way in hell you can beat the bosses alone, id say ths isnt a con but im just going to say this, no you cant beat that dragon alone dont even try.the movement isnt the smoothest, when you look to the sides or up and down its not amazingly smooth but i got used to it in half an hour. This is by far a good game to buy and its early access so they will keep updating it and making it better. "

								An action RPG game set in a hostile environment where before you even get to the enemies you will have trouble not dying.  I have to say that for all I heard about a lack of content uh in my almost 4 hours of playing I had more than enough to do and it was a tense experience.  It felt how a survival game should feel and it also felt like I was in a Skyrim-like world.  Now I got this game during the Steam Winter Sale so I did not pay the current full price but I could easily pay for $20 for this and feel comfortable about it.  I definitely can recommend this to others but realize people it is an early access game and so things can change and the game might not even work from time to time.			"

I love the building system, unlike other survival games, Savage Lands doesn't just throw you into the world without no instructions. Your Journal comes very handy in explaining the basic mechanics of the game. The building system is simple and yet intuitive. The only thing I had to look it up was how to find sinew. Other than that the game this game is almost perfect.It could use a few more living things in the world. The skies are empty and would benefit from some sort of life flying around.One frustrating thing is that if you die, you loose everything unless you can get back where you died. However the fact that you don't even start with the basic tools that you started the game with it's very disappointing. It's easier to start a new save than bothering getting everything back. Hopefully the developers will fix this soon. Yes I'm looking at you dev dude :)I'd recommend getting a good grasp of the game before venturing too far. A weapon is a must.Here are the Pros and Cons of this game:Pros:+Gorgeous graphics+SImple and Effective building system+Great Mechanics+Instructions are certainly a plus+Multiplayer GamesCons:-Barren world at times-Lots of exploration required to find what you need-No basic tools/loot after death.-Character model needs improvement.This game is totally worth getting. I am looking forward to play it again and again. If you like survival games this is a must.			"

Traveled to village, set up shop, and began foraging about for crafting materials. Was attacked by forest giant. Barely shushed him and survived. Came back with materials. Accidentally walked through campfire and perished in the flames. (only had 5% health after forest giant). Respawned nearly naked and was attacked by wolf. killed it. Came back to village and equipped my previous gear just as dragon soared by, torching me. Died AGAIN. 12/10 too much to survive.			"

There is also some good law and backstory to alot of parts of the game such as the dragon, weapons and special enemies. Although the game may not be aimed to be horror it still keeps you awake and focused making you look over your shoulder with every sound! Its great fun and definetly worth the money.

								Combat need a lot of work, hitboxes are confusing, some enemies still manage to hit you despite you being very far away from them. Would recommend adding fast and charged hits and directional blocking. Basically should copy something similar to what Chivalry does and it would be fantastic. Also should really have some form of an increasing invasion mode. Currently there really isnt much reason to dig in and camp long term.Its going on a right direction and has a certain barbaric world-end viking vibe to it. And its metal as hell. Keep going and something awesome might come out of this.			"

								Played a few hours with my friend and we had a ton of fun, ended up almost making a town hall, finished a few houses and working on the stone house. The fighting is hard, bleeding sucks, finding bandages are hard so basically when you are bleeding get to a safe place! Playing this game Coop is a must - single is fun but to have a friend to help you harvent lumber - stone - ore etc it makes the game a lot more fun.The combat reminds me a lot like Skyrim - so it's amazing, once you master the range of the weapon (you know just like in Minecraft, keep a certain distance) you can sort of troll most fights with wolves... Game has huge potential and if you like Skyrim meets Rust meets Minecraft then grab this game and pray the developers will stick to this and let us continue to play the best  sandbox available.CONS:Servers hold 8 players, blahThats my only con, and that will change in no time I am sure we will see larger servers! Oh and the Dragon sits on a tower and you can't climb it, that's pretty poo. ;)			"

								Overall this game has been quite a bit of fun and I like where the game is headed.  My recommendation is based on the below:- Learning curve is fairly sharp to start.  You are literally dropped on a beach with minimal supplies and then you figure out the rest on your own.  I personally like that style of gaming, but it may not be for all.- The developers are very active.  They are continually adding content and fixing bugs all over.  With that said, the game is early enough in development that the game can turn out to be an awesome survival game or a complete flop without any depth.  Time will tell.- Modding is on the table, but they have not decided on adding support for this yet.  This will be a deciding factor for me in the long-run.  Mods can add a lot of depth and speed the creation of assets that might have taken developers months or years to get to (if they add them at all).  This game is positioned very well to support modding so we will see.- Player base is committed and active on the boards and trello (a voting site where you can vote for the features you want to see next).  If you like survival games and are willing to contribute to the development of the game, you will find an active community and get in on the ground floor of a potentially great game.  If you are expecting a full-fledged game with story and list of to-dos, you might want to wait a few months and check back.  Happy hunting! "

								**** Review Update - 8/28/16 ****I purchased Savage Lands about a year ago, late July early August 2015.  I'm amazed at how far the game has progressed in only a year.  When I first played Savage Lands, the graphics weren't anything to brag about, there were few enemies that were easily defeated, food was scarce, but it had the giant sand box feel that I love.  I invested about 18 hours in the game and by that point I had crafted most of what could be crafted and done what could be done back then.  I saw that the developer was constantly improving the game in the short amount of time I played it, so I figured I'd check back in a year or two.  I played Savage Lands for the first time this year yesterday and I have to say WOW.  Who ever is developing this game is doing a fantastic job and clearly working very hard.  The graphics have improved dramatically, there are many more craftable items, more animals, more enemies, and a story to go with it.  No more logs rolling out of my house, no more stacking logs on the up hill side of a big rock by the beach to feed my fire. When I first played logs and other equipment used to roll under the front wall of any structure and then into the ocean because the structures didn't sit on the ground flush, they kind of hovered on the low land side of the structure.  You really had to search around for the most flat part of the island to lay buildings down, this has changed dramatically.  Right now my survivor is camped on a little island off the shore for his own safety.  I found the wimpy skeletons that were once the only enemy lurking near the shore.  I found an abandoned castle and inside a found an undead warrior who bum rushed me and damn near killed my survivor.  I barely escaped alive.  So far I've crafted 8 small 4 slot pouches to store gear, collected a few 20 stacks of logs to feed my fire, built up a decent food store by knifing rabits with my stone sword, and have collected two of each stone tool: axe, sword, and hammer.  Before I knew it almost 3 hours had passed and I can't wait for my next chance to get lost in this game.  To the developer, keep up the good work, this game is becoming a gem.			"

								Found mysterious village. Before I could explore it, realized I was almost freezing, so ran back to my campsite. Almost froze to death while looking for a piece of flint to restart my fire. Restarted fire with 20% health left. Shook fists in the air shouting ""I AM ALIVE!!!"". Then looked at my hunger, and realized I was starving to death. Exited to desktop. To be continued.20/10 would break into tears again.			"

								Interesting Game. Initially it seems impossible, stick with it, it gets easier to survive, you get better at dominating your environment, food becomes less of an issue, the cold gets easier to deal with! Then you move into the Islands interior and get to deal with not one wolf at a time but but 5, not one skeleton at a time but 6, giant bears and weird looking walking bushes that make the ground shake! After 70 hours this game still makes me jump out of my skin and the Dev's are just starting to warm up, they didn't turn on the dragons yet.......			"

								This game completely overdelivers on content and community both for a title in Early Access and especially at this price.  Many released titles that cost more deliver less...Signal Studios - the developement house - is very present on the community forums, with weekly live streams covering new features and future plans for the game.  Bi-weekly betas and rolling updates keep the gameplay fresh, and I've always got something new to look forward to.Great game, outstanding value for money - a must have!			"

								Savage lands started like any other survival game, too many placed resources to start you off. I quickly felt the game was too easy. plenty of resources game to hunt and a rare wolf here or there. I was thinking that the game was too easy, waiting for an update to increase difficulty. With nothing else to do I started venturing further north. Within minutes I start getting attacked by packs of wolves. It's great that the difficulty increases the further you travel, giving players a chance to increase at their own pace. Game is great as it is, but I can't wait to see what they do with the magic system. I just hope they don't make it too easy to hunt and kill things.			"

If you want to be addicted, unemployed, and homeless buy this game now. If not, go on with your boring lame life and you won't ever knw how boring your life really is. If they had female models or at least some type of medival fantasy porno, I would quit life and just play this game. Thank God they don't have any of that yet. When they do, I'm going to cancel my youporn subscription. My life from here on out seems bleak but also very exciting...			"

								It's ok...it has more potential than actual fun gameplay and generally seems as if it would become more interesting the more polished it is. crafting is a pain, too much senseless rock hitting. Some of the Evil NPC characters have cool designs but mostly it's very average, Graphics are kind of bad...but not massively. The Cold will annoy u as well the entire time and steal your health bar. The AI is horrible and predictable. I hope they fix this game some time and add some new features and polish their visuals, then I would totally give it a second chance.			"

""Compass"" pointing to West, while you facing East - that's all you have to know about it. And forget about Sun as possible source of directions, since it raise not from East.more coming soon "

								I have tried various Early Access games, and Savage Lands is one of the better ones.   It is challenging, and makes you think about what you need to do to stay alive and not be killed by hunger, the cold, or hostile creatures.   There are a few minor glitches (e.g., sometimes deer running away from you go into a ravine and disappear), but the controls are fairly easy to understand and learn.   Staying alive and improving your situation is a bit of a grind in the early stages, but that grind reflects the premise of the player being exiled on a hostile island with little equipment and left to fend for survival.I hope the developers keep up their good work.  I recommend Savage Lands for anyone interested in survival-type games (and who is willing to try an Early Access game).Update to my review: It's been a bit more than 2 weeks since my original review.  The more I play Savage Lands, the more I like it ---- even when I occasionally make a mistake and suffer the consequences.  Now, I rate it as one of the top 3 of all the Early Access games I've played.  Thanks to the devs.  I am looking forward to their future efforts at making Savage Lands even better.			"

								    First let me say that I am really lovin this game so far, it's just like Skyrim with a twist. Has lots of potential and I can't wait to see the end result.     That being said, I have only noticed one issue that I have with this game, and that would be the lack of a map, compass marker, or any other kind of an indicator as to where your spawn point or base camp is. Now I'm not saying that a lot of work to that end would be nessessary, but something, anything, to point you back to that respawn point that you can build (short pole with 3-4 skulls on it) would be really nice. I can do without a map if I have to, but something, please... I have had to restart my game a few times already because I keep loosing track of my bases.....    Anyways, like I said, love this game and would deffinately recommend!  Thanks Dev team, keep up the good work!			"

								Great idea for a game.  I was excited to play.  Was.  I'll give it another try at next update.  I can't find any purpose in clicking respawn right now.  I know it it's early access but I can not reccomend this game.  Maybe worth 5 dollars right now on the off chance you might enjoy it for the weekend.  Will gladly update this review when the game is recommendable.  And I will be checking.  Biggest issue right now is you will feel like you have zero control in your destiney.  If things around you happen to go right you will live for while and maybe build a house or something.  But 90% of the time you will be attacked by a wolf or just freeze to death before you have any sort of opportunity to do whatever it is your supposed to do while your surviving.  Very shallow experience so far.  I would make reccomendations but I think it would be insulting to the company to assume they think this is an even close to good enough product right now.  So I'll trust they have some sort of plan to put together a decent title here in the next few weeks.  And we will go from there.			"

YouTube™ Video: Savage Lands - Survival Basics, Crafting and Combat  Introduction! 

			Views: 578		

			Savage lands is a survival game with a mystical and mysterious game environment that we begin to explore. In this video I introduce you to the main idea of the game and some of the crafting, we also...		

Savage lands is a very non forgiving close to hardcore survival game with a mystical skyrim feel. Throughout playing Savage Lands, there was many factors of the game that seemed to be replicated from games like The Forest, and throughout the both the similarities became dissapointing. It did not completely throw away my experience of Savage Lands but it is just a warning to the people who don't like games like The Forest, because this is like The Forest.I am going to leave the pros and cons down below,  and I will then conclude my final opinion.Pros:-------------------------------------- Advanced AI and unique creature animations make NPC's scary and immersively realistic.- Inventory system along with crafting is bugless, and very easy to use.- Graphics are decent enough to immerse me into the gameplay.- The game takes realistic survival factors and implements them into the game, including a body temperature system which drops exponentially at the night. This makes the game challenging in a good way.- Dragons...pretty damn cool- Various creatures, all of which have their own unique properties, made the game much funner to explore.- Ruins and towns, gave the game a mysterious feel, making exploration enjoyable.Cons:----------------------------------------------------- Badly Optimised, lagg spikes often on Good enough computer.- Combat system is clunky and skill-less, causes combat to be quite unenjoyable and I found myself avoiding some creatures because there is no proper way to block in the game, and I would die inevitably. Also the NPC's tend to hit you even if there animation is not directly hitting you on screen. Quite dumb.- Parts of the game such as cutting down trees and crafting seems like a clone of The Forest and it slightly throws away the uniqueness of the game.- Your character cannot jump up on rocks at most times, moveability is uncomfortable, and even when shift sprinting, animals can catch you and kill you.Final Conclusion:-------------------------------------The game succeeds to appetise my survival addiction through it's mysterious and mystical gameplay environment and harsh survival factors. If you enjoyed The Forest I definitaly recommend this game to you!			"

								I had really high hopes for this game. I was expecting something along the lines of Skyrim meets The Forest. What I got however was a pretty mediocre survival game that didn't really offer anything interesting or new to the table. It's pretty much your standard wake up on an island, make a campfire, scavenge, hunt, etc. Except that it does all of this stuff very sloppily. In the end, I just felt myself feeling very unfulfilled with this game. Oh well. At least it gave me an opportunity to try out the new refund system; which I was quite satisfied with.			"

Early Access Review
								A good fantasy-survival game! There are some bugs, but it's early-access; nothing game breaking. It's tough, and therefore actually feels like it's about survival. Reading reviews from others, there apparently were huge optimization issues that caused major framerate drops. I guess I was lucky enough to start after they had made multiple updates toward that issue, as I have very minor frame problems. The co-op works quite well for me too, as I have played with 2 other friends in a game. Over all I kinda feel like it's survival-Skyrim, minus the magic..or maybe I'm just not that far. The only real issue I have is that animals occasionally location-pop while running, and run through rock formations. Already loving this game though, and it being early-access, it's only going to get better!			"

								Well well, it's come to write a review has it?So, my experience with framerate, look a little bit below for gameplay rather than me complaining.Maybe if I could run the game i'd be able to give a less biased opinion considering i've had this since legacy, before I could run the game perfectly fine way above 60fps and now I struggle to get 30fps. The recommended may not always apply but when my pc completely surpasses said recommended hardware and still struggles to run you have a large problem.I have 6gb of memory and this game completely maxes it and that is whats bottlenecking it, cpu 45% usage and gpu 60% usage. Low and high graphics make no difference in framerate, only render distance does. God forbid you set launch options to ""-force d3d9"" because that can cause your sky to turn completely pink and sometime flicker.Oh yea, the game right, not my problems.=-=-=Pros=-=-=-Games graphics are highly flexible and an amazing amount of options for personalization.-Actual difficulty, There is an actual amount of scaling in this game, I doubt you'll goto late game with a stone sword or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ you have to build yourself up to take on the battle.-Dedicated multiplayer servers.-Special Enemies to spice up your life a bit rather than fighting wolves every 5 seconds, you might find a devourer or something of the like.-Alot of items to make to give a bit of personalization.=-=-=Cons=-=-=-Combat system has little to no depth, you swing, the enemy swings, whoever does more damage wins. that simple.-Crafting system is ridiculously easy and gathering materials is tedious.-Probably nobody is going to read this, pretty much no point for me to write this other than i'm bored. (unrelated)-Recommended requirements is currently nowhere near what it states, since it's early access thats due to change but with the large amount it's off by it's almost invalid.-It can be quite a grind, especially when you can lose everything so fast and have to start over.Do I recommend it? If you want a survival game that is somewhat different and is constantly being updated sure. If you plan to play it alone and expect AAA performance and story and expansive continents or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ no. I highly recommend you play with a friend to get some enjoyment out of surviving rather than dying every 5 seconds.Thanks for reading if you got this far, you've probably got nothing else to do either than waste about 5 minutes of your life reading a steam review.

Early Access Review
								Note: I have bought this game through a bundle.First of all for an early access game I had no crashes or bugs yet which is very rare and I am impressed. The game mechanics are in my opinion spot on, this includes hunger, cold, stamina and health which can be affected from the environment.The idea that I can create my own local game is very important specially if you had some past negative experiences with other survival games in a PvE or PvP servers. That being said, you can bring your local character to PvE or PvP servers and play with your friends if you so choose.Savage Lands brings new enemies to fight, either being boars, wolves, skeletons, giants or dragons, they all fight in a unique way and drop items based on the creature. For example a boar will drop boar meat and tusks while a skeleton will drop bones, rotten flesh and silk.Crafting in this game is in-depth and complex, you have lengthy list of items you are able to craft/ cook with each having their own unique recipe. Finding the materials may be challenging specially for new comers but over time you are able to identify the best spots to mine for specific materials.The graphics are not bad, for an early access game. I have seen finished games which couldn't hold a candle to Savage Lands graphics and I know they will improve if that is your thing.Overall this game has hooked me, eventhough I don't have much time for playing anything at the moment I will surely be devoting some of my free time to this game!Score 9/10 - (Epic)  "

Early Access Review
								I normally never write reviews, but with the amount of negitve reviews that I've seen for this game I have to weigh in on it.First: this is an early access game, it does show, and there are definately areas for improvement, figureing out crafting is dificult, and sometimes you can easily forget that not everything you can craft show up in the main crafting interface. If you want to make crafting tables, or forges you have to set the diagram on the ground from the journal. This can be overwhelming at first, but after a bit you get used to it.Second: the overall gameplay is fun, you really do feel like you are shivering on a frozen isle, just trying to not get killed. so far the dragon hasn't come to try to kill me, but I always keep an eye on the tower to make sure that it doesn't come towards me. I would like for them to include a female model for the PC, but at the same time, I understand that for the most part the model is just a placeholder.All in all this feel very much like Skyrim meets minecraft in its early days. The setting is very reminicent of Skyrim's northern wastes, but as in Minecraft, you will die a lot if you are not careful. Food and energy, health and cold are all things you must manage, or you will not survive.TLDR; If you are a fan of dificult but fair games, then this is a good buy, you will die, but you will also learn.

								I am in love with this game! Bought it on sale, had it on my wishlist for a while now, just been waiting for the right time (:My first try I literally died because I couldnt figure out how to get a stick... My second try I died of cold. My third try I got murdered by wolves. Fourth, finally came to realise I should probably make basecamp instead of travelling around, dies of starvation.Couldn't survive alone lol, still couldnt resist respawning and playing over :PAlthough its early access it's still really enjoyable I've so far made camp and have been working on ""my land"" built many structures and havnt done much adventuring yet, just mostly making basecamp lol.The gameplay is nice, I do recommend that loot should be dropped every time you chop a bush down, makes it hard for you to find frostberries,  or I do reccommend to make a whole new bush thats for sticks only and another for frostberries only.I also sudjest Traps for animals perhaps, and possibly more structures to build.I would like to also see a planting mechanic such as trees or frostberries, also making the frostberries seeds rare to drop or something like that.Possibly add a map system of some sort or make the firepit smoke visible from afarAnd could you make the compass a little less dark looking its hard to see the needle ends or even distinguish them sometimes The daylight system is great but i think there should be less wind/snow the night+win/snow isn't fun at all, nightime is already creepy already Also a healthbar for the monsters and deer, make it a little easier for beginner Besides that the game is fun and I havnt stopped playing since I've boughten it lolI do look forward to the updates in the game (:			"

Fourth, finally came to realise I should probably make basecamp instead of travelling around, dies of starvation.Couldn't survive alone lol, still couldnt resist respawning and playing over :PAlthough its early access it's still really enjoyable I've so far made camp and have been working on ""my land"" built many structures and havnt done much adventuring yet, just mostly making basecamp lol.The gameplay is nice, I do recommend that loot should be dropped every time you chop a bush down, makes it hard for you to find frostberries,  or I do reccommend to make a whole new bush thats for sticks only and another for frostberries only.I also sudjest Traps for animals perhaps, and possibly more structures to build.I would like to also see a planting mechanic such as trees or frostberries, also making the frostberries seeds rare to drop or something like that.Possibly add a map system of some sort or make the firepit smoke visible from afarAnd could you make the compass a little less dark looking its hard to see the needle ends or even distinguish them sometimes The daylight system is great but i think there should be less wind/snow the night+win/snow isn't fun at all, nightime is already creepy already Also a healthbar for the monsters and deer, make it a little easier for beginner Besides that the game is fun and I havnt stopped playing since I've boughten it lolI do look forward to the updates in the game (:			"

Early Access Review
								Note: I have bought this game through a bundle.First of all for an early access game I had no crashes or bugs yet which is very rare and I am impressed. The game mechanics are in my opinion spot on, this includes hunger, cold, stamina and health which can be affected from the environment.The idea that I can create my own local game is very important specially if you had some past negative experiences with other survival games in a PvE or PvP servers. That being said, you can bring your local character to PvE or PvP servers and play with your friends if you so choose.Savage Lands brings new enemies to fight, either being boars, wolves, skeletons, giants or dragons, they all fight in a unique way and drop items based on the creature. For example a boar will drop boar meat and tusks while a skeleton will drop bones, rotten flesh and silk.Crafting in this game is in-depth and complex, you have lengthy list of items you are able to craft/ cook with each having their own unique recipe. Finding the materials may be challenging specially for new comers but over time you are able to identify the best spots to mine for specific materials.The graphics are not bad, for an early access game. I have seen finished games which couldn't hold a candle to Savage Lands graphics and I know they will improve if that is your thing.Overall this game has hooked me, eventhough I don't have much time for playing anything at the moment I will surely be devoting some of my free time to this game!Score 9/10 - (Epic)  "

Early Access Review
								I originally bought this game just to play with my friends and give me something to do if I was ever bored. At first, I didn't really expect much out of it, it looked cool and all, but the game type wasn't what I usually play. After playing it with a small group of friends, however, this game ended up being real fun. At first it's challenging, and then is still challenging when you think you're all good. There are, of course, some bugs and problems, but since the game is still in its early stages, they aren't a major concern to me, and the game will probably be even more amazing when it's completed. My only recommendation when you play, especially if you play with friends, is don't clear an entire section of trees for your town and name the decision Operation: Homeless Bambi. I don't know if it actually had any impact on it, or if it was just my crappy luck, but every single creature hated me more than any of my friends... No matter which one of us was closer to them... Remember, only you can prevent deforestation... Or cause it... I say cause it...			"

								This game has potential.  It's Alpha so don't expect much, but there are definitely things to do in the game to keep you occupied.  There was a recent update, but I'm not too sure how frequent updates come out.  This game sorta fills my Ultima Online void that i've been missing.  Its still too early, but if they did some tweaking, this game would be great.  DEV, in case you see this, here are my suggestions for the game:- Make more lands with different weather, animals, etc.  Even if going to the next land requires an instance and needs to be loaded.  - Introduce skills into the game.  No leveling, simple skill base.  You hack a tree, you gain Lumberjacking.  You hit a rock, you gain Mining. - Introduce fishing and lakes/ponds.- Boats!  get some boat crafting in this game once you have the ability to travel lands.Not sure if this game will EVER get this far, but, I sure hope it does.TLDR - Would I recommend?  Yes.			"

Early Access Review
								I am currently writting this review with 16 hours of gameplay. This is, of course, in the Early Access release. I have to start off with, ""Wow!"" It is not often that an Early Access game is with well off. I have not encountered any game breaking bugs that make the game unplayable in its current status. I have, however, had it crash to desktop twice. I believe this is partly due to my insane hours of play in one sit down and possibly an error on my side (I'll post it in an edit here if I encounter it again). Overall though, here are my thoughts on Savage lands besides the obvious: it is an awesome start to something great.The GoodFor early access, the game is quite developed as far as graphics and interfacing with objects. There is a challenge in the begining and getting used to the system and how to survive, but after that, you can explore to your hearts content and try and tackle larger foes.I really enjoy the idea that my friends and I can make a community (houses, town hall, etc.) and advanture together in a crazy survival or be killed by foes, the weather, or maybe even a dragon. It really is a great start for what I like in games with my friends.The BadWhile the list is small and generally things that I would like to see put in the game in the future, I really don't have any real negative feedback Unable to lock doors from other players. Unable to lock chests from other players. Being able to ""draw"" a map of areas you have explored would be helpful with navigation. Remove names from friendly people (while it is awesome, it also takes away some of the ""find your friends and brave the lands"" feel). "

								As the game is as of 11-7-2015 I would say the game even if it isn't finished is a decent game. Think Minecraft with a little more realism and better graphics, albeit with only one world that never changes and has only one Biom and NO easy mode.That said, while there isn't much to do it is a pretty good time sink game with decent amount of stuff to do. Think lone survior of a ship wreck stranded on a freezing hostile island/continent being hunted by Skeletons, Wolves, Bears, and Boar all the time and has the strength and know how to build basically a mini medival village minus walls.Now the game has plenty of faults, but hey it is a work in progress so obviously. Glitchy mics for multiplayer, random player buildings and gear but no NPCs to account for it. NO GOAL OR MISSION, that I found anyways, NO MAP OR WAYPOINT system unless you just learn the terrain or build landmarkers yourself. Glitchy and oversensitive point and aim system. Glitchy combat. Arrows DROP WAY TOO FAST, I do archery in real life with old fashioned recurves made of WOOD and wood shaft & fletched arrows too, not the new stuff: fiberglass, aluminum, carbon arrows, with a bow made of metals and artificial materials etc, and arrows go a lot farther than in the game.Definetly a grinder, takes a bit more common sense and thinking on the player's part as the game isn't telling you where to go and what to do to make stuff but more or less lets you figure it out. There's a journal but it is more encylapedia refernece during/after inital work than a guide.Game has plenty of faults but is definetly a playable game as is, so long as you don't mind it NEVER ENDING as there's no story to it or even any back story items to give the land character.For a work in progress 6.5/10 for a finished game 5/10			"

								So far I've enjoyed every minute of this game.  I love how it just throws you into the world right off the bat.  No stupid tutorial or hand holding.  The early stages of the game is quite difficult and very unforgiving, which is why this game is so awesome.  I spent the first night with a new character cowering in a make shift shack I built while two Plague Wolves circled around it, waiting to devour me if I stepped out side.  I also love the fact there's no in game map, it makes exploration much more fun and rewarding.  There's a fair number of land marks you can use to find your way around and there's also a crude compass that can be crafted.  I look forward to the new features added to the game and especially release.  Keep up the great work!			"

								This game is currently in early access as of this review but I definately recommend this game, it's very fun. You start off on a frigid island basically stark naked and you must learn to survive there managing your warmth, hit points and hunger all while gathering resources to create weapons, armor, lodging, a forge and more. You must hunt for food and explore by day as you will be hunted by rats, wolves, skeletons, etc or freeze to death at night if you don't build a campfire. You can play solo (like I do, it's more challenging this way - no one to rely on but yourself) or you can play with a group of up to 8 people if someone hosts. This game is not for rage quitters as you will die ALOT in the first hour of play while you learn the game mechanics, but once you do, it's easy to thrive.			"

								for once, early access done right. the Devs actually talk - and, even more important - LISTEN to the community, and - unlike other developer teams -actually fix broken stuff before adding in more stuff that might break. about the game itself:it might not have uber-mental graphics, but it looks good, and the world just FEELS right. i have spent hours just walking around, admiring the landscape, interrupted by the occasional ""oh darn"" moment when encountering one of the more dangerous creatures that roam the isle (or the skies above it).not like there are much creatures that are unable to kill you in seconds if you don't watch out.the game is hard, pretty darn hard. like a survival game should be.my first encounter with a boar turned out like it were the first two hours of Gothic 3 - read as: ""oh crap, a boar - aaaand i'm dead.""what is also really cool is that it borrows some elements from RPG's, like special creatures to find and kill, and them dropping rare items or the components to craft even stronger items - with which you then can try to take on that pesky dragon that has been screwing you over repeatedly since the first time you were dumb and/or brave enough to set foot on his ""front porch""prepare to die. A LOT.especially if you are mental enough to try and play it solo.better bring a few friends (or people you don't like to feed to that cheeky, firebreathing, a-hole named Kur^^ )you like survival games?you like fantasy?you enjoyed skyrims landscape?then you will love this game.

Early Access Review
								Really enjoyed this game tonnes of potential, I've listed some points below about it thus far...SURVIVAL: Its an issue when you start, but if you don't faff about standing on player made houses throwing rocks at each other, its easy to get the hang of, and only really becomes more intense when you start to venture far from your homebase, especially at night. I really hope they add some sort of crop growing system in future, as it'd at least provide a break from slaughtering the islands natural inhabitants for sustenance (Plus seriously its an island = limited supply of game to chew up). COMBAT: Pretty simple really, like Skyrim, using a bow is satisfying when you get the hang of it. No shields, or parry, so you just have to dodge by stepping backwards etc. I hope it gets a bit more advanced in future as I expect it will, as this would also be a bonus for PvP when/if anyone decides to engage in that sorta stuff. MOBS/BADGUYS: Like in every game they can get a bit dull a bit quickly, plus, aside from the odd wolf pack, duo of bears, or party of heavily armed skelebobs (who only spawn in certain locations) I wouldn't say the mobs are hard, more a nuisance, that if you let your guard down will hurt you. Though very interesting, and certainly more is planned, I'm hoping that mobs become far more threatening to the player in future. By that I mean, they actively hunt players, and not just spawn in place and randomly patrol about. It'd be awesome if the game would occasionally send a large pack of skeletons, or even new deadlier creatures to haunt/attack player camps. Perhaps even have it so some use stealth to pick players of, whilst others just lay siege to villages. Perhaps other events/happenings where something emerges from outside the island etc at random points, just to keep us on our toes. ONLINE: Game is best played this way IMO. When persistent servers needs to be added, alongside greater controls for hosts (say prevent players griefing/stealing others buildings or belongings) it would be excellent. When I first hosted my own server it became full pretty rapidly, and people began building their own shacks/houses next to mine to the extent a sizeable village had sprouted up. Coming back to a busy camp with people coming and going was just brilliant! We often traded, brought in goods from other servers etc, and went out to help newbies at night find their way their. Its also why I hope in future bands of mobs will attempt to rush and kill players in their camps, it'd definitly develop a new dynamic survival wise. DRAGON: He's cool, don't go near him.  "

								I am recommending this game. The ramp up isn't as hard as other survival games. It's probably the first survival game with a tutorial in the beginning. The community is awesome. The game is designed where it is beneficial for players to help each other. For example, killing giants takes a group of people. The recipes aren't hard to figure out. Building houses is unique compared to other survival games. You actually place the item and it's transparent until all the material is placed.			"

I regain conciousness, my boat smashed to pieces on the shore of the island. I came with friends, but after wandering the coastline I see only salvage and more smashed boats. I can only hope they went on without me. As I pick up an axe I recognise too well, I push the thoughts of my brothers out of my mind. We crossed the sea to escape the blight that befell our town - the undead and other creatures of the night still haunt my dreams. No more could we repel their relentless attacks. Alas, seeing city ruins and hearing a thunderous cry echo through the land, I begin to doubt the decisions of the elders.While trekking up the mountain I make quick work of the boars and wolves along the way. I fashion a lean-to and make a fire, but as I hear the beating of heavy wings, I quickly extinguish it to avoid the flying lizard that just passed overhead. The smoke lingers, and the creature double backs and lays waste to my camp. I sprint blindly forwards until my lungs can't take me any further, my tattered cloth giving little protection against the burning foliage I'm consumed by. After diving into a warehouse next to a small building, it seems I have lost it. I'll make camp here for the night. Perhaps I can regrow this into a village similar to one of home over the coming days.---I want to go on, because so much more happened in those 2 hours. I had to leave in the middle of the night to find more food; deers constantly springing away at the last second as hunger constantly threatens me. Awesome. After finding some food and berries, my torch blew out and I had lost my sense of direction in my chase. I spent 20 minutes getting gradually more and more desperate until my health started to rapidly decline from the cold. I make it back to camp with just 10% health left. Awesome.I died from ambush of wolves while mining Awesome.. But this time when I trekked back up to camp, I came across an abandoned dragon village. Awesome. Were these worshippers? Where did they go? What was in the dragons tower? The village had something very eerie about it. I grabbed the bow and began hunting deer like the nordic warrior I imagined myself to be. Awesome. After learning to chop down trees behind me to create a path, walking slowly to not startle deers, I was having good success. Then, after killing the dears I make my way back to camp; 5 wolves spring onto my back and kill me again! Awesome.A thank you to the developersGuys, that was an incredible experience. The desperation and raw situation you put us in make it extremely immersive to me. The environment was different, but realistic enough to get lost in incredibly easily. The wildlife was intimidating, the howling wind, branch snapping and bush rustling had me on edge constantly. The dragon village had some nice environmental story telling, and overall it just made one of the most immersive fantasy experiences I've had. There's a lot of room for imagination, which can be a wonderful thing for some games.Pros- Optimised well*, I don't have a great PC but it ran great on the highest settings.- Immersive, realistic environment both visually and audibly.- Great bleak atmosphere, I felt every emotion my character might.- It's difficult, but that's also a con- Use of cold felt particularly realCons- Inventory management is not good.- That survivors guide felt kinda tacky, but I appreciate you've put it in to help players, which is also a much needed thing- No inbuilt controller support- On first impressions, the world feels empty. The ""inbetween bits"" are samey, which helps realism but detracts from the experience. Additionally, the focal points aren't interactable: the dragons tower was just that, a pillar of stone that you couldn't even climb to the top with.- Nothing that distinguishes it mechanically from other games in the survival genre (setting though was great)* I read some other reviews that said optimisation was a problem. I played solo locally but didn't build a lot. Lots of buildings and/or players might change the running of the game.TL;DRThis game is rough around the edges to say the least. The UI is horrible, and it's incredibly difficult to orient yourself. It's not clear how the craft system works and gathering materials is a bit of a pain. Survival games tend to be immersive by their nature, but this is the only one I've seen based on a fantasy setting, and boy does it deliver on that (based on first impressions). I doubt I'll play this a lot more, but I certainly enjoyed that experience - I look forward to the finished product.			"

								To start off this game is amazing, and i would and do reccomend my friends getting itthe game has alot of good aspects of an adventure/survival game, such as when you spawn there are few enimies but as you venture off the game gets more difficult, and swarms of wolfs,bears,boars (depending where you decide to build) swarms of them attack you as you build, and gather reasources, which keeps you paranoid and on your toes(i find that enjoyable in survival games rust is a big one)Big Cons are the building first off, (This Game is Still Unfinished so these cons can be fixed)the building is Rough its hard to place building b/c of terrain, there are few Building Types like 6 actuall premade houses or something like that which leads to No viraitythere are glitches as all games do, but nothing that game breaking as far as ive experienced,Few servers that have people play on but you can host your own sever w/ ease so not that bigg of a deal,the A.I> for Mobs is sadly lacking to say the least you can spin around a hostile mob and take no dmg, and stand on a rock or building and the mobs run around in circlesthe game could also use some optimization for hosting servers i can run like 6ppl and me then drop in framesA BIG ONE is the Combat (pve as far as ik) there is no attack animation that is accuratethe dogs can stand there sometimes and do 1/3 of you health as dmg w/ no indication its kinda bad in all honestly Pro's very fun gameVery Nice Comunity, if you have a question players will help for the most part (atleast in my case)Devs randomly join hosted servers and have been known to ask for input at least they asked me once,if you have equipment in one world in transfers over to all servers/worldstons of hostile mobs variantsin the end i'd give this game a 6.5/10			"

								Muaha!I am a Savage in a Savage Land!This is an Early Access Review - Friday July 10 2015I would like to state a brief review why I would recommend this game:There is an empty flower pot.  There are two bags of dirt. And one bag of fertilizer.  I reach for the first bag of dirt, which was obtained from the soil and beaches from ""The Forest"".  I pour the dirt in the flower pot.  I reach for the second bag of dirt.  It is from the snow and unforgiving gravel under my feet in ""The Long Dark"".  I pour the dirt in the flower pot.  I reach for the Fertilizer.  It is labeled Skyrim MiracleGro.  I pour the fertilizer into the flower pot.  A flower begins to grow.  It's name is Savage Lands.  I will be watering this flower every day until it is no longer an early access flower.			"

								Already fun and lots of potential. The weather/atmosphere feeling is almost perfect. Hopefully additional interesting mechanics will be added, like (for example) making smoke rising from fires visible from a certain distance to give away player/camp locations, friends or enemies. And maybe more unique ways to find others, like being able to make some sort of sound to follow, which again could have good or bad results. It already works for finding deer so... Getting seperated from friends happens often and I think some more subtle ways to find each other would add depth. I've spent a night making an emergency camp only to find out I was within shouting distance of the main camp.The only issue really so far is the network play. It's been dropping quite often, but it's not unexpected at this stage. The character recovery once re-connected is usually pretty clean, which is nice.Overall tons of potential and hopefully the devs will polish this gem in the rough to shine brightly, and not rest on what has already been accomplished.

								I originally bought this game just to play with my friends and give me something to do if I was ever bored. At first, I didn't really expect much out of it, it looked cool and all, but the game type wasn't what I usually play. After playing it with a small group of friends, however, this game ended up being real fun. At first it's challenging, and then is still challenging when you think you're all good. There are, of course, some bugs and problems, but since the game is still in its early stages, they aren't a major concern to me, and the game will probably be even more amazing when it's completed. My only recommendation when you play, especially if you play with friends, is don't clear an entire section of trees for your town and name the decision Operation: Homeless Bambi. I don't know if it actually had any impact on it, or if it was just my crappy luck, but every single creature hated me more than any of my friends... No matter which one of us was closer to them... Remember, only you can prevent deforestation... Or cause it... I say cause it...			"

The game needs fences and farming just for fun.  Hopefully the trees will grow back and the rocks will regenerate their supplies... maybe we just didn't play long enough.Anyways, I got the 4 pack and my friends who joined were all addicted.  If you like minecraft, get this, its similar.			"

								It kept me busy for a few hours but at this point i feel it's missing quite a bit. I feel like the mining is horrible. You have to hit the rocks quite a lot, just to receive 5 lumps of ore. I'd like to see them drop more ore, although crafting will have to be updated accordingly as well. It just doesn't feel right. Rebuilding the broken villages and towers is fun, but there is no use to them except keeping you busy for while, collecting the recourses necessary. Give the homes a function(Usable bed even if its only an animation, chests that you can use to store and ability to personalize the houses with some craftable furniture) It all seems so generic at this point. That having said, i do recommend this game. Its a fun fantasy world surviving game, but it still needs work. Good thing it's an alpha, that way we can point the devs in the right direction. I bought this game in the humble bundle and i really feel like it was a steal.   "

The crafting system is built nicely, the graphics are decent, the mechanics are great. The only two problems that I have with the game is it's price which imo is high compared to what you get now and that it doesn't have dedicated servers. If we put those two problems aside, I suggest you to buy it. The game does seem to be in really early statges but I can understand what it could become in the future, so for this case I will support it.			"

								I am in love with this game! Bought it on sale, had it on my wishlist for a while now, just been waiting for the right time (:My first try I literally died because I couldnt figure out how to get a stick... My second try I died of cold. My third try I got murdered by wolves. Fourth, finally came to realise I should probably make basecamp instead of travelling around, dies of starvation.Couldn't survive alone lol, still couldnt resist respawning and playing over :PAlthough its early access it's still really enjoyable I've so far made camp and have been working on ""my land"" built many structures and havnt done much adventuring yet, just mostly making basecamp lol.The gameplay is nice, I do recommend that loot should be dropped every time you chop a bush down, makes it hard for you to find frostberries,  or I do reccommend to make a whole new bush thats for sticks only and another for frostberries only.I also sudjest Traps for animals perhaps, and possibly more structures to build.I would like to also see a planting mechanic such as trees or frostberries, also making the frostberries seeds rare to drop or something like that.Possibly add a map system of some sort or make the firepit smoke visible from afarAnd could you make the compass a little less dark looking its hard to see the needle ends or even distinguish them sometimes The daylight system is great but i think there should be less wind/snow the night+win/snow isn't fun at all, nightime is already creepy already Also a healthbar for the monsters and deer, make it a little easier for beginner Besides that the game is fun and I havnt stopped playing since I've boughten it lolI do look forward to the updates in the game (:			"

								This game won't take you by the hand one bit. The ""touturial"" is for♥♥♥♥♥♥and from second one you start to freeze and starve to death. That's the fun of the game. You realy need to look for ways to survive. If you are stuck at some point or confused about controls, there is always the wiki. If you are looking for a game where ""survival"" is not ""chop a tree, build a house, plant crops"", you found it. Even if you think you are doing well, death is just around the next corner.			"

								This review is kind of complicated.The game in itself is surprisingly fun, I have played it with a couple of friends and we did crack a few laughs. The crafting system is built nicely, the graphics are decent, the mechanics are great. The only two problems that I have with the game is it's price which imo is high compared to what you get now and that it doesn't have dedicated servers. If we put those two problems aside, I suggest you to buy it. The game does seem to be in really early statges but I can understand what it could become in the future, so for this case I will support it.			"

								I like the idea of Savage Lands. I like the layout and so far the items that CAN be crafted seem to be pretty cool. But why is it so hard to find a wood stick in the middle of a forest? This game seems like it would be a lot more fun if some resources (at least the basic ones) were more abundant. It gets pretty boring when you're running around for nearly an hour looking for something as simple as sticks, hoping a wolf doesnt come along and take out half my health while I try to punch it to death. If some of these small balancing issues were fixed (along with the sometimes annoying and slowvframerate) this game could really shape up to be an impressive one.			"

								First impression after several hours of playtime:  WOW!Lovely crafting system with some depth to it.  Gathering materials is easy, until you remember that you are freezing to death as you work.  After 17 hours of play I am only on the second island.  Lots of content for a game that is this early in it's development cycle.Cons:  combat is too easy.  I actually have not died once yet, and I am an old slow gamer ;)low FPS, but they have plenty of time to fix that.in response to people with technical issues, Check your computer!   I had no problem running this game.My computer is 8 years old, an ASUS M3A mb with quad core Phenom 2.5 Ghz CPU, 7 G RAM, XFX R7 260X graphics card.With another year or two of added content this game will be a wonderful RPG.   Great world to explore and build in.			"

								While not my kind of game, this holds promise to be a fun fantasy-esque man vs wild  game. I only played enough to get an overall feel for the game and how it would pan out. I must say... I may even put some more time in down the line. (I was actually scared when Boars came out of no where and finding shambling skeletons wandering around some ruins). It reminds me a lot of Forest and other games like it so if you like those and want to fight fantasy creatures... I will definitately recommend this game. I love how recipes are unlocked through finding components or killing creatures to acquire components. It keeps you going out and exploring instead of hunkering down in one spot only.			"

								This game, in the simplest explaination, a single player version of Rust. It is not quite the same as rust though. There are many differences from this game and Rust that makes it better and worse. First of all, you don't have the same building freedoms that you do in Rust. You choose a building, get the supplies, build it, and thats it. This makes it simpler to do things but a little boring. I would love if they added a thing where you can put furniture in your buildings or something to that extent so you don't have such empty buildings. Second of all, it is less realistic than Rust. Rust is based on a post-nuclear war where there are old towns with radiation and bears and wolves and stuff. This however has many monsters which can make it both more fun and less fun.Going into gameplay. This game can be difficult because you need stone which involves going far from the beach and coming back so the stone spawns. That is the simplest way I have found to get stone (unless you have a hammer). The problem with this is that if you die you will have to find your stuff or start over. This means having no weapon. This makes it very difficult to get more stone to make a weapon. You must risk dying again to either get your stuff back or go far enough so all the stone respawns on the beach. Other than this the game is challenging but still fun.All around this is a good game for an early access game. I am hoping to see more things added as well as improvements to the game mechanics. I bought it while it was on sale for 10 dollars. I would not recommend buying it for the normal 25 dollars unless you just have money to throw around. It is a great game that I would recommend but not for 25 dollars. Wait until it goes on sale because it has frequent sales.			"

								I've been playing this a few months now, I have about 80 hours in the game, I think. This game is an alpha, it's fairly simple as far as what you can do.  Survival isn't hard if you choose to stay by the beach, but what's the fun in that?  Yesterday I traveled inland with a relatively new character and was swarmed by a wolfpack.  I'm sure I'm not the only person to ever experience that, but I'm lucky in that this is a game so I woke up on the beach again. Naked, collecting stones, and wishing for something tasty to eat and warm to wear.I'm seriously looking forward to watching the continuing development of the game, and to the content that likely will be added in the future.  I'm really hoping that my friends and I can use this software to create a persistent online world for ourselves.  Buy the game. It's on sale at the moment for the Steam Summer Sale, and a total bargain at the current price just for the promise it holds.			"

								I love this game,  the concept,  its unique,  its amazing.  But I accidentally joined a hostile server instead of a friendly one.  This game has a issue where your character is loaded into the world before you are fully loaded in.  Well I died before I even loaded in... I didn't even have a chance to fight back and about 45ish hours(First 20 or so was before a update that deleted everything) worth of my time gone.  This guy had the best stuff in the game and he was just farming people on the first island where everyone has to spawn.  He left my stuff alone he didn't want it and said I could have it back.  Then a guy with nothing but a sword comes kills me and puts my armor on and kills me repeatedly.  I recomend this game, it has so much going for it.  Don't make the mistake I made, I will not be playing this agian until this game has fixed the spawn issues.  It has almost killed me before and now its finally done it.  DEVS PLEASE make  the first island a safe zone so this doesn't happen and also PLEASE fix the loading.  I love the game, but I can't deal with those kinds of design flaws in a game.			"

								Been playing for a couple weeks now and love it.  Finally got the last achievement today.  I'm excited to see what additions and changes will come about. Great game!  I love it.Pros-It's a big island.  Lot's of space to roam and get lost.  Other than the coastal area, there are easier places to survive and harder places, with no clear lines on the ground to tell you which is which.  So there is always a sense of danger as  you explore that something bigger and badder than you will face you down.  I was pretty confident in my high end gear, strutting around like I owned the island.  Then got taken down by a large pack of wolves, and another time by a pair of bears.  In most cases there are a lack of cheat features that trivialize the intended difficulties.  No map that would instantly make the world smaller if you knew where you were, where you wanted to go and how to get there.  A compass that makes you re-learn how a primitive compass actually works.  No pause feature (at least not one built into the game for that purpose).  No instant health potions.  I appreciate the limited hand holding.  Cons- Which are more like personal suggestions on what might improve the game.  I thoroughly enjoy the game as it is and have 230 hours in the game already.A limited array of building options with no discernible difference between them other than look and material costs.  And no ability to customize, design your own, or furnish them. It's also difficult to build where you want to build.  So you end up wandering around while turning in circles to find just the right position where it will allow your building.  This means it isn't turned the way you want it or positioned in relation to your other buildings how you want it.  Several of the beasts/monsters have movement limitations that allow you to exploit them and avoid danger (low level skeletons and bears).  Packs of wolves can't always attack all at once.  Some of the wolves get stuck behind the others.  so you can take them on a couple at a time, which is significantly less dangerous.  When it works correctly they surround you and add orifices to your body. Some of the high end gear doesn't seem to last as long as the cost to maintain them is worth.  So I use a stone axe to chop trees and bushes because the higher end items seem to deplete just as quickly, can't be maintained out in the field without building a forge, and require a large amount materials that are very time consuming to gather.  So what I gained in chopping the tree down in two swings rather than the 8 it takes the stone axe, I more than lose when I have to mine for hours to get the materials I need, and either run to a forge or build one.  The other high end weapons are needed against the higher end monsters (or if you don't want to chase deer down to be able to kill them in one swing) so you are forced to do a lot mine grinding.  And that can get old.  I keep a set of high end gear in my bags while I use the mid grade gear that I can maintain in the field and without large amounts of mine grinding.   I understand the idea of keeping it more realistic by including wear and tear.  And that is needed for the low end beginning gear experience.  But part of achieving the high end gear should be either significantly more durable gear than it is, a drastic decrease in the materials needed to repair, or doing away with upkeep altogether.  No way to lock up your items.  You want to invite people to your world, but you don't want them to have free access to everything you have spent hours gathering.  Let me put a lock on my chest.  And if the world is set to hostile give them the ability to bust it open with some effort.  And in the same vain of thought, let me build defences for my buildings.  All in all, great game!			"

								I bought Savage Lands when it was on sale through the Steam Summer Sale for $10, and I would be happy to pay the full $20 or more that it costs now. While still in Early Access, Savage Lands has a lot to offer and is a game I would highly reccommend. I'll condense the selling points of the game into a pros and cons list:Pros:- Great graphics and landscape- A great survival experience- Savage Lands isn't big on hand holding, which is part of what drew me to the game. - Multiplayer is available, allowing you to play with friends, making the survival aspect just a little bit easier.- Even though it's still in Early Access, Savage Lands has a lot of content on the map to find and explore- and more is being added all of the time.- The Devs are very attentive to the player base. They respond to reviews, forum posts, and have weekly DevStreams every Thursday.- A variety of creatures can be found on the Sundered Isle, from the slow defiled skeletons to the terrifying Forest Giants. And more appear in the game all the time.Cons:- The PvP aspect still needs work- right now to kill most creatures you can stay behind and whack them with your sword without risk of retaliation. However, this is currently under work, as tweaks to creatures like the Forest Giants are being added to make them harder to kill.- If you're under attack by mobs- like Kur for example- and it looks like you're not going to make it out alive, all you have to do it exit the game and reload it, and all enemies will be gone. I'd like to see this fixed, as it makes getting out of sticky situations way too easy. Overall, I thouroughly enjoy this game and can't wait to see what updates will come our way next. 10/10			"

								So far I can say I am really enjoying the game. I enjoy the mix of Minecraft and Skyrim. The only thing that I could say takes away from the experience is the optimization. On the lowest settings I get an average 35-55 fps. It could be my PC but I can play much better looking games at higher settings and framerates. Other than that the game is fantastic. My friends and I enjoy hunting and exploring the world. Cannot wait for future updates and more content.			"

								I know it needs to hit the growth spurt...and hopefully, it will be worth it.  I didn't see a map option to make, but there's a compass?  It could use some hints on unlocking items, when I finally went through the journal, I saw long bow.  But it didn't tell me what I needed to find to unlock it.  Exited the game and went back in and it was unlcoked.Its fun, I find it better than that blocky 16-bit looking game the MS bought recently.  Content is lacking, but that'll surely change.Edit - I had a bit of an oddity, it was almost morning based on moon's position, but the sun was still out and setting.  It was great, visibility was awesome...until I encountered a plauged/diseased wolf and died.  I see alot of death in my future as I was carrying everything I had.			"

								I bought Savage Lands when it was on sale through the Steam Summer Sale for $10, and I would be happy to pay the full $20 or more that it costs now. While still in Early Access, Savage Lands has a lot to offer and is a game I would highly reccommend. I'll condense the selling points of the game into a pros and cons list:Pros:- Great graphics and landscape- A great survival experience- Savage Lands isn't big on hand holding, which is part of what drew me to the game. - Multiplayer is available, allowing you to play with friends, making the survival aspect just a little bit easier.- Even though it's still in Early Access, Savage Lands has a lot of content on the map to find and explore- and more is being added all of the time.- The Devs are very attentive to the player base. They respond to reviews, forum posts, and have weekly DevStreams every Thursday.- A variety of creatures can be found on the Sundered Isle, from the slow defiled skeletons to the terrifying Forest Giants. And more appear in the game all the time.Cons:- The PvP aspect still needs work- right now to kill most creatures you can stay behind and whack them with your sword without risk of retaliation. However, this is currently under work, as tweaks to creatures like the Forest Giants are being added to make them harder to kill.- If you're under attack by mobs- like Kur for example- and it looks like you're not going to make it out alive, all you have to do it exit the game and reload it, and all enemies will be gone. I'd like to see this fixed, as it makes getting out of sticky situations way too easy. Overall, I thouroughly enjoy this game and can't wait to see what updates will come our way next. 10/10			"

								While I have not played much of this game everything I have seen so far is great! The crafting system is easy to use, nothing is overly complicated like some other open world survival games. The character creation is awesome you can make your character whatever colour you want and when I say colour I mean it. You can play as a green hulk dude if you feel like it.Finally, the enemies are really cool. I personally like the fantasy feel it has to it as you fight skeletons, dragons and wood imp things over just clubbing normal animal predators like bears or something.All in all if you like fantasy and survival games like Rust or ARK definitely try this.

								I saw one of the developers describe this game perfectly in one sentence: ""You will die and you will die often.""In the little amount of time I've played Savage Lands, I've already been quite impressed with it. A respectably detailed environment, decent combat, a refreshing take on the gather-supplies-and-craft-things scenario we see all too often, and a beautifully harsh world that hints towards at least a moderate sense of realism.Given, I died and I died often. But through my inevitable deaths, I learned to better adapt to the unforgiving environment and survive.The enemies can be frightening at times, and the nights can be cold and long, but every minute I spent on the Sundered Isle was one of interest and fun. Even gathering supplies isn't dreadfully boring, like in many other games of a similar type.I spent a great deal of time exploring and fending off my camp from outsiders, while slowly gathering the supplies I needed to grow it, and felt a sense of accomplishment after having finished a building that took over an hour of game time and almost freezing to death to complete.I give Savage Lands 8/10, losing only a few points for the further depth it needs to the gameplay. But as far as early access games go, this one is awesome.			"

								This game is pretty good. Its hard in the begin when u start out but as soon as u figured out how stuff works its just a pretty relaxed game :D graphics are good, animations are a little simple but ok.It has a ingame timer that will show when the next patch will come out and devs are active on the forums.Its easy to host a game on your own computer to play coop with some buddies or pubs can join if u want and they are mostly friendly.You can also use your own character on other worlds. So first you make a character u gonna use then u join a world or create a world so u can still switch with your own character to other games with your gear on you.There is no levels or anything its just pure survival and trying to get better gear to kill stronger enemies or bigger packs of wolfs.The island is fairly big with only a few landmarks to find your way or with the use of a compass to navigate.All in all i payed 10 euros for this game and i enjoy it more then ARK at the moment and this game will be finished in 10-12 months so i am looking forward to what it will become, and i am looking forward slaying the epic dragon that screams and flies around the map i love it :Dthe game runs between 40-50 frames on my old i7 920 3.0ghz 18gb ram and a nvidia gtx560ti hawk edition which is pretty good performance			"

								Ok, Items to bring to a mysterious land....clothes check....and that's it! Yep that is how you start out. In just rags, but of course if you just look around you there are a plethora of things to be of good use. When you first start it really does feel like you just got thrown into the wild with just your wits. As you progress though you get better at gauging what you can and can't do. The first night can be a little stressful but not too terrible. Oh yeah the map is huge so be sure to build that compass before you start going far from your base camp. Bring some friends as it is dangerous to go alone! Sure it still needs some work and polish but it is early release. All and all I am looking forward as to what the future holds for this game.			"

								I do and do not recommend this game.As of right now in very early development this game is enough to keep you entertained for a couple weeks. The community is mostly friendly with very few trolls. The ability to keep pvp turned off keeps seperate those that are looking for a team environment and those that are just looking to see who can kill who first. However at this stage in development there is very little content and you will end game very quicly and get bored with it. For the current price it might be worth it to some to buy it now and put it on the shelf for a couple months because the devs really seem to be on track to making a great game. Pros:FunFriendlyGood gameplay for early developmentGood graphicsGood crafting systemNice survival systemChallenging when starting outCons:End game quickly (Within a couple weeks you will have top tier equipment and a full city)Resources don't respawnGame lags whenever a new player joins or some one leaves which can get you killedLimited variety of enemiesSmall map for a survival gameHuge plot hole (If im stuck on an island and i can build a huge town hall why can't i just build a boat?)So if the devs keep on track then this will be an awesome game. A bigger map some game play tweeks and some more content will make this a must have. In its current state if youre looking for a polished product then hold off for a while.			"

Overall, the game has a very good feel to it.I don't have any major complaints for this game that, at this point as an Early Access game, would be a dealbreaker and they're mostly asthetic complaints--the way that buildings sit on hills, etc; these are things that can be, and I'm sure will be, fixed easily.The minor complaints: * Hunger also seems to progress quickly, although I haven't tried to quantify it in any meaningful way; I shouldn't have to eat several pieces of meat during the night to stay alive, and* I shouldn't be in a perpetual quest for more cotton, which seems very scarce but very needed for bandages and cloth strips, and many times I will find a cotton bush only to have it drop zero cotton.Things that would be nice going forward:  * Being able to sleep part of the night away, say if you're full of food and in good health, * More content, * More monsters, * More crafting items, and * More building items such as walls, pike torches for some visual security at night, etc.			"

								Great early access survival game. I own four early access survival games and this one is the only one I plan on spending more time with as it develops. It's week 11 and the game is pretty stable and very playable which is a huge plus.It has Skyrim like aesthetics, a low fantasy setting, is mostly gear and item based for progression, along with bosses to find and slay. You maintain your own set of characters and can import them in and out of persistant worlds. This is very handy. You can play solo, or go on-line to play with other people when you want to.My only gripe is the mining system needs some love, along with improved combat. Adding third person perspective would really seal the deal with me.Looking forward to more updates.All around, if you're looking for a fantasy survival game th			"

								I found it a bit difficult to navigate as there were very sensitive mouse controls. However that may be able to be changed, I couldn't tell because it was lagging quite a lot on my laptop regardless of low quality settings. Will try again when I have upgraded RAM. However from what I played, I agree with what others say, pretty damn hard.Save lots because you will be reloading lots as well.			"

								this game has a lot of potential i would recommend it what i like the most is that you can chose what kind of server you can join form friendly to hostile. another thing is the crafting options. there are a lot of them i would like to see a cross bow added eventually. i would say the bow is a good weapon to use to take down the deer highly recommend crafting that first above anything else. all in all i am vary happy with the game i am looking forward to seeing how this game will turn out			"

								So straight up. It's good.Couple of things wrong with it are the simple bugs and stuff, like the hostile NPC's pathing when you get on a roof top. The dragon (Kur) is kinda a♥♥♥♥♥♥when he is always on you if you get a little too close to the tower. (seriously, took me 30 mins to gt him away from me after dying 10 times)Good side; crafting is very easy, no need for rare crafting benches or anything. The only rare things are the items to collect for crafting into weapons and armor, but of course, is the fun side of it, the satisfaction of when you grind the land for hours to finally get that last item to make OP gear.For an early game, it's quite enjoyable. It's fun and with the the ability to play along side friends, in such an early game, it's pretty awesome. Seeing this to become a fully completed game would be really good. (expecting some really good graphics and items in the long run)Not for all people, but it's worth a look.			"

								EDIT: This is a solid survival game, unlike many others on steam. Steady development team gives weekly updates to the beta, and the legacy version remains stable. Legacy is beautiful, but I feel I need to join the beta testing, I want to be part of the team and enjoy the updates :) Will update after testing the beta. Great game, sound engine is marvelous, surround sound works wonderfully, using dolby virtual surround with earphones makes this game the most imersive one I`ve ever played. You`ll feel like you`re out there, in the cold, fighting for survival against, first of all, a rough environment and, secondly, enemies that range from boars to skeletons and more. Great game to go solo or coop. Don`t mind this being EA, give it a try, you won`t regret it. PS. If you`re a bit concerned about this being a zombie game, no it isn`t. It is a survival game. You against nature. There are skeletons and zombie-like creatures, but they are definitely NOT the main aspect of the game. Must try.			"

								Great game very intresting also even with a early release, i felt like it was the full release and all i have to say is this game is totally worth buying every peny, at first you would really understand how to play but with a couple of tries you'll be a master, i had to make 2 worlds just to learn more about this hardcore survival game.Graphics are outsanding looks are wonderful and i must say again even for a early release.Gameplay mechanics are wonderful the game plays smooth although sometimes you might get occupied looking for stuff but thats only for the beginners, but it still tries to lead you with the tasks, if you played these type of games befor then its no problem for you.Map and details are outstanding although at first the map is kinda repetative and its the only biome i saw was snow biome but im haven't confirmed it so that won't count, although the map details are very nice and textured wonderfully makes you enjoy it with a great look.The beatiful sounds of this game makes you get hyped with what it has! truely wonderful, haha they even got the classical Buzzer sound when you do something wrong.Graphics 10/10 For its kind the rate 10/10 is the best for it!Gameplay 8.5/10 It's near perfect although sometimes it gets confusing...Map And Detail 10/10 This is far beyond my power to express it.Sound Effects & Music - 10/10 derpOfcourse i'm not saying this is a perfect game to other games, I'm saying this is a perfect game for its main catagorie which is survival.THIS IS  99% RECOMMENDED FOR ADVENTURES AND EARLY ACCESS TESTERS			"

Early Access Review
								I've had the game since 2015; it was a lot of fun early on and I'd have recommended it easily back then (I've a bit over 300 hours played).  Now I don't recommend it.  Simply read the curator reviews to see how it was - the vast majority are from 2015 and it had a great deal of promise back then.  I could go on about the bad AI pathing, the poor transitioning and staging in progress, how one can ignore most all of the gear and weapons, changes to food, how the grind fact has climbed while the community has disappeared (used to have a fairly large number of MP games going all the time - not anymore)...  Suffice it to say, they've done a lot of changes to things but not changes that have added much value to actually playing the game and have taken the bulk of the dev to a 'closed beta' format vs Early Access.  It honestly feels like an experiment for some designers to see what it's like to make a video game but without a real road map.  (1 big island, no - 3 islands, no - we'll merge 2 of them... 2 isn't bad but enough of the shuffeling around on this sh**.)  To me the ""run"" or ""destroy all"" twin modes of play (new area?  run from everything until geared then it's joke easy), coupled with the large amount of collection time, between different games (launch new, collect, return to 'main game', repeat until you have the stuff needed to advance), to get ANYTHING done as you progress, is just a bit much.

I see potential and alot of it within the boundaries of this game,Irregardless of the negativity I sought out in the first time I played the gameIt is indeed very intruiging to an extent as to how you go around building your character.Not only that but it being an early access game has great graphics, a good system on which your character is based.I haven't reached night time yet but I dread to find out what will happen in that case.But yeah, solid 10/10 for the game.Can't wait to get roped into it altogether and spending hours upon end playing. :)			"

								First, this game has a lot of promise. I hope that the devs are dedicated to see it through to its full potential. Overall, the game has a very good feel to it.I don't have any major complaints for this game that, at this point as an Early Access game, would be a dealbreaker and they're mostly asthetic complaints--the way that buildings sit on hills, etc; these are things that can be, and I'm sure will be, fixed easily.The minor complaints: * Hunger also seems to progress quickly, although I haven't tried to quantify it in any meaningful way; I shouldn't have to eat several pieces of meat during the night to stay alive, and* I shouldn't be in a perpetual quest for more cotton, which seems very scarce but very needed for bandages and cloth strips, and many times I will find a cotton bush only to have it drop zero cotton.Things that would be nice going forward:  * Being able to sleep part of the night away, say if you're full of food and in good health, * More content, * More monsters, * More crafting items, and * More building items such as walls, pike torches for some visual security at night, etc.			"

								Joining a Hostile-mode server, loading screen, loading still in progress when I get killed loosing all my items. Yes, you can get killed while staring at the loading screen.Joining a Friendly-mode server, 1 minute there, BAN. Happened to me twice. Probably they did not like my naked willy dangling between my legs. Yes, your character starts completely naked.More cons:- game looks very cheap graphics-wise. UI wise, music-wise, everything-wise.- it lacks any atmosphere, e.g. feeling of cold in Kholat game is intense. Here it is not- most creatures die after one or two hits and are not very dangerous. But - there is no animation of creatures attacking you, they are only running hence and forth, even disappearing and reappearing sometimes. You only hear a sound meaning you got wounded and you hear it with a delay of 1 second or so. Wonderful.- the video on Steam store page is well made, the game isn't. Do not get deceived by it			"

								This game is far from complete, but right now it is very playable with or without friends. Stay away from the tower, food is the most important, and don't go out at night (you will be ♥♥♥♥ed by wolves). The hit boxes are a bit wonky, but that is really as far as the major improvements should be. Crafting is good and feels solid. Combat is a bit frustrating, with dodges that don't work sometimes.

								As of 5-1-2016: Clunky clunky as H-E-Double-Hockey-Sticks. Get past that and you'll find something VERY satisfying. I'm giving this a positive review so I'll start with the cons. Let me start off by saying I was playing PVE and opened my server to multiplayer for anyone to join. Cons:* Overall SERIOUS lack of polish. (but I played it when it first launched in EA... Now, a few months later I don't even recognize the game it's so much better.)* Clunky controls (however, WASD is present. Keys arent clunky, the feel is.)* No Female avatar (thus my wife doesn't want to play)Pros* Survival FEELS like surviving.* This is the ONLY Survival game where I felt ""Home"" meant something. Where I was HAPPY to sit by MY fire.* Gathering is pretty satisfying.* Items don't de-spawn if dropped on ground (in other games I wouldn't care, but in early game, space is SERIOUSLY limited.* Monsters can be REALLY dangerous. (Something lacking in most survival PVE)This brings me to my last Pro, which deserves a catatgory of its own.Two time's I've played. Months ago and now. BOTH times I met AWESOME person after AWESOME person. Everyone I met was SO generous. They would pop in, toss down a bunch of stuff, warm themself by my fire for a while, chatting... and then leave.If the community manages to stay this pleasant this game MAY become the ""PVEer's Survival game"".10/10 Would chat by the fire again.

								I read alot of the reviews before buying this. Slow and buggy I expect, and certainly don't mind it being part of the experience of playing an early access game. The only thing that lets this down in my opinion, and is the sole reason of 2 extremely frustrated and premature game session endings is that bloody dragon! Fair enough I expected Savage - but why have a mob, that you can't really outrun or fight against right at the begining that likes to pop off it's perch every few minuntes and fry you? You get a heatbeat or two of warning (if you're lucky) with the sound of its wings before being engulfed in flames! If it was every now and again I could accept it's part of the feel of the game to constantly be afraid, but the fact its every 5-6 minutes and nearly all but a few times ends in a death just makes the playing experience entirely unenjoyable. Of the few hours played I've died over a dozen times becuase of the dragon. The one and only time I didnt die becuase of the dragon was from a wolf, which joined in the chase as I was running around a big rock away from the bloody dragon!! I loved the concept of this game and really, really wanted to spend hours enjoying it. I like difficult, I expected far less help  and hand holding than the game actually gives. I enjoy long resource gathering and working towards building something that took alot of effort. What I really don't enjoy and makes the game unplayable for me is the fact its effectively time barring your character to a set few minutes before certain death, respawn, run back to corpse to get gear, crack on for another few minutes before certain death! That's just not enjoyable! Maybe I'm being harsh and I've missed something? Maybe if I stuck at it through another dozen deaths to build something than doesn't burn that I could run into until the dragon gets bored? Maybe a bit further on, or alot more practice with a bow and arrow would rid me of the sodding dragon? But do I want to continue through that frustration in my time when I'm meant to be enjoying myself? Not really! Its for that reason alone I feel I have to give this a 'no' on the recommend at the moment. If there was a ""I like the game but can't recommend becuase of a bloody dragon"" button, I'd select that instead!			"

								EDITED EDITED:Is it the DayZ of Skyrim? Or is it the open world Dark Souls where you craft your own gear? Perhaps you are looking for a game like The Forest with functioning multiplayer for up to 7 friends? Whatever it is, its cold. Its cold all the time.Very very good so far at this time of early access - everything works. You can play alone but its a fun co-op adventure and super easy to get started. You can make a server right from the start menu, make it PVP or PVE, and make it public or private. The first map is an open world island and if you wander too far too soon, you will be crushed. The beta map by comparison is more attractive but more structured. I dont feel the same fear of leaving the beach, but its going to make a great single player or coop adventure. Theres now one spawn so I dont know how that will work for multiplayer pvp, maybe they will keep both maps? Overall the new map design is smart because it will draw more players than just the hardcore survival crowd.The super active devs are constantly changing and adding things so who who knows where it goes?It is an adventure itself watching the game evolve. In a good way!Regardless it is still a crafting-survival-inventory management adventure that I enjoy.			"

								I have about 10 hours into this game and I honestly feel like I've barely scratched the surface as far as what this game has to offer.  Crafting and building is a bit of a grind specifically when you throw in the survival aspects of the game. But its challenging in a fun way. Being an early access game it has a ton of potential going forward as long as the developers keep plugging away. The release patches weekly so that's good. Overall fun game to play solo haven't played multiplayer yet.			"

								Savage Lands (Osiris Review)These guidelines being covered- Playing- Contact With Developers- Gameplay Opinion- If you should buy it or not?1.         This game when I was playing kind of made me feel like this, Oh god another early access game that's good probably the developers don't even care like the last ones. I was blown away on one Thursday, I decided, Hey why don't I stop being a scrooge? Well. I did and the stream surprised me, Instead of devs just talking about their game, They were talking to people in the stream, They acted like your average gamer and it really surprised me because they had heart for their game instead of being like boring and wanting money, They wanted the experience of meeting different people. They were very open about questions and didn't really hide much from the players. They even opened up a server which everyone wanted to join but sadly it got full and some people got sad, So I decided to be nice in said stream and give the studio games to hand out to people. But the game's community and playing is very very fun, Quite excellent in fact. Let's get into it shall we?2.       The contact with the developers is very very open, They are just gamers with a developing studio practically. They created a great game in the past but they just show what game industry should be. Don't be afraid to help them out by going on their community or their streams and ask questions. They are very kind!3.        My opinion on gameplay is the fact it's changing every aspect of a normal RPG, This game brought a new context to fantasy, Realistic Fantasy. This showed how one would survive in a harsh fantasy world and try to be a great warrior at the same time. Just trying to make a living on the isle. It created it's own new genre, It's a survival fantasy game. It's savage lands. It's own thing. The best way to describe it fully is get the game, It is worth the price! It is worth the fun! It is hard but playing with friends who have just makes it better. Now the cons in my opinion I hate. This game is still be worked on but heres the thing I have an issue with.. It's some of the multiplayer bugs and the voice chat. Trust me the voice chat literally sounds like Darth Vader had the voice of Sean Connery. It's bad but it will be fixed hopefully. But the game overall gets my seal of approval. The Osiris Badass Award.4. Should you buy it or not?        Well if you like these kind of games YES! Unlike most early access games it is actually a very fair price, They gotta make money for it's development but they show they do care. They will make your dollar worth more every Thursday, They usually release updates every Thursday too! They tell you about upcoming ones as well! But it's worth buying if you have the money. It is a bunch of fun and scary. It has regained trust for me for early access games. This game personally helped me through some dark times by making me feel better. It's given me fun memories for me and my friends. It was a game I've been waiting for personally and it's here. This game is a worth to try and you will not regret once you see what your up againest. I won't spoil everything. You gotta play for yourself to truly know savage lands. That's my reviewBy Osiris Bragindine (Niko)			"

								So far this game is basic, however the premis the game being based solely on survial is awesome. It would be better if you could see the enemies health bar and if you could stack more items together. The graphics and the gameplay is good, it reminds me of Elder Scrolls trilogy with very different objectives. So far so good, but I hope improves more; thankfully is only beta for now!			"

								Have spent a few hours on this so far. Liking the idea. Almost brings back a diablo feel, but in fps style. Definitely needs a lot more items, a dragon that actually fights, maybe some areas where rare monsters spawn, perhaps magic items that you can make from getting items from rare monsters. This game is early ofcourse. It feels empty at the moment, but that emptiness is just an opportunity to add so much more. Food definitely runs out a bit too quick in this. Very keen to see where this idea goes.			"

								Bought the 4 pack for me and my friends to give it a shot, not one of us managed to enjoy it. That said i highly recommend you purchase the game and try it for yourself. Everyone has different tastes and making an informed decision on wether or not YOU enjoy it will be up to you. With steams refund policy you dont even have to risk wasting money if you dont enjoy it within the first hour you wont in the second and youll be able to decide wether or not you want to refund it, OR like myself if you think these devs are great and want to leave your money invested in the project in hopes of it becoming what people say it may I highly recommend doing so as too many great ideas with tons of potential have failed through early access by players abandoning games well before they ever make it to the light of day. I will leave my review positive untill the final release at which point i will edit to reflect the final projects content.Happy hunting			"

								Okay so I'm not very good at reviews but heres my thought on the game, it has potential, at the moment it doesnt have that much for a £10 game, so I would advise getting it while it is on sale.Pros:Fun multiplayerGot to make sure your warm and fed or you will dieA range of difficult monstersCrafting and nice looking buildingsCons:Multiplayer can be laggySome monsters are easy to predict and are slowNot many bosses and some locked locations at the momentHouses are expensive and some seem useless unless you have a big communityWhats it about/what could they add?Well from my experience you start on an island which is full of wrecked places, there's plenty of resources as long as you know where to look, food can be caught from traps or from hunting, you also need to make sure you don't freeze which is a good idea as it is a frozen wasteland, theres also notes you can collect so my guess is there might be a quest system later and it would be interesting if you could restore some of the places and NPC's join and you have a town full of NPc's and your friends/randomers.

								This game a very very harsh and amazing game with no map and no help its very hard to survive. but still its a VERY fun game. Even though theres glitches and stuff it doesent mean theres nothing to do. Fighting ""Forest Giants"" and ""Dire Bears"" is a very satisfying experiance and a very refreshing one at that from the normal Walker Zombie. Its Style is a hybrid between RPG and Survival or... D&D and The Forest. theres alot of content in the works and the devs are very active unlike other early access games...*cough *cough (The Fifth Day) *cough *cough. Over All I give it a...*Drum Roll... 8.6/10    Note. this is for what it like now when its done its going to probily be a 10/10Edit:I WIll Keep Editing This Review Over Time As The Game Gets Better :)			"

Early Access Review
								I played most of my in-game hours in mid-2015, it seemed bare bones and awkward then, but had (has) potential. It's still EA - so it will probably improve. Come late 2016...still clunky interface, twitchy mouse etc....but easy fixes, however easy fixes that still haven't been fixed. The world itself though feels somehow contrived and fake, graphics are ok but not mind blowing. Wildlife list is excruciatingly slowly expanding but still very limited. Having returned to the game after 12+ months away I was standing on beach near spawn point, took literally 10 seconds to look at the interface book thing to see what I can do and was killed by a boar before I could craft anything or see what was even possible to do. Respawn, same spot, open menu to see if I can find what is needed to craft a weapon - killed by a wolf or something under 20 seconds from spawn time. Respawn, decide trying to understand what the hell I can do or make is a fatal error at this point so I walk along beach following a couple of markers to a burned out ruined building 200 metres away when the game's resident dragon comes along before I even made a sweep around the remains of one building.......closed game and went back to ARK which has been on EA for half the time, is much more graphically appealing (not sure if ARK has more content as I still don't know what was in my mysterious SL book) and gives the noob on the beach at least a couple of minutes to discover his/her character and a few capabilities.Long and the short of it.....don't p**s off your customers as soon as they walk in the door.

								Its a trip into an emersive cold environment that sucks you in to a fight for your life. Very Very challenging this quest is not for the faint of heart. Given only a weak axe, bag of food, some tattered clothes, and some rocks you must use these devices to help you survive the best you can. Youre enemies are the bitter cold, lack of food, and ferrocious enemies that want to crush you any way they can.If you love titles such as stranded deep, the forest, subnautica, and the long dark this is a title you have got to add to your library. Be aware this game will cause frustration!P.S. this game is like a Dark Souls and The forest hybrid. I love this game and though it will not be easy to survive, I HIGHLY recomend you dive in and do all you can to survive either alone or online with friends			"

								Alright, so I played this game for a moment and I don't believe it's playable at this point. My experience looked like this. I spawned in snowy land that looked like a pre pre pre alpha of skyrim (with some dragon skeletons included) and two guys far away from me, doing some more advance stuff. As I was going to meet them, something exploded (no idea what) and took 90% of my hp. Then I saw a bear doing the sickest break dance (spinning on his back, doing somersaults all at the same time) and as I was trying to kill it, he sunk into the ground. So for now this game gets points for dancig bear. Pick it up on sale and check it out.  "

								Well I have to say. The game is pretty easy when I saw the game name I thought it will be harder.But when I woke up.And do all the stuff to prepare for night.Well the night was pretty boring because I thought the skeletons will come but I was wrong.The game is pretty easy when you are on the first island.And its almost same on the sec. island.Well and the mobs.. Well their path finding kinda sucks so that makes the game kinda boring. Because when I wanted to defeat first boss ""Lord Kruul"" he was standing still and he did nothing to me.I dont say the game concept is bad.But needs to be fixed.Like path finding or animals which are stucked in fence.But I still hope the devs will do something about it.

								For early access savage lands is a brilliant game in my opinion. I'll start by saying its harrowingly difficult single player i recommend tell your friends to buy it and work together or if your friends aren't interested join a multiplayer server they helped get my character basic armour and that type of thing. As i've said it can and will kill you at first but don't be disheartened and remember its early access so bugs will be here and there.			"

Early Access Review
								I have written relatively few reviews for games but felt that a review for this game was warranted.PROS:-Extremely atmospheric. The transition between day and night along with the weather effects develops a sense of extreme phobia (Have I stocked enough wood and flint to maintain my fires throughout the night... do I have enough bandages?). Furthemore the music compliments the gameplay extremely well.-Crafting system is fleshed out and makes sense.-Mining system is unique and not voxel based (like mine craft). -Plays extremely smoothly on my computer on full settings, very beautiful gameCONS: - Jumping is practically useless - I noticed some graphical glitches. For example I bult a stone house and if i walk up to the wall of the house I will clip through and see outside.- Killing deer is a ♥♥♥♥♥ without a bow, you end up having to chase the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s all across the map and hit them once....extremely annoying.- Building shelters is extremely fun ,but the lack of options to build your base are few....- Enemy AI. Although I have not progressed extremely far into the game, I noticed that if you are one on one against a skeleton or a pack of dogs) it is easy to dispatch them by circling around them and hitting.SUGGESTIONS:- A rudimentary map system... that reveals itself as you explore. This can be established via a logbook that your character draws in or some form...otherwise it is extremely easy to get lost and lose where your base is at. If this is not the way to do it, at least allow for the placement of markers on the ground so you can find your way back.- No walls or fortifications for your base . . . If my team and I decide to permanently make a location our base of operations, it just makes sense to have wooden or stone walls developed (with guard towers if possible) so that we have a safe place to defend.... This would make the game that much more immersive-Traps! If no foritifactions let us at least develop traps to lure enemies into (such as the infamous pungie pits)... this would bring a level of strategy to the game that is otherwise missing.... -You mentioned on the most recent stream the plan to incorporate a system of blocking with a shield... it would be nice to also use your shield to bash and stun an enemy....- It would be nice to have caverns and caves in the game (if not already incorporated). A relatively small recessed cave could be used as a great base. Also exploring dank, dark caves would just add to the immersion of the game.- There is a neat system for hunger and cold in the game, but no system for water.  As anyone who is halfway intelligent knows, a person can last a while without food (even if they are starving) but without water, you are as good as dead... so incorporating a thirst system would be awesome!- The current building system is neat, but how about expanding it? For example, the current Stone House building, once finished, has a torch on the inside that you can light (when adding the materials to it)... The system is already there so how about we expand on the house we already built. Make it larger, add a second floor, add a well for drawing water (see aformentioned request for a water system). "

								I love to play this game to late night with my bro just a very good survival game with great adventure like gameplay. Every update makes the game more lovely. Better optimisation and less glitches every update, devs are working hard and I wish all survival devs where like them. I think there might be more spawn of ores tho. And sometimes when you kill a boar you can't loot it (not a big problem since boars are everywhere) and the game needs more spawn of cotton in random areas (there are cotton farms but still..) and I hope server lags and frame drops will be fixed. THIS GAME IS ADDICTIVELY AWESOME 8.9/10 :D			"

								I purchased Savage Lands more than a year ago and enjoyed playing the content it had back then, even if it was very early-access-ish without too much content. But it had potential, being a quite difficult game set in a harsh world and I liked it.Since then I didn't play any of it. Starting it up again today (on a different account) really surprised me, in a positive way. The amount of content the developers added over all this time is quite impressive and the game was improved a lot, especially gameplay-wise. The multiplayer is a lot of fun and it's extremely satisfying to adventure, fight, build and survive together.I still think Savage Lands has a lot of potential, which it hasn't reached yet, and it's a long way until it gets close. The big plus is it standing out from the other survival games, as long as it sticks to it's mood and doesn't try to become easier/more mainsteam. Nevertheless, the devs definitely have to work a lot to improve it's current state and status in the gaming community. In my opinion, they are headed in the right direction.			"

								Although my hours are short I've really enjoyed this game both Solo and with Multiple others. I can see a lot of promise with Savage Lands in the near future. Although a few things I would enjoy seeing added in future patches:-Stone Walls (2 Wood Logs, 15 Stone) : Half the players height; is jumpable and destroyable. -More Buildings/structures (Make a village) or have the look of the model slight change in shape. -Weapons on toolbelt/hotkeys visible on player models i.e 1st 1H Sword is shown at side in hilt. Tools or other weapons are crossed on back, etc. -Ability to block with weapons.-More Armour for every ""level"" of resources.			"

								The game is still very young, but shows so much promise!Review time is 4/17.The game is great with some friends, is difficult but fun.  It doesn't walk you through a tutorial so checking out forum discussions to understand things is important at this time.  If you find a monster, odds are that the first few times you see it, it's gonna mess you up good!  The progression of buildings and weapons/armor feels rather natural, even this early on.  You will quickly learn the importance of shelter, especially at night.  Even with a limited amount of progression that you can make at this point in time of the game, it is very good at consuming your time.If you like open-world sandbox survival games with serious enemies, pick it up and watch it develop!

								don't review games much,,, because reviewing games is like interpreting someones   delusiions.... ya gets what ya pays for,,, I like this game.. First crafting survival game I have played... bout 7 hours of play time..pros: New game- And very dirfrent, initially, there is a little hand holding that gives you a vey simple and safe opportunity to craft:  a fire place and a lean two;; you find an axe, chop down a couple of trees, collect some stone,, and then kill two  deer,, then you are pretty much on your own... I have not seen a map,      Environment: looks good, appears to be very Nordic,,, I have not played skyrim,, but looks similar, a little.. Picture an icelandic coast with snow squalls, wind and distant mountains,,,, appears to be wide open, not at all linear,, Haven't progressed much because i keep on dying,,, skelteons, not a problem it the wolves and other carnivores...speaking of dying, as of yet, the game does not support   a save mechanism.. you die, you respawn back on the coast: Naked, the respawn provides a bright red skull you are able to follow back to your corpes.... Problem, by the time you make it back to your body most times you wiill freeze to  death or die in a wolf attack... I have died bout 5 times ..Graphics: look good,,, I get some frame stutter,,,have been fooling around with the settings,,, I have an 8 core processor  running at 3.4, 16 gigs of 2400 ram, Asus 370 Strix 4 gigs.. so, don't think its my hardware   Exploration: this game is not a back yard barberque sim... It is SURVIVAL.  You sit you die, you don't chop wood, you die, you don't hunt and gather, you die...you cook all your meat, you hunt your meat,, Cave man meets the stoneage sim.    Inventory is a bit of a learning cure,,, crafting seems easy, eveything you have you either find or make,, Recommend: BUY IT,,, and get yer caveman on, remember it's only a game,,, beats siting in LA traffic or shoveling snow or counting the days to next ChristmasBetter than donkey kong and pitfall,,,			"

								This game is tough. It throws you into a cold world, and immediately you have to find a place to keep warm.Starting out blind, this game can be really brutal. I started fresh in the early days of Savage Lands, and it's only grown and become more in depth. There's no doubt starting out is now tougher in the updated game.Though my experience with the game, it's pretty solid. I don't really encounter too many bugs, and I've personally never crashed. Even when I do find a bug, it has never once felt game breaking.Savage Lands is packed with content in it's current state: teired gear, interesting loot, quite a few enemy types, mid and end-game bosses. You could easily get quite a few hours trying to discover the lore, and find those rarer items needed for that end-game gear to defeat the dragon.The developers are active with this game and involve the community. They host development livestreams where you can ask question and preview new features. I personally really enjoy the streams.The game has come such a long way since I first began playing, and I cannot wait to see what it becomes.			"

								Okay, so after playing about 30 minutes I realized this game has really amazing potential. I want to give some constructive critisism. It seems like all open world survival games have the same thing in common: THEY'RE REALLY GLITCHY/CHEESY (in the graphics of course.) I think they should take the time and make the player move and jump and interact in a more realistic way. I love the building and all that. I think they should also have a tutorial or something. I had to look up where to find things. I just think this game is pretty fun. It could be made into something really amazing!!! (UPDATE: Add some snares and maybe some bunny rabbits and you can catch them with the snares. Make a better way for hunting and getting food easier from the start. There! :D)			"

Early Access Review
								***EDITAfter discussion with Kevin from Signal who reassures me that food is being rebalanced soon and managing to successfully build a wooden shack in a reasonable amount of time (now with full access to its interior) I'm feeling a lot more positive about the future of the game. Things are definitely being worked on and that is one of the most reassuring things in an EA game.It is still needing more development, but if you are willing to deal with rapidly-changing gameplay and the usual woes and uncertainties of Early Access and if you like a challenging survival game, I do recommend Savage Lands. Those lands really are quite savage, but they are beautiful too.END OF EDIT***I find Savage Lands to be be strangely frustrating. I play single player and the difficulty is punishing. I'm glad that there is finally a health bar for enemies, but overall I think that I enjoyed the game more a year ago than I do now.The new map is attractive and the graphics are good, but starting out is now even harder. I played for a few hours today and my little dude, Amy*, needs to eat about 5 pigs a day, just to not starve to death. Amy apparently has an amazing metabolism, perhaps it's the cold climate. Chopping down a tree with low level tools now takes 4 times as long as before and pretty much destroys the axe after 1 tree. I'm not sure if it's been fixed yet, but the last time I tried building a house (which took ages what with the slow chopping and the rapidly disintegrating axes) I couldn't actually get inside it, because the doorway was too small. So now I am spending an excruciatingly long time building a stone house. Apparently, they are easier to enter. I sure hope so.I frequently get a bug that makes it so that the crafting recipe for an item only appears if I don't have the materials in my inventory, making crafting things a right pain in the posterior. Relogging does fix it temporarily, but it's really frustrating.Getting cold reduces the health bar, but warming back up doesn't allow the lost health to regenerate. So I try to only eat when near a fire so that I can restore the lost health and frankly, it's just another annoyance. As soon as you walk away from your fire you are becoming injured by cold.There are plenty of updates and the game is still in active development, unfortunately the development feels somewhat chaotic and it's very difficult to find up-to-date info on anything.I would love to explore further and see more of the world and possibly it would be a whole lot more fun with a group of friends, but the way that I am feeling right now is that I cannot recommend it in its current state. Hopefully, one day things will feel more balanced and less buggy, but I suspect that the developers are focused more on creating the game that they want to play, rather than the game that I want to play, which is of course their prerogative, but I cannot recommend a game that I'm not really enjoying playing.*My little dude is called Amy, in honour of the fact that I cannot play as a female character.

								Savage Lands is a lovely open-world sandbox survival game with a sizeable map, good crafting system, decent amount of weapons and armor, and several creatures to fight and kill.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this is an early access game so garden variety bugs and glitches do occur  (none of them gamebreaking).PROS:-Items don't despawn, so you can drop an item and it will stay there (seemingly) forever-Night/Day Cycle: allows for longer days than nights, so you can get more mining and hunting done in the daylight hours when it's safer-Map: quite large, albeit somewhat difficult to navigate at first (the compass helps a lot)-Crafting: lots of crafting options for several seperate sets of armor, several weapons, and a few buildings-Weather: snowstorms really add to the survival aspect of the game because you can die of exposure very quickly if not well equipped, especially when compounded with being in the world at night CONS:-Tbh, there really aren't many other than the run of the mill EA bugs What I'd Like to See:-In game map (again, the compass helps, but the community-made map has helped me out quite a bit)-More enemies, creatures, weapons, armor, buildings, crafting options, etc.  Beacause the game is EA, I surmise we will be seeing the majority of these gaming aspects in the (hopefully) near future.I'm very much enjoying this game and I can't wait to see where the game goes from here!!!Also to the Devs: Thank you so much for making such a fun game for both pc and mac, for they are few and far between on mac.

								For early access, this game is a bundle of fun. I had the joy of learning how to play with a friend by my side in a private server. Surviving can be tough, but that's the beauty of it; It's a challenge. We completely leveled a large part of the forest just to built a Town Hall, but then used the huge, unmissable open space to build more houses on. He builds, I go hunting for food and rare items. It just works.I don't like that when you build, the buildings can be hovering off the ground in the corners. Maybe make it possible to level the floor like in the other villages? Something I'd like to see in the future is us being able to grow things.I rate this game 9/10.Great game so far. Keep up the good work!			"

								(beta review) This was my favorite game for some time... got my money's worth in classic branch of the Beta.   If you like first person open world survival games, I'd recommend, but suggest switching to the classic channel at least unless/untill major improvements are made in optimization on the newer build which became unplayable to me even after upgrading my computer.  Frame rates when dueling gets down to un-playable leves with deadly battle lag.  Good story, mechanics, etc.  With the complete re-build in a new engine half way through the game beta, maybe this should have been 2 separate games?  If devs ever get the new build more playable  (I'm Linux with i7 3770s, 16Gig ram, Nvidia GTX-1050Ti) I'll honestly feel like I got 2 games for the price of 1.			"

								An amazing break from the ordinary as far as survival sandbox games go. Before going to far into yes, the game is Early Access, and yes, there are some bugs, (deer twitching around in areas with a high tree density, two packs of wolves travelling on top of each other for a total of 8 etc) but none of them are game breaking IMO.    Too many survival sandbox games have popped up promising a lot and offering so little. If you are like me at all and want a sandbox game in which you dont have to worry about mobs of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥killing you at spawn (DayZ, Nether, Ark, Rust, and any other game in which you spawn on a beach) or those same mobs of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥breaking into your house when youre gone due to real life responsibilities and robbing you of 10s of hours then this is a game for you. The community is great as far as i can tell, in the time that i have played i have had no issues with griefers or trolls. The game in itself is amazing, a huge map to explore, diverse amount and types of enemies to kill and be killed by. Building system similiar to the forest, which works just fine IMO  Crafting system is pretty fantastic as well, well a good amount of armour and weapons to craft, lots of storage options.And the game is updated on a fairly regular basis.    Also easy to connect to and play with friendsI really hope the game continues at its current pace, as this game has, on its own, restored my faith in the Steam EA program                                                                                      10/10 Would get lost, freeze, bleed, and burn to death again			"

								Great game! One of the very few survival games today that isn't filled with game-breaking bugs, and doesn't have the same  gameplay as the previous games. The game requires you to be patient while you're hunting, crafting and doing your best to survive in the wilderness against many (scary) creatures. Definitely recommended for survival fans who are (like myself) tired of seeing games with potential get ruined because of lazy developers. The devs in this game are active every day, and provide you specific details on when the next update will be available, bringing even more and more content to the table to prevent you from boredom. They are extremely kind and do their best to get this game out of early access and make it a damn good survival game. Great job on this one :)!			"

								Updated Review:They introduce bugs into the game right before going live, then they put the game on hold while they do a different project, leaving players with a broken/unfinished game, all the while leading players on, saying they will come back to fix/finish it later.  Thanks for taking my money and giving me... this.  And just to be clear, I am not really thankful.  I feel I have to explain this since I do not trust the devs have the intelligence to read the sarcasm in that statement since they thought it wise to treat their customer/fanbase this way.Try a different sandbox survival game instead, like 7 days to die, or pretty much ANY other game.Original Review:A dragon that keeps spawn-killing me over and over = time to play a different game.  The game was fun before this, now it is pretty much unlpayable.			"

								---ALPHA ALPHA ALPHA---1. Dead (Frost death)2. Ahaaa.... I need a campfire, but it goes off after while ... Need to gather all the rocks, flint and logs AGAIN :) - Death3. Temparature is good - starvation - dears. killed one - 3 sceleton notice my smell from underarm... fast i grab some baby wet tissue - too late. death4. Where am I ? where is my campfire, leanto, ... all gone?. Cant be,... running like hell, hell what? Death again.5. Hmm... water, must be some fish inside. Cold, i am soo cold. Death again.I think this game, is hard to play but hard is fun. Pros:-Crafting-Hit Box is good-Survival (you can die from beeing cold, wounds, starvation...)-Dragons, wolfs, skeletons and other creatures...Cons:-sounds-environment (single one)-Fighting animations -Skeleton animation ( they are funny not scary)-Leanto (basic sheter need sinew(need to hunt animals for it) house needs only wood logs and stick -why building leanto than?Well the game is worth to be suported, it has a potencial to become a good game, but it needs a lot of work. Price -40% right now is good. Whole price is too much for a game in that stage.  "

								Loaded in with 2 friends to play. Not played solo, however it's a GREAT game while playing with friends. Started off building our little village. Was great working together, one on deforesting the area, one mining and one hunting. Got ourselves built up fairly well, running around to keep each other alive as we had to push further to mine. Once we reached a point where our equipment was fairly strong we began exploring. Spent a day preparing, repearing our equpiment, hunting for food and farming the essentials to keep ourselves alive. Started travelling through the day and setting up camp during the nights. Was real fun having to plan for each day, fighting to keep each other alive and travelling the island. Watched a few dev streams and happy to see there's still a lot of ideas and work being put in to the game. Loving the game now and excited to see what happens in the future. Edit: Watching dev stream now. My first decision on this game was to run out in to the forest naked... the dragon got me. Loved it! :D			"

								Upon reading everyones comments on how hard this game is and that they didn't like it I was unsure if I should get it. I got it in a bundle so I got to give it a try. Yes, this game can be relentlessy hard. Most notably would be the fact that you starve so quickly. However, I still was able to enjoy this game. It's definitely better with a friend, but is playable on your own. All the enemies so far have been easy to defeat. You just have to learn there attacks and all of them are slow. It is a slow game at first since you have very little inventory, but once you craft some bags that issue goes away. I get people being frustrated by the difficulty, but I like that it is challenging. Of course there are things that need to be fixed, but thats normal with all early axxess games. If you do decide to get this game don't be deterred by how hard it might be at the start. Once you get passed that point and get a small base and good items crafted it gets better and funner.			"

								10/10 survival game if you're no stranger to the genre. I have no frame issues besides when using portals and the difficulty ramp is excellent. Had no issues with terminator dragons or spawn camping rabid wolves and ultimately have enjoyed every moment of this game. My only recommendation to anyone looking to purchase this is to get a buddy along for the ride. Solo can be a bit slow and thus unenjoyable at the beginning.			"

								Paid 1$ for it on Humble Bundle, cant say it wasnt worth it. Its definitely a game that has promise if the devs keep putting work into it.Crafting is difficult to get into, but pretty easy when understood.Surviving isnt as difficult as people say it is, although sometimes I do forget to eat and have to panic chase some animal to survive.Other than that its pretty fun, even if you have no friends to play it with.Only con is that it feels poorly optimized, but that shouldnt be a problem for most people.

								I haven't played much at all, but because this is an early release I will not say anything too bad.I like the setup but It's really lonely at first, I was exploring a bit and I have yet to find any thing but I small pre-made camp and a few deer.The water so fat looks like clear jelly and the walking sounds are very unrealistic (I'm pretty sure they'll fix it)The landscape is very primative with no roads, cities or even towns.No one to trade with, and I've only come across few pieces of marierial that was on the beach.I ran into a skeleton which with a rock took roughly 14 hits to kill, then loot.I'm not sure whether to reccomend or not, so I'll just say this.It's nothing like skyrim except for the graphic details and you will not find things easily.You don't customize the character and there is no gender choosing so If that's an issue don't get this game.I know it will get much better but untill then I wouldn't play.

Early Access Review
								To clarify this for people looking to buy the game, read below.1. The game has a solid amount of content for its current status. Even when you've crafted the best armour in the game, there are still bosses and monsters for you to hunt to get even stronger weapons. There are a few bosses to fight, including a dragon which is best fought with a ton of preparation, team work and time. He's not easy to kill, with a massive HP pool and enough damage to drop you and your party in seconds without proper preparation. The world is fairly large, and somewhat unsafe to travel through alone. This game is best played and enjoyed with friends.2. This isn't as free-form as some other sandbox games, where architecture and building is a big part of the gaming experience. This game focuses more on the survival aspect and conquering the environment around you as you slowly build up your character through crafting new armor and weapons. There are structures you can build, some of which are incredibly important, some that are literally useless. Once you play the game for an hour or so, you'll understand why building structures doesn't really take away from the game's experience.3. The combat is good. Could be better, but it gets the job done in a non-frustrating way. Blocking is something that could be added to make it a more skilled experience overall. PvP could be a great aspect of this game if there were some minor tweaks done to the combat. 4. This game is well optimized (graphically speaking) and incredibly atmospheric. You may find yourself stopping to just look around at the harsh snow, fog, sun rays piercing through the vegetation or even the deer you're about to hunt just stroll through the woods peacefully. Best played with headphones. Overall, the game is satisfying, and definitely worth the price. It could use a bit more content to fill the large landscape you have to explore though. Caves or dungeons could be a good idea. Just more areas to explore within the given land.			"

								This game is, all things considered, pretty great! Though the game previously had some optimization issues, those seem to have been fixed and the game looks great and runs smooth. There seems to be quite a lot of content, and the gameplay is fun. Inventory system is a bit lacking, but I'm certain it will be improved in the days to come.It's clear the devs really care about this game, and actually listen to advice given by the players. Unlike the devs for DayZ, who only want money and clearly don't care how much they break their game.Great things are ahead of this game, and even in its current state I certainly recommend it to anybody who likes a mix of fantasy, survival, and first-person adventure.

								I just got this game from Humble Bundle, and I like it very much. Only complaint I have, is that the game requires a lot of 'learning-by-doing', which can sometimes be a bit of a struggle. It would serve nicely, if you'd be able to either get kind of a tutorial or maybe a 'hint' button. Kinda like 'Hey, it's a good idea to start out crafting a bag, so you can gather more supplies'.  "

								Going to keep this pretty short as its late and I should have stopped playing hours ago :PProsPlayed with a friend and had a great time.  Finally a survival game that actually has some strife to survive!  Definitely an old school feel to the game overall.  No map function is great and really draws you in, I cannot stand games today that have the guiding light from the sky to show you where to go...  I followed the game and joined a few TTV streams before purchasing.  Devs are very devoted and interact with their community constantly which is a rare thing to see.  This is an EA done right.  Had such a great time in its current state and can see it only getting better.ConsThe shore definitely needs some optimizations where the water is breaking on the beach.  My frames were dropping hard whenever I was near the water break.  As soon as the break was out of view the game ran wonderfully with zero fps issues.  Dedicated server would really make this game much better as well.  However, the devs have already stated in a recent TTV stream this is a feature coming soon (few weeks).  Overall, happy to support the game with the 4 pack I purchased and would die to freezing ocean again :)			"

So thumbs up for the devs on great Linux support.Either way, get it from Humble Bundle while u can and try it for yourself!			"

								Could be a really great game with so much potential, but it's really underdeveloped yet. I gave a thumbs up because I had 9 hours of fun until my friend I discovered everything that are still not implemented in the game. We even climbed up half way on the dragon tower.I hope the developers won't give up on this game, because they can make a great survival fantasy game. Pros:- Great environment and overall feel (until I noticed that the dragon won't do anything, it was really scary to always look up to the sky and check if it's near)- Nice building system and textures for the houses (they are really cozy when finished)- Heck of a lot recipes (it's not for everybody, but I love a game when there's always something new in the recipes section)- Nice gear textures (maybe it's a bit too early to write this, because I only managed to create leather and fur cuirasses, but I loved how they looked)- Not bad combat system, but still needs a lot of work- Really creative items can be created (I love the respawn item and that if you kill somebody you can just put his/her head on a spike right infront of your house)Cons:- I think some of the mobs are way too powerful.- Also they are glitchy (sometimes they just disappear)- The spawn system is a joke currently. One island is full of animals and mobs and the other is just plain empty.- There are a lot of materials that are not implemented yet (I never managed to find iron, gold, lion flower etc., but maybe I wasn't really lucky with them)- The mining is just tedious     - It doesn't matter if you have a betterm hammer you won't be able to mine more or faster- Terrible inventory system- Not easy to play with your friend (can't create groups)Overall:Only buy this game if you are brave enough to bet on the developers for future updates. Currently I don't think it's worth 14,99 euros but definitely worth to buy it via Humble Bundle (as I did ;)). I will update this review maybe a year later. I hope the devs will work on this game! :)			"

								I just got this game from Humble Bundle, and I like it very much. Only complaint I have, is that the game requires a lot of 'learning-by-doing', which can sometimes be a bit of a struggle. It would serve nicely, if you'd be able to either get kind of a tutorial or maybe a 'hint' button. Kinda like 'Hey, it's a good idea to start out crafting a bag, so you can gather more supplies'.  "

								10/10 survival game if you're no stranger to the genre. I have no frame issues besides when using portals and the difficulty ramp is excellent. Had no issues with terminator dragons or spawn camping rabid wolves and ultimately have enjoyed every moment of this game. My only recommendation to anyone looking to purchase this is to get a buddy along for the ride. Solo can be a bit slow and thus unenjoyable at the beginning.			"

								Ok someone help me understand why this is getting good reviews...-Great Graphics-sparse resources for crafting and especially food you will eventually no matter what u do starve to death-craft a house and some armor and youve basically beat the game and there is no longer any point to go on livingThis is looking like another pointless survival/crafting game with no depth and no goals.Why go on surviving in an empty world 30minutes and youll be bored.Update:Have been playing the beta version so I could test the update-still having poor frame rate but by no means uplayable-With relightable campfire farming food while tedious is fairly easy to stock up on-Fighting is basically hit trading, look forward to seeing more combat mechanics like parry and block-Much easier to survive with increased dura and deer and animal debuffs-crafted armor still degrades fairly fast for what it costs to createUpdate:Wow this game is improving at an absolutely insane rate these guys must be popping crank and washing it down with redbull.  Seriously no idea how they can roll in the Updates so fast.  Every week theres a new one.  Anyways just played some totally worth buying at its current state			"

								After playing for several hours, its a fresh experience to survive under such harsh environment. Its good to see some lore on the island. Its funny to coop with other players to live on the savage lands.Since this game is still in early access period, I think the problems within the game is understadable.It will be good if the following points can be fulfilled.Technical:1) Allow opengl 2.1 and 4.5 to be performed on windows so that players can have more choices to run the game2) Bug solving: In coop mode, joiners may see the flashing creatures and those creatures cannot be hitted.Game play:1) Quest mode: There is large potential for the game to be further developed so that the game can have more realistic gaming experiences. The current problem of the game is the lack of human issue such as how people act in order to survive. It will be good to start from a group of people and NPCs arriving the land accidently and have to find out the reasons they come to the land and the reasons of disappearance of the natives. And set continuation of that group of people and the land survivors on the island as the final target. I am not talking about another skyrim, but instead a real survival game.			"

								Great game, especially for early accessWhile this game has decent content as is, I can see some people being bored with what there is now, however, keeping in mind that this is early access i see a lot of potential in it. Another thing i would like to mention is that the setting feels like a real place, i often find that in games there are often places that seem completely impossible and they're usually all over the place, this game makes the world feel very possible, roaming enemies may also attribute to this feeling of realism.Graphically it's good considering it's in-progress state but nothing to write home about.Audio wise i actually quite like it, i usually listen to podcasts while i game so i shut off the music but the ambient audio is really nice, it's fairly good quality, and simple enough to be both pleasent and immersive.Gameplay (control) is good, controls well and the options available make things nice, it may be a personal thing but being able to set any command to any key is incredibly nice and almost a shock to see in a game of this level of development, i feel a lot of people won't even notice this but i feel it deserves a mention.

								There is a sad situation here. I bought this near release, as some people have done as well, and expected it to get better. At the time, I was trying to run it on a low-grade laptop...and this was before steam refund. I am now stuck with a unfinished pile of garbage that wasted 15$. I haven't even played it on my new PC, and just by looking at the reviews I got scamed. Thank you garbage developers that stole 15$ (more like 20-25$ when I bought it.)...			"

								Spawned. See three dudes along the beach. Tried to be cool. Didn't workout. Got gang-bang, they ra-ped me. Respawn with no knowlege of how to make things, then killed some deers then crafted my-self a spike club; soo happy about it, then found a campfire. Spend the night there. Happy with my meat and spike club. Then in the distance; Oh! is that?!  is that?! Oh! S h i t! those dudes again! Noo! Thinking myself; come closer, then. Surprise! MotherF**** pullout my spike club then BANG!! They didn't even know what hit them. kill two of them. Revange taste sweet at last. Nobody messes with a true survivor. Overall, this game it is fun it brings joy and it has potential to be some really great game in the future. I give it 8/10.			"

								I have only played this game for a few hours and all i have to say is, wow. This game is absolutley awesome!! I love playing it and exploring and surviving! All those people who say this game is way to hard are a bunch of pansies. If anything this games difficulty could be amped up!! Its especially easy if you have someone to play with. And even playing with your friends is easy because its based on a host game and not a massive server so itll only be you and your friend! The crafting menu is super easy to get used to, surviving makes sense (eating, healing, getting warm, etc.). Watch a youtube video or 2 of someone playing this game just to get the essentials down of how to start out and you will be fine. I love skyrim and like minecraft and the two of them meeting has been awesome! Overall this game is 10/10 and i recommend if you have any interest in this game, definitely get it! I am a ""save all the money i can"" kind of guy and was weary of buying another game but this one did not dissappoint!!!Thanks devs!! Cant wait for more updates to come!!			"

								Dropped off on an island you have nothing. Cold, Hunger and Health play a part as they would realisticly so gamers can really have an experience where they have to keep themselves alive. As one gets deeper in the island there are more enemies especially at night so its quite easy to find yourselves with no food, no fire and no shelter, or get lost and can't find your base! you can use the ruins of bases on the island or make your own buildings yourself. I quite liked that you can place logs into a building and it will gradually form shape. For an early release it is great its similar viewing to Skyrim, visually stunning.			"

If you want something, you have to go look for the materials and then build it. Its a really good game thus far, and Im really looking forward to what its going to become.			"

								I do reccomend this game for the POTENTIAL not for it's current condition. There are a few feedbacks that I hope the developers will take time to read :) I think that a larger selection of hostile entities, more terrain variety (I think new maps will most likely be added in the future), A server hosting system at some point like minecraft where you have a permanent server that is up (whitelisted perhaps) and people can join, more options for adventuring and exploring like caves and the dragon's tower maybe with loot to be found in places like the village would add very very much to the gameplay experience. Obviously there will be more items added and maybe things like neutral NPCs. AND HERE MY MOST IMPORTANT RECCOMENDATION. The ability to terraform an area and BUILD WALLS LIKE A VILLAGE FOR SERVERS. Without terraforming currently the only way to bulid a halfway decent house is to build it in the village that alrealy has flat ground where you won't be able to peek under the walls and where you don't feel like a savage because your floor is the snowy grass.

A fantastic, magnificent, fresh, and most of all-- fun new experience in the Survival genre***Signal Studios, if you're reading this, please make the OST out for sale. The Kur dragon encounter theme is especially amazing.8.5/10, not yet complete, but it will get a solid 10 when they complete it, I'm sure of it!Have you ever played a game that feels so refreshing and new to you? This is that feeling. Even if you haven't, this will be that first feeling.EDIT:The developers have added more content, and now it feels even more refreshing and a bit more fair.SECOND EDIT: Developers are getting really smart and listening to the fanbase.This is like a mixture of Minecraft and Skyrim.

I can tell there is going to be some casting of various things in the future if we have a sword that has a magical glow.+So many that I gave up listing them. Just buy it and see for yourself!Cons:-A.I. seems broken at times. As I write this I'm stuck naked on top of a rock while a Dire Bear and Skeleton run around it. They are also really persistant and annoying, to the point where you need to kill them for them to stop chasing them. They are a bit over powered from when you begin, and way too many wolves appear at once, making it extremely hard to stay alive. Every NPC except the skeletons do way too much damage and have way too much health when you first accidentally encounter them, at least have a loud noise of a bear/plague wolf that you can hear as soon as you get close to the area. And you have to run into them regularly in order to get to the resources you need. They end up killing you and you can't move your respawn point unless you build another one, which is impossible if you can't kill skeletons and chop wood, which is impossible because you don't have any tools upon respawning and lose everything. You have to start an entirely new character if you die while you're lost or die a few times to lead the npc's away so you can retrieve your stuff then kill every last one of them. The A.I. keeps you staying on a rock for five minutes while you freeze to death and never stop chasing you unless you are on a rock for five freaking minutes, which in turn drains your heat meter, which in turn, lowers your health.-There needs to be a map for the entire island that draws itself out as you explore so you can get back to where you were/where you want to explore so you don't get so lost.New strategy to counteract this is a Compass, a death marker, and chopping down millions of trees to make weapon racks as a ""bread crumb"" trail. -Needs less limits on what you can and cannot craft without a blacksmith. You can practically only craft one in an area or else you will most likely die trying to build another one and cannot find it. There needs to be some kind of portable smithy or something. They added a rare ""smithy"" attached to a burned down home in old villages.-Plauge wolves spawn in the beginning parts of the island where you spawn if you go a little far at night and have eyes behind their tiny testicular organs so they can see behind them a mile away. Nearly impossible to kill with a starter hammer, and they spawn as you begin.-No bear should take 15-25 arrows to kill, even if it's a dire bear, and treat your armor like it's just wet paper.They fixed up the bears, good trade off of Power and Defense with them. Good melee blade will be able to fix them up.-No wolf pack made up of 10 wolves should do 5 damage to you when you have full armor on you and a Wolfsbane. (That's the reason I rage quit for a bit at one time.)-No wolf, bear, skeleton or any creature that ever existed would follow you to hell itself and back just to bite you. Especially when they can kill you so easily with full armor on.-Your armor breaks way too easily, especially the top tier armor, Ebon Steel.Overall, it's a great game, but it needs fixes in the NPC's and enemies. Especially how persistant they are. I haven't been this mad at a game since Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Sm4sh, even though how wonderful this game is. However, despite its difficulties, you cannot help but return to it. It's too much of a treasure to skip out on, especially when it's on sale. Buy it for yourself and your friends too!			"

								I do reccomend this game for the POTENTIAL not for it's current condition. There are a few feedbacks that I hope the developers will take time to read :) I think that a larger selection of hostile entities, more terrain variety (I think new maps will most likely be added in the future), A server hosting system at some point like minecraft where you have a permanent server that is up (whitelisted perhaps) and people can join, more options for adventuring and exploring like caves and the dragon's tower maybe with loot to be found in places like the village would add very very much to the gameplay experience. Obviously there will be more items added and maybe things like neutral NPCs. AND HERE MY MOST IMPORTANT RECCOMENDATION. The ability to terraform an area and BUILD WALLS LIKE A VILLAGE FOR SERVERS. Without terraforming currently the only way to bulid a halfway decent house is to build it in the village that alrealy has flat ground where you won't be able to peek under the walls and where you don't feel like a savage because your floor is the snowy grass.

								Great game, especially for early accessWhile this game has decent content as is, I can see some people being bored with what there is now, however, keeping in mind that this is early access i see a lot of potential in it. Another thing i would like to mention is that the setting feels like a real place, i often find that in games there are often places that seem completely impossible and they're usually all over the place, this game makes the world feel very possible, roaming enemies may also attribute to this feeling of realism.Graphically it's good considering it's in-progress state but nothing to write home about.Audio wise i actually quite like it, i usually listen to podcasts while i game so i shut off the music but the ambient audio is really nice, it's fairly good quality, and simple enough to be both pleasent and immersive.Gameplay (control) is good, controls well and the options available make things nice, it may be a personal thing but being able to set any command to any key is incredibly nice and almost a shock to see in a game of this level of development, i feel a lot of people won't even notice this but i feel it deserves a mention.

								Paid 1$ for it on Humble Bundle, cant say it wasnt worth it.

								Loaded in with 2 friends to play. Not played solo, however it's a GREAT game while playing with friends. Started off building our little village. Was great working together, one on deforesting the area, one mining and one hunting. Got ourselves built up fairly well, running around to keep each other alive as we had to push further to mine. Once we reached a point where our equipment was fairly strong we began exploring. Spent a day preparing, repearing our equpiment, hunting for food and farming the essentials to keep ourselves alive. Started travelling through the day and setting up camp during the nights. Was real fun having to plan for each day, fighting to keep each other alive and travelling the island. Watched a few dev streams and happy to see there's still a lot of ideas and work being put in to the game. Loving the game now and excited to see what happens in the future. Edit: Watching dev stream now. My first decision on this game was to run out in to the forest naked... the dragon got me. Loved it! :D			"

								I don't normally review my steam games but I'm sick of this one getting♥♥♥♥♥♥all over so I wanted to add my $.02. As of 8/09/16 this game's major problem seems to have been addressed, that was the one shotting dragon overlord who eats whiners and complainers. He has been balanced out. As long as you don't get to close to his tower, (there's really no reason to if you're unprepared), he probably won't eat you. The dragon does seem to leave the tower now and again but he usually stays put now around noobs now and, according to the dev notes, would rather focus on more formitable players. This is a fun survival, crafting game set in a fridgid fantasy world. It is a little challenging to solo but it's not impossible and it seems to be easier (and funner!) with a friend. It also gets regular updates. I reccomend this game, especially if it's on sale or in a bundle but I don't think the regular asking price of $15 is too steep considering the frequent updates and the general enjoyableness of the game.

Early Access Review
								To clarify this for people looking to buy the game, read below.1. The game has a solid amount of content for its current status. Even when you've crafted the best armour in the game, there are still bosses and monsters for you to hunt to get even stronger weapons. There are a few bosses to fight, including a dragon which is best fought with a ton of preparation, team work and time. He's not easy to kill, with a massive HP pool and enough damage to drop you and your party in seconds without proper preparation. The world is fairly large, and somewhat unsafe to travel through alone. This game is best played and enjoyed with friends.2. This isn't as free-form as some other sandbox games, where architecture and building is a big part of the gaming experience. This game focuses more on the survival aspect and conquering the environment around you as you slowly build up your character through crafting new armor and weapons. There are structures you can build, some of which are incredibly important, some that are literally useless. Once you play the game for an hour or so, you'll understand why building structures doesn't really take away from the game's experience.3. The combat is good. Could be better, but it gets the job done in a non-frustrating way. Blocking is something that could be added to make it a more skilled experience overall. PvP could be a great aspect of this game if there were some minor tweaks done to the combat. 4. This game is well optimized (graphically speaking) and incredibly atmospheric. You may find yourself stopping to just look around at the harsh snow, fog, sun rays piercing through the vegetation or even the deer you're about to hunt just stroll through the woods peacefully. Best played with headphones. Overall, the game is satisfying, and definitely worth the price. It could use a bit more content to fill the large landscape you have to explore though. Caves or dungeons could be a good idea. Just more areas to explore within the given land.			"

Early Access Review
								Although the ""early access"" label is a much-needed warning on this game, it still manages to be an intriguing and fairly fun time. The developers certainly seem to be listening to complaints: many of the negative reviews here revolve around problems that no longer exist. To be sure, it's still very clunky, and many aspects are unintuitive while others seem spoonfed to excess, but I'm going to keep playing and exploring. This is probably one of those games that I'll play happily for 3-10 hours, uninstall, then reinstall a few months later when the itch returns, and that seems like a fine return for 20ish bucks. If you can buy it for less (I got it on the Humble Bundle), then I strongly recommend doing so.Pros:- Strong solo experience- Clear crafting progression- Visible goals that are not forced- Manageable danger- Apparent developer attentivenessCons:- Shallow character creation (no female option, one body type)- Bland cold open- Inconsistencies in usefulness:accessibility and difficulty:visibility- Dull writing- Lag, jitters, etc.Some of the above issues will, I'm sure, be fixed as the game nears completion, and are more of a reflection of where the developers' attention seems to be. If you're here for Skyrim Meets Minecraft, then this is a game worth following, but if you're here for Dragon's Dogma Meets Stardew Valley then it's probably best to move on.			"

								As of 8/14/2016 build 306 (Early Access) I'm writing this review:Savage Lands is a 'hardcore' survival game set in a medieval fantasy era with dragons and skeletons walking around. Seems simple enough but the atmosphere is definitely perfect for the setting, with every sound keeping you on edge whether an enemy is attacking or your next meal is running.But no amount of atmostphere can sadly remove the tediousness of  collecting  finding a single vein of ore or the seemingly empty world where you can run through an entire forest without finding a single entity day or night. And of course being Early Access theres bugs, items disappearing, floating rocks, god mode cheating *** mobs and the ability to animals to seemingly morph into a rock formation as you hunt them.Currently the devs are on a good track and are trying to fix these bugs as well as add more content to the islands of the game. Each update addresses issues and the devs are currently playing around with the spawn rates of items and mobs so its definitly finicky currently.PROS: crafting system actually feels like you're crafting atmospheric when not buggy a large amount of content already Devs are updating fairly frequently with actual patches and additionsCONS: finding ore veins and general collecting can be extremely tedious especially early on large patches of land with literally nothing  extremely buggy at times ie AI of mobs running through rocks or inventory disappears when dropped onto ground spawn rates of mobs can be wonky with sometimes upwards of 30-40 spawning (rarely) to only 1-2 appearingOverall its one of those cases of wanting to recommend and not recommend in its current state but with im hoping future patches many issues should be addressed and the game just that more enjoyable			"

								While the game is clearly not finished and I wasn't expecting to like it when I started playing, I do recommend it for those who enjoy multiplayer crafting/survival. This review is current as of v0.8.3 build 306 (11th August 2016). Update: I've been out wandering all over now, even almost climbed a dragon tower before I found out you can't. At this point in time I feel there need to be more to do and would really like some buildable stairs and platforms.I have not encountered death from the dragon once (even walking right up to it's tower) as some others seem to (I think it got patched) and most of the wildlife is easy enough to kill, at least on the starting island. I've started several new games and every time the dragon has stayed away. Once you venture across the long bridge the enemies (skeletons) seem to get better equipped and can kill you quite quickly, and there are other things lurking in the woods.One thing the game doesn't have which I would like to see is skills you can buy with experience from things you accomplish, such as being able to sprint longer, freeze/starve more slowly, harvest more ore from mining sites before they are depleted and increase weapon damage or armour protection. This isn't a huge thing missing from the game but I feel the experience would benefit from having at least some small ways to improve your character.The biggest issues I've had so far are;- the interface isn't explained (it's not incredibly complex but a short tutorial to tell you what's what and how it works would be helpful). For those wondering, you can split a stack of items by holding shift and clicking with LMB, and items can be quickly picked up in the inventory by double-clicking with LMB.- on some games the wildlife decides to just randomly stop spawning in certain areas for a while (in my first game my friend and I began starving after day 2 because there was nothing around to kill).- most physical structures have to be built from your journal in the house tab, which is confusing and nothing tells you to look for them in there. Campfires, walls, buildings, traps and various crafting stations are all in your jounal and not the crafting menu. Once you select something to build you put down a blueprint where you want it (mousewheel rotates) and the blueprint then shows the materials needed to build it, which you can add all at once or bit-by-bit. A problem with this is that if you have items on the ground near a blueprint you can accidentally add materials while trying to pick up your stuff.- a few of the items you build in the crafting stations are world-placeable (like chests) but when you make them there's no placement interface, so you end up placing them down only vaguely where you want and with no control over the direction the objects are facing. Furthermore these objects can be knocked over and off surfaces by enemies but you walk right through them and cannot pick them up or adjust them to keep your base tidy.- The only way to unbuild structures it to tear them down and weapons (even stone swords) deal more structure damage than your basic clubs and hatchets, so as soon as you hit tin you'll end up using weapons for everything since they can harvest resources as well. I find this odd.- There are some issues with server hosting. Server privacy is almost nonexistent unless you set a password. Even when I set the game I was hosting to ""friends only"" I still had random strangers joining every now and then (not a lot of them, but even one is too many). On top of this there are very few things you can do as the host and none of the options are presented to you when starting to host your game, you have to find them in the options menu while playing.- Both the food you eat and the food you keep don't last long enough. Especially considering you're in a very cold area, meat should last longer than it does before spoiling (and there's nothing in the item details to tell you how long it lasts). On top of that everything you DO eat doesn't keep you going for long. If killing a boar the same size as myself only gives me one piece of meat then by golly that piece of meat should keep me going for at least a few days! Because of these issues you'll spend a lot of time hunting and foraging, unless you got lucky like me and had one wild boar after another wander straight into the abandoned village (seriously I killed more than ten of the things while just standing around working on building stuff).- Some things are intuitive, like the fact that you have to mine metals, but others aren't. When I wanted to get clay I had to google it, facepalming at the fact that I have to smash it out of rocks. Thankfully this only seems to be the case for a few items.- Creatures often go straight through rocks and other barriers that you have to go over/around. This is a real issue when you think you have that deer cornered and ripe for stabbing and he just vanishes into the rock face. This only seems ot happen with part of the rocks and I think they get stuck in there sometimes because they don't always come out the other side.- A minor gripe; I once found a compass and was annoyed that I had to hold it in my hand to tell direction. Normally it wouldn't be a bother but with so little inventory space the item wasn't worth the bother to take with me, so I dumped it. Extra equipment slots for things like this would be useful, and having them add a compass bar to the interface instead of holding up the object too. Furthermore as far as I can tell nobody from the abandoned settlements thought having a map would be a good idea despite apparently having enough paper to just leave lots of notes laying around. Even if there isn't a ""you are here"" marker on them, having some maps of each area to add to your journal and a compass bar would be really nice.- Another minor gripe; In character creation you can only create males, colours are limited to the realistic natural spectrum and half of the tattoos make the characters look like they are wearing t-shirts. Small things really, but I want to have a pink mohawk! D:<All in all I find it fun so far, just watch out for those skeletons, they're surprisingly quiet when they come up behind you!			"

Early Access Review
								I used to play this game a year and a half, maybe two years ago. It was fun back then. It was incredibly barebones, but it was playable, and there was definitely potential. I got it for two other friends and we had a blast for maybe 15 hours before getting bored, but hey it was incredibly early alpha so we were satisfied and hopeful to come back to it later when it'd be more fleshed out.About a year later, I reinstalled it. Here was my experience.- Wake up- Visuals haven't changed much, performance did- Getting stone was way more grindy and took way too long- ""How did they make the ai WORSE?""- Immediately on my way to dying, way too quickly. I couldn't even get my bearings, I'm just already freezing and getting hungry- DRAGON. DEAD. Respawn, dragon comes back and breathes fire again. Repeat for entire experience, nonstop- Wolves everywhere. If it was night time, there were always 8 wolves biting at you if you weren't standing out of their reach and a dragon locking on to you if you stand still on said out-of-reach platform. So either you run until you're out of stamina and get mauled / freeze / starve, or you get murdered by the unrelenting dragon- Literally this is default settings, not some crazy hardmode- Uninstall, scarred- Reinstall 5 months later- Exact same, no changeDon't get this game			"

Early Access Review
								Although the ""early access"" label is a much-needed warning on this game, it still manages to be an intriguing and fairly fun time. The developers certainly seem to be listening to complaints: many of the negative reviews here revolve around problems that no longer exist. To be sure, it's still very clunky, and many aspects are unintuitive while others seem spoonfed to excess, but I'm going to keep playing and exploring. This is probably one of those games that I'll play happily for 3-10 hours, uninstall, then reinstall a few months later when the itch returns, and that seems like a fine return for 20ish bucks. If you can buy it for less (I got it on the Humble Bundle), then I strongly recommend doing so.Pros:- Strong solo experience- Clear crafting progression- Visible goals that are not forced- Manageable danger- Apparent developer attentivenessCons:- Shallow character creation (no female option, one body type)- Bland cold open- Inconsistencies in usefulness:accessibility and difficulty:visibility- Dull writing- Lag, jitters, etc.Some of the above issues will, I'm sure, be fixed as the game nears completion, and are more of a reflection of where the developers' attention seems to be. If you're here for Skyrim Meets Minecraft, then this is a game worth following, but if you're here for Dragon's Dogma Meets Stardew Valley then it's probably best to move on.			"

Early Access Review
								Savage Lands.This game has A LOT of potential.I started playing it a year ago.I convinced some of my friends to get the game, as it was amazing to play on multiplayer.We stopped playing for a year.When i came back, i must say i was surprised :- map changed, giving a new gameplay to the game- tons of itemsetc etc.But, there was unfortunately too many deceptions :- animals/monsters crossing rocks and literally disappearing- i got stuck 9 times in 5 mins between icebergs or rock without ANY chance of getting out, i could barely move or jump, nothing changed and i lost everything i got.- graphics didnt changed a lot.- Monsters OS you even before you could get close to them to check it out on the second island ( i was on full Tin armor)This game has a LOT of potential as i said. The concept is amazing and i perfectly know how hard is it to make a game, so this is why i am certainly saying it is a ""bad game"" like most players.If i could help in any way, i'd like to tell the creators that i'm ready to help. I really believe in this game as it has the bases of being an epic game.Let the devs to their job, and lets help them build a magnificent game.Why is this on the thumbs down category? Cause i want the devs to read me! =D			"

								Ok i know a lot of people are hitting no but to be honest i actually like this game.. the crafting is cool and not too hard to gather materials.. the materials you drop in the world stay on the ground while you log out of the game which is awesome!!!the graphics are not too bad but could be better and honestly i dont mind it the gameplay is fun enough to keep my mind off that minor issue. i got this game off the humble bundle sale and honestly i would have paid the full price for it.if your not into survival games then dont bother with this .. other wise get it .. its a nice addition to the survival game library.

								As of 8/14/2016 build 306 (Early Access) I'm writing this review:Savage Lands is a 'hardcore' survival game set in a medieval fantasy era with dragons and skeletons walking around. Seems simple enough but the atmosphere is definitely perfect for the setting, with every sound keeping you on edge whether an enemy is attacking or your next meal is running.But no amount of atmostphere can sadly remove the tediousness of  collecting  finding a single vein of ore or the seemingly empty world where you can run through an entire forest without finding a single entity day or night. And of course being Early Access theres bugs, items disappearing, floating rocks, god mode cheating *** mobs and the ability to animals to seemingly morph into a rock formation as you hunt them.Currently the devs are on a good track and are trying to fix these bugs as well as add more content to the islands of the game. Each update addresses issues and the devs are currently playing around with the spawn rates of items and mobs so its definitly finicky currently.PROS: crafting system actually feels like you're crafting atmospheric when not buggy a large amount of content already Devs are updating fairly frequently with actual patches and additionsCONS: finding ore veins and general collecting can be extremely tedious especially early on large patches of land with literally nothing  extremely buggy at times ie AI of mobs running through rocks or inventory disappears when dropped onto ground spawn rates of mobs can be wonky with sometimes upwards of 30-40 spawning (rarely) to only 1-2 appearingOverall its one of those cases of wanting to recommend and not recommend in its current state but with im hoping future patches many issues should be addressed and the game just that more enjoyable			"

								UPDATE:I'm keeping the game recommended for now, but I advise waiting for March to see if what they will reply to the community. The game might be abandonware, which would be a disgrace and it'd keep me from buying an Early Access ever again.A worthwhile Survival with dark fantasy props. A good buy at discount, and even a good bet on full price if you're into the genre.The game has plenty of  content (mobs, crafts, buildings, ores, trees, etc.) which is good for an EA. The atmosphere is enthralling, making those first hours really challenging when you need to get clothed, fed and find some shelter. At night you'll be on your toes, specially when those snow storms hit.The challenge then turns into finding bigger game to hunt, and trying not to get outmatched by your potential prey. Experience is much better with friends.			"

								Pretty amazing game that will become way better over time. Savage Land's is still decently barren at this time though 3/19/15 yet it is still very new and as long as the developers stay as interested as they are now as hopefully will be in a year, then I can see this game becoming something that transcends the survival and fantasy genre. If you are tight with your money I would wait but if you would either like to fund the developers or play a nice alpha experience go ahead and pick it up now.			"

								This review is directed to the Devs. My friends and I love to play Savage Lands and relize it has some potential. We have some ideas of things we would love to see in upcoming updates. First off walking is a long and tiring proccess in Savage lands, in-game we have a main base camp with a town hall, forge, etc; but when we go hunting for food or going for minerals it is a lengthy proccess and it would be great if you could add mounts. In the way of mounts I was thinking that of course there should be horses, but why not have something more exciting? I don't know about you but I would personaly love to charge into battle atop my burly war bear to take out my enimies, or soar through the skies atop my dragon stead. I'm sure that you have heard this from lots of your players, but the map NEEDS to be larger. There is simply not enough to explore! I understand this game is relatively new, so for where it is this game is doing great. I reccomend this game to anyone willing to grind for materials for little reward other than to have them, and to survive in game. While I cannot say this game is a must-buy it should not be overlooked. So Devs I hope you have not overlooked this review and will take my ideas into consideration, and than you for providing hours of social fun with my friends.			"

								""Early Access"" for some game is really big trouble, but not for that. I'm a fan of the survival games, and I should write a comment about Savage Lands.And even though that this game have got early access status, it's worth it. And given the fact that developers don't forget about update and very often do it (gravely, they have got timer for update!), game promises cool. Now we can see great landscape: trees, water, sun, shadows - all of that are beautifully drawn, I fell in love in it. Big world, clever (sometimes xd) animals, and I really afraid when wolf walked quietly and... with full force howled in my headphones!!! >_<Maybe now this game haven't got only one - purpose (some if my friends said that, but don''t listen them, they don't now anything about sandbox)), and for me - more craft! More terraforming!Best of luck to developers, please, don't back away this game. It has a big future.  "

								Pretty amazing game that will become way better over time. Savage Land's is still decently barren at this time though 3/19/15 yet it is still very new and as long as the developers stay as interested as they are now as hopefully will be in a year, then I can see this game becoming something that transcends the survival and fantasy genre. If you are tight with your money I would wait but if you would either like to fund the developers or play a nice alpha experience go ahead and pick it up now.			"

								It's fun, really is.The content is at a low level though. I'll admit learning it well enough to get to ""end-game"" took about a day.But once you're there, that's it. You can stand there with your awesome sword and yea that's about it.Hoping they add more content, boat for inter-island travel, at least twice as many crafing options, more hunting game, stuff like that.  Without it, the game gets very old very quick.But don't get me wrong, it's ALOT of fun. I'm just going to have to wait until more content comes.			"

								This review is directed to the Devs. My friends and I love to play Savage Lands and relize it has some potential. We have some ideas of things we would love to see in upcoming updates. First off walking is a long and tiring proccess in Savage lands, in-game we have a main base camp with a town hall, forge, etc; but when we go hunting for food or going for minerals it is a lengthy proccess and it would be great if you could add mounts. In the way of mounts I was thinking that of course there should be horses, but why not have something more exciting? I don't know about you but I would personaly love to charge into battle atop my burly war bear to take out my enimies, or soar through the skies atop my dragon stead. I'm sure that you have heard this from lots of your players, but the map NEEDS to be larger. There is simply not enough to explore! I understand this game is relatively new, so for where it is this game is doing great. I reccomend this game to anyone willing to grind for materials for little reward other than to have them, and to survive in game. While I cannot say this game is a must-buy it should not be overlooked. So Devs I hope you have not overlooked this review and will take my ideas into consideration, and than you for providing hours of social fun with my friends.			"

								Day 1, completed the beginning guide to learn how to play, was great, saw this awesome sunset from my abode on the beach, I was able to chop down enough trees to build a shack even! It was awesome! I went into my shack at night to let the time pass, as I went to close the door some wolves decided they were hungry and I looked like a nice snack. Day 2, I decided to venture inland, as I was hunting deer and almost starving to death the nice dragon decided to end my suffering by eating me. 10/10 would do again.Day 3, I found a player town (yes I started on a server), they were nice enough to give me some food, bags, and armor, and I ventured back out into the wilderness to claim my own land! I had a nice shiny weapon now!!! I was hunting a deer when right as I ran up to attack it a bear came out of no where and decided to eat me and the deer. someone needs to teach these animals the ""finders keepers"" rule..Day 4, I'm running around yet again trying to find a nice place to live and I found this great area, I cleared out all the trees and shrubs, rebuilt my home and a great big fire to keep me warm, apparently the fire was too big because some skeletons decided they wanted to sit by the fire too so they wandered into my camp and proceeded to wreck me and take my camp.. what lovely gentlemen. All in all, this game is hilarious if you dont mind dying a few times to get the hang of things. Its been a very enjoyable experience thus far, will keep playing for sure if the game keeps updating!			"

								Despite being a fairly blatant mix of skyrim's atmosphere and the popular minecraft survival style sandbox, I'd say this games worth a shot. Calling it what it is or not, the two things really mingle well. I feel this game has potential because of its difficulty, atmosphere, and pvp. Granted, early access, here are some things that could be improved upon:Dedicated servers and (Subsequently) raising the servers player cap far beyond 8.Being able to crouch, not just slow walk.  Smoothing of combat system, its not day z clunky but its still could use polishing.Optimization of graphics. I dont exactly have a great gaming computer, but for the quality of these graphics it shouldn't be as difficult to run smoothly as it seems. Im sure a lot of people also feel something is missing with no quests, dungeons, or any other true objectives besides survive and attempt to thrive with. However, I dont think it needs it. This could really be an interesting game if rather than copy/pasting the typical survival game mechanics, features, and far too many craftables, instead it took advantage of its multiplayer and gently encouraging players to make the most of an open world, realistic tribal, or even feudal, survival/ pvp warfare system. Something about this game just makes me yearn for that kind of experience.Overall, not bad. Gonna stick with it and see how it goes.			"

The only improvement I have run into that don't set well with me is the inability to leave surplus firewood and supplies in the Camps. It just goes away. and the second improvement I would suggest is an interactive map. or at least an accurate map that shows the big rocks in the ocean for points of reference.Don't get me wrong, I love this game and believe it has great potential and will keep playing it to see where it is going to finish Beta.

								I will admit that I haven't played many survival type games, I've played the more cutesie ones such as Terraria and Starbound, but nothing lik Savage Lands. I normally don't like games with the idea to survive and craft so hardcore in the beginning of the game, and normally not a fan of the first-person view either but that view has grown on me through other games played.I LOVE this game so far, could be that I play it with 1-2 other people though... All I know is that I enjoy the challenge and getting to explore while having to find your way back to your camp, etc. It's easy in the beginning with a camp built near the water, but after moving it more inland you really need to rely on a compass and different landmarks of sorts.Very interested in what changes will come about in the future, hoping perhaps the ability to craft a ""recall potion"" of sorts that can bring you back to your set spawn point is a possibility, but if not it's not too terribly hard to navigate yourself.

								This is my first review on Steam and I'm going to keep it short.  This game is worth every penny and then some.  I've spent the last 2 years digging through survival games since I outgrew Minecraft.  There are a lot of garbage titles in the genre and that is a good thing as the best games easily rise to the top.  This is one of those gems for sure.  The most amazing thing is that this game isn't even remotely finished and it's already my fav game in the genre by far.  This is intended to become a Skyrim-survivalish game.  So at some point I'm going to be able to cast fireball spells?  Just take my money now.  My only regret is that I bought this game on sale for $8.00, and I really feel bad that the developers are not gettting the other $12.00 they had planned on.  I've never felt this way about a game and may in fact donate another 12 bucks just so I feel better about it.  Just buy this game... DO NOT watch streams or YouTube videos if you can help it.  The less you know, the more fun you will have.			"

								Going to start by saying that the game is somewhat crude.  However the gameplay seems solid and the attention to detail is amazing.  I chopped down a tree and instead of falling it got caught in the tree next to it.  I chopped down the next tree and both fell.  Also, I love that the shadows actually disappear.  I'm only an hour in and I think I'm in love.On sale this game is a steal and I'm extremely excited to see what happens in future updates.			"

								Its an amusing game, in its current state its not worth 19€ but i picked it up for 7€ and i say its worth that atm.A thing i would like to get fixed is with the houses. Its to expensive to keep the torches burning, i would like a hearth in the house or atleast the townhall which i can fuel with wood. Or make the torches permanent once you buld them or at the very least make them last the night....			"

								I have been very interested in this game since I first seen it pop up on EA... However, being against EA, I told myself I would wait quite a bit until purchasing.  Now that the game has been out for a bit and seeing tons of great reviews I decided to take the plunge. Very glad that I did.It constantly gets compared to Minecraft + Skyrim.  I wouldn't exactly say that is the hybrid I would go with, but I can see it.It is not a digging game or a block builder.  So dont get excited if that's what you love about Minecraft/Terraria.It isnt an action rpg.  There arent any NPCs. So if that what you like about Skyrim, then tough.What it is: Awesome.  You are washed up on a beach.  You find a few supplies that must've fallen off of your very tiny boat. You have 3 bars that you have to manage.  Cold. HP.  Hunger. All easily managable.  You start of with barely any inventory space... Logical because you washed up basically nude.You have to gather everything you can!  Build a fire to keep warm and cook meat from the various wild life you will have to kill. (Sorry Bambi lovers)  Make a house to stay safe at night (also keeps you warm).  Cutting down trees, and mining are your main resources, but with lots to explore and find washed up on shore or at various camps where others have perished.There are several types of enemies that require different tactics and better gear to ""progress"" while you try to gather materials and better your gear.And there is a giant dragon flying about!  This game is constantly getting updated.  The devs are constantly keeping the community in the loop and taking suggestions.  It seems like the devs want to keep this as realistic as possible but set within a fantasy world... I very much approve of this decision.  I really hope they dont end up taking advice from all of the casual complainers who want some modern-esque survival game.It is totally worth a pick up.  It isnt anywhere near finished but there is tons to do and lots to see.  I definitely think it is the type of game that one would enjoy to see evolve just as much as you would enjoy the game play.Note: I unfortunately have not given multiplayer a try, so I did not mention that in my review.  All I do know is there are 2 modes, one pvp and one thats pve co-op style.			"

								Ok so I'm only about 8 hours in but I'm liking how things are going I'm just far enough that i feel safe adventuring at night alone or with a friend or two but still terrified of kur showing up and burning me to a crisp. Sadly I've yet to see any furies or giants, I'm guessing i just not far enough from the start area yet. Can't wait to fight some of the named enemies, planning to go looking for a few tonight. Things I'd like to seeWould be really nice if building a structure would level the terrain floor, would prevent dropped items from rolling outside under the walls and whatnot, not to mention the ground clipping through the floor of the townhalls.Ammo counter for the bow, yea i know u can put the arrows in the hotbar but after u use those 25 u can't tell how many more u have, not a big thing would just be semi helpful.Quiver bag, could only hold arrows but would let them stack to 100 intstead of 25 and have a few slots, could be a worn item maybe accessory slot, other accessories could be cloaks to help warm when in armor that isn't so warm. Epic teir item, after kur combat done could include a fireproof cloak made from kurs own hide.A block mechanic, shields would be nice but if i can block with my sword at least i wouldn't mind so much.Some type of cave/dungeon in game would be cool but I'm sure thats already been thought of.All in all the game is amazing so far and i can see myself playing plenty more in the weeks to come, I love that there is an update countdown in the main menu. I'd recommend this game to just about anyone who likes survival games it has just the right mix of grinding for items and fighting for your life that you'd hope for.			"

As soon as i entered the game it was kinda good with the objectives they give you, to help you get started and learn some of the basics. the building reminded me of the forest or life is feudal: Your own, were you select yuor building and orient the structure how you want. The controls aren't to bad, pretty good to say the least. Graphics are great to for early acces, very little bugs to none at all.			"

								My first impressions:Character feels super fat, like you're constantly running up a hill. Not really any sense of direction when you start out. I just ran around for a while, killed a few skeletons and a wolf, then froze to death. All I really found in this time were four of the same hammer, and some meat. The combat system also feels a little boring. I would like to see some major improvments with the crafting menu as well. I was expecting my computer to handle it better too, it was stuttering a bit. The game is too early in development for me to really judge it properly. Definitely a lot of potential here. I look forward to trying it again in a few updates. (I did thumbs up this on purpose. I'm not hating on the game, just sharing my opinions with those who are considering buying the game.)			"

Very hard to hit some things even when right up on them too.For now I don't have the time or interest to waste on this game when I have so many others that are enjoyable.			"

A friend and I began playing and learned a method to play effcientlyRecommendation: Stick at the first island for a while. Move on , stay there and alternate till you are ready.We had no clue what to expect with this game, originally I believed it to be proceduly generating but no. Thats not a bad thing at all. Because theres an actual static map, we could learn more.Recently finding out about world bosses and reading the diary entries to learn about the world. Savage lands has a subtle way of steering you in the right direction.. Or the wrong if you dont read carefully. Some of the messages are cryptic and can be clues towards puzzels taht the game has. Very high recommendation as an underrated game			"

								Good game. I mostly support it because they made Ascend: hand of Kul. Which I am QUITE angry to see has been removed. Forgot it existed. Randomly remembered it. Got super happy and felt life had purpose. Then find out it is no longer a thing. Angry.So i'm reviewing Ascend here, with some Savage lands added too.Ascend:Hand of Kul Review;Ascend: Hand of Kul is an action RPG hybrid putting you in the enormous shoes of a Caos—a monstrous being inhabiting the border between god and humanity. Customize your god-aspirant and join one of three factions determining your ability set: Dark, Void, or Light. Set out into a miserable landscape to defeat vile creatures, and harness their souls and experience. Convert altars scattered across the land to your deity, and recruit more worshipers to your god. Human followers will clamor onto your back and help defeat enemies with blazing arrows. Sacrifice yourself to the divine and create a homunculus to invade other player’s worlds and steal their altars. Upgrade your Caos through a huge library of gear, changing your play style and equipping yourself with the wardrobe of a god.    Ascend: Hand of Kul Key Features:3 factions - choose between Light, Dark and Void, each with their own play style and skillset.Equipment - customize your Caos with a huge arsenal of gear , unlocking new equipment as you play.Player invasion - Sacrifice yourself to the gods and send a homunculus in your image to attack other player’s realms.Recruit Followers - claim religious altars scattered through the world, recruiting human followers to aid you on your journey.Active Combat - fight in real time, chaining attacks to rack up combos and earn more souls.Savage Lands Review;Made by company that made Kuls hands. Is good. Play.			"

								The game was fun, and I would reccommend it for those that like Dragons and survival games akin to Don't Starve. However my only complaint is regarding the very limited inventory space as well as limited stacking. Even if the meat is the same you can only have 1 raw meat of that type in a slot. To make a fire you need 3 logs but you can only have 2 per stack. Max inventory space is roughly 11 or 13 slots (can't recall at this time).   Other little annoyence is when you kill an animal it doesn't always give you meat. It would make sense to get a poorer quality of meat instead of none at all.    However please do not let these little annoying things stop you from trying the game.  I imagine you would thoroughly enjoy it with friends.

								This is a game I deeply recommend. The game reminds me of Skyrim and dayz in the same game! There are multiple ways to survive and go through your adventure. I love how the environment seamlessly integrates with the gameplay.  Sometimes I feel like I am actually walking on that island.  Although graphics aren't the goal of this game I will say it can really suck your time away from how engaging it is.  However, optimization in the game isn't at an all time high.  So you can expect large lag spikes here and there.  As well as graphical glitches, such as floating deer or flying trees.  The beta of this game is showing a much larger map of amazing proportions and some dungeons with mysteries surrounding them such as why is there a giant meteor or what was the role of the dragon bridge? The beta inculdes dungeons, new bosses, and a better island.  I hope you choose to buy this game and love it as much as I do! :) "

								I played this game when she first popped up on Steam then played it again just under a week ago. Actually I played it with a few friends on both occasions. To say the least, its fun, basic, and gives a decent enough challenge. In addition, after coming back to it, I'm impressed with the progress the dev's are making. Compared to the first time I played it, SL has made massive improvements. It's still a little wonky, hit boxes can be off, the AI will occasionally get confused and you'll see the rarer graphical glitch. However those are the negatives. I'm sure if you scroll through the comments you'll find the more nitpicking detailed issues that people have. However, for a $15 early access indie multiplayer, Savage Lands stands out. It has a comprehensive UI and crafting system, a time consuming yet entertaining grinding system, the graphics and AI are still well built for what it is. Does it have it's problems? Sure, yet like I said it's an early access indie (that's only $15) and for that I give it a 10/10. Also the Devs are still here! (ikr, rare AF) Is it worth the money? Absolutely! Especially if you're going to play with friends. You get to set up your own servers, its savable, and it easy AF to set up.How is SL compared to other Indies/Alphas? It's simple, it doesn't compare. I mean that in a good way. This game hit the nail on the head for me. Nowadays you have to sort through all the glitchy PoS waste of money multiplayers, Indies, and or Alphas that Steam has to offer. All so you can find a remotely decent one to play with friends. Even then, most are pay to win or the Dev's give up on them after the first couple of months, and or the Dev/Devs just run off with the money *cough cough Dean Hall*. In conclusion, seeing as I'm starting to rant. Overall Savage Lands is still a very solid game and in my opinion it is a load of fun and definitely worth the money.			"

								Incredibly fun, crafting and harvesting feels good,  fighting is a combo of archery, dodging, and blocking and feels super satisfying with the many different kinds of weapons. Most of the reviews say that mining sucks and takes forever, it takes like 30 seconds to mine a fair amount of tin and coal (important resources early game) with a rock ._. Pretty sure everyone who is submitting reviews about mining speed either never upgraded their hammer or just decided to try and skip progression and mine the highest tier stuff with a rock. If you follow the progression mining takes almost no time at all.Additionally, the game features randomly occuring bosses and unique items, makes it feel a little like first person terraria, especially with the game's focus on PVE.TLDR: if you are a KOSing scrub from rust,dayz,etc go elseware, this is PVE (E FOR EVIRONMENT, NOT PLAYER), if you remember playing games like terraria with your friends fondly, you will probably like this alot. Totally recommend the game, especially for the current price on humble bundle (<$6.00 with other games in a bundle)			"

								Good game. I mostly support it because they made Ascend: hand of Kul. Which I am QUITE angry to see has been removed. Forgot it existed. Randomly remembered it. Got super happy and felt life had purpose. Then find out it is no longer a thing. Angry.So i'm reviewing Ascend here, with some Savage lands added too.Ascend:Hand of Kul Review;Ascend: Hand of Kul is an action RPG hybrid putting you in the enormous shoes of a Caos—a monstrous being inhabiting the border between god and humanity. Customize your god-aspirant and join one of three factions determining your ability set: Dark, Void, or Light. Set out into a miserable landscape to defeat vile creatures, and harness their souls and experience. Convert altars scattered across the land to your deity, and recruit more worshipers to your god. Human followers will clamor onto your back and help defeat enemies with blazing arrows. Sacrifice yourself to the divine and create a homunculus to invade other player’s worlds and steal their altars. Upgrade your Caos through a huge library of gear, changing your play style and equipping yourself with the wardrobe of a god.    Ascend: Hand of Kul Key Features:3 factions - choose between Light, Dark and Void, each with their own play style and skillset.Equipment - customize your Caos with a huge arsenal of gear , unlocking new equipment as you play.Player invasion - Sacrifice yourself to the gods and send a homunculus in your image to attack other player’s realms.Recruit Followers - claim religious altars scattered through the world, recruiting human followers to aid you on your journey.Active Combat - fight in real time, chaining attacks to rack up combos and earn more souls.Savage Lands Review;Made by company that made Kuls hands. Is good. Play.			"

								Incredibly fun, crafting and harvesting feels good,  fighting is a combo of archery, dodging, and blocking and feels super satisfying with the many different kinds of weapons. Most of the reviews say that mining sucks and takes forever, it takes like 30 seconds to mine a fair amount of tin and coal (important resources early game) with a rock ._. Pretty sure everyone who is submitting reviews about mining speed either never upgraded their hammer or just decided to try and skip progression and mine the highest tier stuff with a rock. If you follow the progression mining takes almost no time at all.Additionally, the game features randomly occuring bosses and unique items, makes it feel a little like first person terraria, especially with the game's focus on PVE.TLDR: if you are a KOSing scrub from rust,dayz,etc go elseware, this is PVE (E FOR EVIRONMENT, NOT PLAYER), if you remember playing games like terraria with your friends fondly, you will probably like this alot. Totally recommend the game, especially for the current price on humble bundle (<$6.00 with other games in a bundle)			"

								As of 30/08/2016 this game has a few glitches as expected of early access but they are minor enough to skip and not even mention the games got nothing but good points to it, the start is a challange like you would hope and artwork in game is well done and constantly evolving with active dev team doing updates making the game feel even more cared for and very promicing.another good point with the game is that the community is very friendly you find your odd idiot in game as you expect with any online game but majority are just happy to have others in to play and build a community . the weapon system is vast and later game can start to be more interesting as you pick things you want to do more and be more at home with where many items are .id strongly reccomend giving this game a try if your into the survival type of game its fast become one of my fave games to play and im happily investing time into it i look foward and hope to see many more in the savage lands.

Early Access Review
								I purchased this game a year ago. To see the amount of content and updates they've done since then is nothing but astonishing. They have upgraded the graphics quite a bit. They've added so much land mass it is easy to get lost, but that's a good thing.They've added bosses, several of them. They've also added unique/named weapons you can find or loot. The crafting in this game is awesome. This is very similar to The Forest in the way of gameplay. One of the few things lacking are gates for the fences, as well as being able to freely build your own structures. So far you have to choose different buildings and set them down and then add the resources to complete them. I highly recommend this game. As much as they've worked on it since last year, I look forward to what is next to come.			"

								Awsome game thusfare with an even greater potential! The building system and survival is much like that on The Forest and the gameplay and themes are quite a lot like Skyrim- rather reminisant of it with Frostfall and Basic Neads and Diseases...        Great game although it would be cool to have a slightly larger array of enemies than Undead and Wolves but I don't think there is much doubt that new enemies will be introduced throughout the course of the games Alpha. DEFINATELY RECCOMEND!!			"

Early Access Review
								After a shipwreck I woke up in a beach of some unknow place. I found traces of living people there. Huts, gathered food and even some much needed tools. But I saw nobody. I took their things hoping they could one day forgive a man doing what he needs to survive.Along the shore there were a couple campfires, but I lacked the resources to light them up. Or maybe I did, but didn't want to use them just for the sake of seeing fire. At least not yet. The cold winds never cease their attacks on me.Leaving the sand behind, I adventured to the wilderness. Abundant pine trees waved welcomes to me and I welcomed some deers - I mean, running food AND resources. I've never imagined I would kill a living creature with my own hands, but it happened and I am alive now because of that. Later I found a village. Finally! I was excited to see signs of real civilization closing in on the horizon as I dashed with all of what was left of my strength. Not a single living creature. And that meant two things:1- The people who lived here either left or died.2- Some of those who stayed behind (and died) are not very found of foreigners.So I had to face skeletons armed with just a stone axe. Luckly, they were in a shape far worse than mine. The sun left my world, the cold snow masked everything in a beautiful and deadly white and my mind wondered what would happen to me if I were to perish here. Would I become one of them?I didn't feel good. I could say I felt the heat leaving my body, but there weren't even traces of it in me. I've heard of peopple who froze to death. What happened to them. The blurry sight, weakness, shaking. The air was ice and it burnt my lungs with every breath. I couldn't go much further. But even before my fall, I witnessed a gigantic winged craeture soaring the skies.I died then. It was my first day. But somehow I was there again. The familiar beach. I don't understand this. Is it hell? Am I condemned to freeze to death every day? I hope not. I don't think so. What the devils don't know is that I am getting better, adapting, learning to survive and I will have my revenge.__________________________________________Think of this game as hardcore minecraft. You struggle to survive and have to juggle your health, hunger, cold, explorations, building, crafting and resource hunting. Good luck!Oh, and get a friend to play it with you.			"

								Savage Lands, at first sight i pictured another average survival spin-off but this game is actually very original in a lot of ways. Its fun and challenging which adds to the over satisfaction its not just stupidly difficult gameplay on top of impossible  odds. The devs from what i hear are very very interested in user feedback and keep diologue rolling with many gamers which is exactly how it should be. I love the crafting and building system, it gives you the feeling the island is yours for the taking and truly it is. The only downside is as you start reaching out for minerals and expanding you get the feeling the island is very small. However even though the island is small by my standards it is packed with action you cant walk for 30 seconds without seeing some form of life. Nightfall is another fun addition i wish it was darker making the torch an absolute necessity but we'll see where they go with it. Some users say its too difficult i find that to be untrue. Just remember survivors, preparation is everything. dont go out fighting forest giants in your skivvies with a rock tied to a stick.			"

								This game has a really awesome and unique feel to it, as others have said. it’s bleak, but that just adds to the feel for me, makes you feel very isolated. The whole lore is cool to, and the crafting system seems pretty solid, not to hard to craft stuff, but not hours of grinding hard either.  	Basically, it’s visually appealing, not the best graphics ever but the environment is epic. The combat system is okay. As it is a survival game it’s top notch keeping you interested in a deep world. The game seems to be advancing well, with good updates frequently, and a good team running it. This game has some serious potential.			"

								I am really enjoying this! Haven't really gotten into survival games in the past, but I decided to try this out with my boyfriend and am really enjoying it! It is addicting! Of course, I really hope they add in a female option, I would really like to play as one, but that doesn't take away from the game at all. I really like the crafting system, it is user-friendly and you can make some really cool stuff. Also like how you build, you choose a building, for example a stone house, then pick where you want it. Once placed, it is a simple outline of what the house will look like, then you interact with it and add in the materials needed. If you don't have all the materials, you go out and find stone/wood/etc and then go back and add it to the house. It really feels like you are carrying building materials to a site, kinda life-like. As you add in the materials needed, the building starts to be fleshed out, and once you're done it is complete. I am also enjoying the updates/patches, its interesting to see the game evolve and improve from the first version I played. Also the development team is very involved with the fans and take into consideration everyones comments/suggestions and what players want in the game.Great survival game!			"

								This game may have potential, but initial impressions are not all that good. The graphics are lame, granted, I'm sure there are a lot of place holders, but still, lame all around. Combat is pedestrian and I'm beginning to think these slow moving, open world, survival games just aren't for me. The Elder Scroll games however hold my attention much more. I only bought Savage Lands because it's currently on sale, I'm so glad I didn't pay full price.

								i absolutely love this game the SUPER EASY server making to the good amount of enemys to the shear fear the isolation gives you but there are some ideas i want to give make it to were there are villagers in the village or survivers after the dragon attacked like skyrim to help with the isolation and there should be a system of blocking and also making a sheild also a system of taking souls from monsters and being able to enhance you or your equipment like a wolf to enhance speed the boar to add a ability to charge at enimies and hit them with the sheild the bear would be shear attack and defense and the plague versions would enhance even more on the original the dragon would be controlling fire completely like summining it and another idea allow us to make farms and add magic like frost manipulation a little bit but you would need a spell book and also make it to where you could enchant weapons like minecraft			"

								The game is pretty good, they do update everyweek and the community is pretty good, the majority of people that make bad reviews are those who die a lot and then complain because the end game wasn't handed to them. You can really play this game however you want but the most efficent method would probably be to grind out some resources a bit and craft up some good armor and then use good tactics vs AI so your not constantly scavaging for food and bandages. And in all honestly for $15 dollars this game can easily occupy your time and make the money you spent worth it, they defintly have some big updates coming in for magic & pets (though don't quote me on that because it is ea but there is a lot of talk about it on forums and on their streams so good chances) as well as a big part of lore coming in. I have bought copies for my friends and we come back to it every now and then as it develops to see more content and end game creatures to kill and loot and then to see what lore has popped up.9/10 Good Game but like anything can always use more improvements ;)			"

								This game may have potential, but initial impressions are not all that good. The graphics are lame, granted, I'm sure there are a lot of place holders, but still, lame all around. Combat is pedestrian and I'm beginning to think these slow moving, open world, survival games just aren't for me. The Elder Scroll games however hold my attention much more. I only bought Savage Lands because it's currently on sale, I'm so glad I didn't pay full price. I don't usually buy Early Access games, but I do think it's important to support the games that have potential. I'm going to recommend this game anyway, purely due to it's potential, but please know that it is very much still in development.

Early Access Review
								I am generally fairly skeptical about recommending a game that is in early access, but I would say that this game is worth the $19.99 (and definitely worth it while on sale) right now.The game is very harsh, you can die to hungry and freezing. You can die from packs of wolves (or even the solo wolves right in the beginning). As you collect materials you can upgrade your gear (i.e. better armor and weapons).The melee combat system *feels* very rewarding currently, it is a little easy to sidestep and run around some monsters, but you can almost feel the swing of a weapon. I am not a huge fan of the bow in the game, mainly due to the large arc (I feel the arrow should arc a bit slower than it is currently, but am confident the devs will find a happy medium somewhere).I would say the best part of the game is the sound, it is extremely immersive. You can hear the wilderness, everything just sounds great. All of the mobs have distinct sounds, deer wander through the forest making huge ruckuses. You will probably not hear wolves until it is too late, and the howl of the plagued wolf before it pounces will literally send a shiver down my spine.There are a few issues, mainly not having floors in buildings so you need to find very flat land to build and the mobs not interacting with each other in any meaningful way.Obviously the game is still Early Access, and you have to be prepared for some bugs, but the game is in a very playable state and looks to be a great foundation to build a truly epic game.

Early Access Review
								The game was a little difficult at first...kept dying every few minutes till I got the mechanics of ""surviving"" down. Key was to stay calm and patient, and ""think"" it out, which is what I really like best about the game. Rather than just keystrokes and repetitive actions, you have to strategize what you're doing to make real progress. I've discovered the five main towns of the island and monolith and had some lethal interactions with the ""wild"" life  LOL but have improved my hunting skills considerably since first starting the game. My advice, play with a friend, be patient, and give the game a chance...it becomes addictive pretty fast. Still lots of bugs that need tweaking but programmers seem to be going through that list little by little. Some realistic features are in place, while things like needing water to survive and being able to tear down already made wooden structures for kindling and making fires, or just removing them isn't in place yet. But like I said...solid game, looking forward to final edition.			"

								So far so good, its alot like Forest , except so far not so creepy as Forest , Forest really creeps me out. Although it has become better in the latest updates. I will def post a  more informative review when I have a few more hours in it. I died once when I went outside to smoke and didnt pause it so not sure what killed me.Then I had ZERO cold bar left when I managed to get the fire lit....I do like the sounds and the ambience , the devs did well on that.O now that I have some time in it, I definitely like it. I also find I enjpoy it much more than Forest. Not that I dont like Forest because I def do. It is just a bit on the frustrating side. This game gives me a feeling of accomplishment and I feel it is doable. I guess my only complaints so far is it is so hard to maintain a sense of direction and you can get lost quickly. Also it would be nice to have a mouse sensitivity adjustment as I feel like Im drunk when I play and would love to be able to slow the mouse movement down. I did on my end but in game is still far too sensitive.Right now I have to add that a save game function would be nice. If you exit the game u go back to where u were at that moment but if you die you are dropped on the beach and have to run like hell to wherever your corpse is to retrieve your accumulated gear. But maybe this adds to the game in some way. I did find an entire village the last time I died on the way back to my corpse, sadly 2 wolves found me before I could get back.			"

								So far so good, its alot like Forest , except so far not so creepy as Forest , Forest really creeps me out. Although it has become better in the latest updates. I will def post a  more informative review when I have a few more hours in it. I died once when I went outside to smoke and didnt pause it so not sure what killed me.Then I had ZERO cold bar left when I managed to get the fire lit....I do like the sounds and the ambience , the devs did well on that.O now that I have some time in it, I definitely like it. I also find I enjpoy it much more than Forest. Not that I dont like Forest because I def do. It is just a bit on the frustrating side. This game gives me a feeling of accomplishment and I feel it is doable. I guess my only complaints so far is it is so hard to maintain a sense of direction and you can get lost quickly. Also it would be nice to have a mouse sensitivity adjustment as I feel like Im drunk when I play and would love to be able to slow the mouse movement down. I did on my end but in game is still far too sensitive.Right now I have to add that a save game function would be nice. If you exit the game u go back to where u were at that moment but if you die you are dropped on the beach and have to run like hell to wherever your corpse is to retrieve your accumulated gear. But maybe this adds to the game in some way. I did find an entire village the last time I died on the way back to my corpse, sadly 2 wolves found me before I could get back.			"

								This is the first game that I have played so far that has caused me to actually be wary of nightfall. This has a Dark Souls-esque feel to it in that it is not easy to progress, but each little milestone makes it worthwhile. It can be a little systematic in that you gather, build, gather, build, wait for night to finish, then repeat in the beginning stages of the game (I'm still there now), but that dragon likes to remind me that I'll have to get a little more adventurous when I'm better equipped.On the very first night, I was attacked by a canine (still trying to figure out what kind of mob it was) and killed. That was a wake-up call, if there ever was one. Be careful; pay attention to the different sounds you hear. But, I'm a fan of this, just for that fact. To be honest, the beginning in this game is a lot harder than the beginning of Dark Souls. I might be too early in the game to actually tell, but from what I see, the most there is for weather is snow and clear skies. I think it would be nice to have other conditions, such as rain and thunderstorms. Maybe even add different seasons into the game, with each season having signature weather? All in all, I'm a fan of the game so far, and I'm only a few hours into it.			"

								I don't know whether to recommend this or not. I got it to play with friends, which it accomplishes, but other than that it's just a extremely hard to keep up with survival game that erases everything you build or work for when you log off (Of course it is in early access) You almost cannot do anything as you go hungry or cold within a few minutes of exploring. Like You eat, leave the fire to find more food and are starving and almost frozen within 5 minutes or so. I did not like that part. I hope they put some sort of goal or missions maybe in the final and maybe some more stuff to do. Otherwise it is like a realistic minecraft.			"

								Been looking forward to a survival game in this genre and first impressions are very good. Its a very playable game and for an alpha has a lot of potential.If i was to be picky I would say it was a bit frustrating gathering all the items to make armour/clothes and to loose them after being hit a couple of times and found myself running around in my loin cloth with my armour in my backpack but  even that hasn't dulled the experience so far( the best bit was at night coming face to face with  skellie fully armoured with glowing red eyes that was a jump scare) very immersive and enjoyable to play look forward to many more hours play time.

								After playing this game a lot more, I can tell that the quality of this game is great for an early access game!The survival is real, the feel of the creatures etc is great and you can get used to solo pretty easy, but doesn't mean to say it won't be a hard journey.There are still a few things to be done on it which they look set to work on due to already having the first update. I recommend this game is you love survival/medieval/fantasy style and all that.9/10			"

								If anything, you will see ""has potential"" in many reviews and they are all right.  Savage Lands screams potential and the progress that has been made so far is excellent.They patch often, they talk with their community and clearly there is a passion to push new features and ideas.Pros: -Nice open world that really immerses you into the idea that this is a nasty, cold, bitter and deadly place.      -The Day and Night cycle.  Learn to fear the night      -Crafting system       -Mulitplayer ( coop with friends of FFA servers with potential non-friends :P )      -There be giants and dragons..oh yes! ( and undead, nasty wolves, yummy boars )Cons:  Since early alpha they have improved the UI, performance and crash issues with zeal and while there are still FPS isses near water and some weather clipping effects, from a performance stand-point the game is running well for my rig which is 2.5 years old.   I know you already know this but again, this is Early Access, so this is more of a ""love to have"" list rather than a product critique      The main CON is features and content      LOVE to have sooner than later     -repair buildings when I find them     -repair my own armor     -upgrade buildings ( AKA: Skyrim )     -oil/fat as a resource to make lamps for internal lighting of houses     -dungeons     -Larger structures like enemy castles ( NPC or player controlled )     -Build walls     -Furniture such as a Bed and then being allowed to sleep through the nightThe list goes on but those are the top ones for me.All in all I've had a blast playing and dying, and dying and....running for my life freezing to death with undead chasing me in a snow storm at night.It's fun!

Early Access Review
								Well, i have to say that so far i am pleasantly pleased with the game. It adds some suspense, and keeps you on the move to survive, at least for the first while so far, although i am only into it for just over an hour at this point. The odd thing can be found but for the most part its a fairly balanced grind to find the items needed to craft improved weapons and armor, of which they are fairly diverse in visuals, which is nice to see. You dont have infinite storage, you really have to earn your stoarge capacity from what i can see, so be choosy on what you pick up or need to keep, as bag space will keep you working until you have crafted some good quality packs, and some storage lockers. Its got a nice older gritty feel to its graphics, yes its not the be all end all, but im more into immersion from my games. That leads me to sounds, they have done well, directional and atmospheric audio, you can actually get warnings of directions you may not wish to go, or you may find that illusive deer by its call. A good headset will allow you to avoid, or go right to, the spot you need to.The server sizes are small, and its easy to work together, as opposed to the KOS style of larger servers where everyone feels they have to fight eachother to survive. This seems more oriented toward a group based survival againt the elements, nature, and mythology :)I haven't run into anything gamebreaking or glitching, so far everything works well, and its just a matter of time til i can progress to where i feel safe and secure in the game, so i will definately keep playing this one and give it my approval. Looking forward to playing with a few of you soon.			"

								Difficult and frustrating, the goals and targets in the game are constantly being moved. It's like the game designers are building it just for themselves, a private club. You die - a lot - for no other reason than bad luck. And there are so many chances that you have to take. You can't save a game and to die, even if you've cached stuff, is to lose everything. So you end up playing conservatively. You don't take risks, so exploration is in a way discouraged. I suppose if you keep at it you'll get somewhere. There are a lot of smug players in forums to seem to feel that way, but I found it to be all so frustrating that I didn't keep at it. The highest I ever got was to build a smithy, then they regened the game and deleted my character and I had to start all over again.			"

There are so many bugs with things turning invisible, no animals spawning for a food source, enemy ai working occasionally, etc that you never know when you will even remotely get an enjoyable experience out of it.

Sure alot of it is most likely due to co-op rather than a full open world with everyone cluttered but there is just something about this that feels good.

								Tremendous promise here, but not much to see yet. You have far too little control over your success / failure. You will die a lot. Dying often in survival games is usual and customary; the problem here is that long stretches of accomplishing and learning next to nothing are punctuated by the relentless death / respawn cycle. Soon enough, you're going to find yourself looking at the clock, wondering why there's so little happening.Navigation is virtually impossible. If you start on the beach and cannot fix your position within a minute or two: give up. Leave whatever bits you've found lying in a pile on the beach and then walk directly into the icy surf to drown yourself. On the subsequent respawn, try again. Exploring new stretches of beach is pointless. You will usually spend the entire time it takes to die of exposure, walking down barren stretches of sand without finding _any_ supplies or crafting materials.Armour doesn't last nearly as long as it takes to collect the materials to craft it. You will spend most of your time sporting a ragged loincloth and worn flint axe, running away from wolves. Fun for a bit! Really. But it doesn't get better.Most combat triggers a bleeding condition, but there's no cloth to be found to craft bandages. Your avatar will simply stand there and watch himself bleed until he falls over, dead.Gathering materials for crafting: forests without sticks, boulder fields without stones, plains without edible plants.Most crafting recipes require a forge ... and you can't make a forge. But! There's a forge in the first town: Argo. However, you'll need post-introductory gear (read: crafted with non-trivial materials and a forge) or tremendous luck to survive long enough to find Argo. A vicious chicken-and-egg joke, shot through with the soon-to-be-all-too-familiar pointless death / respawn cycle.</sigh.>I'll be back. Again: tremendous promise here, but it's just not ready. Even for the players that are willing to endure much to support and explore indie survival games.			"

								PC SPECS: Cpu: 3.7Ghz Gpu:r9 380 1050Mhz 8Gddr5 RAM: 16GB DDR3 1.6GhzOkgraphics:colors are washed out. runescape has more charm in it's simplistic form.Performance/smooth gameplay:chopping/clipping it feels like you are lagging even in single player.multi-player performance:laggs often.gameplay:the only insitive you have to get more resources is to get to the next section of the realm. while remaining hopeful the game has more to offer when it doesn't. grab these things assemble these things to live in this realm to do the same thing again. bosses are easy just requires a good rock to stand on because the path-finding system is so generic and static.worst early access game i've played yet.1 being its not even a game. 10 being i'll never put it down, the dream game.2.5/10.0 "

								Skyrim meets Darks Souls meets Don't Starve.  One of the main reasons why this game is getting bad reviews right now is people can't handle the steep learning curve.  This game is made to be difficult and being so early in development isn't making the difficulty any easier.  So if you buy this game, expect a challenge.Now with all that in mind this game is still very early access so there are things that really don't make any sense like the deersharks and the fact that you can't craft forges, but these are all things that they already plan on fixing.  If you decide to buy this game expect issues, expect to be annoyed at the quirks, but also be pleasantly surprised at the amount of regular developer feedback.If Signal and Digital DNA Games keeps up this level of feedback (weekly streams and Q&A's) and development continues at roughly the same pace as it's been up to now this will be a very solid title.  With Digital DNA's history on Xbox, the fact that they continued development on games like Castleminer and Castleminer Z for years after they were released and even going so far as to try to bring CMZ to the PC I have full confidence that this title will get just as much dedication.

								Not at this time happy with this game and expected more but then again after playing games like the long dark since early release Ive been spoiled.If your thinking of getting this game then i suggest you wait a while (maybe a month) until they fix it and make the content more enjoyable because spending your whole time focused upon a fire and food is not my idea of fun...

								Excellent game, but quite unforgiving.  a slight miscalculation can lead to death very easily.  Watch your resources carefully.  Otherwise, this game gives all that you need for fun alone or with a group.  I would love to see a dedicated server in the future, but is very playable even now.			"

								I'll be honest with you. I haven't played this game very long at all but I do like this game and anybody who says they are getting spawnkilled by the dragon or it takes too long to cut trees or mine rocks must be quite stupid or have problems with the game. I manage to cut down a tree in ten seconds and mine rocks in thirty seconds. That is not long and the dragon doesn't even spawnkill you, a great tip would be to not go near the damn dragon tower where he swoops down and burns you alive. "

								Do you like jumpy gameplay, and poor ui? Insainely loud noises for the most minor actions (ie opening the menu)? This is the game for you. I understand it's early access but the trailer is very misleading. VERY MISLEADING. You know that awesome dragon? You can't actually get to it. And even if you could, walking feels like a chore with massive framerate drops.There are no dedicated multiplayer servers, the combat is boring, and there is no back story.The game has potential, but I'd wait to see if it lives up to it, as it needs A LOT of work. And at the current price it is not worth the risk./channel/UC8lVVHl_HfOVLP4aedQXQxg is where I review Steam games, especially during sales, to let you know if they're worth the price.			"

								Neat concept, has a lot of potential. But right now you spend WAY too much time gathering resources just to refill your bon fire. They need to speed the rate of advancement, dramatically. Once I start a bon fire, I should NEVER have to refill it. Who cares how realistic that is, this is a video game, for fun. It's not supposed to be work. You can't use your shelter, not sure what good it is when you can't even use it. Granted, I only built the bottom tier shelter as a hut was too difficult to get resources for. Not enough time in the day, literally. Has a long way to go yet, for instance mining things like wood shouldn't take so long. Just becomes a drag.			"

Early Access Review
								Given that this was an early access title, I went into it with low expectations.  But even those expectations were too much.  The art, the playable content, the direction, even the setting... none of it is finished.  And while that may be fine (After nearly two years of development), if the core mechanics underlying it all just worked.  But they don't.  The screenshots are in no way indicative of the actual gameplay.  While the graphics and much of the setting is represented, many of the basic models or concepts (group mobs for instance) don't exist in the game.  Overall, the game starts out slightly difficult due to poor gameplay prompts.  It then falls into being one of the easiest games I've ever played.  Until you get to the end game content, at which point you'll no longer have any hope of even slightly progressing without a fully geared multiplayer party to join you.  You'll also lose your progress.  Frequently.  To stuck characters, to unaccessable places, to inescapable enemies who plant their flag in your dead♥♥♥♥♥to prevent you from recovering anything. And you'll consistantly lose everything to unexplainable bugs where your corpse just disappears on respawn.  This developer has a cheap one-size html template website.  They have no real discussion boards or discord, a poorly run trello that doesn't in any way fit the role of a project tracker, and they seemingly have no direction at all with the project.  It's already gone through one major overhaul and platform upgrade, and has still yet to see major setting changes.  And this is after nearly two years of development?  I understand not being done, but it's not even close.  And after this long in development, the only excuses are incompetance, mismanagement, and plain ♥♥♥♥ery.  Don't buy this game in early access.  Wait to see if it ever gets done first.			"

								The fact that there isn't a lot of information or guides online only adds to the mysterious survival atmosphere of the game. Very buggy and can't get 60 fps even on the lowest settings but at least it hasn't crashed once yet. If Signal Studios focuses on the combat and adding bosses and special enemies this game will stand out from other survival games in a good way.Well worth the 1$ it cost me on Humble Bundle.			"

								I played this game a long time ago (year or two?) and have started to play again with a new character in the updated, expanded world.  I enjoyed it before, but there was much to expand on and complete still.  I'm really happy to see that it's not been given up on like some other early access games sometimes are.  This game has a lot of promise and has become a blast to explore and build in.I play on my own and with my partner and it's been one adventure after another - trying to survive, trying to build, trying to explore, and hunting new nodes, beasts, and being hunted by even bigger things yet - ""Just wait 'til I get my next gear upgrade, pesky critters!""  It's explorational, keeps you on your toes, and challenging without levels while encouraging cautious bravery so that you may conquer that which you've discovered.I didn't take much time to write this review and shall likely update it later, but I just wanted to send good will toward this game as the creators continue working on it to make it what it is meant to be.

								i bought this for 7.99 and it is ealsily one of the better survile titles out there. it starts off in much the same manner as ark, on a beach with no cloths or tools, the added challenge here is that you are in a tundra as opposed to a dinosaur filled jungle. the lack of dinos would make this game's enimies easier save for the presence of at least one dragon. overall, if you were to take the story, freindly npcs and overpowered gear in skyrim and replace them with a fairly challenging but still fun survival mechanic, signifigantly stronger enemies, and a crushing sence of lonelyness, you would have a clone of this game.oh yeah and multiplayer...there's that too.

I won't tell you what the game is about because you can Google that. I will however tell you that it is worth at least 15 euros. This game is difficult! You will die, you will fail. However, when you've figured out the mechanics, it is tons of fun.The only thing I would wish for is more content: more blueprints (houses, walls, traps), more enemies, more fighting patterns and I would love to see skills added to this game. I have been playing with friends, which I can advise, but you can perfectly solo this game as well.So, looking for a difficult (indie) survival game? This is for you.			"

Early Access Review
								Savage Lands is a work in progress, but it is worth your support.  You start play naked and alone on a hostile shore.  Your health declines due to the cold, and you need to eat to maintain stamina so you can run.  When you start out, the learning curve is steep and it takes a while before you get the hang of things, so you die, respawn and go and retreive your lost gear and try try again.  The game is unforgiving, and that is the charm of it.  If it were easy you would get bored of it very quickly.  To the Devs credit they are responsive and hands on and release changes ever week or two in my experience.  This is not Skyrim, it is its own beast, but frankly it has things that Skyrim would have benefitted from such as there being a point to eating and staying warm.  By the time this game is finished I think it will be pretty excellent.			"

								The fact that there isn't a lot of information or guides online only adds to the mysterious survival atmosphere of the game. Very buggy and can't get 60 fps even on the lowest settings but at least it hasn't crashed once yet. If Signal Studios focuses on the combat and adding bosses and special enemies this game will stand out from other survival games in a good way.Well worth the 1$ it cost me on Humble Bundle.			"

								Savage Lands is a work in progress, but it is worth your support.  You start play naked and alone on a hostile shore.  Your health declines due to the cold, and you need to eat to maintain stamina so you can run.  When you start out, the learning curve is steep and it takes a while before you get the hang of things, so you die, respawn and go and retreive your lost gear and try try again.  The game is unforgiving, and that is the charm of it.  If it were easy you would get bored of it very quickly.  To the Devs credit they are responsive and hands on and release changes ever week or two in my experience.

								Fun survival game. You can see that it is made by just a few people. It might get repetitive at some point, but for now it's tons of fun. I won't tell you what the game is about because you can Google that. I will however tell you that it is worth at least 15 euros. This game is difficult! You will die, you will fail. However, when you've figured out the mechanics, it is tons of fun.The only thing I would wish for is more content: more blueprints (houses, walls, traps), more enemies, more fighting patterns and I would love to see skills added to this game. I have been playing with friends, which I can advise, but you can perfectly solo this game as well.So, looking for a difficult (indie) survival game? This is for you.			"

								So, my friends and I played this game for about 5 or so hours. We started small, built a shelter, found each other, one built houses, another gathered food, and another mined, and another did a bit of everything.It was really fun, we enjoyed playing the game, but we knew this was early access so we can't complain over a lack of content. We can't wait until we can actually fight the dragon as that mother fudger was chasing us everytime we ventured in land.Yet again, it is early access but the combat between players is VERY dodgy. The lag at times is very... crippling.I would recommend this game and I can't wait to see how it changes over time. Also, challenge for you - fight a bear with your bare hands ;v			"

								After nearly getting grilled by the dragon, I decided to call it a draw and concentrate on hunting bears.Then I got surprise-shagged by a bear for killing two of his pals.Respawned on the other side of the island in a shack in a very hostile area, got ambushed by 3 packs of wolves.Respawned again and got grilled by the dragon.Respawned and made it really far, then a pack of wolves jumped out of the bushes and decided to cuddle with me.10/10, would respawn again. (Tip: Place the pike in your house on the shore. Really.)Now, to ze serious part;• I like the inventory, it's organized nicely and for the most part it's also responding well• It's great that you're right away from the beginning thrown into having to survive with nothing at your hands, exept the stuff you find.• I'm glad this is in 1st-person. You're sneaking around in the forest and you have to look left and right; stop walking and listen to the sounds, trying to figure out if it comes closer and from which direction.  It makes the anxiety about being alone in this hostile environment much more atmospheric and cooler.Some random ideas;• Crafting a map from leather hides for example, that you can draw on (No auto-map).• Deconstructing weapons/tools/equipment that you no longer need and getting a few materials back.• What about planting trees and bushes with the berries or the nuts? Would be fun to have a bit of a somewhat constant source for food for now and then.Weird things;• I couldn't stack things in the box that you can craft.   If you try to drag one stack to the other one (like 8 stones to 4), it simply drops the one in the chest to the ground. Would be great if that could be changed.• There were a couple of times deers and wolves bugging on trees or bushes (They were rapidly turning from one side to the other, until I approached them so they'd run away).I enjoyed the game a lot so far and am interested in seeing how it will develop until it's ready for release~Defenitely worth a try, if you like that kind of games! Keep in mind though, it's still Early Access.			"

								I personally like the graphics in this game. Its all very dreary and lonesome. Makes you feel like your really stranded there. Plus the game has been updated quite a few times and is much different in a better way upon my return from months before. I believe many people own this game and are waiting for it to be golden to return in mass. Sadly the one con i have is the little amount of people on online servers. Because the game can be played in Singleplayer and then that world brought to multiplayer and or that character brought into other multiplayer worlds it is difficult to actually see that amount of players actually on.

								i bought this for 7.99 and it is ealsily one of the better survile titles out there. it starts off in much the same manner as ark, on a beach with no cloths or tools, the added challenge here is that you are in a tundra as opposed to a dinosaur filled jungle. the lack of dinos would make this game's enimies easier save for the presence of at least one dragon. overall, if you were to take the story, freindly npcs and overpowered gear in skyrim and replace them with a fairly challenging but still fun survival mechanic, signifigantly stronger enemies, and a crushing sence of lonelyness, you would have a clone of this game.oh yeah and multiplayer...there's that too.

Also its have strange community with fanboys, who cannot stand my previous bad review so much, that finally I decided to delete it just for a break from pointless, poisonous comments. But now I see that game in fact really gather bad reviews, so maybe the problem it's not with my impossibility to feel overwhaling joy while playing this game, but it's in fact very bad. I spended only 1.3 hours in this game and that was painfull experience. Totally not worth my time.			"

Early Access Review
								Given that this was an early access title, I went into it with low expectations.  But even those expectations were too much.  The art, the playable content, the direction, even the setting... none of it is finished.  And while that may be fine (After nearly two years of development), if the core mechanics underlying it all just worked.  But they don't.  The screenshots are in no way indicative of the actual gameplay.  While the graphics and much of the setting is represented, many of the basic models or concepts (group mobs for instance) don't exist in the game.  Overall, the game starts out slightly difficult due to poor gameplay prompts.  It then falls into being one of the easiest games I've ever played.  Until you get to the end game content, at which point you'll no longer have any hope of even slightly progressing without a fully geared multiplayer party to join you.  You'll also lose your progress.  Frequently.  To stuck characters, to unaccessable places, to inescapable enemies who plant their flag in your dead♥♥♥♥♥to prevent you from recovering anything. And you'll consistantly lose everything to unexplainable bugs where your corpse just disappears on respawn.  This developer has a cheap one-size html template website.  They have no real discussion boards or discord, a poorly run trello that doesn't in any way fit the role of a project tracker, and they seemingly have no direction at all with the project.  It's already gone through one major overhaul and platform upgrade, and has still yet to see major setting changes.  And this is after nearly two years of development?  I understand not being done, but it's not even close.  And after this long in development, the only excuses are incompetance, mismanagement, and plain ♥♥♥♥ery.  Don't buy this game in early access.  Wait to see if it ever gets done first.			"

There are great hits like: Thriller by Michael Jackson, Shiver by Coldplay, To the Sea by Jack Johnson, and many more! In addition, your wildest fantasies come true when your hot character strips to nothing but a loin cloth! Also, there are rocks!!! Not only do they dance, you can ride those babies for miles!!!

								Mixed Bag. I'm missing some rather basic things like clothes (why can't I make a warm jacket out of the wolfs pelt?), instead there''s a ton of weird armour. Same with the structures, I can make useless armour stands, but I can't make a fence? or a palisade?Some things are also very cheap, some others extremely expensive: chests or bows. Basically anything that needs sinews, because they're actually rare (a beast should maybe drop half a dozen of those, instead of the maybe one). The option to turn a whole hide into 3 sinews isn't really helping. You'd expect a lot more of them from a whole hide. Speaking of hide, why do I need one for a hammer? and so on. Seems rather unbalanced (and grindy) right now.Engine-wise, and from the look and feel of it, the game feels quite good.			"

								I just played this game and I'm going to tell you this and this only, do NOT buy this game even if you have great hardware. This game is not optimized at all and has several issues in which, from my experience, your frames per second in your video will NOT change. Whether it be from the lowest settings or the highest settings, my fps stays at around 11-13. Now as I said, this is from my experience, but that does not mean that you will be immune to it. I have relatively mid-high end hardware and your experience will be rather lacking with the object glitches coupled with lighting and sound latency. I had only played this game for 10 minutes, trying to ignore the poor optimization and performance issue, and I also want to note that the gameplay on it seemed rather bland as well.			"

								Alpha Review Into Early Access release -Great survival game with a fantasy (Skyrim) like setting!Obviously going into this game you will encounter a bug or two which is a given in a Early access game.With that said the game is great with constant updates and a dev team who talks and listens to its community.This game has great potential and is great to play with friends or family. Start out stranded on a beach with only a few supplies to get you started, collect materials to help you along the way so you don't freeze or starve to death.....or get slaughtered by the deadly inhabitants of ""Savage Lands""!I would suggest someone who is a fan of the survival genre and fantasy games get this! If my review doesn't sway you into getting this game then just read the fourms or check out their youtube channel to see what they want to eventually make this game into and I tell you what! When this game reaches its true form it will truly be EPIC! "

Savage LandsRecently exiled from my homeland, I find myself washed up on a beach, in a land filled with chilling cold winds. Nothing in this new place seems familiar.Maybe - just maybe - I could find shelter from this cold wind.Nothing seems as I remember, this new land is harsh, cold and savaged. Even the wildlife here seems to be savaged. Last time I went in land, I was chased by a fierce wolf, I barely made it out of there alive. Had it not been for my Frost fern bandage, I would surely have succumbed from the bleeding from the wound the wolf left as a gift on my right leg.Now all I really want to do is to stay alive, even if it means that I have to find shelter somewhere around the beach.At least then I can always have a lookout on ships sailing by here. Unfortunately, I have yet to spot any ships coming this way.The snow storm is still raging outside of my hut, so for now at least - all I can do is sit tight in here. However, I should probably get a plan going, seeing as it seems I will be stuck on this ravaged land for a long time. The cooked wolf meat are soon running out, and I think I spotted a few deer roaming a little further away from the hut. I might go out tomorrow and see if I can at least hunt one of the deer. Now is probably a good time to get some rest so I have a little strength for tomorrows hunting.Later that night a strange roar is heardWhat is that? That certainly did not sound like any sound I heard before. Could it be people using some kind of horn? Nay, I have yet to see anyone around here. Frankly I think I am all alone for now.As I wander outside, looking around - left, right, back and forth. I hear a faint flapping of wings. I brace myself, ready to seek shelter in the hut again. As I turn my head slowly, I notice the shadow on the ground in front of me.Holy smoke! A Dragon! I could have sworn these were only occurring in the folk tales. Stories told to children to keep the from going out at night. But right now, this shadow is roaming around my hut. Look at the size of that thing, it's almost 13 meters long, with a wing span of at least three tall men.I run back into the hut, panting and sweating at the sight of the fierce creature. "

								before the last update on 8\9\16 the game was alot of fun but also hard. now there are less creatures in the world but it is a glitch they are going to fix hopefully in the next update (whenever that is) for those of you thinking about getting this game if you enjoyed skyrim then the setting of this game is very much like that. tho it is a survival game/ adventure game.you start off on the small island of Snowmere. this is the beginning island. some of the mobs will kill you pretty easily at first but as you progress and build up your gear and base they get easier to hunt down.after you feel like you are geared up enough you can progress to the second island of Freydalyn. the island of Freydalyn is much much much bigger then the island of Snowmere. it is also set into 2 stages the first stage is the half of the island you start on while the second stage is the other half. i say stages because of the kinds of gear you can make and the creatures to kill on each half of the island. after a bit of time on the second island gearing up and killing mobs its time to go explore the third island. if you head to the faaaaar northern part of the island of Freydalyn you will come across a town, go ahead and explore i wont tell you how to get to the third island tho, just like i didnt tell you how to get to the second because exploring is half the fun ;)the third island is the island of Jormungahr (i know, i cant pronunce it either) this is the third and final (so far) island. on the island of Jormungahr, it is as close to hell as this game gets (lol) be ready to get killed at any second and always remember to RUN LIKE HELL. the mobs on this island WILL kill you. this third island is the hardest out of all three. its size is in between the sizes of the other 2 island. but dont be fooled by its size it is many times harder then both other islands put together. on the third island you can also get the best gear (if you survive long enough) and fight and hopefully kill the dragon ( no idea if he respawns tho but i think he does) by killing the dragon you can get dragon gear and wyrmslayer weapons but hes no push over. have fun, happy hunting and most of all beware the trees.

								Fun, good concept, it's an early access game on steam...I haven't played this game for very long but it's pretty fun. If you are into the first person terraria type games then go for it but it's an unfinished early access game on steam that might never be finished... I have had no problems running this game and my friend that has a terrible PC can run it just fine so I would say it's decently optimized. This is basically a skyrim mixed with minecraft type of game. It's fun once you get into it but it's only fun with friends. I would say you are better off getting Rust. It's cool that you can make your own server and play either by yourself or with friends. They are updating the game lots more and there is much more to come.Rating: 6.5/10			"

								You know how you're worried about all the early access games just releasing wayyy too early, and unsure if it will ever continue development? This game feels like it had 2 months of development, then released. The concept is fun and addictive, like a co-op survival morrowind (not really rust x skyrim)Except, youre on an island with trees and rocks. You can build crap melee weapons, attack seletons and get nothing from them. Attack wolves and deers. Cant really build or make anything much, nothing really to explore.Oh and the bears, oh god the bears.The hitboxes are INSANELY BAD, it looks like an enemy is standing 5 meters infront of you, and then they swing and hit you. The bears...the bears swing at you from 10 meters, and when you walk up to hit them, you automatically collide and push them back even further, whilst they still swing at you. Theres nothing to this game. Extremely rushed cash grab. I hope it turns into a sruvival dungeon crawler one day.			"

								I love the concept and I'm glad I've got in early. Savage Lands is going to revolutionize survival, fantasy, MMO and RPG's all rolled into one. They have to stay on task and listen to their fan base.Things that need fixed in my opinion:1. Food Gathering (I should be able to skin/quarter and use all aspects of any animal I slay, and not just get 1 meat)2. Free building. 3. Groups/Raids and Guilds. (Make that happen)4. More personalization of your character and different races if that's in the works (fantasy comes to mind)5. Better aiming system as it seems off to the right or it could be the camera. It just looks funky.Othe than that, rock on guys keep going.			"

								So far this has proven to be a very interesting game for me personally. It combines a lot of elements that I like from other games, but the devs still have work to do so maybe if you are on the edge about purchasing then keep your eye on it.If I were to sum up the feel of this game I would say it is very similar to Skyrim while taking a lot of elements from games such as Minecraft and Don't Starve. Essentially its a big sandbox with skyrim like feel and a lot of its own fun elements.Be warned however, right now the game does not seem to be very well optimized so expect frame drops if you aren't running a high end computer.There is no story, but a lot of the landmarks and actually geography is really cool-- stuff you really can't get from randomly generated worlds.

								I'd like to start off by saying that I really enjoyed this game when I first started playing it for what feels like almost 2 years ago. Now the game is still under development, past its expected release date. The new big island they've been working on apears to be in beta for almost 2 months now, and It almost seems like the game is dying. As of recent I've played 7 Days to Die, which is like 20 times better in comparrisan to this survival game. Crafting is better, construction is better (because its based on a block system instead of premade structures). Survival mode is better. I just want to say that originally I was really looking forward to this game being released but now I'm not so sure. If you want to spend your money on a good survival game, buy 7d2d not this buggy garbage.			"

Early Access Review
								So far this game is fun and sets itself apart from the other survival games with more of a fantasy feel to it. It’s harder and scarier than the rest (wolves -_-)  and that’s awesome. Bugs are easy to find only ANY early access game, one in particular that was annoying was dead creatures still making sounds… but it’s early access so pointing them all out in review is dumb. Max graphics could look better vegetation-wise especially on the trees since they look a little low poly. I hope to see more customization with the buildings and a craftable forge >.< unless I missed something; however, the weapons and armors are awesome! However, crafting certain items is a pain (like the hatchet) but you can still beat down a wolf with your barefists like a true man to get your sinew. This is a good early access game I do hope the dev team continues to update this game. It has a lot of potential… If you’re looking for a perfect game that gives you cookies don’t buy. If you’re looking for a game that’s different, fun, and is a little challenging to the average gamer… get it. Else – try the regular zombie or rust style survival games... GLHF			"

								Everyone has that one game that makes them wish Steam had a neutral rating, and this one is mine.I love the concept, and when playing it, it was actually quite fun. The issues are primarily in the playerbase, or lack thereof, so I'm going to be recommending this game for that (a negative rating is no way to gain players).Of course, there was one issue with the game itself I had. Progression feels a little bit off. There's a checklist of things you need to do, which is great, really gives you an idea of what you need to do. Of course, it gets kind of annoying when there's camps and towns absolutely EVERYWHERE giving you things you shouldn't have anywhere near as early as you get them. This could easily be fixed by lowerint the spawn rate on them (perhaps even making it some sort of slider when generating a world, to add or decrease difficulty). But with things like this everywhere, it seems pointless to make anything on your own.			"

								To me this game reminds me of  Skyrim with the ability to build and survive without a storyline or quests. Make no mistake I am not harping this game at all or calling it a copy cat. I love this game and they have a potential to make this game legendary. I hope they continue updating and expanding the game. I would love to eventually see NPCS, more housing options, armor, ect. In due time I'm sure of it! Keep up the good work guys.			"

								   I think it is a grate game for now, it still has work being put into it which is good. I want to ask of a few things first from the developers and then tell my expereince. If you could add a bed in the one of the next update that would be nice, i think it should add warmth and pass time by 6-8 hours. I also would like it if you could add in to where you could tame a young wolf with dear meat to have a pet, i think that would be cool.    Now from what i have experience, this game is a lot of survival and crafting. You, as said in other reviews, begin washed up on shore of the Sundreaded Isle with basic supplies at your disposal. Im glad that you give us basic stuff, that is good, other games throw you in without a tutorial or tools. You start with a cured flint axe, basic cloth clothing(replace as soon as possible) and a sac with food. you can biuld more sacs to  carry more, and you unlock more recipeies as you craft.    My advice would be to experiment with crafting and see what you get, you can only learn threw trial and error.  Also try to make a basic house(wooden shack) before night fall if you plan to move inland, you will need it for a retreat if attacked at night, i think you should stay around the shore for about 1-3 days and gather supplies on your first try. Again this game is in alpha so expect some thing to not work out so well, like how wooden logs have a tendency to roll threw everything. I do like this game and see lots of potential in it, but agian please take my requests of a bed and taming young wolves into thought.     One more thing, if you do plan to go inland on your first run, try to complete the beta objectives first so you can get a basic understanding of how the game works and try to get a bow or sword as soon as possible, there is village near the dragons tower with a forge you can use to craft till you biuld your own, just avoid the dragon if you can. That is all i have for now. I hope it was of some use to whoever reads it.			"

Having said that they absolutely need a map and sleeping bag/resurrection thing to be added like now.... I hate not knowing where I am or where I am really going... Drives me nutts lol.... Also there needs to be just one back pack not 6-7 small ones that also eat up inventory slots. needs more creatures to spawn and  monster variants and weapons. After first 5hrs of gameplay killing the regular creatures was easy the really hard ones impossible and collecting and crafting is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Devs need to check out some games like 7 days to die and ark those games are on the right track with inventory/ mods/ and crafting. I like the game want it to progress but with all that I see missing I am not sure this one will ever make it out of beta :/ </3			"

								This game are great loving it! A few changes there and here and it be good! since its pre-release? then theres a few bugs which ofc are espected.About the fps compared to other games out there you can get a fai fps to 40-60 easy.The crafting system could be improved, and more terms of swords to the early levels other thsn the Wolf' Bane which wasn't that easy neither hard to get since a coal bug was up.I feel like the game has a cool system and fairly easy achievments to get which don't require you slayed every monster 2000 times because that's just way to ****** up if you ask me.The game i hard to understand at first i got murdered by a wolf, starved to death , freezed to death, it was horrible ... but the games still fun and if you die, you can see where you died and not be like ""wheres my dead body?"" upon death you drop your head, that's a wonderful thing it shows how happy i am to get character customication to the game.it feels like maybe a little bit lack of late game content, i can get wrong now like i reached so far anyway.i would recommend this game and for 20 euros you get alots of fun and enjoyment and if you dind't like the game just ask for a refund, either way you missed out something cool if you liked skyrim, survivel , rpg anything! And by the way don't eat rotten meat it kills you more than it helps you!			"

								I'd like to start off by saying that I really enjoyed this game when I first started playing it for what feels like almost 2 years ago. Now the game is still under development, past its expected release date. The new big island they've been working on apears to be in beta for almost 2 months now, and It almost seems like the game is dying. As of recent I've played 7 Days to Die, which is like 20 times better in comparrisan to this survival game. Crafting is better, construction is better (because its based on a block system instead of premade structures). Survival mode is better. I just want to say that originally I was really looking forward to this game being released but now I'm not so sure. If you want to spend your money on a good survival game, buy 7d2d not this buggy garbage.			"

								This game is Early Access, and my review is based on development from time of purchase until time of review.Gameplay wise, very little has changed over the course of time. Glitches and bugs abound. There's not much content. Survival is incredibly difficult in a way that is unbalanced. It doesn't feel fun in any way whatsoever.It looks like this game has a ton of potential but the developers aren't reaching like they should be.Right now, I don't reccomend buying this game. Give it six months and check back. It's either going to get really good, or it's going to stay right here forever.			"

								Savage Lands, a game where wanna be Ewonks can spawn in your home at night whilst you're going through your inventory (which all three of the chests I made fell through the floor btw), you have to wait unit you freeze to death because you're stuck somewhere (be it a broken path, jumping on some rocks looking for coal or where ever), placement of things you want to out down is ridiculous at times, and loads very slowly on top being absurdly choppy once you finally load even with the graphics on the second best settings and lots of things turned off (though it will eventually get smoother, it tends to get choppy as you're exploring). There's not even a point to the game. Once you have the best weapons and armor and finally kill that obnoxious dragon that won't shut up as you're hunting for animals that seemingly don't respawn, then what?  Nothing, that's what. If anything this game is maybe worth $7 or $8 max. Honestly, just play Skyrim or the elder scrolls online now that there's no subscription and they've made a lot of updates if you really want to craft so bad. At least then you'll have better bows.

								Beta 0.8.0 updated review:Savage Lands has really started to evolve into something special. Around the launch of the public alpha I was a bit skeptical if this would really come together into a game with staying power. I liked their refreshing take on some of the more tired survival concepts, but it felt rough on a lot of fronts and some of the mechanics were overly burdensome (like 10 hammer swings per ore drop, yeesh). The developers have really come through for us, though. Every system has had a bit of polish and a new coat of paint. The game at it's core has not changed much, but pretty much all the little annoyances and bugs have been ironed out. Movement and combat feels very good now, gathering is much more fun and engaging, FPS is significantly more stable and the post processing and general graphical look is better. With the improvements made in the last 6 months or so, I really can't wait to see where this game goes. As it is, it is worth it's sticker price for sure. It no longer feels like a beta.			"

								Fun, good concept, it's an early access game on steam...I haven't played this game for very long but it's pretty fun. If you are into the first person terraria type games then go for it but it's an unfinished early access game on steam that might never be finished... I have had no problems running this game and my friend that has a terrible PC can run it just fine so I would say it's decently optimized. This is basically a skyrim mixed with minecraft type of game. It's fun once you get into it but it's only fun with friends. I would say you are better off getting Rust. It's cool that you can make your own server and play either by yourself or with friends. They are updating the game lots more and there is much more to come.Rating: 6.5/10			"

								Beta 0.8.0 updated review:Savage Lands has really started to evolve into something special. Around the launch of the public alpha I was a bit skeptical if this would really come together into a game with staying power. I liked their refreshing take on some of the more tired survival concepts, but it felt rough on a lot of fronts and some of the mechanics were overly burdensome (like 10 hammer swings per ore drop, yeesh). The developers have really come through for us, though. Every system has had a bit of polish and a new coat of paint. The game at it's core has not changed much, but pretty much all the little annoyances and bugs have been ironed out. Movement and combat feels very good now, gathering is much more fun and engaging, FPS is significantly more stable and the post processing and general graphical look is better. With the improvements made in the last 6 months or so, I really can't wait to see where this game goes. As it is, it is worth it's sticker price for sure. It no longer feels like a beta.			"

								This game has a LOT of potential. ATM its pretty fun ... but with the lack of content I can see how it will get old pretty quickly ... but even as is ... totally worth the money :)I am not sure how it would function at a 32 player game or even a PvP game ... as for it to be a PvP game it will need to rework the combat system entirely as atm it pretty much is just a hack and slash. But it is a FPS survival game with fantasy elements ... how can I ask for more!?Combat system is fun and even if it is a little bit grindy, like ALL open world survival games, I am still enjoying it and love the fact that the enemy mobs BAF and sneak up on you at times.Crafting system is fun and logical ... you can't find out how to craft things until you have the mats.Survival ... really is that. It has the best qualities of don't starve is a superior format. It needs some work as I think that crafting of food recipes would be great and also farming etc... but that may be something they will look at later and totally not needed now. Mulitplayer is capped out at 8 people ... which some people are crying over ... but seriously 8 players is a zerg in this game and you could just kill everything too easily ... will be interesting to see how they change things when they do up the server pop limit ...The map ... there isn't one ... so it's explore and mark your way ... they do have a compass which helps ... but it doesn't help you when you are dead :PMorale of the story ... I have played 1 character and I haven't died yet ... so if you have read a review of people crying about how impossible it is ... they are noob squeekers so ignore those negative reviews.Top work guys on this game thus far... was actually really surprised how good it actually was.Please keep at it and keep developing ... I mean you could totally turn this in to a game with expansion packs and larger worlds and magic and range combat and cities and siege and omg the world is your oyster ... can't wait to see my first Dragon and really looking forward to seeing some Dungeons.Only negative comment atm is that armor still needs some tweaking ... but that is just an alpha issue and wouldn't be something that should stop ANYONE from buying a game ... unless they are a squeeker and then go hack in rust or somethng.

								I dont normally do EA anymore since the last few years its become a method of grabbing money from customers and gamers and ripping them off, However I decided I would give this a try after researching it some, and I have to say SO FAR, I am glad I did, and as long as the developers dont stop developing this game has amazing potential and fun!!! one of the best EA survival games to date including better then H1Z1's release and cash grab. I highly recommend this game , it has some bugs yes but WELL WORTH 15 bucks, I got it on sale, and definetly will be worth 25 later. Do remeber its ""pre alpha"" not really ""EA"" unless you mean early Alpha, but the game runs great dispite a few bugs, its very hard yes, which I love , challenging is great, they need to tweak the durability of items so they dont break in one fight, right now the best armor in the game is broken in a single fight with a bear which is a quite hard fight and im glad just need to make your items not break so quickly, makes it almost impossible to keep up and in gear, the game is well worth what they are asking right now. No way to go wrong unless the developers run off and stop developing it.UPDATE 3/11/15The game is very fun, the mobs are amazing thus far, the building as far as the houses and stuff go are all just premade designs nice ones but generic.I see a lot of people complaining they cant get food, stones etc, or hunt becuase they have no weapon, these are all crys from people who are ignorant to the game and dont know how to read if they cant figure it out for themselves, you can in fact kill wolfs, deer with your fists ive done it many times and stones are EVERYWHERE, not to mention there are campsites premade and old ruins everywhere that spawn gear , food and armor.The isnt easy by any means if you are a instant gratifcation type who refuses any work to get somewhere in a game you might want to walk away from this one, its not for the timid or the rage quitters, this game naked is very easy once you figure out how everything works to survive and build up.You drop all of your gear on death, however if you learn quickly how to make respawn totems which are easy enough, you can get your gear back, but die in a unknown area good luck, I lost like 5 bodies when I first started not realizing your first make you are given some starter gear, die and respawn and you are naked.The cold enviornment in this game makes it essential to keep a campfire going or get some really decent armor made which you wont get done right away, so campfires will be your friend, especially at night, the temperature drops drasticly and is a death sentence if you dont have a campfire or at least a house with decent armor, not starter armor.

								After only 6.6 hours (unfortunately) I haven't even scratched the bottom of this game, so let's review the things I did touch.Survival mechamics,These seem solid, It's a nice mix of keeping things difficult without making it tedious, annoying or restrictive.The game could do with a thirst mechanic but the system in place is perfectly fine.Combat,For it's genre the combat is great, I haven't fiddled around with bows and shields but the two hands mechanic works very well.Since I play the game coop/friendly only I haven't encountered any pvp combat.Multiplayer,Here is where things get interesting, the server hosting mechanic works really well, not requiring port forwarding for me and having near instant connection with friends and strangers alike.Early access,The game is currently in early access it will have bugs (I lost a character once) and it patches about once or twice every month or so, so progress can be lost.However there is a neat little timer showing the time to the next patch, and I have personally never noticed it being wrong.I love the ability to play the game in early access and all the usual 'issues' with early access seem to elude this game.All in all, for me, the game works very well, it's solid, lag free and very light on bugs and issues10/??? I should play some more and see what else the game has to offer.			"

Early Access Review
								I dont normally do EA anymore since the last few years its become a method of grabbing money from customers and gamers and ripping them off, However I decided I would give this a try after researching it some, and I have to say SO FAR, I am glad I did, and as long as the developers dont stop developing this game has amazing potential and fun!!! one of the best EA survival games to date including better then H1Z1's release and cash grab. I highly recommend this game , it has some bugs yes but WELL WORTH 15 bucks, I got it on sale, and definetly will be worth 25 later. Do remeber its ""pre alpha"" not really ""EA"" unless you mean early Alpha, but the game runs great dispite a few bugs, its very hard yes, which I love , challenging is great, they need to tweak the durability of items so they dont break in one fight, right now the best armor in the game is broken in a single fight with a bear which is a quite hard fight and im glad just need to make your items not break so quickly, makes it almost impossible to keep up and in gear, the game is well worth what they are asking right now. No way to go wrong unless the developers run off and stop developing it.UPDATE 3/11/15The game is very fun, the mobs are amazing thus far, the building as far as the houses and stuff go are all just premade designs nice ones but generic.I see a lot of people complaining they cant get food, stones etc, or hunt becuase they have no weapon, these are all crys from people who are ignorant to the game and dont know how to read if they cant figure it out for themselves, you can in fact kill wolfs, deer with your fists ive done it many times and stones are EVERYWHERE, not to mention there are campsites premade and old ruins everywhere that spawn gear , food and armor.The isnt easy by any means if you are a instant gratifcation type who refuses any work to get somewhere in a game you might want to walk away from this one, its not for the timid or the rage quitters, this game naked is very easy once you figure out how everything works to survive and build up.You drop all of your gear on death, however if you learn quickly how to make respawn totems which are easy enough, you can get your gear back, but die in a unknown area good luck, I lost like 5 bodies when I first started not realizing your first make you are given some starter gear, die and respawn and you are naked.The cold enviornment in this game makes it essential to keep a campfire going or get some really decent armor made which you wont get done right away, so campfires will be your friend, especially at night, the temperature drops drasticly and is a death sentence if you dont have a campfire or at least a house with decent armor, not starter armor.

								Based on the engine of Unity 4, this Early Acces attempt at a hybrid survival game proved to be quite entertaining with a friend at your back. Add the fact that the game has some RPG and lore elements to its progression map, it can easily be considerer a gem in the rough, especially for the satisfying price of 0.60 € . However, the bugs and choppy frame on which the game elements is set is quite broken and game breaking. All in all, it was worth the purchase price but not a positive review considering the game breaking bugs which forbid me from completing it coupled with the absence of feedback from the devs.			"

Early Access Review
								Been playing for around a year and all I can really say is Id like to kick everyone that gave this a good review in the nuts. This game is horrible. In every aspect. First and foremost optimization. I have a decent gaming PC that can handle Skyrim, Fallout 4, and the Witcher 3 well and this eye diarrhea plays like crap even on low settings (and it looks REALLY bad). The Dev's update regularly but seems like you would want to make the game balanced and playable before you keep adding more meaningless stuff. Yes they updated to Unity 5.3 which provides a slight graphical ehnacement but thats about it. I hate complaining about early access but this game is just horrible and I see no amount of time that can improve it if it has progressed this slowly in a year.  Plus I was sorely dissapointed by the building. Most other games allow you to somewhat customize how you build your home. Not this game, cookie cutter house designs mean your home will always look the same. Plus the insane amount of resources required to build anything pretty much kills the single player experience. Unless you like mindless clicking on trees and rocks for hours just to build a bland looking house. I'll pass, you should too.			"

								This game isn't terrible but it has some serious issues.  It has been like 9 months since the release and i feel that the devs aren't updating frequent enough, not only that but the updates aren't focused on the right aspects of the game.House building is pretty much pointless and it looks buggy as hell even when placed on a tiny incline.  There should be floors and the town hall should atleast have 2 floors considering how big it is.  The fighting in this game is fair although finding high quality is a grind from hell if you want to make any of the ebony.  There isn't much to do in the game unless you love to gather resources whilst occasionally killing a wolf.  There are alot better games that are similar to this available so i would steer clear of this one in its current state.2/5			"

Early Access Review
								(First week of Early Access) This game has great potential and the devs are very active on both the forums and the development of the game. They have a nice interaction with the community and they do livestreams each thursday where they answer some questions about the game.  Now I was lucky since I received the game with a giveaway that the developers did on their stream. However after playing the game I sure feel like if I had payed for it I wouldn't regret it. In the very first early release I had about 4 hours of gameplay. However due to some annoying things like armor decaying quickly and not being able to relight campfires, I had to stop playing untill next patch. When I checked the forums I was delighted by a post by the devs that specified the changes in the next patch. In this patch, once the most annoying things are fixed, the game will be even more playable. New features will also come after bugs are killed. The developers are gamers themselves and I trust in them in this age of scamming developers and lazy money grabber companies. They constantly check the steam forums and take user feedback into account. Anyway enough of praising, this game itself has a lot of potential. It has skeletons, giant walking trees, huge bears, scary wolves and a dragon which at the moment is of no threat but later on according to the devs the dragon will be a part of something big in the game along with magic. Night times are scary and hard. At nights there are scary lurkers and the cold is an even bigger threat than it is in the morning. I would say the game is hard at first but once you get the hang of things like crafting,looting and surviving it becomes easier. Right now there is no pvp in the game, but surely it will come. Some kind of magic is hinted at and will surely come sooner or later. So yes I do recommend this game. Have a good day. "

								I know this is an early release. But I can see what they are trying to do and where they are going. The only reason I can recommend this game is if you like to hit your thumb with a hammer so it feels good when you stop. You are left stranded on a deserted (sort of) island. You begin to gather supplies. You soon find out however that in order to get these supplies you will run out of the ones you need trying to get the others. I've played four or five games and have yet to survive a night. No save option? In 2015! Most people like a save option, for those who don't put a hardcore option in. After banging my head against this game a few times I've had enough.  To light a fire you need six stones... (really? are the rangers going to arrest you for not having a ring around your fire?) a flint, and a log. Apparently logs light w/o the use of tinder... in the snow... from a freshly cut tree. Once you get a fire going it's not enough to gather some wood and toss a log on it once in awhile. You have to let it go out and start with a new flint and log. The whole game is an excercise in futility.  Save your money. Play Skyrim. It's more fun and doesn't punish you for playing. Btw, when you die, you respawn back on the coast with none of your items to be found. You are this time left with only a loincloth. Wow, fun, fun, fun.			"

								It's a really good concept, but for now it's lacking tremendously in content. I would suggest waiting off until it gets a bit more meat on it's bones.Obviously, from only having 2 hours on the game, I really can't speak for the entire game. What I do know is that the beginning is a kinda lack-luster. I LOVE the first little check-list system, and I think that most survival games could learn a lot from that. It's a near perfect way to implement a tutorial. However, past that, I found the gameplay had little variety (atleast in the beginning). I would have loved to have seen more animals, and more variety in the weapons. I like the idea of freezing, however I never felt very threatened by it.My main gripe, and I know it's not the best gripe, is the lack of a way to skip the night through sleeping. Each night I found myself just sitting in my little shack waiting for the sun to rise. I was completely safe, and therefore I feel as though I shouldn't have had to wait.I realize this is a very early release of the game, however, it's priced as something that's completely finished, therefore I feel as though it should be more of a complete package. I commend the developers on responding to my review, and I will certainly be following the developement of this game.			"

								Bought it today via the humblebundle.. Aint even worth the 90 cents.The crafting system is absolutely horrendous. There is no searchfunction. Plus, if you wanna craft a bandage, for example, you cant just click on it if you have cotton, no you have to manually click on the cloth scraps, craft those, then craft the bandage. And this just continues to be even worse the more complex it gets. I have 10/20 achievements already after 2 hrs of play with no knowledge of the game whatsoever. You can equip 10 bags at once, makes the inventory just more of a mess.The whole UI is ♥♥♥♥ed up as well. Combat is superboring, you have 1 Attack. Thats it. Animationquality is also bad, music is basically nonexistent.No story, nothing else to do, cant interact with most of the world.Gathering resources is terrible.Dont buy this if you are looking for a good survival game. There are better ones out there. "

								Well spent 1 euro on this game, since bought it from reseller, and I gotta say that I overpaid. This game has way too many flaws to be enjoyable.I admit that I enjoyed the first hour of this game, everything after that was filled with issues.- The RAM usage went up to it's maximum, forcing me to hard restart my PC.- The AI is just terrible(If you thought Daikatana had terrible AI, wait till you see this)- The game is laggy(especially AI) when trying to play it with friends(my friend hosted the game, it might be internet speed & ISP diffrences but that's not the case)- Some effects just dissapeared after joining a hosted session(like flames for instance)The game has potential, however at this state I cannot recommend it, wait until it gets improved before buying.JUST DON'T BUY TILL IT GETS BETTER			"

								I actually like this game, but do not reccomend (without warning) because its advertised as a survival game, and this is NOT a survival game.  I've only recently started playing survial games, having only played two other games billed as survival games and Savage Lands differes from them in two major ways:  One is there is no death penalty.  In a survival game, if you die, the game is over (install a ""hardcore mode"").  Second is that in Savage Lands, merely surviving is very easy.  Its way too simple, in fact.  Not sure how to fix that.Thats my reccomendation, now for the Devs, a few thoughts:Things roll downhill, its cute, but annoying and not realistic.Durability is an issue, I'm killing things all day long just to keep my gear repaired.You should be able to break down found gear.Buildings should have more purpose.  For survival, the only one you ever want to spend the time on is the smithy.  The rest are for town simming fun.Days seem too long, and you can't sleep through the night.  I'm eating several dear or wolves per day.  Not that there is a lack of meat, I have stacks of it because my equipment needs the more important animal product, sinew for daily repairs.Encumberance should be included. You shouldn't be able to carry the world with you in 8 backpacks.Bandages are an issue, I'm exploring the map desperatly trying to make it from one cotton plant to another.  (in areas with the BIG wolves).Rocks should disappear when they are mined out... unless they eventually regenerate?Could not ""place"" the pine chest in the smithy, I just kind of dropped it and there it sits, immovable.Look forward to playing and seeing the additions you guys come up with.

								Has potential, but i do not recommend it at the current point in time. Graphics are not awful. Movement and control is a bit wonky still. My character was stuck on a tiny rock. I found a tower and couldn't climb in the debris, collision wise it was a full cylinder with stairs on the outside, but visually it had gaping holes and voids i thought might contain some loot. There isn't much within the world that i could find. I beelined it right inland and saw tiny wolves, and stags more than anything. I saw 2 skeletons that were dispatched with ease and maybe 4 bigger wolves. The item list looks impressive but i would need to look into it further for all of that. So far it honestly seems rather cakewalkish, i killed everything i saw with minimal trouble amd without crafting anything. It just felt really empty. I am looking forward to what this might turn into, please don't abandon this devs.Update 22.12.2015Played online with some people from all over the world. Stil don't recommend it, much of the grind was brought down by us working together, despite little to no shared language. It was interesting, but still not something I can recommend right now. Devs, if you want to talk to me on my review, feel free to leave your comments. Deleting them just sets bad vibes.			"

I went back to try the game again and it still looks the same to me. Not sure how much the devs are putting their time into this game or what their plans are but still it seems this game doesn't give me enough reasons to continue playing past the first hour or so. It seems a bit grindy. The snowy landscape is beautiful but even that seems to repeat itself. Also, some of the animations and sounds could be improved too, make them more realistic please.			"

This game is amazing, I've only played it for several hours and can already tell it has potential. The pre-game is probably the roughest point a player has to overcome throughout the entire game, with limited resources and several survival factors such as Warmth, Hunger, and Health; this game isn't for the average COD scrub. Although the combat system can be easily abused by circling enemies and spamming left mouse, it shows promise with future updates. I found this game realitively easy, until you find a Plague Wolf... then you spend the next half hour trying to kill it with your bare fists because it guards yo stuff better than a Watchdog Security System, this game will beat you to your knees, and leave you with nothing, but some stone and frostberries.

I enjoyed the game, but now if i log into the game and play the game then it feels moustly different....not so fun anymore. I wish that there is the same system that was before. But as it is now...this is just o my god. Why to change the system and the playstyle if you can just make more items or monsters for the game. This is certainly a good thing to have more items (afcourse shields). This is  boring if i must reparier my armor and weapons so often (searching and running too much for the items to reparier)- i dont enjoy that at all.

								Not enjoyable yet. This WILL be a great game, but as it stands right now it can be quite frustrating. It's much too hard to gather resources. Weapons/Tools break way too fast.  And while you might be able to fight off the cold nights later on, getting to that point is a huge task that can end up being very frustrating. Devs: You need to add more ways to get resources.  Stone, wood, sticks, and more sources of food. I had no idea what I was doing my first time playing, so I got stone and wood gathered to make a fire.  I regretted this short after, as fire's burn out fast, and stone is almost non-existant without a hammer (which you need stone to make) and wood is non-existant without an axe (Which also requires stone....). Realisticly you'd be able to pry some sticks off a tree, and find some small rocks around the other boulders we see... Neither of these traits are true in the game yet. A few adjustments to balance out how the game starts could do this game wonders.  I'm all for challenging games, i'm not asking for an Easy button.  I do like the severity of the weather, how hard enemies hit, bleeding, disease, etc.  That's all good.  But this needs to be balanced out more. We can't enjoy all the challenges you have set up for us, if we can't even survive the first night. I've only played singleplayer as of now, as I don't have anyone else to play this with. All that im griping about might be alleviated in the multiplayer side of the game, but you've got to make the game playable on SP too.Don't misunderstand: This is a great game here. It has great features now, and they will clearly get better.  But it's too hard to enjoy those features right now. It just needs a simple re-balance, and the whole experience will improve 10x over.  EDIT: Changing to recommended, sheerly because a Dev actually replied and appreciated the feedback.  That indicates to me that whatever we find wrong with the game and talk about, the devs are going to listen and make appropriate changes.  That's a rare thing these days.  And that means this game will get the fixes it needs and turn into an outstanding game.			"

								As much as i am playing this game as player Stormheim i am in regards giving this game a negative review for the following, not because of the game devs fualt but for the reasons that will be listed down below. Thank you.For one this game is still early access and is still in a constant working build wich players have to understand. we live in a♥♥♥♥♥♥age where people see an early access and twant it to be instantly done and thats not how it works at all and players need to understand that. i my self played savage lands from the very begining whe it was in an alpha mode and had one island then took a couple years break then came back to enjoy what was recently implamented and came across some funny / awesome players who shared the same things in common such as i. though i will continue to play the game and see how it goes. it does lack on going immersion to keep the intentiveness of the game to be apeasing though that being a small factor it could be worked on more to keep the game feeling more alive. yes there are bugs and those bugs are being worked on which is good. How ever, moving onto the servers. friendly is fine and most obvious if you dont want to play on hostile. ( such is fine for making the most obvious statement) but if your like me and want to do pvp once in a while then you're gonna want to give into that itch of combat. how ever hostile servers arent the problem. The problem is what players are doing within those hostile servers. if you collected and upgraded your guys to such a point where he can no longer be further upgraded and you go into a hostile server thinking you're ok sadly you are wrong. players have cheapen the game expierence and what i believe will kill hostile servers before hostile servers can count or serve their official purpose upon official release. what players are doing are making walls or fence traps around where you spawn and cannot escape and killing and ganking other unsuspecting players and stealing their gear and everything they worked for with out remorse and consequence in this early build. it is themost scummiest thing i havent come across in a long time. These type of hostile servers and players are what will kill the game if the devs do not act fast upon the issue and i fear if this type of non sense were to continue savage lands wont last long as a long time game to stand on its own because of such and will forever be in a constant state of friendly "" PC "" land of happiness and friendliess then quick to mad boredom beyond measure. It's easy to say "" well dont go on hostile servers "" yeah no ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥retard. thanks for stating the obvious ♥♥♥♥face. This is not the point i am getting at. the point im getting at is that hostile servers should serve pvp in its original format meaning players dont get spawn killed where they spawn and should be free to go around n find what they can just so they can properly pvp n battle against. not joina  serve only to find them selves instantly die ina  spawn trap and cant escape it because they are being spawn camped time and time again. This is whats called common sense in seperating the issue's. Like i stated before, i will continue to play this game because i enjoy playing with the people i became friends with over time because we make the game fun and intrieging and will keep continueing to post and give screen shots to the devs and will not stop until something is implamented to prevent such spawn trapping and player spawn ganking. `Thank you for taking the time to read this -Stormheim. Also if you plan to try this game, atleast get the game ona  bundle or ona  discount n see how you like it for your self to see if you want to hop in on the expierence before you let steam reviews decide the game for you. This review is to just give an over all statement on whats going on and what you can be on the look out for thats happening in the game.			"

								Pretty much your generic modern survival game à la Rust and Ark: Survival Evolved. This game's unique spin on the formula is that the enemies are harder to defeat (Along with a pleasing fantasy aesthetic). The problem with this is that the combat system is the same hold down left click to vaguely flail at things in front of you system of this game's influences, meaning that the actual skill in the harder combat feels like is still exactly the same. I did go in to this game after reading many reviews praising the game greatly, which may have given me some unfair expectations, but all in all I left the game unsatisfied.Otherwise it seems like a pretty solid addition to the survival genre, but if you aren't already sold on these games this will certainly not change your mind.

								I really tried to give this game a chance, but...ugh.  I get it is early access and there are going to be changes and bugs along the way, however I came across a bit of an issue where the hit boxes for enemies didn't exist. I would swing and hit dead on and nothing. After this happening after restarting the game twice, I gave up. I'm just glad this was a gift and I didn't have to shell out $15 bucks for this. Hopefully the game changes and I am able to actually sit down and play it eventually.			"

								The idea of the game is fun but not the actual game. The fighting in this game is laughable, I killed the krul skeleton or whatever with a tin axe i got from the abandoned tower or whatever with no damage given to me. The Mining is an ABSOLUTE chore. Getting Tin takes ages and getting stone/clay/whetstone from rocks is just RNG, literally stoof and mined a rock for about 3-4 minutrees just trying to get one whetstone. Doesnt run well on my rig that can handle witcher 3 medium settings at 45-50 fps (this game runs at 30-35 FPS on the absolute lowest settings)Would not recommend, got this in a humblebundle and i think this game is going to stay under 10 hours of game time for sure			"

								Only played Single Player so far, but it's quite enjoyable. The crafting takes a bit of getting used to, but once you do, it's pretty intuitive. Combat is fairly basic, but not annoyingly so. The ability to bring your character into multiple worlds with his inventory intact is really nice!And that dragon is pretty scary!Definitely needs a crouch abilty, though. And the hunger stat needs tweaking, goes down a bit too fast.			"

Then some other creature mauled me where I re-spawned. Then I figured out fire and crafting a little bit and got mauled some more.

								Tl;dr: Expected Skyrim Hardcore Survival, instead got the best Hitting Rocks With Hammers Simulator on the market I spent about 60 minutes repeatedly Googling ""Savage Lands how to use a bow"", ""Savage lands where to find clay"", ""Savage Lands why does this dragon hate me so much"".After struggling through the two crafting menus and being mauled by a wolf who seemed to require a few minutes between actions to decide which direction he is going to lunge and miss me entirely, I realised the gameplay boils down to roughly 90% hitting nondescript rocks with hammers (??? I spent a while trying to figure out where pickaxes were until I Googled ""Savage Lands how to mine"") over, and over, and over, and over for a very long time.I quit about the time I spent 10 minutes hitting a rock slowly getting the clay that was falling out, building a forge, thinking ""♥♥♥♥ yes I can do something else"" - Oh no I need coal which involves walking back to a small bit of red rock and hitting that for another ten minutes.

								My last review was a bit trolly but this is my real review. It's a good game, it has alot of potential but the developement is very slow. It takes them 3 weeks to do a couple of bug fixes. They're working on too many games at once. The devs are nice but they try too hard to make everything perfect. I think they should focus on adding content rather than fixing it. This would speed up the updates alot.(Only fix important bugs). I'd like to see wolf taming that would be really cool. I'd like to see more animal beasts because most of the monsters are just skeletons. We need monsters like a huge bear that has six legs and moose horns (you can use this idea if you want). Adding reptiles would be cool too. You gotta get schwifty.			"

Without its difficuly, savage lands has gone from an incredibly unique survival rpg to a run of the mill survival. Bring back old savage lands please			"

								Ok here we go.I got this game as a part of the humblebundle and I thought: ""well why not - give it a shot""survival - openworld - craft - medieval - coop stuff .... mhh ok there are quite a few of those games.-----------Negativ critic-----------------Worst first: It's damn ugly.I got to say, the game does not look good at all. I tried with the highest settings and everything but still. The World, the textures and even the animations are ugly. And even beeing that ugly, it still does not perform very well. Frame drops and lagsthroughout the game (especially multiplayer).And that's the biggest minus to this game for my opinion.The other point is the menues and the crafting system.It's clunky, it's confusing and like the rest of the game: ugly.The lack of a search option for anything you want to craft or the simple option to scroll with your mousewheel in the menues just makes it annoying to navigate through them.------------------------------------------After a little while fiddling around I at least understood the craftig system, what to get,where to combine and what to build.++++++++Positiv critic+++++++++++A little plus to the game had to be said aswell.I like the world.- Besides the unpleasing cold and snowy setting I really enjoyed exploringthe map and against all odds, the map is pretty big and full of little areas you want to take a look at. I also like, that you have what looks like a ""endgame-content"" which is something to lookup to.At the first little exploration on the map you'll see this (SPOILER) dragon creature flying around and you instantly think - I'm gonna kill that guy -And that's not as easy as it first looks :) So you have something to work for in this openworld.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++So the game-content is ok-ish I would say BUT!!! And here comes the main reason for mythumb-down review:The ugliness of this game, beeing it the poor graphics, the messy and user-unfriendly interfaces or the clunky animations completly outweights the positiv aspects of the game and ruining theexperience and the long-run activity.So thats a pretty clear NO from my side, at the actual state of this early access game.::Take care.

								Let me start by saying that this game has huge potential, and I want to recommend it, I really do.Savage Lands is an incredible concept on paper, and drew me in straight away, even with some bad reviews. The problem with Savage Lands is that the performance is absolutely awful. I spent over an hour making the game run and then getting into a local game as there are no dedicated servers. When I finally got into the game (which took over twenty minutes) I was plagued with performance issues. I turned my settings right down and still had performance problems, and I'm well within recommended specifications as well as not having software problems. To be sure that the issue wasn't my own I asked around and found that performance issues are definitely a big problem. As someone with experience in game development, I could see a lot of good reviews popping up if we had a slider for draw distance (good for lower spec), some work on performance before adding new features and consideration of renting dedicated servers to players. Frankly, the menu UI is ugly and needs an overhaul. All of that being said I will definitely be coming back to the game after a few patches because I'd really like to see how it develops. I won't be refunding as I recieved the game through Humble Bundle. To sum this all up, I would not recommend buying the game right now, but I would recommend watching how it develops and considering a purchase in future.			"

Early Access Review
								This game WAS fun, in the alpha.Once beta hit the building mechanics all changed and basically changed the game alltogether.There is a wide gap in difficulty level.  When you first start it is IMPOSSIBLE to collect materials for even basic weapons and shelter.  Once you've progressed far enough, there isn't anything left to do.  It's far too easy.I was very hopefull for this. It was a survival game with fantasy aspects and this was something new.In order for this game to be successfull:*Revamp the entire building system, or revert it back to alpha*Give the game a goal/purpose other than pure survival. I realize this is unheard of in survival games where the goal is simply that, surviving.  However, this is a ""fantasy"" survival and this genre needs more quest-style play to succeed. OR*PVP- this is how survival games survive.  This game however has such a strong PvE focus that the PvP is nearly non-existant.			"

								The game being in Early Access is amazing, but if you were to compair it with other games such as Rust, You would be very disapointed. This game does have a few bugs such as not being able to place a chest anywhere, not even in houses so you have to result to carrying everything... The game certainly needs to improve on the loot aswell. I feel like it is just a really dumbed down version of The Forest. However the game is not to bad. I would reccommend it if you can get passed the fact that you have to carry all your items on you, and that you starve often. 6/10 Mainly because i dont wanna carry valueables on me at all times, and there needs to be more options for food and loot. :)			"

								Average graphics, very low content and NPC's. Once you understand farming and crafting build your own hut and forge it's game over, games boring, you've survived. There are a few good NPS's and the game has potential, but right now, I can't say spend more then 10 or 15 on it. Update, They fixed mouse smoothing. Thanks for that! Game loads just fine. Died by a pack of wolves and freezing to death.  Seen a massive flying dragon from a distance. Game has great potential. So far the dev's have been very active. I look forward to more content. --Crashed steam on first load. Unable to turn off mouse smoothing. Tried to turn it off for 10 mins. Running is more like walking midly quicker. It's not by any means running. Hell it's not even power walking.. In fact I had to check it a few times to make sure there was a difference between walking and running. Maybe my run key was not bound.. No, it was. Unplayable in the current state.			"

For example some more advanced player combat which would be one of the bigger things. Also I would like to see some more animations. "

								This game has potential. I played about 7 hours. I enjoyed crafting and the gathering was alright.There was a huge power gap between island 1 and 2. I mined all the best meterials I could and build the best items I could before I moved on to the next area. The monsters were ok to fight but they could easily one shot me which made me wonder why I worked so hard to make this armor. All of those little bugs and balancing aside I stopped playing after my fourth death due to being stuck in terrain. I'd like to return to this game a few months down the line and see if it is fixed but for nowe I can not recomend it. If you can get it cheap pick it up as it is wortha few hours of fun and the potential for it to get better is definitely there. My advice for the devs is to make losing items on respawn a tickable option so people can prevent it when exploring before official release. At least until the game is balanced and the clipping is fixed. I'd also supress mob spawns in a radiaus around respawn points.			"

Early Access Review
								Tried it and sadly didn't like - I had high expectations for it, admitedly, so I shall now wait for it to be more updated before trying again (I'll be honest I buy very few pre-release games for this reason now).Now yes I agree reviews from those who spent less than 2 hours in game isn't as valid as those with 100 hours.. So I won't even try to comment on most of the gameplay that I did/did not like.The graphics are okay, and the environment is varied well enough. You don't come across the same building simply repainted 18 quintillion times (unlike some rather expensive games as of late) which is imo very important for a survival game like this where exploration is key. So for that - I like this game!Unfortunately, I found the UI and some other aspects horrendous to use, very clunky and certain aspects counter intuitive. The crafting system was also a little of the mark for my liking and somewhat counter intuitive - I felt like it was trying to fight against me whilst using it..Combat was 'okay', although even after an hour I wasn't liking where it was going, I felt like I was going to be doing pretty much the same thing for however long I played with regards to attacks.Unfortunately for me the worst part about the game in current state are the sound affects. These were very similar from one task to the next, and even after 5 minutes I was scratching the edge of my mouse for it to stop. I do think it worthwhile pointing out that I am a big fan of good music and sound affects, so I guess this was probably the reason I disliked it quite so much.I very much wanted to like this game, but, I think I'll find myself waiting for more updates/full release before I try this again - It's got a lot of potential so I'd FOLLOW this and see where it goes in the future. 3/10 in current state from me.

								The grapgics are amazing, and I love the concept. It's not a bad game by any means, so don't get me wrong, i'm going to rant a bit. .My main issue with they game is that it seems to be made unreasonably hard on purpose. And of course it's a survival game about being stranded alone with little to no supplies, so it should be hard. But I mean this is unrealistically so. For example one of the first things that you need to do is build a fire so you do not freeze to death. To build a fire you need 6 stones for the fire pit, 3 logs, and some flint. Flint is easy enough to find. But somehow, for some unfathomable reason, with miles upon miles of open beach, forest, and hills, cliffs, and giant rock outcroppings, it's nearly impossible to find a few stones or logs. I was able to find 1 log relatively easily, but it's floating about 500 yards out in the freezing water, and if you go get it, you will die of hypothermia before you find any more to make a fire. A work around for the log problem is to find a stick (different from a log, and harder to find), and use a stone with that to make a hatchet. But it's already so hard to find a stone that doing so feels like a huge sacrifice. The only reason I can think of why simple stones and logs would be so scarce in a wilderness/beach environment is that the entire map, the beach, the trees, the rock outcroppings all over the beach, etc, is made of plastic.

								If you like fantasy sandbox games, Savage Lands is definitely worth a look. Rather than reiterating all of the good aspects mentioned here in reviews, I'll focus on what I don't like about this game:ITEM DURABILITY, UGH!!!!!!!In around a 3-4 hour play session, I have to replace some of my armor and weapons multiple times. It feels like that this is the core gameplay loop. You craft armor and weapons only to craft more armor and weapons... constantly. I found it difficult to build up a cache of wearable items, because my weapons and armor would degrade faster than I could create them.I still recommend this game, but item durability needs some serious tweaks, or a system to repair items.

								The survival checklist is garbage. It doesn't tell you how to build buildings, it says to press J but all J does is open your journal and there doesnt seem to be any buildings available in the crafting menu. I froze to death. Plus, when I was hammering away at some rocks it started droping... whetstones. Not stone, not flint, whetstones. Apparently I am so skilled with a hammer that I can't even just get stone, it comes out in perfectly formed blade sharpening blocks.Also the resolution ♥♥♥♥s up constantly. I had it in fullscreen and it cut off the edges of the screen even though it was at the correct resolution, so I tried a smaller resolution in windowed mode... and it still cut off the edges of the screen.This game is years old but still hardcore early development. Needs some serious work to be even slightly playable.			"

								I was excited to try this out as I bought it in the humble bundle. At first it started out fairly fun. The graphics aren't amazing but that personally doesn't bother me. From the start I noticed it doesn't really tell you much. Thankfully I've played prior survival games, which I'm sure was a huge help and kept me from being completely lost. However, as I played a bit more, I realized the only thing I was doing was running around looking for food, constantly. All of the animals (rabbits, deer, boar etc) became next to impossible to find, so I starved to death. Multiple times. There was nothing to forage for food. No berries, apples, nothing. Doing nothing but running around looking for food while starving to death is not what I would call fun. You can make rabbit traps but that costs resources which was made very, very difficult by the constantly starving to death part. Even if you do manage to craft one, rabbits aren't caught often enough to keep you alive.Also, it lagged. A LOT. Not all the time, but when it did.... it was bad.I do no recommend the game as it currently is. While it feels like it *could* be fun if some things were changed, in its current state I can't.			"

								This is the closest thing to a simple multiplayer Skyrim we will probably get anytime soon.  The landscape reminds me a lot of Skyrim, plus there is a fairly good crafting system.  Your main enemies are cold and hunger.  It basically feels like you're shipwrecked on a land where a big battle or catastrophe has occurred and you are the only people left.  There are lots of creatures though.Survival is hard but very doable at the present.  There is a lot of unfinished content like chests (or almost everything) in buildings that you can't interact with.  Also there is no magic system, quest system, or anything like that.  Basically you hunt, fight monsters (and scavenge skins, meat, teeth, etc. from the remains), gather materials (like coal, flint, wood, stone, and different types of ore), build better armor/weapons and survival structures, and explore.  There really is no storyline that I can tell, just a little bit of lore found in notes and books.  I haven't seen any NPCs yet.  I've played it co-op with another player for 10+ hours now and we are still interested and pushing ahead while building forward camps to see what else we can find.			"

Early Access Review
								This is not a real hardcore review, because game still in early access, just wanna mention few things because Im not sure this game really deserve so many negative assessments:1) As said before, this is still an EA game, and buying such games always a lottery. Bugs and broken gameplay is a quite common problem of a survival\sandbox genre, when after some development point game become partly or fully unplayable for a few or many players. Just check reviews of '7Days to Die', 'Space Engineers' or other popular games of that genre, youll find same problems.Personally I prefer not to buy EA games anymore because of a huge risks, but I got Savage lands long time ago for a less than 5€ and for this sum I got more than enough. At least I got much more entertainment than from 'Castle Miner Z' or 'District' so I really cant blame devs for a mistakes that were done after moving game from Unity4 on Unity 5.Savage lands quite good for a few hours of solo gameplay, not bad (at least hilarious) for a coop seccions, whats more important, you still can play old, much more stable version made on u4 by checking BETA option in game settings. I highly recommend to stay on older build because even its much more simple, its much more enjoyable.Wont widely list all good and bad sides of this game, just wanna say that summarising good core mechanics and gameplay, overall ambient, quality graphics, and stable multiplayer with infestation by small bugs, quite empty world and small craftlist (plus way more awful bugs in u5 version of game) I still enjoy u4 build of this game and still think that its worth a try with 75% discount.Just a few days ago devs post a message in SC that game still in development so I hope it wont die like 'Towns' or 'Spacebase DF-9'.

Early Access Review
								(TL;DR at bottom.)[I am open to changing this review once (and if) the game improves.]This is a weird case for me, I want to like this game, and as such, would consider being on the fence. But not this one. While I do say, YES, it certainly has potential. As is? NO, I can not recommend Savage Lands to you or anybody else.I played it sometime last year, and liked it for the most part. I just now came back to it, and quite a bit has SEEMED to change, and while, yes, it has, it has not been for the better. The game was already living up to its name before, this is a brutal game; you don't even need to make a mistake for it to punish you. But there-in lies the issue. The game, seems to have been made EVEN HARDER than the last time I played it.I spawned, killed a skeleton with a stick, okay. Try to gather supplies before night, okay. The moment night falls, WOLVES. WOLVES WOLVES WOLVES. Your starting weapon does nothing. Your fists do nothing. You're forced to run, and if you're lucky, you'll get away. Alone, naked and cold, unless you somehow managed to scrap together clothing by day 1 (which won't be enough), or miraculously found enough (and managed to carry it with you) materials to build another fire, you'll freeze to death before morning. The water might as well be LAVA with how quickly it ends your life if you dare so much as wade up to your waist into it. Because yes, cold now consumes your life in the opposite direction. That is now health you no longer have access to. Even if you manage to warm up, that health will be missing! So if you so much as get a little chilly, you'll get one-shot before you have time to see that second skeleton, that wolf, or a giant boar.Now, I'm not one who complains about difficulty in a game. But I am one to complain about PERFORMANCE of a game. They have gone out of their way in the last year I played this, to drive this to unfair and un-fun levels of 'hard', yet they have done NOTHING to improve the game's actual stability. Combat is still  ungodly clunky , and even on the lowest settings, the random lag, slow-downs, or outright freezes, will most likely kill your fun before the nightly spawn-rates do.TL;DR: If the game would perform better and had less clunky combat, it'd be cool.

Early Access Review
								Definitely not in a state ready to be bought. I played up to the second island and that's a pretty good way into the game.  First off, the quality of the enemies AI varies WILDLY from enemy to enemy.  I haven't seen any that I'd call good, but I have seen some truly terrible ones.  The early game skeletons can be completely dodged without any difficulty.  whether they even notice the player is random.  The first boss, ""kruul"" has no AI.  He literally stands there and lets the player hit him as much as they want.  If you are LUCKY he might hit back once.  Even then I'm pretty sure I remember dodging it.  The higher level monsters have sketchy AI.  They are okay in that they'll usually land a hit on occasion, but often they have some silly trick to get them stuck in a wall or on a pebble somewhere.  At which point you can usually wail on them as much as you want.  The lore in the game is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  As in the developers have been changing the way the game works and they haven't been matching the lore up to match it.  If anyone is wondering where the portal that all the papers mention in the game over and over again, it's a bridge now....  That's right, documents and walkthroughs posted online all mention a portal to the second island, but it's not a portal anymore, it's a freaking bridge as of this review.  Now the reason I quit playing.  It's because I got one-shotted on the second island where the monsters are DRAMATICALLY stronger than on the first island.  Then I got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off when the stupid monster was guarding my corpse.  Let me make this clear, I didn't die where the monster spawned, the monster ran after me and guarded where he killed me so I couldn't get my corpse unless I lured him away, died a second time, then got my corpse....That brings me to another complaint.  The power difference of the monsters on the first island and the second island is RIDICULOUS....  I played the first island to DEATH gaining every possible advantage I could reap from it and I'm still getting one-shotted by boss monsters found in the second island. I had full tin armor which is as high as the first island allows.  Some of the normal monsters there are also ridiculous.  If the ghoul lands his poison, you'll be on deaths door in a matter of seconds. Make bloody sure you have the anti-poison powder ready because you won't last long otherwise.			"

								I played this game back in 2015, gave up after a while as the game was stacked against the player.  I have kept coming back  over the last year and after the last update I have been playing daily.  This is may favourite build, the mobs in game are now more realistically difficult, most can be defeated  with right gear, but some will do u with one hit, but using bow from distance u can knock down their HP before attacking with melee. I like the idea of being able to destroy structures to gain mats to rebuild buildings.  This game is early access and yes has room for improvment, hunger level needs to be changed, falls too fast when at rest, which the devs seem to be doing, i believe when finished this will be an excellent game.  I have played many so called survival games, in Savage Lands you have to work at surviving, its a frozen, bitter cold land, explore without correct equipment and end up in snow storm, cant complain if u freeze to death.  £10 is a very fair price.

If you are into sandbox games that are somewhat challengeing, I recommend this game greatly. Also if you complain about the graphics try turning down the resolution. In all this game is in ""early access"" this means that the game is still in beta and is still being worked on so therefor it isnt going to be perfect and have some glicthes.			"

								Game crashes when trying to start a game. Make a custom character, name your world, watch the screen load, and then crashed 3/3 times.First two times were on default settings, which mysteriously set all graphics to med-high.Last crash was on everything set to minimum or off. Still crashed before the game start.Extremely dissapointed.			"

								Perhaps down the road this game will be playable. Right now it seems to be in an alpha state... The crafting aspect is ok... A bit clunkyThe turn off for me was the AI of the hostiles... very sketchy... in some areas the mobs dissapear depending on where you are in thier area... That made me log out permanently... I may try it again at some point but right now I cant reccomend...			"

Took many months to Kenshi to become worthy of its price, so I think this game should also takes many months before it is a good action-adventure game worthy of its price.Just wait a couple more months and it will be better.I can only recommand it to people who are patient and want to help in designing a game with bug reports, suggestions, etc.Otherwise, wait until it is finished.

								Alright, look. I try to give games a fair review and at least play them for a decent amount of time so I can get a full understanding of the game. However, within the first 15 minutes of gameplay, I could tell that this was not a good game.First off, the framerate issues are massive. Keep in mind that I'm running Windows 10 on a more-than-decent laptop. I can run games like Skyrim and Fallout 4 with no framerate issues, but with Savage Lands it's a whole story on it's own. I even put the settings to the lowest, yet still had issues with it.Most of the characters look bland and ridiculous. Especially the skeletons.Another factor would be the controls. When you first start off, for me at least, slightly moving my mouse in any direction would force my character to swing their neck about a mile in that direction. I'm pretty sure he has whiplash now. I set the sensitivity to the lowest it could possibly be, yet it was still extremely high.The game COULD be worth it, maybe if it was free. But no. It's $15. FIFTEEN. DOLLARS. I wouldn't be ranting so hard if Savage Lands was free. Side Note: My friend gifted it to me so we could play it together but we tried to refund it. Can't refund mine. Gotta be reminded of this daily now.			"

								I bought this game during the Summer Sale, so it was at a pretty good discount. It's still in early access at the time of this writing. I'm giving it a ""thumbs up"" and I'm not sure why.Essentially, this is Minecraft that looks like Skyrim. I guess I like it because those are two of my favorite games.It is buggy. I've dropped items on the ground, only to have them disappear. I've had old corpses of mine reappear, effectively duping all my gear. I've seen items floating in mid-air that should be on the ground. For two weeks, a dragon came and breathed fire on me every time I came outside -- in the newb zone.But, I take all of that with a grain of salt. It is in early access. The devs are pushing out new builds every few weeks. They are still making big changes to the content. It looks great and has a lot of potential. I'm eager to see where they take it. "

								Decent. I've played with some friends and it was awesome! Sure there are some bugs but that is what early acess means. The thing that I like the most is the dificulty. Nothing tells you what to do and that gives the game another feeling and reminds me of those old games where you win if you are good and if you join forces with others. The crafting could be improved, I needs a search bar, it also could be intemidating since there is alot to do and so small info.			"

								My recommendation comes right now, as this is in the ""pay what you want"" level of Humble Bundle, and I can heartily recommend it at that price point (any price point, basically).  I don't know if I'd pay $15, but a buck?  Sure!  It does have some issues, but it has a lot of promise.  Let's just hope it's not one of those games that fades away without updates...Even if you don't enjoy it right now, it has great potential.  Buying it while it's on the HB will be something you probably won't regret... even if it's only good EVENTUALLY instead of right this second.			"

								Wanted to write a review because I see the game got plenty of negative reviews and I don't believe the game deserves them. Before I start I got to say that I got the game from a friend within the humble bundle - can't say anything about the game before that period.Does the game has some bugs that are quite annoying? Yes. Should some features be added/changed/fixed/revamped? Yes ... and that is normal and expected when you get an Early Access game. One thing that this game has and many does not is the great communication between the community and the developers that results in creation of a better game. You can actually find out what are devs working on and influence their decision on future development of the game. Game updates comes every two - three weeks that fixes/adds lots of things. About the game itself. The game is fun and challenging, it's like a survival version of Skyrim (just without NPC's). It has rich contend and the game is only in early access so I would say that the game has immense potencial. Can't wait to see how the game will develop. Should you get the game for 14.99€? I would say go for it if you dont mind bugs and problems since it is in Early Access.			"

								Savage Lands isn't a phenomenal game, but it is a competent survival game. It isn't like other sandbox survivals in that it has much more lore, sort of unique enemies and a general goal. It is an overall enjoyable experience even if it lacks some polish. Here's a pro-con list, because they're easy.Pros+just-right map. The map feels neither too large nor too small. Dangerous enough to make you think twice about certain trips, but not enough to feel unfair.+Difficulty. A lot of people used to complain about this but there is no permadeath or character progression. Death only makes you lose items which can be recovered. So while it may be difficult, it isn't too punishing.+multiplayer. I haven't played multiplayer yet but it is a great and common addition to survival games. With the small map and more goal-oriented gameplay I can imagine it would be fun with a group of cooperative friends.+Interactive and active developers. This is an early access game, and many early access games have developers that avoid the community or give up on the game or let development come to a standstill. This game has none of those problems.+Base building. Though the base building is in it's early stages and has an admittedly small amount of structures, it is a fun part of the game.neutral~Crafting. Crafting is a mixed bag. It suffers from the same issue that games like Unturned (in the 2.0 era) suffered, and that is a complicated multi-level crafting system. For example, if you want to make bronze armor you need to first craft hardened leather armor, which requires leather armor and a few other items. You also need bronze, which requires tin and copper ingots which requires tin and copper ore. You also need various small things like bronze rivets and nails which require more bronze. So the crafting can take a while and some effort to make your way through the levels, getting more complicated as the items get better and also requiring higher tier crafting, smelting and forge structures, and while some of the complexity is annoying, it isn't a terrible system. I would say just remove some of the clutter items like rivets and it would be a good system.~Combat. This game is more combat oriented than other survival games might be, with enemies spawning almost everywhere, which is a bit of a shame because the combat is mediocre. The game has various weapon types bu they all have long clunky animations and they leave you guessing as to their range, maybe you can hit that enemy 6 feet away, maybe not the animations are too poor to give any indicator. The enemies have the same style of fighting as well, but that's a good thing, they telegraph their swings giving good time to react, dodge and counter. This gives the game an unpolished, indie, pseudo-Dark Souls feel to it's combat.Cons-bugs. Currently the game has a few bugs, nothing game breaking except maybe the one that causes no enemies to spawn on the second island. Hopefully the developers can sort that one out, but overall I find the game to be relatively bug-free.-Performance. The game doesn't run all that great. Nothing new for indie early access survival titles but it would be nice to see some better optimization.-variety. There isn't all that much variety in the game. It feels as though there's three stages (corresponding with the three islands, which might be a design choice), beginner where you're just running around in the beginning trying not to die and scraping up various crap you find, intermediate where you have a small base and you collect nice ores and craft a suite of tools and armor, and the final stage where you're fighting giants and dragons and working with the highest tier armor. But it feels like the high-tier armor and weapons are only marginally better than the mid-tier stuff, and you really only end up crafting 2 sets of armor through pretty much the whole game. It would be nice if the higher tiers of armor had a less marginal increase of stats and perhaps a minecraft-esque system of ""to mine gold you need iron, to get iron you need stone"" to facilitate working your way up the levels.A fun, if flawed, game that could use some improvement, but is ultimately enjoyable. And if you get it for cheap on Humblebundle, it is absolutely worth it.			"

								For an Early Access Game, this game is acutally pretty fun.  After about 8 hours of playing, and dozens on a buddies account, I only encountered 1 bug (couldn't loot a Boar that died right next to his buddy) but it wasn't game breaking.  I never totally felt at ease while mining, hunting or even finding out how to make a campfire.  This game differently needs a buddy to team up with, so there is multiplayer for that, and single players for whom like it rough. *wink wink*  Overall, I really like this game, and with regular updates that they developers tell you about (not like DayZ....screw that game) they acutally make the game more enjoyable, rather than breaking it.  If Skyrim, Minecraft and Rust all had a baby..... Savage Lands would be that wayward ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son.			"

								This game is great and has great potential. I would describe it as a sort of Skyrim meets Minecraft with the gritiness of Dark Souls. Early development is a bit apparent in a lot of aspects such as combat and respawn mechanics but overall, this game is very enjoyable. My friend and I played when he got the game and the session connection was quick and seamless. We had tons of fun exploring and getting wrecked by giants.If you ever wished you could just run around a world similar to Skyrim but co-op with your friends to take down monsters and explore, then I would definitely recommend checking this game out. I will certainly be tracking this game's development and am continuing to enjoy it over 27 hours of gameplay later.			"

								Wanted to write a review because I see the game got plenty of negative reviews and I don't believe the game deserves them. Before I start I got to say that I got the game from a friend within the humble bundle - can't say anything about the game before that period.Does the game has some bugs that are quite annoying? Yes. Should some features be added/changed/fixed/revamped? Yes ... and that is normal and expected when you get an Early Access game. One thing that this game has and many does not is the great communication between the community and the developers that results in creation of a better game. You can actually find out what are devs working on and influence their decision on future development of the game. Game updates comes every two - three weeks that fixes/adds lots of things. About the game itself. The game is fun and challenging, it's like a survival version of Skyrim (just without NPC's). It has rich contend and the game is only in early access so I would say that the game has immense potencial. Can't wait to see how the game will develop. Should you get the game for 14.99€? I would say go for it if you dont mind bugs and problems since it is in Early Access.			"

Early Access Review
								Savage Lands isn't a phenomenal game, but it is a competent survival game. It isn't like other sandbox survivals in that it has much more lore, sort of unique enemies and a general goal. It is an overall enjoyable experience even if it lacks some polish. Here's a pro-con list, because they're easy.Pros+just-right map. The map feels neither too large nor too small. Dangerous enough to make you think twice about certain trips, but not enough to feel unfair.+Difficulty. A lot of people used to complain about this but there is no permadeath or character progression. Death only makes you lose items which can be recovered. So while it may be difficult, it isn't too punishing.+multiplayer. I haven't played multiplayer yet but it is a great and common addition to survival games. With the small map and more goal-oriented gameplay I can imagine it would be fun with a group of cooperative friends.+Interactive and active developers.

								A solid few hours into the game with some friends and so far so good. The game needs work in areas like combat an AI but the setting is good. I would suggest making more enemies with more players on a server, also the animal spawns are erratic; sometimes they are everywhere and sometimes you starve becuase you cant find a living thing. I like the crafting system but mining takes a while. The best part of this game is exploring. You are kept on your toes with keeping an eye on your hunger as well as how cold you get, while getting into scraps with the local monsters. I would advise adding some other monsters to keep this intersting; pack hunters, dangerouse flora and things that only come out at night all add to solid survival titles. As long as the AI is good. I love good AI but the creatures in this game do feel predictable and mechanical. I would recommend this game  and rate around 6 out of 10. Good if you get it cheap like in a humble bundal. Lots of potential here but it does feel like an early access game (as it is, duh).			"

								Looking back at the history of the game, it looks like the development might have hit a dry spell since March. It looks like they have a lot of things cooking right now and they just released a great update. I love this game so far and can't wait to see what they bring to the table. The development team needs to remember to stay active with the community and be transparent and this could be the next big survival/fantasy game.			"

Early Access Review
								Got this game in a Humble Bundle. At first I was like, oh, it's the exact same game as Hurtworld, right?It's not, and in my opinion it is far better (although I haven't near completed either game).My very first impression was a positive one, the simple fact that you got to choose in the main menu whether you wanted to play locally by yourself, play online on a public server or create a server yourself. In other survival games I've found that a lot of the time, it's a dragged out pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to create your own server. Not in this one. So that's a big plus.It took me a while to figure out how to get anywhere with the simple hatchet you are provided at the start of the game, but once you figured one thing out, you had already figured ten more things out. Easy to learn, and if you don't know how to craft a certain material for example, all you really have to do is click around in the craft menu, rather than tab out and google for help. So that's another thing that makes the game easy to navigate.But I definitely wouldn't say the game is too easy. So far I've only really focused on making a nice base camp for myself, building houses and such (simply because that's the part I find most fun), but even that isn't so easy you pay no mind to it. You still have to go out in the landscape and get materials, create a smelter, use it to create more materials, use the materials to create a forge, use the forge to create MORE materials to build a house, etc. etc.It's a real step-by-step experience that I find very fun and interesting.And for people who aren't into the whole crafting thing; there are multiple dragon towers literally within sight from the spawn location. And also on your way over there you will be attacked by boars and skeletons. So yeah, if fighting is more what you're into, that's not a problem. After all, it is a survival game, not a build-a-village game.Also, you can run around with your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hanging out. A feature I believe a lot of people will find hilarious when playing with a group of friends.Overall, I really like this game. The character creation... How do I say this politely... Has room for improvement. But even I, someone who usually doesn't even consider playing a game unless the character creation is BOMB, has managed to get over it and not let it affect the gameplay (I mean you hardly ever see yourself anyway).So if you're considering buying this, but changing your mind over the CC, don't worry, it's not gonna bother you at all. Take it from me, I usually spend 4+ hours modifying my characters' appearance. Because I'm a superficial ♥♥♥♥♥.tl;dr - Environments are nice, weather and lighting are bomb, crafting is bomb, enemies can sometimes be buggy but will still kill you, you never get bored, it's more fun than it seems the first hour or two of gameplay so give it a chance.8.6/10			"

								The dragon no longer plunders you in spawn which is great and the initial spawn area from my experience is very safe with some skeletons but nothing a spear can't handle. However the food is difficult sometimes and starvation may occur :p  but I enjoy the crafting, building, etc and hoping for more building options in the future.11/10 would starve to death again.
