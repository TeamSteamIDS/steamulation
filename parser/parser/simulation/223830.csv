												I finally completed my first Normal Ironman run in Xenonauts after many rage quits, forced restarts... and forgetting to deactive my C4 explosives only to pink mistify half my squad (way... waayyyy too many times). There were many moments that had me mumbling at my screen in frustration or outright had me getting up from the computer, going to the gym, and lifting things up then putting them down over and over again to get the angst out. It was incredibly frustrating to have some of my wet-behind-the-ears soldiers survive a few missions and pulverize some Xeno scum, only to watch them get one shot by a well placed shot or devoured by a Reaper I didn't plan for. Cover isn't intuitive (or at least for me it wasn't) and there were multiple times I took position only to watch the alien turn, smirk at me, then plant a plasma bolt square between the eyes of one of my soldiers. Refer back to the rage and lifting portion.Eventually, after epic (and possibly unhealthy) amounts of nerd rage and QQ'ing over cheating alien scum, how insanely difficult breaching UFOs is (Corvettes! I'm specifically hating on you!), and having to make aggrevating economic decisions... I learned from my mistakes (gasp!), had to learn to accept losses, and got better.I actually started using squad level tactics like hugging walls, throwing down smoke grenades if I absolutely had to turn a blind corner with no indication of what could be waiting on the other side, NOT sprinting down the middle of the street with my entire squad, then getting upset that I got sniped from a random window, making liberal use of explosives even if it meant I lost some money breaching UFOs, and generally just accepting I'm supposed to be out gunned.The game is remarkably well paced, freakishly so. Due to the ticker implementation RIGHT when you finally have outfitted your fighter jets or soldiers with the appropriate gear new bigger, badder aliens show up that almost make your hard fought gains obsolete. One step forward, two steps back is a common theme throughout the game that makes you BETTER because you have to actually think about WTF you're doing and why.I'm a father of three, married, and I have a job that has me at work anywhere from a standard 40 hours a week to almost 60, so it took me a month to get through the game. I guess I could've used the common complaint/logic ""I don't have that kind of time"" or ""I want something I can sit down and beat in a few days"" but this was far more rewarding. Yes, there were days where after a 12 hour shift I certainly didn't come home and boot up any games, but the time invested was worth it.I'm glad I stuck with Xenonauts despite my initial frustrations and will be putting many more hours into it either by tweaking the config file or by downloading mods. I actually tried playing XCOM: EU again and couldn't bring myself to do it.If you've made it through the wall of text (hurray!) I guess I'd split it into three categories:The Good:-Excellently designed game that gives you total freedom, no ♥♥♥♥ty tutorials shall be thrust on you here.-The pacing is genius! I don't know how long it took them, but the game ups the difficulty at the right moment. (unless you're playing bad, then you'll never catch up)-Soldiers have no role, you determine what they do based on what equipment you give them. Have a guy with high TU (action points)? Make him your scout! Have a guy with amazing accuracy but maybe his HP is kind of low? Sniper! Found a meat shield with high HP and incredible strength, but he couldn't hit the broad side of a barn at point blank range with a fully automatic weapon? Give him a metal shield and let him be a bullet sponge! Or don't do any of those things, it's up to you.-Aliens appropriately out tech you through out pretty much the entire game. You genuinely feel an overwhelming sense of dread as you play the game.-You will take losses, but that doesn't mean you'll lose the game. You can have pretty substantial set backs and still come out on top. (kind of like how life is!)-Using squad level infantry tactics ACTUALLY works and is necessary.-Well thought out tech tree and research progression.-You can mod and edit the crap out of the game to your liking.-Music is well done and adds to the setting.The Bad:-Even on Easy this game will be too much for a lot of people. This will be viewed as an ""elitist"" comment, but I think that's more indicative of the gaming industry as a whole and not to Xenonaut's detriment. Nintendo games were soul crushingly difficult and only had one mode, now many games I can hand my six year old that he can beat without having to read any of the text.-Still some glitches/bugs, namely shooting through walls. It doesn't happen too often, but it can make a huge difference to how that one map will play out.-The game doesn't explain a lot of the mechanics adequately. This can amplify frustration or make it more rewarding as you progress, depends on your perspective.-Mind control late game is a bit out of whack. I thought it added a great deal of intensity and dread, but it was depressing to watch two of my colonels that had managed to survive +30 missions get possessed and murder each other. I think it's a great (and necessary) part of the game, but still needs tweaking in either lower % success rate (which you can do yourself) or a turn delay the same way Wraiths can't teleport and shoot in the same turn.The Ugly:-Graphics. Eventually they grew on me, but it was admittedly jarring at first.			"

												Xenonauts. It's greatest strength is that it's X-com. It's greatest weakness is that it's X-com.If you're an older gamer, played the original X-coms, and just wanted them to get a graphics update and maybe some mods on being able to better organise your units and maybe a few updates, look no further. You've found it. If you don't know what this ""X-com"" business is about, both X-com and Xenonauts are tactical and strategic games where you defend earth from an alien invasion through a specialised organisation and squad who deals with the aliens. You'll respond to the aliens by shooting down the UFOs using regular human fighter aircraft, and then landing a squad of soldiers with just plain old human guns near them to clear out the survivors. After that, you'll begin to research better technology. Laser rifles, faster aircraft to take down the UFOs, armour that protects from the alien weaponry, and so on.You will meet several different kinds of aliens, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and figure out why they're invading. But most importantly, you're going to stop them. You're going to take all their technology and make it your own, and you will end up with several bases across the world to find, and destroy any intruders who push into your atmosphere.As for the changes between this and X-com, they are mostly good. You have an airstrike option on alien crash sites so that you don't need to do everything or have them expire when you've been too busy dealing with other sites, though it will provide you with far less rewards than if you send in a squad of soldiers. There are new pieces of equipment, such as the shield. You'll no longer need to micromanage every last clip or laser battery in your arsenal and order the construction of small things like two laser batteries - Just keep track of the ones you bring into combat so you don't run out. There are now more involved air battles, along with air terror sites. And cover, along with range, now actually provides a bonus or penalty to your shots. You don't have to worry about this turning into a chest high wall simulator though, it works out well and you don't have to stay in cover. It's just a suggestion that increases your soldiers' lifespan. There are some others but they are mostly positive. One I'd say is slightly negative is that you can not land on a UFO and blast a hole in the ceiling to enter it as you could in the original X-com, though if you never played that game(And even if you did), you might not even notice that option isn't there.Mechanics wise, it works out very similar to X-com, with an isometric view and tile based map. I've found some maps had too little vertical space sometimes but often this wasn't a big problem, the controls are pretty good, mainly just using your mouse to command your units.  It's turn based, with a world map to place your bases on and do your air battles, and a base overview where you can build out your base by modular rooms.Interestingly, I've found that the difficulty settings actually changes AI behavior, rather than the lazy way of just giving the AI more armour or damage. I'm not sure if it also gives the aliens more stats or makes it more difficult to get money for the player, but the fact difficulty settings actually improve the AI is something that many AAA games completely fail at.In the end, it's X-com. It has most of the strengths of X-com, but it also has the flaws of X-com. You may need to restart several times if you're new and you might get discouraged. A random lucky shot could kill off your best soldier and send the nearby rocket launcher guy into a berserk panic state right into your own squad. If you're not used to it, you'll wonder just how long the campaign keeps going and it may turn into a game of 'whack-a-UFO' for you with slow or barely noticable progress. Or you may simply not have a clue what's going on until the aliens are already in a better position than you.Even then, it's a very good game. I would say it's worth grabbing it at some point if you want to see what the fuss is about, or because you want some more of the X-com from long ago (Without looking at Interceptor or Enforcer for now)			"

Early Access Review
								If you're looking for a game that captured the feeling of the original X-Com then look no further.With stellar 3d to 2d rendered sprites, an art style and design the is reminiscent of an older generation of games though I think it would be going too far to call it ""retro"". Its both pleasing to the eye and has excellent clarity, all the information you need at the tip of your eyeballs and fingers to make the best strategic and tacticle decisions to defeat the disgusting xeno threat.The gameplay is heavily inspired by the bygone days of the past, with enough updates, improvements and modernizations that streamline the drudgery of the past (like the micromanagement intense menu screens of the original X-Com that are themselves evoke thoughts of Dwarf Fortress un-modded) into a lighter area by trimming back the intensity of the learning curve (such as buying ammo, etc) leaving the player with the same amount of depth and variety without leaving newer players in quicksand googling guides.If you're looking for a game where no one dies, aliens are made of paper and losing is impossible - look elsewhere. Your best men can be cut down like wheat by the advanced alien troops, who can at times seem to be made out of 40ft thick brick walls with angry faces painted on them. The risk of having your best men enhances the gameplay so much more than I would have thought, I truly cared about each soldier and shook my fist at the alien menace when my important men were gunned down mere feet from the landing craft.Theres a lot to this game, and if you're still on the fence there are plenty of videos on Youtube of people playing it - go look there and you'll find some great gameplay videos for the most part!Just be wary, some of the videos are old and may be on outdated builds that have bugs which no longer exist in this release and if I do have anything negative to say about this game its that it isn't a fully polished release and bugs do crop up from time to time, the majority of which aren't gamebreaking but once in a while I've seen a bug cripple someones game despite myself not having seen one.

												Xenonauts – a remake of a game of old.UFO: Enemy Unknown is one of the most influential games ever made. This is clearly visible by the amount of games that tried to mimic its gameplay like Altar’s UFO series or UFO Extraterrestrials and XCOM Enemy Unknown to name a few. Still some people were not satisfied by the above and wanted to recreate the know experience to their liking. One such project is Xenonauts.My first encounter with this game was not a rather positive one. I saw it at a friend. The game was half finished with tons of missing graphics and an unfinished campaign. After this experience I forgot about this game for several months until some sale on Steam and since I had some extra cash I gave the game a second chance (I’m a sucker for his kind of gameplay and own every commercially released UFO game and their clones for PC).The game itself is almost a direct clone of UFO: Enemy Unknown though there are several differences. Setting wise, the game is set in 1980’s during the cold war. As a bonus to the game you get a free novella in a PDF format, titled “Crimson Dagger” by Lee Stephen, which serves as an introduction to the game setting and describes in detail the first human contact with the aliens (quite a nice read). Apart from the setting, the most obvious difference is seen as soon as you start the game – there is no rotating globe, just a flat map of the earth. Than again the graphic design of the game is very nice, esthetic and functional. The core gameplay is identical to the original – you start with one base, some interceptors, a troop transport, soldiers, scientists and engineers and slowly advance the story by assaulting shot down or landed ufos, researching alien tech, acquiring new weapons, armor, craft and vehicles up until the final mission when you save the earth for good. And this all works pretty well. A nice touch is the casualties counter which track the number of people killed due to alien activities and also the on map reports of various event like forest fires, tidal waves, strafing runs ets. which might help to track a ufo outside of radar range. Some people might not like that certain parts of the game are more streamlined. There is no need to buy the basic weapons or ammunition, for both soldiers and jets. All is provided free and in unlimited quantity. Furthermore, jets have a fixed set of armaments per jet type and all upgrades to weapons installed on them are done automatically after researching certain technology, also free of charge. This take a lot of base management of ones mind though it comes at a price in ingame currency. First, funds are scares and getting stuff from ufos for sale is a must. Second, loosing a country is quite easy as building a new base is expensive, not to mention the prices for manufacturing new craft, armor or weapons for you troops. Furthermore, there is no possibility of self funding your efforts by selling weapons that you manufacture as the selling prices are way below the production costs.As for the combat part of the game, there are two types – dog fighting ufos in the air and ground combat in the form of assaulting grounded ufo, alien bases or defending cities in terror missions. The air combat is the part I like the least about this game. Its done with a pseudo radar view of the situation where a squadron (1 to 3 jets) you sent to deal with a ufo is under your direct command in an RTS like manner. You have to manage the position of your craft, range of your and enemy weapons, represented by cones projected from craft silhouettes, fuel reserves and craft health. The key it to either take out the enemy with your long range missiles or to try to get you planes in the ufo’s blind spot and use you short range weapons. If you get in trouble you can press special keys to dodge incoming fire or use the afterburners to fly quicker but use more fuel. If things get nasty, you can order your jets off the combat field and run away. All in all I’m very glad that the creators of the game gave players the option to auto resolve this part of the game. For me it’s a blessing as I really didn’t like this particular air combat system.The ground combat, on the other hand, is done extremely well. The graphics are sharp, clean and present different types of object on the map in a way that players will immediately understand. The animations of units, both your and aliens are nicely done and you rarely have problems distinguishing units one from another. Terrain sets are varied and depict farmlands, cities (in Eastern European, US and middle east styles), military bases, forests and sub-polar regions. The alien craft themselves are varied and interesting on their own. The combat itself is done in turns using a time units system for performing actions. What is nice is that the game will inform you how many points an action costs before performing it (e.g. little numbers by the target indicator before a shot is fired) or how many time units will be left after moving a desired distance. Furthermore, a cover system is implemented, not unlike the XCOM Enemy Unknown, which has to be always taken into consideration when positioning your troops. It works by reducing chance to hit a target that is obstructed by a peace of cover, be it a bush, a fence or a fridge inside a kitchen (the game show which objects reduces the to hit chance by how many %). But its done only when you actually want to take a shot and you never know how good your soldiers cover actually is. Another interesting feature is the suppression system. Every weapon has a chance of suppressing an opponent and machineguns excel at that. A suppressed unit immediately looses all time units it currently had (especially dangerous when your soldier is suppressed by reaction fire), and on their next turn their starting time units are reduced by half. Add riot shields to the mix, which soak up damage very nicely and leave one hand free to fire a pistol or use a stun baton, and you can get a lot of combat options unavailable even in other remakes. On the down side, grenades have no primer regulation. Regular ones explode at the end of the turn while smoke or stun ones immediately after they land on the ground. Additionally, in certain situations the units can get behind object which the game engine does not make transparent. This is annoying as it is difficult to position your men to you liking or you can just “loose” them on the battlefield and not use them for a turn or two. But still, tactical combat should satisfy most of the old UFO fans. As with the air combat, there is also an option not to go and clean up a shoot down ufo and just air strike it. This way you get a fixed amount of cash, dependent on the ufo type. The downside is that you don’t get any special resources from the ufo and after performing a ground mission you always get more cash.Lastly, sound and music. As for the sound design all is done OK. Every alien, weapon, action has its own distinct sound and after w few hours into the game you will know what happened just by the sound produced, which is especially important in ground combat missions. The part that made a really big impression on by was the music, especially the one in tactical missions. For some time I was looking for a good modern version of the track played on the original – this creepy midi, with a heart beat motif and loads of strange sounds accompanying it. Well, Xenonauts delivered 11 very good tracks made by Aleksi Aubry-Carlson which you can linsten  here [aleksiaubrycarlson.bandcamp.com]. Ground Combat Day 2 is the one I had looked for.All in all I am really happy with my purchase of Xenonauts. It’s a very good take on the classical UFO formula, faithful to the original concept but still bringing its own setting and story that drive you forward to uncover the alien secrets and save the earth once more.

												First off, air combat is great - I mean, finally - this has always been a very important part of these games and it irked me that XCOM 2012 pretty much ignored it.  Here it's way more important, plays better, and has a much better consequence spiral.I wanted to like this game - I have hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in the original X-COM games.  I've finished TFTD on superhuman ironman.  I've played a ballistics only UFO Defense... I even made my way through XCOM Interceptor...<edit>  Before we go any further, I want to add a little edit since many of the comments are critical about how I can thumb down a game even though I have 120 hours into it - The short answer is:  I should really like this game, it seems perfect on paper, but I didn't and I wanted to know _why_.</edit>♥♥♥♥ this game though - and for one simple reason - the Aliens always know where you are.   And this isn't the X-COM: EU type of alien squadsight where if they see one troop, they can see all your troops.   This is where if you are within range of an alien, even one that's never looked outside the UFO, it triggers a special AI.   This is the kind where if you have a wall between you and an alien, the alien will be facing you through the wall.  Remember how in TFTD there would be those little closets where aliens would get stuck because of a pathing bug?  And to kill that last alien you'd have to either eat up its reaction fire with rookies or blow through the walls from another direction?  Well, this is half of the aliens in this game.  And you can't blow through the walls.  UFO breaches, depending on the layout, are either brutal or tedious.   Most of the time the aliens will just sit behind the door in their command center, full TUs, waiting to reaction fire as soon as you make a move.   And that's nothing compared to alien base assaults.Jesus effing Christ - the beginning of the assault are fun - about a third of the aliens on the map will make their way to the LZ and try to push you out.  The next phase is classic XCOM - carefully make your way to the control room, removing opposition as you go.  The last phase is just mind-numbing tedium - 1/3 of the aliens in the base are sitting in a single room, barely moving so they can keep their TU high for reaction fire.  Problem is that there's something like a 60% chance that if they hit your fully armored guys, they will kill you in one hit.  They, on the other hand - take 3-5 hits, on average to take out.  Now, add in the lovely 'Dread' effect and half your team will have 30% of their TUs removed.  Just 'cause.  It's like they combined the worst parts of all the XCOM games - Alien PSI spam, Lobstermen Bullet Sponges, XCOM 2012 projectile/cover dynamics, Apocalypse AI camping - and they put it all into a single room.  Then we can talk about LOS issues - they are everywhere.  The number of times I have gotten shot (or have shot) through a wall is ridiculous.  Or aliens shooting through solid obstacles from the fog of war.  Or sitting in the middle of a roof and having an alien along the wall of the building be able to hit me.  How about trying to throw a grenade over a knee-hgh wall, only to realize that you don't *throw* grenades so much as you fire them in a direct line from your chest.Moving past the map issues, the way ballistics work is just broken.   In the original X-COM, you shoot a bullet, it will fly in a straight line until it hits something (Wall, scenery, alien, back of your team mate's head) or it goes off the map.  It's simple, it worked - your accuracy percentage was your chance to hit a target at 20 tiles, that accuracy determined the size of the cone the bullets leaving your weapon would travel.   The game didn't care what you were shooting at, just put the bullets in that cone and they did what they did - whether it was boring a hole through a house or taking down a floater.  Here, you have a) a chance you'll hit the alien (XCOM 2012) and b) a chance to hit anything in the way. (XCOM 94)  Let's say that you're shooting at an enemy with a LMG.  There's a bale of hay between you and the enemy, but you know that your LMG can shoot down that hay bale if you get 2-3 shots into it.  So, you force target the alien and the first 3 rounds of your 10 round burst do indeed destroy the obstacle between you and the bad guy.  You expect to see the 7 remaining bullets proceed to kill or even just supress the alien on the other side.  Unfortunately, the remaining 7 rounds just *poof* disappear, stopping where the hay bale used to be because that chance to hit an alien is determined before the first shot is made.  That's the XCOM 2012 binary hit / miss calculation ♥♥♥♥ing everything up.  Even if you have a clear path between you and the alien, the bullet will still disappear at the alien's square and you'll get a *miss* text pop up over the alien's head.  It won't continue past them on these occasions, possibly hitting the explosive barrels on the tile directly behind them, just another *poof*.  That game said you had 95% chance to hit that alien, and even if your bullet had perfect dead-center trajectory, that 5% will kick in and eat that bullet.Oh, and sidenote - dread is the worst game mechanic ever introduced.

												I think that one of the best ways to define Xenonauts is as a ""spiritual remake"" of X-Com: UFO Defense. By that I mean that the developers attempted to recreate the original X-Com as faithfully as possible (while at the same time improving on the classic's flaws) but had to use a different setting, considering they don't own the rights to the X-Com franchise (hence the ""spiritual"" aspect). What is the result of said remake? Simply put, the best X-Com game that I have ever played. Xenonauts succeeds admirably at perfecting the formula that made the original game a timeless classic, and while it does have a few flaws, it is nonetheless a fantastic turn-based strategy game. It also brings forth a very nice artistic design, and streamlines the original's cumbersome UI, thus successfully bringing the original concept into the modern era of gaming.In Xenonauts, you act as the commander of the titular organization tasked with defending the Earth against an alien invasion set in a Cold War-era setting. The game is divided into three separate components: a real-time administration simulation with 4X and sandbox elements where you manage the bases of your organization (assigning all kinds of tasks such as research, manufacturing of equipment, and building of annexes) and monitor for UFO activity in a map of Earth; a real-time with pause minigame where you engage UFOs with your interceptor aircraft; and a turn-based strategy component where the actual combat against the aliens happens. This last mode is where the meat of every X-Com game lays, and in the case of Xenonauts, I'm happy to state that said combat missions are every bit as challenging, tense and satisfactory as they were in X-Com: UFO Defense. Furthermore, the turn-based combat has been largely improved from the original, featuring more deep, complex mechanics, a wider array of weaponry and artifacts, and a healthy dose of streamlining where it was needed. You have to keep in mind that this is a very challenging and difficult game. Every choice you make has consequences, and actions are irreversible. Furthermore, if you play on Ironman (a mode which I recommend activating from your very first playthrough, as these kind of games are clearly designed to work that way) you will not be able to reverse to a previous save state. You'll have to learn to go on with your choices, both good and bad, and I can't emphasize how fulfilling it is to achieve victory in these conditions. Remember though that if one of your soldiers dies, they're gone. Forever.A rather notorious addition that Xenonauts made to the X-Com formula is the air combat. As I mentioned earlier, this is a real-time with pause minigame where you direct your aircraft against the UFOs in a radar-like interface, trying to maximize the damage you deal to them while avoiding their deadly attacks as much as possible. While I think this mode is far from perfect, as many times I felt it was a bit shallow, it is nonetheless a huge leap from UFO Defense's barebones interception system, and I think it succeeds in getting the job done.The only real complaint I have with Xenonauts is with the way that psionic attacks works. This was a huge flaw in the original X-Com, as psionic abilities were hugely overpowered. In Xenonauts, they tried to fix this by making psionics unavailable to humans and making it a bit less powerful in aliens. Unfortunately, the result is that many times you feel completely powerless against psionic attacks, as there's no research that allows to counter it (something like the Mind Shields in XCOM: Enemy Unknown would have helped a lot in making it a fairer mechanic). Still, it's not a game breaking flaw, and the game it's still an excellent one even with the annoyance it poses.At the end of the day, I don't see any reason not to recommend this game to everyone interested in a deep, complex, and tactical experience. For classic X-Com fans, this is a no-brainer, and for newcomers the lower difficulties are forgiving enough to make learning the basics of the game a smooth experience (keep Ironman mode activated though, that's the way to play this, in my opinion). Go for it.			"

												This is a solid strategic game.  Sure, it doesn't have the eye-popping 3D graphics of the current XCom games, but what it's lacking there it more than makes up for in challenging gameplay.  And by challenging, I don't mean aliens picking you apart while you hide in full cover and wonder what the point was.  The aliens here will find ways to flank you with the same type units that at other times often would hole up defensively instead.  Sometimes it takes carefully placed explosives / flashbangs / stun gas into an area just to give you a leg up vs. them.  It is also a difficult game to master in terms of having a good gameplan finance-wise.  Will you spend a pile of your initial funding on science research to get a better technological balance vs. your foe, or will build extra hangars to combat the increasing ufo assault?  How much of that funding will go to engineers to help you build better weapons & vehicles quickly enough to be of real use, and how much of it will you spend on soldiers to have enough to stop terror missions while still defending your own base?  Or I should say, 'bases', because one will not be enough, as the threat is ongoing and everywhere.  It's a fine line to walk (and I'm just talking about normal difficulty here).So if you get distracted easily, or you're looking for a lot of gloss and entertaining Wow - factor, this game might not be for you.  If you're into a game that'll hand you your ♥♥♥♥ the first few times you play it and demand that you improve your strategy, well then you've come to the right place. :)			"

												I am pleasantly surprised.The original X-Com was best known for its punishing difficulty.  But it was also known, among people who played it much, for its annoying idiosyncracies and irritations.  Xenonauts does away with many of these, simplifying things while keeping much of the difficulty.  For example, you can define soldier classes that have no game effect, but allow you to set default equipment.  Standard-issue gear costs nothing and takes up no space, because a base commander has better things to do than count rifle clips.  Base defenses are automatically upgraded, because really, who wants to rebuild base components every time you research a new tech?Some things are harder: The tech tree seems to keep things a little more out of reach, and funding is absolutely brutal.  Some things are easier: Riot shields.  Oh my God, riot shields.  Instead of ablative rookie shields, lead your squad with a guy with a shield and a pistol.  Why the hell didn't we have these in the original X-Com.  It feels so good (and it won't help at all when a Chryssalid, or whatever they call them in Xenonauts, comes knocking).  Also, if you crash an interceptor, your engineers will recover it and put it back together in a week or so.  Losing an expensive ship near the beginning of the game is no longer painful enough to make you want to start over.A personal favorite feature of mine is airstrikes.  Are there four small crashed UFOs on the map at once?  Do you need cash?  Do you cringe at the thought of playing them all out?  Just hit the airstrike button and the local military will blow it away, recover the scrap, and pay you for your donation...less than you'd get from a raid, but well worth the savings of player time.  Also, intercepting alien ships is pretty rad.  New dimension that X-Com never had, and it might not be your thing; you order your planes around in realtime, outflanking and gunning down the enemy with nifty fields of fire.  Personally I could take it or leave it, but there's an autoresolve button, and since you can recover crashed ships it won't instantly ♥♥♥♥ you over!If you've ever heard me complain about Galactic Civilizations II, you know I hate bad humor, especially in tech trees.  I know...I'm weirdly specific that way.  Well, your lead scientist in Xenonauts has an irritating intellectual superiority complex, but it's written *just right*, enough that you get a wonderful, subtle characterization just from the tech reports, no cutscenes required.  You want to deck him in the face, not turn him off entirely.  Well done, Goldhawk.Anyway, I've played to the point where I'm through the first terror mission, and I gotta say there's a huge difficulty spike.  Just as it should be.  If you think the first month is too easy, take another look at your funding, and wait for some pain to roll into tactical.  As a big fan of the original X-Com, I heartily endorse this game: Cleaning up all the annoyances and adding a few new features has truly made it new again.  It's the game we loved, without the trappings of retro.  Clear your calendar.			"

												X-Com not X-Commy enough for you?We're going back to our roots here. No fancy 3d graphics hogging your resources. Ain't no voice actors here, just 100% pure, uncut, grade A tactile turn based combat. Hire people based off stats, Assign them based off stats. Equip them with stolen alien tech to improve their stats. Build up your base to increase stats. Stats everywhere. I really like how when you're inching a dude forward and then set him in prone, you can move him again if another guy uncovers an alien that suddenly has him vulnerable if he has enough points left, all in the same turn. Their system really helps make the combat feel forgiving while remaining engaging and fun. You can afford to take some risks which makes the combat feel faster and more fluent then typical tactical turn based games.There isn't really a whole lot to say here, you know the formula and these guys executed it well. Great combat, music and graphics... just an all around stellar title. Be sure to pick this one up.			"

Early Access Review
								The real alternative for everybody, who thought the X-COM remake from Firaxis was not close enough to the original.While also in an alternate reality (the X-COM scenario was always a bit in the future), this game starts in the late seventies of the last century. The technology involves the guns from that time (first iterations of the M16 and similar weapons) to begin with, but in true X-COM fashion, these will soon be replaced with the technology from the enemy.Base building (multiple bases on the planet are a necessity in order to win), soldier management, loadout customization, UFO tracking and intercepting, all that works very similarly to the original X-COM and is not streamlined for the ""newer generation of gaming"" (whatever that means...). We have UFO recovery missions, base assault missions (both offensive and defensive) and terror site missions. There is no story missions or such, which take you by your hand, you have to make your own story.The missions play in a traditional round-based system with actionspoints. When actionpoints are not used up in a round, the soldier can have an interrupt chance and fire back at the enemy (same rule applies for the aliens, so watch it when opening the door of a UFO).On the negative side, there is not really any sort of tutorial. However, with the newest patch a lot of tooltips have been introduced which explain the game rules, but I can see that this could be a bit tedious for a new player. Also, the graphics might not be everybody's cup of tea (check some screenshots to see what I mean).All in all, I can highly recommend this. While not released yet (still beta), the release is just around the corner and there are a couple of bugs left to be squashed. But it is highly playable. Just the ironman mode is a bit of a gamble, since there is no guarantee, that the save game does not get corrupted.			"

Early Access Review
								Xenonauts is a UFO:EU-inspired turn-based tactical strategy game set during the Cold War. The game begins in 1979, when the player is tasked with leading a joint NATO/USSR task force formed in response to a mysterious alien threat. The player is responsible for managing every level of the organization, from constructing bases and researching new technology, to deploying and commanding fighters, to directing individual soldiers on the battlefield in turn-based combat.Aesthetically, the game has a unique, classy visual identity, great sound design, and a superb soundtrack.Gameplay-wise, the game is of course similar to its inspiration, X-COM (or UFO: Enemy Unknown), but with rebalanced combat, a vastly superior interface, added mechanics (such as suppression), and real-time air combat. If you're a new player who was at some point intimidated by the original X-COM's initial lack of direction and micromanagement, or a fan of Firaxis' XCOM looking for a different experience, definitely give Xenonauts a try. It has all the depth and fun of the original X-COM but with almost all of the micromanagement stripped out and a clearer, more presentable interface.If you're a UFO:EU vet, you'll find something new here. For instance, unlike in UFO, combat armor is extremely valuable, but also heavy, so if you want to follow the tried and true strategy of blowing everything up with C4 you'll have to pay for it in either survivability or mobility. Running out of ammunition can be a very real concern. Suppression and improved alien AI moves the gameplay away from massed reaction fire toward more dynamic ""fire and maneuver""-style gameplay.The best thing about Xenonauts is its ability to remain ""faithful"" to UFO:EU without feeling like a nostalgia-driven fan remake of an older game. Xenonauts is not afraid to make changes to the formula if they benefit the overall game, nor is it trying to ""recapture"" the greatness of its idol. Xenonauts wants to forge its own identity as a bleak, uncompromising, tense, occasionally terrifying strategy game. And it largely succeeds.Very much recommended.			"

												I wanted to like this game so bad, I tried so hard to like it... but after about 15 hours vanilla and 15 hours modded, I just can't recommend it. I can break this game down into a few components and I'll review them individually - let's start with the good: Air Battles: I absolutely adore the air battles in this game. The geoscape is a flat map, UFOs pop up, and you send out your aircraft. When you hit them, you get to know exactly what they are and can choose to retreat, tail them to get a better engagement positiion, or just go in for the kill. What follows is a fast-pased ""real-time"" (though pausible) battle between your jets and the enemy aircraft. Depending on your armement and the foe, these can be breeze or a complete nightmare. Shooting down UFOs over land gives you the option to simply annihilate the remains for money, or go in to attempt to capture resources. Base Management: Base management is also great! You do the thing, build the rooms. Manage the number of people your base can provide for, the ratio of scientists to engineers to soldiers. Keep enough medbays for sick fellows, hangars for your planes, garages for your vehicles. If aliens get to your base (and they will), the battle will take place in your base, as you designed it. But that's not the end of it, because you don't get just one base, you get as many as you please! Each one with it's own radar range, vehicles, squads, researchers. Graphics: And here we go. I know this may be vein, but I think it's important - Xenonauts lacks absolutely any semblence of luster. It is the most God-damn dreary, drab, boring, plain graphics I have seen. The original X-Com was more colorful, Gameboy games used better palettes, and it can't dare to compete to anything with a budget (ala XCom 2012). I feel absolutely fine playing old games with crappy graphics, but there's no life in Xenonauts. Everything but fire and smoke are perfectly still when you're thinking. There are no idle animations, in fact there are almost no animations at all! Shooting isn't satisfying - just lift the gun and a gentle ""pew pew"". Threw a grenade? ""Poof"" and it's over. This game feels like it was drawn up by an insurance salesman. It's completely lifeless and boring, it feels like a placeholder.This complaint isn't even superficial, it actually impacts gameplay. Handling the different vertical layers is painful at best, you'll lose enemies because their colors are exactly the same as the environment they're standing in!  Ground Combat: But it gets worse. The ground combat is just  DREADFUL . Watch as you:* Throw a grenade and have it fall to the feet of your soldier, killing him and perhaps another squady. * Struggle to work with the LoS cover mechanics - the enemy shoots you, you can't shoot back, you move out from cover, they take a reaction shot (we'll get to that later), you shoot (and miss), and then step back into cover. There's no peek mechanic. The awkward camera and bad visuals just make this even worse. There's so little feedback ever given to you on what you can expect and the feedback you do get straight-up  lies . And don't forget, and I'm not joking, the aliens can shoot through the hulls of their ships. You read that correctly, they shoot through the hulls that you can't so much as see through because the engine can't handle their circular shape. * Not take reaction shots, - seriously, who thought of this? In the original X-Com, units would consistently take reaction shots if they had enough TU. In the new XCOM, overwatch just  works . Reaction fire in this game is a delve into madness! A team with 100% TU will just completely ignore an enemy reaper walk up and murder them.  It's completely RNG, yet the aliens take them almost every time you move! * Have soldiers panicking or unnerve every turn, losing half or more of their TU. Fine. Workable. But then you get worthless mechanics like ""berserk"" - which have your unit turn to their nearest ally and blow out their brains. This isn't a psi attack, it's a game mechanic. Fans of the game counter this by, and I kid you not, always holding their weapons in the backpack - taking them out each individual use.* Just die. Not because you made a bad decision, not because your weren't equipped, not because of clever AI, and not in a way you can learn from, but just because. They shoot through their ship walls, they shoot through cover you can't even see around, they toss grenades before they get any form of LoS. Your soldiers kill each other, your soldiers kill themselves. Opened a door, eat shrapnel. No one takes reactions shots, reaper squad kills them all. Rockets and grenades blow up at you or the flanking squad's feet. Dying is good, it makes you learn and gives your decisions meaning and consequence. But you don't die in this game, you just stop living for no reason at all. Despite all this, though, I still want to love it. I'll come back to it from time to time; and I'll update my review as I see fit.			"

												Play it on Normal + Ironman, read a couple of guides, accept that you'll lose a couple times before you put a solid run together, and Xenonauts will stand up as one of the best strategy games you've ever played. More than anything it's the way that Xenonauts keeps tireless pace with me -- I might get an economic or technological edge, only to have my veteran soldiers wiped out by a new enemy type or a bad decision. I adore XCOM -- it's probably my favorite game of the past five years -- but Xenonauts is deeper, tougher, more personal, more detailed, more PC, and a better strategy game if you play it with a bit of patience.

												This is as close to a completly faithful remake of XCOM that we're ever going to get. And boy, is it faithful. It even adds a few new things, like a dogfighting minigame that's leagues better from we had in either the old XCOM or the remake.Combat is nice in balanced, and my only real nitpicks are that grenades are overpowered and clearing ships is a meatgrinder, since unless you outright destroy the door, UFO entrances will close every round, forcing you to play whack-a-mole. If you ever played UFO Defense, or even just Enemy Unknown, you owe it to yourself to buy this and give it a whirl. I give it a hearty recommendation to anyone.			"

												Xenonauts is amazing! If u're a fan of the original XCOM or even the XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within, then u'll love this one. Especially if u're looking for more of a challenge compared to XEU. Xenonauts definitely offers the player more control over what/how u can spend and allocate your funds, as well as more randomness in terms of ground combat and enemy placement.If I had to pick a negative, I would say that the game doesn't necessarily have a random map generator like the original XCOM did/does. Xenonauts has more of a semi random map generator, in which u may come across a similar map, but the layout in terms of what's on the map may be different. For example; instead of a crate being placed in a particular part of the map, there may be a set of parked cars or debris of some kind etc. Of course in the forums, u can always download custom maps ppl design, and add em to ur game to spice it up, and keep the game fresh as well. I would imagine (if they hadn't already or are already in talks) they would possibly put up a patch as far as implementing a random map generator.Other than that, the game is absolutely Amazing!!! I still haven't even seen all the maps nor all the enemies as well. If I were to pick a number, I would definitely give this game a 9/10, 4/5, B+/A u name it..			"

												If you love the original XCOM games. Get Xenonauts. It's as close as it gets to the original but with many many improvents regarding gameplay and manegement. It also adds tactical interceptions which are quite challenging. XCOM: Enemy Unknown wasn't a bad game, but Xenonauts is much better if you really want to sink your teeth into a strategy game.The graphics are... well... functional and they look nice, but do not expect flashy 3D extravaganzas. I am glad I bought this early on...although its not finished I still enjoyed hours of gameplay.Added after final relase:I currently can't recommend this game. There are some weird glitches going on. First of all I have had several crashes midmission. This is no fun if you don't save every minute and there is no quicksave feature. (so you have to go to the menu and save manually). /Added: This seems to be fixedSecond of all...the cover system is weird. If you kneel behind a wall that looks like 3 feet high it often said it I had a 45% chance that my shot gets blocked by said wall. IRL I would put the gunbarrel on top of the wall. Aliens shoot at me but it says 100% blocked when I want to shoot back. That feels wrong. Cover and blocking are really unintuitive and glitchy.Third of all...the FOV for your soldiers is like 45 degrees on each side. What are my soldiers...moles? But having an alien 60 degrees to the left and just 5 squares away and I cant see him? What about peripheral vision. That alien stood there without cover.I was kind of ignoring these issues in early access but as a finished product I can't. I was so looking forward to play this game proper but it was just aggravating. I understand that its hard, that aliens can look and shoot better but feeling like commanding a troop of myopic idiots is'nt fun.For a little 90sec demonstration:

												This is the only faithful remake of the original 1994 game UFO: Enemy Unknown (aka X-COM: UFO Defense). It has numerous flaws, but in the end it captures enough of the original X-COM magic to be well worth playing. (The recent Firaxis game, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, is an excellent game in its own right, and probably a better game, but is not faithful to the original X-COM formula.)The game improves on the original X-COM in several ways. It helps reduce end-game grind by allowing you to skip the ground combat after shooting down a UFO, in exchange for greatly reduced rewards. It eliminates the X-COM problem of having to laboriously track down the final alien. It updates the interface to more modern standards of user-friendliness. It adds a proper cover system (albeit a frustratingly bad one). It adds an air combat mini-game to make shooting down UFOs more interesting. And, it adds some mod support to the game. Soldier advancement is pretty well-designed too, allowing rookies to get better without you having to force them into dangerous situations so they can get kills, although I think the original X-COM was okay in this respect.Unfortunately, the flaws are many.The AI is quite stupid. Aliens (and civilians) often run around in circles, or run back and forth through a fire until they die. Your squadmates don't seem to care about friendly fire during reaction fire, so if they have a 25% chance of hitting an alien and a 65% chance of hitting a teammate, they'll still take the shot. You want to keep your machine-gunners behind you because they're not very flexible, but then you have to worry about them slaughtering a team member if they decide to do reaction fire. Or, you want your infantry to advance behind a tank for cover, but they might shoot and blow up the tank trying to hit an alien on the other side. And there's no way to disable reaction fire to avoid this.The cover system appears nice at first, but it's quite bad. It's just nonsensical what kind of objects can block your shot or grenade. If you're next to a tall box, and on the other side of the tall box is a short box, you can shoot over the tall box but the short box will block your shot even though that's impossible. Etc.There are unforgiveable flaws in the game simulation. If you know an alien is on the other side of a flimsy fence, you might think ""time to blast through it with my machine-gunner"", but no. The first bullet may destroy the fence, and the other nine bullets will just hit the empty space where the fence used to be. This makes machine-gunners far less useful, since they can't punch through obstructions to hit enemies behind. Also, there's no gravity. A favorite tactic of mine in the original X-COM was to get the drop on enemies by blasting a hole in the ceiling and dropping in on them. In Xenonauts, you can make a hole, but you won't fall through. Even with a big hole, you can just walk around in the air where the floor used to be. (Similarly, if you kill a flying enemy, its corpse will just float in the air.)Other, less important omissions from the simulation that existed in the original X-COM: no negative effects from smoke inhalation, temporary unconsciousness, etc. Also, sometimes in Xenonauts, you can see through walls. So presumably the aliens can see you through walls.The maps are small, few, and not randomized, unlike the original X-COM which had random maps. You'll see repeat maps pretty often by the end of the game. The ground is entirely flat, unlike the original X-COM which had hills and whatnot. The alien ships are linear and thus safer to assault compared to the original X-COM ships which could be quite treacherous.The game fails to capture the tension and fear from the original X-COM, at least for me. When you start the original X-COM, you have 14 men (with the least-upgraded transport ship). Before you even exit the transport ship, plasma bolts start flying your way. You can't even see who's shooting at you. Your men are dying. You're diving for cover, or trying to. The aliens are blasting your cover apart. Gotta find new cover. Shoot back, or keep moving?? Finally, you get to a good spot or kill the immediate attackers. Three men are dead, and two are wounded. And now you can start trying to complete the mission... The aliens in the original X-COM are dangerous. They can see further than you, their weapons are devastating, and they frequently ambush you. In Xenonauts, I never really felt threatened in the same way. The aliens aren't very aggressive, they can't see further than you, and there isn't as big of a difference in weapons. You never have to fight in the dark, and almost never in buildings. You can fight every mission in daylight. As a result, it's easier than X-COM and it doesn't feel as satisfying to turn the tide of the war because you don't start so far behind. That said, there's an iron-man mode, which should help add some of the missing tension back into the game.Alien psionics are devastatingly random. There is no way to effectively defend yourself against them. No matter how strong-willed your men are, no matter how high their morale, health, etc., they will frequently be mind-controlled or worse. Combined with the fact that psionics don't require line of sight, it's just frustrating rather than fun, especially if you want to play iron-man and can't reload the game.The game lags even on a modern system sometimes. For instance, after I added a hovertank to my team the game started lagging pretty noticeably.The developers seem a bit incompetent. When flaws like those mentioned above were pointed out (e.g. why the cover system was so bad), they said they couldn't fix them because ""it's too hard"". X-COM did many of these things better in 1994, and many other games do them better today, so I think if it's too hard it's because the developers aren't good enough at their jobs. (Also, I've been programming for decades so I know something about what things should and shouldn't be hard to do.)In addition, there are numerous small bugs, but they're not too annoying and at least the game seems stable. It has never crashed for me.In spite of all those problems, if you're a fan of the original X-COM, I believe you'll enjoy this game.			"

												THIS IS IT!This is new version of old classic XCOM serie.Is this as good as original? It's even better. And I know what I am saying - I'm a big fan of original game.Developers just took classic game and developed it again trying to improve every aspect. And they achieved their goal.It's still complex and complicated game but some aspects are wisely simplified.Game feels very finished but developers still work on that title - BRAVO.VERDICT:If you're fan of original XCOM, you must try this, you will probably love it.If you are a fan of new XCOM version, you should also try it. There is huge chance you will like this game too.If you are just a fan of good games, you should try this one, because it's just great game.But if you are fan of modern super graphics ultra simplified 3D games, don't try this.

												In short: Game is excellent, it has it's flaws and other small things, but in overall, a worthy reboot of UFO: Enemy Unknown (X-COM: UFO Defense in NA). You must buy it if you enjoyed UFO back in the days.Pros.:+ lives up to any UFO: Enemy Unknown lover's expectations+ scary musics which gives a good vibe on the battlefield+ you can take control of an air battle, meaning you control your jets against the alien ships+ easy to learn the ropes of the game+ ability to airstrike a crashsite, which can give you some easy cashCons.:- sometimes the game can be a pain in the ♥♥♥, i.e. early invasions of Androns- the RNG is too strong sometimes, so you need to plan ahead if you want to surviveI hope that the devs will consider making the reboot of X-COM: Terror From The Deep.

												The best bit about xenonauts is that it is an awesome port of a classic game with updated graphics and a few cool new ideas and changes.The worst bit about xenonauts is that it is an awesome port of a classic game that was not implemented fully. So much of this game is half way done and not fleshed out fully.Let me explain.It's prettier than original x-com... if by prettier you mean higher resolution. There is no way to rotate the map, no way to zoom the map in or out (well... you can change the resolution i guess), no minimap, fences and doors obscure everything behind them unless there is a npc or player model on that square... the list goes on.The geoscape is a mess. It's a flat projection of the world that takes as long to travel around the pole as it does at the equator and radar ranges are perfect circles. This would not be a problem except someone decided to be clever and program in a realistic day/night transition that even moves up and down with the seasons. It's not game breaking, gameplay is balanced around the flat map and perfect circles...Yet I can not get over the realistic day night line. If you're going to do one bit right, you have to do all the bits right, not half of it.You can set things on fire! But there is no incendiary ammo, and things you would expect to burn (hay bales, wooden buildings) don't. Once again, it's a lovely mechanic ripped form original x-com that is implemented half way.This basically applies to every single item in the game. Research, manufacturing, base development, combat, tooltips, in game information, etc.I'm enjoying playing this game... in short stints. If I play too long the flaws grate too much and I get frustrated with the game instead of enjoying it.If you can overlook/don't notice the flaws xenonauts is a solid x-com remake and is be a lot of fun.

												Xenonauts is a great game.Once I shot down a main craft over at snowy I suppose planes of Greenland. Just a routine intercept, kill those alien sum♥♥♥♥♥es, get that much needed dosh so I could build another base and name it something from Secret Warriors. Or so I thought.My brave men and women including Iosif Nichayko, Ellen Ripley, Rick Deckard and my main killing mean machine lieutenant John Cross who rocked cool moustache, Wolf armor, a riot shield and a plasma pistol were all there.My prised bull Iosif who was always clearing the UFO itself with a shotgun got shot almost immediately by a crased Icelandic reseacher who mistook our dropship for some sort of huge alien spacecraft. My brave men and women couldn't retaliate and thus commit a horrible war crime of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a cold dead body of an Icelandic meteorologist because said meteorologist was shot by his pal, another reseacher present on this snowy research station. The man nodded and moved on completely dissappearing from the point of view of my brave men and women.The research station itself was swarming with reapers, disgusting aliens who turn men into zombies and ♥♥♥♥ corpses. They weren't such a huge problem for mymen since my APC made a quick work of them.We finally made it to the alien aircraft. It was on fire, dying moans and swearing in some beastly alien language were heard from inside. We sweeped the first hall, nothing but reptiloid bodies and blood. ANd in the second hall we found the same honorable Icelandic scientist executing sebilian officer.He then slowly walked into the flame and dissappeared again.The mission was a success. "

												I had bought this game in early access, when Greece was still located in Europe(and not in the Middle East) because I wanted to support the developers and help them finish what seemed like a game with amazing potential.After that, I followed the development at the forums, I saw all good things about the game being ""watered down"". I saw absurd concepts like ""indestructible interceptors"" being divined and adopted by the developers, despite of the abundance of *much better* ideas and propositions by the community in order to achieve the balance desired, without destroying immersion.I saw the developers insisting that, after >4 years in development, the trajectory of grenades is not weird to be the same as projectiles(and be stopped on 60 cm walls or on a soldier just in front of you), because ""it is not easy to program"" :o.I heard the most absurd excuses about why random maps ""are impossible to implement"", while the original X-COM had them so many years ago(one of them was ""the better graphics"" in this game :o ).I witnessed the arrogance of the developers(threatening their early access clients with banishment from the forums because they did not agree with the turn the game was taking, disrespectful to straightforward insulting replies to criticism and more) and their complete indifference and disrespect to the type of game they were creating.I was given as excuse for the placement of Greece with the middle east as being ""difficult for the game code to handle it being with Europe, because there was no land connection"". It does not seem that Scandinavia has such a problem, though, despite not being connected by land to the rest of Europe(or, should I say, Western Europe, since they peculiarly decided to pick the cold war era for their game?).Realism and consistence with the time period set up was an excuse(whenever they bothered giving one) for the things people did not like as they were holding down game experience, but was never an issue when the decision was facilitating the ""development"" of the game.The game was getting progressively worst, cool features removed, flat progression inserted, the development team was obvious that they did not care at all. All they wanted was to be done with it. Believe it or not, 1 1/2 year ago, the Goldhawk owner was asking for coders for another project since ""Xenonauts was at the verge of completion"" and wanted to share the resources with other projects for cost efficiency!!This is the history of the making of the game as I witnessed it. Result?A Broken Game!The game is aspiring to have all cool features from X-COM, Jagged Alliance and various other great games of the past combined, but it fails in all accounts due to the laziness of the developers, the inexistent game design and the ridiculously high amount of bugs in the game.This game has the most historically and topographically unrealistic ""realistic strategic setup"" ever made in a strategy game.This game has the most lame balance ever in a strategy game I have ever played.I feel I was cheated by Goldhawk and I can say for certain that I will *never* buy or recommend a title produced by this laughable excuse of a company and they are the reason I will never again buy an Early access game again.I hope that this review will save some X-COM fans from throwing away their money, because the positive reviews of this game are greatly deceiving and misleading to anyone that reads them.

												Xenonauts is all about patience. For my first hundred of hours I was just learning the ropes here... and I have nothing to say against the accusations for this game being too unfair and too repetative.Firaxis XCom with LongWar? Pff! In Xenonauts, every session is longer. It usually takes more than 150-200 ground battles in one game, (almost) no matter the difficulty level. And yeah, the variety of elements for scenery is quite low, so, while there will not be exactly the same maps - after you've play 2-3 battles on the each continent, you may pretend you've seen them all.Now, the difficulty. It feels just as in the Civilization games on the highest levels. The enemies will be doing same things way better. Progress speed, amount of units, their stats - especially accuracy - all this is certainly and clearly NOT balanced fairly.So, before any other notes, I felt I should tell you about it. You'll fall alot there. The price of every mistake is very high, yet quite often there is no other way than sacrifice some to save at least something. It hurts, but it's a war.As of the game in general, it has many downsides, and the worst of it, you can get tired in no time. Deficit-ridden budget, lame weaponry, weak recruits, freakingly low speed progress - the world is going into abyss, and it seems there's nothing you can do about it. It's that kind of tireness when you're getting discouraged and lay your hands down.So, to actually play this game, to like it at some level, you gotta be one of those stubborn people who don't know how to give up. And... read manual, it really helps!For instance, when I've found that I can form the wings of my fighters rather than send them one by one - it was so huge leap forward, that it raised up the torch of my fading interest, and I finally made it behind the first half of the game, onto Corvettes and some other serious shift.Does it feels like the old-good XCOM? More or less. The global map and strategy elements are certainly parsecs ahead of that Firaxis botchery. The air battles are almost just as good as old series... even if bugged sometimes, so ""autoresolve"" remains the best option. The ground fights, however... are certainly lacking something. If you're a deep fan of the XCom Enemy Unknown, and not the squad-sized TBS in general - you'll certainly be disappointed. Shootouts there are ten times less fascinating. You'll moving much more than shooting - only by maneuvers you'll have the possibility to even to odds. As aliens there are always the defending party - they'll know from where you're coming, they're already aimed and covered from the start. Good thing is that you can create routes, by blasting through walls, and other obstacles...Well, there are too much to say, and little space to do so. Let's summarize.Am I recommending the Xenonauts? Yes. But, there are many chances you'll not like it EVEN if you like the squad-based tactical games in general. It's not ""the way to banish boredom"", but a big, unfair challenge to save the world from killing squatting space invaders. Prepare for the worst, but try to win!As of usual marks, I'll say, 7.8/10 at current state. Would give it more, would there be less engine crushes, or more realistic background details.			"

												As a die-hard old strategy XCOM fan, I was impressed with this game. It brought all good memories and got me playing this game until the very end (not a lot of games kept my attention during last few years). In this state, I would give this game 9/10 points, as it ""can"" get better with bug-fixes and further development.			"

Truly great tactical turn-based game. Clearly a must-have if you're a fan of the genre!Similar to: X-Com series, Jagged Alliance series, Door Kickers, Fallout Tactics, UFO series, Deadline, Breach & Clear, Arma Tactics, and more.Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com series and it does that very well. Very challenging game where you often need to truly be tactical in order to succeed.What's the game about?Aliens are invading and only You can defend us!.. well, something like that.What makes it a challenging game?It's incredibly easy to die, especially in the early game and you have to be careful, tactical, in order for your soldiers to survive. Don't let anyone go alone, don't rush in without cover, don't be stupid.This YouTube video has some nice tips if you need help getting started, I think that he explained things briefly but thoroughly :)

												I have always said the old Microprose X-COM UFO Defense is one of the greatest games of all time. I had started to worry i was just being nostalgic about an old MS-DOS game, but Xenonaughts cured me of that concern by being objectively and subjectively superior to the old X-COM game. I now know that my feelings about X-COM UFO Defense are genuine and that Xenonaughts has surpassed it.Excellent game, maximum recommedation for anyone who likes tactical turn-based games, and a strong recommendation for everyone else.

Early Access Review
								Did you love X-Com: UFO Defense? Do you wish X-Com: Enemy Unknown was more like UFO Defense? Xenonauts does a great job of capturing what we all loved about UFO Defense and TFTD, but like every UFO Defense clone it has missed the mark a little on atmosphere and setting. The visuals aren't quite as charming as the original, but Xenonauts is definitely top dog if you want a modern UFO Defense and blows its competitors out of the water.Edit: After the feature-complete release of version 1.0, I can safely say that this is the best X-Com UFO Defense clone on the market and can not be missed if you are a fan of UFO Defense or the genre as a whole. A must buy. This review originally had suggestions for other games to check out, but I've removed them as this is the clear Alpha Dog now - I would even be tempted to suggest this over UFO Defense itself to someone who has never played either.

												Xenonauts is an alien fighting game where you play the CEO of an organisation outside of any secret intelligences the earth posses. You have been assigned to fight the impending invasion. You'll start off with ordinary weapons and aircraft, your only advantage is the planets atmosphere and the manoverability of your aircraft -- the aliens haven’t quite developed their ships to handle these conditions... yet.You'll manage a handful of scientists and engineers as well as an army of special forces. Bring down the ships, salvage the resources and research new technologies. Capture and interrogate the aliens to work out their motive. Stop the invasion!Xenonaughts is a top down strategy based game with a dynamic storyline; expect to do quite a bit of reading as the game progresses and you discover more about the alien technologies and the invasion in general.This game is not for people looking for something mindlessly fun and quick to play. You will need to contribute many hours into Xenonaughts to experience its full potential. It's a 'seriously-fun' game for people who love strategy and get a kick out of having full control of everything. "

												Xenonauts is a quite fun turn-based strategy, closely similar to XCOM.++The A.I. is very smart on higer difficulties.++Nice 2.5D eye-pleasing graphics.++Absolutely no P2W.+Detailed air combat: Control your planes. Ability to disallow use of certain weapons, too.+Excellent cover system, akin to XCOM.+It's the Cold War: You won't have advanced weapons. This is true in Xenonauts, as you start with quite weak 1960's era weapons.+Weapon technology: Once you get more advanced, you get better weapons.+Amazing autopsy system: You can see the insides of every alien, robot and organic, and even study them.+Amazing research trees. In-depth research trees with about 100 projects to research.+True-to-the biome maps: Artic tileset on Artic biomes, Desert tileset on Desert biomes, etc.+Cold War airplanes, and more: As you get more advanced, your planes get more advanced, too.+/-The A.I. is quite dumb on Easy-Normal difficulty.-Sometimes-dumb plane AI. I had a plane circle a Corvette, not firing its' torpedos.-Crashes: The game will sometimes crash when you start a mission.Conclusion: This is my first detailed review, and I hope it's good. I cannot give enough praise for this game: it is absolutely brilliant. In my opinion, it is DEFINENTALLY worth the 24.99$.Final Rating: 9.8/10.Edit: grammarfix			"

												A few scattered ideas to sum up my dissapointment, what's not mentioned here is probably good in the game, but not enough to recommend it:GameplayThe ground combat really kills it.Seriously, the line of sight/fire issues are horrible. I like playing games like this without saving (I did so with JA2) but here, to me, it seems impossible. It's just not intuitive. If I have a soldier crouch in the center on a warehouse rooftop, he shouldn't be able to get shot by someone hugging the warehouse wall. Or all the times I've moved a heavy for a slightly better position, only to be informed I now have 0% chance to hit, or something silly like a windowpane blocking 50% of my shots and not enough TUs to get back to my original position and fire. Also, I think the entire MG spray hit chance is calculated when you fire, because I've tried firing through those silly waist high walls with screens on them that you get in UFOs, which give you 0% chance to hit your target, because I figured ok, 1 round blows them away and the rest spray the alien behind... well, no, they all randomly hit the air where the screen used to be. This stuff kind of breaks a tactics game. JA2 didn't have these issues and that was 15 years ago...Also, you can't store extra gear in the dropship. I can't be the only one who used to go back to the ship to get the heavy explosives every now & again in a difficult mission. I miss that.Mission variety:There really isn't any. I know there wasn't that much in the original game either, but if there's one aspect where I think the game could've evolved, it's this one.There was just so much wasted potential here, extraction missions, coming to enforce local forces battle lines (I think they promised a static tank emplacement at one point), pilot rescue missions, I don't know, anything?GraphicsI don't mind the direction they took or the lack of female soldier models or lots of stuff that could've been. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of local forces and civilians and stuff, but the game has next to no animations, the characters don't sway, don't move, they don't anything. Everything is frozen until you take an action and then it's all very mechanical.InterfaceNo option to toggle off centering on selected soldiers starts giving you headaches when you have to move 10 of them through multiple levels like in a UFO or building.You can't reorganize your squad order, which is a mindnumbing oversight. I can't have No. 1 be the shield, 2 & 3 be assault and so on. Was it so hard to let me drag the ground combat squaddie tabs around?I would've preferred scroll up/down to change height levels instead of selected squaddies. I guess tab & tilda work well enough, though. You can change the key bindings but you can't bind them to scroll up/down. I guess you probably can if you  start tinkering with the game files but I shouldn't have to do that.XenopediaI generally love the descriptions in games like this, even Aftermath caught my interest with their alien types and whatever, but here, it feels too... textbook. I read all the entries but they felt dry and the attempts at humor seemed forced. There was 1 funny joke somewhere in there, though.ConclusionIn all, it's a real shame and it taught me a lesson about buying into this kind of stuff. Maybe that gives the pricetag some worth.			"

												It's XCOM+Superior to UFO Extraterrestrials, equal of UFO Alien Invasion, not quite the departure in story and quality that UFO Aftershock was. It does what it promises to do, deliver classic XCOM gameplay without the bugs/DOS limits.True-to-original gameplay with benefits of tech advances and without limitations of 1994 hardware. Artwork isn't pixellated or low-res, but remains 2D. The maps are 2D as well, with some tile/LOS issues, but that is just the flavor of this game. There is no need to specifically select a grenade, move it into the soldier's hand after removing the rifle, then use the nade in combat. Select it from a quick-menu and throw at the enemy. The proper TU cost will be calculated based on where the grenade was in the inventory so it costs the same, just makes gameplay easier. Inventory/equipment can be arranged and saved for future use making it possible to edit existing classes or create your own. Building Missile defences no longer requires you to dismantle outdated facilities to replace with new tech versions. They upgrade automatically when new tech is researched. Saving time and making sense. Xenonauts has many similar improvements over the original XCOM while keeping the gameplay essentially the same.EDITThere are greater departures from the original gameplay. Developers removed the ability for the player to construct manufacturing complexes and use them to create wealth by trading new technology and devices. This was exploited in the original to make funding meaningless. In Xenonauts, your budget is the direct result of your actions in defending funding governments. Let them down enough and your budget will constrict to the point of utter failure. There are no ""points"" you and the aliens score, only collateral damage caused by them and bonuses paid for UFOs shot down. You will sell small amounts of alien item, but it's a pittance compared to the gravy train you could ride in XCOM: UFO Defense. Budgetary restrictions are so severe at higher difficulty levels, that even most grizzled veterans will find it difficult to manage, and will probably lose more than once. Great news if you found all your squad-level tactical games too easy and forgiving.Tactical combat is also extremly dangerous at the highest difficulty level, to the point of it seriously not being worth it just for the sake of leveling soldiers. You will have to fight to collect researchable items or to prevent alien terror, but outside this you will not want to engage in too many battles, certainly not without decent equipment.Air combat is expanded. It takes place in a simplified RTS setting, though it is possible to autoresolve all encounters. You risk taking damage either way. Unlike the classic, aircraft shot down are not lost. In a rare moment of forgiveness, Xenonauts will recover downed aircraft, although it can take 72h to drag the remains back to base.In addition to bringing back classic XCOM gameplay, Xenonauts manages to recreate the addictivness of the original. Your mileage may vary of course, but i personally managed to clock 23h during the first three play sessions. And i found myself thinking about different tactics or wondering how the hell i'm supposed to beat the game at all.			"

Follows the Xcom1 very closelyYes! at last a game that does it right, a worthy succesor to the origional Xcom.Its at least as hard as Xcom1, maybe harderBe warned though, even if your an Xcom pro this game is tough, I'm good at Xcom player but after 4/5 failed attempts at this on ""veteran"" I had to start playing it on ""normal"".It has some differences, but you will be glad.Despite following the origional game closely, for most of its mechanics, Xenonauts does make some minor changes that improve thinngs, stores are less of a chore (many items like ammo and standard wepaons are free and infinite), intercepts are more important and more fun, funding is more important (the old exploits won't work here).Also you will generally have to develop new strategies to win.Obviously the story is different and the techs and the style, but they are all still enthralling and brilliantly done.Just buy this now.Honestly, I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this game... although the head scientist is so obnoxious you will want to punch him, but I think that's deliberate.

												Note: I used to play Xenonauts on my roommate's laptop before I got it for my steam account so my real play time is like 100+ hours I guess.2nd note: Remember to set betas section to ""community edition"", it's the unofficial patch made by the community that was approved by the devs and it makes the game much more fun.3rd note: Mods are awesome, especially X-division (makes basic game feel tremendously easy :P )Have you ever thought that new games are easy and do not require the skills we needed in the past to finish it? That there are too much tips and stuff like quest markers that completely destroy immersion and thus make games feel like Micheal Bay primitive action film? Are you dissatisfied with the new X-COM that made so many simplifications to the genre that it's almost unplayable for fans of good, old UFO?If yes, or partially yes, this is the game for you - search no more! Here you are supposed to be the hunter, but usually feel like a prey.It's not a game that's easy to learn, that you can launch for 30 minutes to ""pew, pew, pew"" some alien scum. It's a game that requires skill and careful planning to dead with obviously superior enemies. There is no absurd mechanics like X-COM aliens that start to act only when you first spot them. Aliens in Xenonauts will use every opportunity to find, shoot and kill you whenever you don't expect it. Even if there is one enemy left on the map you can't behave recklessly cause it will lead your soldiers directly to the gates of Hades. What's more, even when you achieve the most advanced weaponry and armours you will not be safe - your people will still die painfully whenever you make a mistake.I did not manage to finish this game in Ironman mode. Try it if you are hardcore enough. And remeber to train more people than the basic 10. You will need more experienced people cause most of Xenonauts gonna be fried/devoured/melted/shot by berserking friend.This game made me shoot civilians so the aliens could not infestate them and fill their ranks with mutated pawns. It made me put triggered C4 on my soldier who was doing his last stand to buy some time for the rest of the platoon. I desperately used my last unarmed soldier to evacute wounded/dead (you can't be sure till the end of a mission) comrades to evac point under fire like Desmond Doss. My best team that have not suffered a single causalty for over 10 mission got utterly massacred during alien base assault when met the new alien soldiers that fought using tactics and equipment I could have not expected.Do not listen to people who say stuff like ""aliens always know where you are"" in negative comments. With proper tactics you can manuver you opponensts into crossfire and they definitely have not seen that coming. There are some issues of course, like the easy way to fire you rocket over you enemies on ground floor while firing from heigh (one must check if they really aim for the ground level) or glitches like room where you can pass between two sofas and must enter through a window (this one can be causes by 2000+ custom maps I have installed :P). Overall the bugs are minor and do not ruin gameplay.  My final verdict:10/10 - this game is not perfect but the 10 grade is not for perfect products. It's for games that I know I will come back to    after many years have passed. Xenonauts proundly stand among classics like Gothic, first two Fallouts and Total Annihilation. I never expected to say that but both original XCOMs/UFOs should now bow to a new master of the genre - Xenonauts.Now I should go test the first public alpha of Xenonauts 2 ;) Cheers!			"

												This game is the chinese food of strategy. Ugly as hell, it's kinda hard to approach, and if not prepared right it'll make you sick. But a few awkward bites and you'll be scoffing it down.This is basically XCOM but losses feel like your own fault. The tactical depth created by line of sight, orientation, diablo-style inventory, weight and ammo management, and flexible turn-based combat means you'll be spending more time fighting aliens instead of fighting the dice.The campaign is equally deep as the combat. Rather than waiting for aliens to turn up, you must build several bases and actively send aircraft on patrol to areas with UFO sightings. The aircraft have fuel range and ammunition, as well as speed which means they might not always catch up to your target. Even the helicopter that transports your squads has travel time and should be escorted to the crash site in case a UFO shoots it down along with your soldiers.Soldiers don't have XP, but their stats go up depending on what they do. A soldier that carries lots of equipment gains strength stat and can carry even more as a result. This makes soldier rotation extra important, as you can have multiple squads en-route to raid crashed UFOs. Soldiers can be literally any role you want with how the equipment and inventory systems work (my favourite is when a sniper is buff enough to casually carry a spare bazooka. Also try riot shield + 25 grenades in backpack inventory + another 8 grenades on belt inventory. Mix incendiary, frag, smoke, flash and gas grenades for maximum tactic00l flexibility. Heck, you can even have a weaponless soldier who's sole job is to carry spare ammo and rockets).Also appealing is the hardcore Cold War SWAT feeling. Getting hit without armour usually means death, but once you nail the pattern of suppressing fire, flashbangs, and other confined-space-tactics, you'll feel like you're raiding these aliens instead of fending them off.Downsides are the learning curve and functional but slightly ugly graphics.The right way to play this game is with the Community version (opt in through beta). It's been modified and fixed up by players, and includes a bunch of essential mods by default. The map packs will save you from being exposed to the same layout over and over again.			"

												#Early Review - 5 hours in # 12 Missions downXenonauts very much takes after the ORIGINAL XCOM: UFO Defense.  If you like the original XCOM but would like some mod support, the original style of management, and the original game's map and squad size, then this game is likely for you.There are a few cons:- Objects dont seem to become transparent to show (Aliens) behind them. So sometimes you will have someone starring an alien in the eyes and not know about it until they shoot you in the face,- Teammates dont seem to care about shooting other teammates who happen to be in the line of fire. Because those aliens need to die, humanity be damned.- Can be a lot to get used to if you have only played Enemy Unknown/WithinStill early in, so can't speak for length, but so far, I like it a bunch and it is certainly a worthy spiritual successor to the original game.

												I would like to enjoy the game, but it is too much infuriating. Is not angerness as in 100% Orange Juice, or when you miss a 99% shoot in the XCOM, or when the AI in the Civ games just declare war on you for no reason.This is Cat Mario type of frustration. The enemies can shoot through 100% cover where you can't. I have been shot thought wall with pistols from totally blind points for the aliens. You get one shoot kill across the map with a shotgun. You get kill by rifle fire from too far away, and again from blind spots for the aliens. I swear some aliens are aimbots inspired from the CS cheaters.The AI is unnecessarily difficult. Is just difficult for the sake of being annoying. And that is just frustrating when you play on Ironman.My feeling is that XCOM:EU was challenging, you can still make no mistake and loose the mission, but you could recover from that. In here you need to make perfect runs, with a cheating AI, and so the game become a matter of luck rather than tactics.There are also minor CTDs, and some annoying interface designs that I don't particularly like.On the bright side, the game actually nails the air combat. You can get your deploy ship shoot down if not withing timing range of your fighters, and so on.			"

												I originally reviewed this game with a 65/100, but I really have to correct myself on this one. The game starts relativerly boring and basic and I based my passed judgement on that, but the game gets a lot better and strategic when you progress further in the game and when you have unlocked a lot of the technology.The ground combat in the beginning is fairly easy and you only have traditional weapons to work with, but as you progress and get better equipment you encounter interesting tactical situations with new opposition where every move counts and any mistake can be a brutal punishment that has a long term effect on your gameplay.What I especially like from this game is the scientific lore. Every new technology you recover and reseach has a very detailed background. And even though fictional the way it is explained sounds credible and makes sense. The devs have really thought about the underlying details of the technology and thats pretty cool.Overall the game has a lot more strategic depth than I originally thought (first few hours of gameplay). And the game mechanics and the AI is a lot better than I originally expected. This is clearly not a game made for the $, but made with passion and devotion... and it shows. 80/100!			"

												This game is a sort of spiritual sequel to the original Xcom games that I think is a bit more faithful to the original then Enemy Unknown and despite the fact that I enjoyed Enemy Unknown I definately recommend this to somebody who is looking for a more traditional Xcom experience.

												Love this game. It's very much like the old xcom granted minus some of the graphics of today. I enjoy the fights and while you don't have to do all of them, that's where I have my fun time. To me the game seems a little rushed in play as if you are not researching some things in the right order or making the money to build equipment or ships then you'll be a little on the low side to the aliens. I do feel like they could have added a few more battle fields as they do tend to get repetitive at times. I do wish the environments were a little more destructible like the old xcom. I have had aliens on a few battle fields disappear, which is frustrating when trying to track them down (still won the battle, but saw one shoot and then duck behind a corner and then couldn't find him. If he shots at me he needs to be accounted for in the body count. :) ). In game manual/help and xenopedia could be flushed out more such as, I've got the money to build a 3rd new base, but have been unable to do so. I'm sure that I'm missing something, but can't figure out what. So, little frustrated there. Original xcom was simple in what you could do comparatively (it's hard to match the formula when  it was perfect to begin with). Haven't had aliens attack one of my bases yet, while it seems that they have hinted at this by way of base defense I've yet to experience it so it makes me wonder if it was an idea that didn't quite make it.

												In X-Com, you trap the enemy with overwatch.In Xenonauts, the enemy camp the indestructible UFO, and overwatch the only door to access it.They know exactly where your team are, wherever they are. So they can sniper shot your team from across the map, way beyond the fog of war. Your soldiers usualy die in one hit, cover or not. Therefore, you often lose soldiers before you even know what you face. Lines of sight are a joke, as small obstacles likes a rock can reduce the chance to hit with a grenade, or even if you have the upper ground. Because the enemy have wall hack, the door game is atrocious. If they can, they'll open a door, shoot, then close it. You can't planify a breach like you do in X-Com.Air Game is nice tho.			"

								Live, learn, and halt an alien invasion. Watch your men get killed a lot. Set in 1979 it has the same X-COM feel with a similarly ominous soundtrack with a fresh Cold War paint job. The Xenonaut organization uses lots of cool colors, greys and blues, but the maps themselves are colorful and vibrant as you find your soldiers touring the globe in pursuit if the many different aliens hell bent on your destruction.Worth getting if you want a game that plays like the original X-COMs and/or if you weren't satisfied with the Firaxis XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Same kind of difficulty curve as the original X-COM, you fight hard for your victories. The devs also encourage ticking the ""Ironman Mode"" box for a more hardcore experience, so when the devs are flat out saying they don't cater to casuals you know you've got something special.Still a work in progress, but what's there is solid.8/10 would play on and on despite getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me at times.

												Personally, XCOM (2012) was a let down for me. My first experience with the original XCOM (I started with terror from the deep) was the cadence of managing everything on the macro level and then getting my men mowed down by the dozen in the tactical battles but still winning it. The new XCOM is great but featured too few soldiers for me to control tactically, which kind of limits the things I can do.Xenonauts is not without its own faults, but good gameplay is not one of them. Nothing beats flying into an alien base with 9 men, splitting them into squads of 3, and clearing the base in a 3-pronged attack. The 2d art is servicable and the animations are great, and it really feels like the original XCOMs with a graphics update and a new story. And that is all I ever wanted in a new game.I'd pick Xenonauts over the new XCOMs every time.			"

												Ah, good old Xenonauts, personally I find it to be as good of a game as xcom:eu and xcom 2, it does have it's flaws here and there, and it doesn't have the 3D of the modern xcom series but I find it to be a really cool experience nonetheless.Pros:-Really good strategy game-Has a Time Units system rather than the double move system from xcom:eu-A whole variety of UFOs to shoot down-A more in-depth soldier equipment screen than xcom:eu-Amazing artwork-Ability to research 2 or more projects at once-A pretty sweet modding community-Nice base building systemCons-2D map view rather then the 3D of xcom:eu-Game tends to get tedious as time goes on-Slighty buggy at times (luckily nothing unfixable)-Animations can be jerky at times-Graphics in ground combat mode aren't that pretty.The game really does has it's moments and it's pitfalls but after all I've said I still recommend it because it's still a good game and most of the bugs you can work around.

								A hardcore take on classic XCOM-like topic with strong simulation, strategy, tactical, and RPG implementations. Although it's an indie, it's already in a pretty much playable state with rigid gameplay, plus the frequent updates from the developer. If you think you got the ingenuity to repel a hardcore alien invasion, this is the game worth playing for you. I highly recommend this.			"

												Remember the old XCOM titles of the late 90’s? They were something truly special, masterpieces of the strategy and sci-fi genre’s, and while we had XCOM: Enemy Unknown in 2012, it’s something I felt didn’t quite live up to the originals due to its simplified nature, such as smaller squads and amount of hand-holding it insisted on. However, if I were to tell you there was now in fact a game that captured the perfection of XCOM in its own way and modernised it properly, would that sound too good to be true? Because that’s exactly what Xenonauts is.Xenonauts is an absolutely fantastic strategy game heavily influenced by the likes of XCOM and fans of the series will no doubt enjoy it thoroughly as it’s more of an updated throw-back to the older games as opposed to the newer ones. Newcomers to the genre though may be a little lost in its complexity due to the lack of any proper tutorial, however veterans will no doubt feel right at home and find a huge amount of content at their disposal. The amount of in-depth management can make the game feel like it drags on at times, but again, this is partially to do with the audience it is aimed at, so if you are looking for a more fast-paced game you certainly won’t find that, as it’s about being tactical and planning your moves carefully. The graphical style is very pleasant if a little simplistic but the overall cartoon-esque presentation makes it feel dated yet modern at the same time, giving it a very unique vibe. Ground combat was without a doubt one of my favourite parts of the game and is well designed and requires good tactical planning and thinking on the player’s part, even on the lower difficulties.

												I'm going to start out by saying that I fully support this game and reccomend it.  Despite any and all flaws it is well worth the money.It's been years since people have been trying to bring new life into this genre.  Many sequels and clones have gone by with mixed success.  Games like XCom: Apocalypse changed the formula too much, while a good game in it's own right, it alienated fans.  Other games like UFO: Afterlight and the series tried a different approach, but suffered from clunky menus and combat felt artificial.  The recent addition of XCom: Enemy Unknown introduced excellent graphics and animations, but this hid the fact that the strategic map was dumbed down to the point that UFOs that you didn't shoot down were not the cause of missions, in fact it was possible to shoot them all down and still have missions so long as you had a country somewhere you didn't have a satalite over.  The tactical was also super simplified.  I would call that one an XCom-lite if anything.Xenonauts does not have the flashy graphics of XCom: Enemy Unknown, nor does it vary far from the original.  However it is improved from the original in many ways and is what many fans have wanted.  It could be used as another start to evolve this hard to capture genre.Once again, UFOs are the sole source of missions on the strategic map.  If a UFO is ignored, it can generate a terror mission during a landing, or build an alien base.  No longer is there effects without causes.  In fact the atmosphere of the game is even enhanced by reports of UFO activity across the globe, such as new crop circles, missing ships, and cattle mutilations being reported in areas where you cannot track the UFOs.  Also every UFO comes with a mission of their own, something you will discover later in the game.  These missions affect their behavior, and you will have to adapt if you want to control the invasion before it's too late.Many clones/sequels allowed the player to overpower the aliens far too much.  This gave the aliens the feeling of being the underdogs despite the fact that they are the ones with the technological advantage.  Not so in Xenonauts.  While the majority of the alien fleet cannot attack immediately, buying you some time to prepare, their progress is at least in part based on your success.  If you are doing well, expect to see harder UFOs and aliens sooner than you otherwise might.  This leads you to having to make tough decisions like ""Do I let this UFO perform it's missions for a while before shooting it down?""  ""Do I want to raid every UFO for the bonus cash"" etc. because doing so can speed the rate of the invasion if you are successful.  In short, go to slowly and risk losing funding and nations.  Go too quickly and the Aliens will bring their main fleet before you're ready.  Can you walk that line?Even further you are quickly forced to decide between building better interceptors or getting better equipment for your troops.  Bullets will not do for long once aliens with armor start showing up.  Some will simply laugh off sustained fire if you aren't ready for them in time.  Defense is important too, as even the basic armor could be the difference between a shot instantly killing a soldier or not.  Even here, you cannot be reactive, as you stand to lose too much.  You have to learn to predict what you will need and when, and if you are wrong, you will pay.This game is a hard strategy game.  Every decision you make will have repercussions you might not have dreamed of down the road.  Your soldiers, while they improve, will never be the super soldiers you had in other games.  Tactics will always be important, with armor only saving you from a mistake or two if you are lucky.  A skilled player might be able to forgo armor completely, though I doubt he would do so flawlessly.  I personally am almost a year into my game and I have never used combat shields, something a lot of players say is a staple in their forces.  My body count isn't that high either, roughly at about a dozen.All this praise does come with a cost.  This game does have it's flaws.  If you need glasses, or have trouble reading small print, the fonts on the strategic map will kill your eyes.  I can barely read them as it is on 720p.  It may be better on 1080p, but that's not how I stream it.  This needs to get fixed.The graphics look like something out of Fallout 2 days.  They are excellent 2d graphics, but do not expect full 3d modelling here.  They spent more of their time making sure the gameplay worked well than actually building 3d graphics.  Still if you can overlook the graphics, there is a great game underneath.The interface, while greatly improved, is still very clunky.1.  Double clicking on a soldier in the management panel sometimes takes you to that soldier, sometimes not.  It's partly to do with how soldiers are organized on the equipment panel, partly to do with the double click speed required.2.  Planes that need to be refueled/repaired/reloaded cannot have any characteristics changed.  Even their name, or loadout.  It would be nice to be allowed to change a loadout while loading the plane with ammo.  This goes double for positioning soldiers on the dropships.3.  This is also a feature easily missed by most players, as it is hidden almost completely.  Placing a button from the loadout screen for the troops in the dropship to link to the positioning would help a lot.4.  The inability to rotate the map or hide walls makes it impossible to throw grenades on tiles behind them.This game takes place in 1979-early 80's.  Some things are anachronistic or inaccurate.1.  The basic starting rifle is the M16A2, which came into use in the 1980's.  It had a 3 round burst option and 30 round magazine.  The weapon that soldiers should be using is the M16E1 which had fully automatic options and a 20 round magazine.2.  The starting precision rifle pictured is a M16A4 which introduced a modular rail system to a rifle similar to the M16A2 allowing for the addition of scopes, laser targetting and the like.  It would have had a 30 round magazine as well, instead of the 6 rounds given.  Instead they should have used the M16E1 fitted with a scope off to the side, with a 20 round magazine.3.  The machine gun pictured is the M249 squad automatic weapon.  This weapon is designed to fire ammo from a belt in a drum underneath the barrel.  It can use M16 magazines, however this is not reccomended due to severe jamming issues.  A M249 belt comes in 3 sizes: 100 round for training, 250 round infantry drum, and 500 round vehicle mounted drum.4.  Night vision scopes were around for the Vietnam war, and should be available for snipers in night missions in the game.  Full night vision goggle(s) however will not be seen till later in the 80's.  A possible tech to research and produce them would have been a nice touch as necessity is the mother of invention they say, and something to counter the alien's advantage at night would have been a welcome choice.  Night vision goggle(s) do however restrict vision, and accuracy due to the way they operate.5.  The starting grenade pictured is a fragmentation grenade.  It has a kill radius of 10 meters with an effective radius of 5 meters.  It does not do it's damage by concussive force, but by shards of metal, like bullets, flying out in all directions.  I cannot speak of how alien grenades work, but a rework of basic grenades should be in order to make them effective in this regard.6.  Flares burn can start fires easily but do not do so in game.  Smoke grenades produce smoke slowly, and will only burn your hand if you aren't wearing leather gloves.  They should not be starting fires in this game.7.  Bazookas are not easily reloadable in field.  Carrying one as a side implement should be an option for a soldier, but ammo preloaded.  The M25 rocket launcher however could fire multiple rockets, but was a mounted weapon.			"

												If you were a fan of the old Xcom series, you will find this a excellent step in the series. I liked how they chose to steamline the purchasing of some of the smaller stuff. (No more having to buy every clip of ammo and every flare.)The only downside is that the missions can become a grind. (But they give you a option to skip them and still get some reward)I personally found the air combat hard to grasp, simply sim'ing it was easy enough though.			"

			Looking to get that X-Com fix? Want something with a different name but still the same game underneath? Didn’t like the modern X-Com remake? Try Xenonauts!		

Xenonauts: Xenonauts is a turn-based combat, alien defense simulator. You play the role as the commander of a special military force designated Xenonauts, who are tasked with the defense of earth from extra-terrestrial invaders. You’ll manage multiple bases you place on the globe, build ground and air forces to combat the alien threat, and defend humanity. Research technology gathered from shot down UFOs, and craft advance weapons, armor, vehicles and aircraft to keep toe to toe with the aliens as the get progressively tougher. Xenonauts is a fantastic spiritual sequel to X-COM UFO Defense, with the entire game playing out almost exactly the same. With that come some very odd choices. You can’t rotate the map and there are many situations where targeting becomes an issue, and a great irritation. Aliens also like to use the open and close door tactic; during the alien’s turn, they can open doors which close for them after their turn ends, this means they will stay glued to the other side of a door, come out the on their turn, take shots at your soldiers and retreat back to safety, however, when attempting this tactic yourself, the door stays open the entire round, meaning the aliens are free to shoot back during their turn. Aliens even seem to know this tactics as many times they are often waiting right behind doors, making it very annoying to advance through bases or UFOs without a guarantee of losing at least one soldier along the way, the only real remedy I found was blowing the doors to high heaven. The other unfortunate, and boring part of the game is the aircraft combat. The aircraft combat is a top-down view where you set waypoints for your ships to travel, it isn’t easy to change the flight path on the fly and the whole experience feels very slow and unbalanced, I almost always resorted to the auto-resolve, which has its own problems. When auto-resolve is at 100% it’s a guarantee victory, however, if you engage in the real time combat you can actually lose all of your fighters. On the flip side, there have been battles with an auto-resolve 0% rating but, when I engaged in the combat I was able to win. Also, alien space ships seem to have unlimited ammo while you have a very limited amount for your own fighters. The whole thing felt messy and unrewarding, you don’t get to see your ships engage in the combat other than green radar blips you see all the time, so auto-resolve seemed the best and most convenient way to deal with the aliens, this is a pretty big part of the game aside from ground combat and it’s a shame it isn’t more exciting or balanced, there’s also no way to take down aircraft without damaging it. The other major complaint I have is the lack of mission variety, crash sites are won either by eliminating all aliens or capturing and holding their ships for 5 turns, alien bases are won by either destroying the power core or eliminating all aliens. Those are the only two varieties and couple that with small map variety and the game can start feeling very tedious. Some other things felt missing like a graph for finance and approval ratings from the various countries and just some minor graphical bugs I’ve experienced. I’ve enjoyed my time with Xenonauts, and would like to see it expanded upon, with more maps, missions, added tools and utilities, and better combat and varied environments. I could go into more detail, honestly, I’m seriously happy with Xenonauts despite my gripes with the combat aspect, I want more and always have and will and the game here is very well crafted with great visuals, music and atmosphere. Thankfully there is a great modding community who may add all that I could think of in a Xenonauts game, but, in the future, I wish for the game to be successful and for more to be added on by the creators. TL/DL; Xenonauts is a great spiritual sequel of the X-Com series. If you like those games remotely, you’ll love this one. It’s heavy with atmosphere, mostly great combat, the thrill of progress and the feeling you get when you nail a tough mission with flying colors.-Thumbs up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												If you ever wanted to play the original X-COM from 1994 without the terrible graphics or terrible UI Xenonauts is as close as it gets. This game is deeply rooted in old school style, which in turn is a good and a bad thing.It’s one of those games were you’re going to struggle a lot your first time through if you are unfamiliar with the game and its mechanics. It’s a very entertaining game but also quite frustrating and vague at times. Unlike the XCOM reboots (which are fantastic by the way) this game has far greater complexity and player freedom. The game is incredibly in depth in a great way, it’s just unfortunate it’s very poorly explained. There’s so much here that isn’t in the XCOM reboots (Or the originals). The research tree and the technology you can create are vast as well.I really loved the setting and art style myself. Set in 1979 during the height of the cold war, the setting really grounds the game.  All the technology and buildings feel realistic in their world. Even the aliens and UFO’s themselves have a very realistic feel to them. While some may not like the 2D style of the game the sprites and maps are clean and well done.  I also appreciate the increased focus on intercepting, assaulting, and salvaging of UFO’s (which is the whole point of the game and the original X-COM) compared to the XCOM reboots.  Which in those games it only happened once in a while.Regardless the game is far from perfect. As stated above the game is incredibly complex but really poorly explained. However there is a manual, which does cover some things. That and the occasional cheapness of the AI which can shoot you from half across the map at a million different directions. What’s worse is the bug that allows them to shoot through walls. The game also has some pacing issues as it can feel way too chaotic at times. Finally the RNG is just too much, seriously if you thought XCOM’s RNG had some issues you haven’t played Xenonauts. Overall good game, just not for everyone:  8/10  "

												So, like a lot of people I was first interested in this when the kickstarter was announced - an XCOM remake in all but name? Take my money sir! And then Firaxis came along, announced their ""reimagining"" and release a truly brillian game in it's own right. It was X-COM, not quite XCOM but an excellent game. In the meantime Goldhawk (a little frustratingly at times) slowly got on with finishing their game and now it's been released.So is it any good? This is the closest you are going to get to replaying XCOM again. OK so they can't use the same names or anything, they've set it in the 1970s (which, by the way was a minor stroke of genius) but works. It works sooo well. If you played and loved XCOM, then you can pick this up without even having to refer to an instruction manual. It does play a little differently yes  - the beefed up air combat being the main difference, something which I haven't really come to grips with so I'm heavily reliant on the ""auto-resolve"" button - but they flavour text accompanying the game is genuinely funny in places and very well written.It lacks some of the creeping dread of XCOM on some of the missions (their Cryssalid replacement for example bears a remarkable resembalance to the Warhammer 40K Tyranid lictor) and suffers for it for some reason, and some of the models are maybe a little lacking. However the UFO design is excellent, and clearing them out a real tactical workout on occasion. I've not ""finished"" it yet, but all I can say a couple of hours of playing this over development and now release is that it's pretty damned good. If you tried the Firaxis version and it didn't click for you, then believe me this will.  Well worth the purchase price for any XCOM fan.			"

Early Access Review
								After the grand disapointment that Firaxis delivered in the form of X-com: Enemy Unknown and the slightly better game that came afterwards. I was looking for a game that had more focus on the strategy, the base building, on the various aspects of running a company that is the sole defence against aliens.Xenonauts delivers, and though it was rather buggy in various of the alpha stages, the game has matured and become an all round great game to play.You've got base management to focus on, every structure you build having a goal and purpose.There's research and development going on, getting your troops better armor and weapons, or upgrading the weapons on your aircraft, researching and manufacturing newer ships to fight the aliens with.Every soldier has a large variety of stats that upgrade and increase the more missions you play with the, and that progression really makes a difference, making every soldier a more and more valuable asset, making losing them that much more bitter when it does happen.But that's fun, because unlike Firaxis's itterations of the game, where you were always pushed into certain behaviors to be the most efficient. Xenonauts offers you a lot more flexibility right from the start.You have the whole world to defend, you can start wherever you want with your base and develop your team towards your ideal. Various types of grenades and a whole list of weapon types give you complete control over the battlefield, over what you want your soldiers to do and how you want them to evolve.The game isn't easy though, because like the older generation it's based on, things can simply go wrong, an alien enemy with poor eye sight might still one of your own men by chance, and the results could be deadly! Good tactics help you out though, good preparation and positioning allowing you to jump enemies before they can possibly respond to your actions.This is a fantastic game, especially if you loved the older games. The strategy, the management, the ufopedia, it's all very well put together, giving you a great time all around.			"

												If you like the original XCOM, this is a very good game.  Very similar, with some enhancements to the UI and all.Set in the early Cold War, it fits pretty well in that setting.Most of my complaints would be nitpicky and minor.  The art and graphics are kinda bland, but do fit the 60s theme fairly well.  The invasion does seem to ramp up pretty quickly (though it might be pegged to research?), and keeping up the income and trying to expand bases is something I find difficult.Things like aircraft armaments and grenades upgrading automatically, not having to manufacture ammunition and grenades, those are helpful updates to not get bogged down in as much minor micromanagement.Now that it's open for modding, there's getting to be some good options to enhance.  The latest patch was helpful too.If you like the tactical turn-based combat, it's definitely a good game to play.			"

												Best tacticts since Jagged Alliance 2Plus everything we loved about UFO1 and more, way more.Graphics take time to get used to though.The setting - lore, xenopedia articles, research reports - create an immersive atmosphere, even more immersive than that of recent X-Com(2012)Best thing I like is honest Alien AI - they will send interceptor patrols after you shoot down a few ships, they will counter-attack as you surround their ship in tactics mode, they don't hesitate to use grenades. Shot trajectories are in gun combat - bullets will hit obstacles and units on their way.All in all - the first game in ~7 years (since GalCiv2) that made me suddenly realize it's dawn already and I haven't slept yet.

												It's hard. It's punishing. And I love it!Xenonauts is a game where you can actually feel the domination of an alien force, invading earth. You'll find yourself in a dire situation, heavily outgunned against a technologically superior race - a situation which is well known in common SciFi movies. And you will suffer - a situation which is very unknown in common video games! You first encounters will likely end with heavy losses, half of your crew dead or critically wounded. But with time you struggle your way up the food-chain, gaining the upper hand and deliver payback! I recommend to play it on Iron Man Mode! If it feels too hard, try an easier level, but leave the Iron Man Mode activated. Yes, it is painfull to lose a good soldier because of a stupid mistake on the battlefield. Very painfull. But it's realistic and the fear for losses creates a strong bond to all your crew members! The ""Save & Reload"" tactic will destroy a good part of your game experience with Xenonauts.			"

												I lost my whole squad. It all started with a single reaper, this reaper snuck through my lines undetected, and like a whisper in the wind, snuck up on my #1 guy. This new reaper, then managed to matrix all of my bullets my men had, then infected another soldier. At this moment, my entire squad went into a frenzy of panic shots and fleeing, one my one my men either killed each other or ran right into another reaper. Soon, all I had was my last guy. I sent this last man sprinting to the chopper so I could get him the hell out of there, and when he got there...........A reaper was waiting for him.10/10 would lose my whole squad again.			"

								Xenonauts is a refreshing throwback to XCOM's classic glory days. One could say that this is a more truthful-to-the-source remake of the XCOM franchise than any of the new games. Xenonauts features a deep and intimidating tactical combat system, one which will be familiar to anyone who has played almost any TBS game or XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, but with such a larger difficulty curve that you will at times be left feeling hollow, alone and abused as your squad of soldiers gets minced like tender beef in a meat grinder. The game makes a respectful nod in the direction of the original XCOM games, in that it is virtually impossible not to suffer casualties at some point in your game. Where as the recent titles even had achievements encouraging you to try completing a campaign without anyone dying, or having a lone soldier complete a mission, in Xenonauts both these tasks are virtually impossible.The reasons behind the difference in diffuclty doesn't come from a more advanced or biased AI, but simply more input that players have to manage. Not only on the ground with your soldiers, but also back at base and infact globally. Your soldiers inventories have to be carefully managed, ensuring they have enough weapons and ammunition to last their contact with the aliens, but also not overloading them to the point that they suffer TU (Time Units, the equivalent of Action Points) penalties that cripple them and make it difficult for your men and women to gun the enemy down then make a hasted retreat to cover. On mention of cover, more things are destrucable on Xenonauts too. Where as in XCOM: EU/W there were some indestructable cover options that would at worst explode, but still offer protection, in Xenonauts pretty much anything that can be used as practical cover can also be turned into dust. So often, it becomes the case that you don't just want a wall between you and the aliens, but several and a yew yards of empty space from the walls too so you don't get caught in any collateral damage.Moving onto perhaps the more important part of the game (at least in terms of your chance of success in the campaign to save Earth), the Geoscape. You're given access to a global map and allowed to place your bases (Yes, plural. You can have, nay, WILL NEED, multiple bases at some point in your game) anywhere you like in the world. Whether you want to set up your alpha base in New York state, the Guangzhou province of China or perhaps just outside of Zimbawe, you're given some pretty hefty freedom on this matter. Though you also need to consider something else when placing bases. Their radar range. Since you're not fed mission options on a timed basis like in XCOM EU/W, you need to ensure that your base is in a decent position where not only will your base be able to detect incoming alien vessels, but also that there's a landmass large enough to make sure you can then follow up and board any crashed ships to kill surviving aliens and salvage their equipment. Poor base placement early on can lead to a starved economy, as you're largely funded by your actuall progress rather than on whether you chose one country over another in mission options.Additional to the base placement in the Geoscape is the base's design itself. You choose how the facility will be constructed, what building will go where. And this will be reflected later in game when the alien menace starts to invade your base. So rather than just filling every single space you can with facilities, you may want to build so that the aliens have few channels to transport through your base. Maybe even forcing them to bottle neck one way in, since they always break in via your hangars.Mention of hangars brings up another very important aspect of the game. Managing your aerospace force. Especially later on in the game, you'll find yourself getting swamped with radar readings for multiple UFO sightings. And since your fighters aren't equipped with an unlimited supply of fuel or ammunition, their ability to engage targets is quite limited. So you'll want to ensure you've enough hangars and jets filling them to confront any aerial menace that pops up within radar range. Without this ability to combat UFO's, you'll quickly run out of funding and let the planet fall into a state of panic.To sumarise what I'm trying to convey here, Xenonauts is XCOM for big boys. It's challenging, frustrating but overwhelmingly satisfying when you get a moment where you feel like you're doing well. Even if those moments are short lived, as the aliens will likely knock you back down a peg in the next terror mission filled with Reapers.			"

												I was involved -- for certain definitions of the word ""involved"" -- in the beta/early access phases of Xenonauts over the course of several months, maybe even a year or so.During that time, the developer consistently showed little to zero willingness to consider alternate ideas of game design, overreacted when balance changes were needed, forced certain game tactics onto the players, and had a very scatterbrained approach to overall game philosophy. And, they committed the absolute worst crime a developer can commit during a paid early access/beta period: They refused to listen to bug reports on several occasions if the bug didn't repro in the dev build. At one point I had to spend over an hour painstakingly summing alien TUs and making a YouTube video just to prove a bug existed, despite it being reported by a half-dozen different people, most of whom encountered it on their very first mission in a new game.In terms of the game design: At early stages, your troops will be shot and killed. On your turn. The AI is highly defensive and usually spends under 1/3 of their own AP during their turn unless humans are visible. If no humans are immediately visible, the AI will not hunt for them, they will take defensive positions and wait. The reaction fire system is poorly coded, being based on what % of a characters' TUs are remaining: If an alien is sitting around the corner with 100% of their TUs (and this happens a lot), as soon as a soldier turns the corner they will almost certainly get shot at. Usually two or three times. With weapons that have a very high chance to instakill a human.As humans design new and better weapons, such as laser or plasma replacing standard ballistics, you do more damage but have smaller clips. That's it. There are no other changes from one tier to another, despite developer promises that more interesting design would be implemented later in the process. There are a ton of forum posts where players debated back and forth how the various tiers ought to be balanced against each other, with each tier shining in certain regions and maybe being lackluster in others. For example, I was a proponent that plasma weaponry ought to do massive damage but have ammo and range drawbacks, while lasers have voluminous ammo stores and long range but only moderate firepower. Attack TU costs are based entirely on percentage of total TUs, meaning those soldiers who can move faster can't actually fight any more effectively, they are just more mobile. This was a late change in the development process, being added with only a few months to spare. When I tried it and disliked it, I was insulted by the community as well as the developer, being told that he ""wouldn't go over the reasons [for switching to a percent TU system] again."" The entire ground combat design (about 60% of the game) is tilted in favor of the AI. Elements like % TU costs for firing and reaction fire require constant calculations and re-calculation to know whether or not a given troop can, say, reach cover and fire a shot. There is no simple mechanism in-game to simplify this for the player. In the end, I don't recommend this game, unless you have a particular desire to fill a pad of paper with calculations, spending your time reading the xml files to figure out how things actually work, and getting your people shot.If you really, REALLY want to re-play the original X-COM... just go and replay X-COM. Get DOSBox running on your computer and replay the classic. Xenonauts is a game that wants to be X-COM but fails to either properly modernize it or recreate it.			"

												I could write how this game is, in its essence, a faithful yet innovative recreation of Gollop brothers' original X-COM. I could say that it captures the feeling and addictiveness of its precursor, building upon its concepts, expanding or modernizing them, while still staying faithful to the original. I could list the elements present in it, like base administration, research and production, UFO activity management, interceptions and, of course, the meat of the matter – ground missions; and then go on praising how well, for the most part, they were executed. Rather that all that, I'm just going to say that Xenonauts passed the most important test, by which I judge games based on other titles – that is, while playing it, not for a moment I found myself wanting to go back the old game instead.EDIT : Nominated for ""Just 5 More Minutes"" 2016 Steam Award... and well dervered too!

												It is fun and challenging but too prone to total party wipes.  This is your father's X-Com.First playthrough was Save Scum city to 'learn' the game.  Second playthrough on Ironman is going not too badly, but keep losing tons of soldiers and equipment, setting me back months and months. Needs.1) Active defense vs Psionic powers or severe range penalties to said powers.2) Had to consult wiki too much, more ingame resources needed.3) Advanced drop ships need defense vs interceptors.4) Less enemy rocket launchers, who would guard their own base with mostly these?5) The lizard aliens with the crazy regen should charge more instead of trying to ambush all the time.6) Needs a chance to run and heal someone that fell between 0 and -10 hp, putting them out of the mission of course.

Recommended: A faithful spiritual successor to the original X-Com: UFO Defense game that adds some strong additional mechanics that add to the game, but misses out on some of the quality-of-life things from that predecessor and has a some jankiness in places, particularly the UI.

												If you are a fan of the original X-Com games and if you liked the turn-based gameplay, this is for you! Xenonauts captures perfectly the feeling of the original. It is a perfect remake with nice oldschool graphics and even some new features like aircombat. For me, as I very much liked playing the Firaxis remake, this game adds the depth I was missing. All the micromanagement, the base building, managing of aircrafts, soldiers, science and so on. This is fun and I can absolutely recommend this game. It still has some bugs though, but not as much and not as severe as many games from big developer studios are released with (e.g. ""day one patches""). This is money well spent, and I surely will play this game again and again. The X-Com addiction is back.			"

												Turn-based strategy is one of my favorite genres, I grew up on stuff like Fire Emblem and Advance Wars.Xenonauts is much more hardcore and simulator-esque than those games are, but it does so in a way that's extremely rewarding and fun. All the little decisions you can make (like those regarding the minutia of each unit's equipment) genuinely mean something and impact the game, I never once felt like the detailed interface or combat systems held me back, rather they allowed me more tactical freedom and room to be clever.If you want to play super aggro with flashbangs and aggressive shotgun units, you can. If you want to play super careful with extreme range snipers, shielded scouts and rocketeers to demolish cover, you can. The more you put your mind to it the more you'll discover little tricks and strategies of your own. Even the simplistic dogfighting minigame provides room for tricky flanking maneuvers and thoughtful use of ammunition.(PS: Do yourself a favor and don't savescum. Fear, suspense, and tragedy are crucial to the experience!)			"

												OMG, this game is good, oh man do I love the atmos. If game design had 'limits' this would be a perfecly positive example of it, or rather; how-to cos, you know; its 'minimalist' feel.Make no mistake, dear cynic this game is one of those 'bordreline' simulation type of ordeals, where the gameplay makes deep emotional sways and moves the player in similar fashion. Where 'graphics' are not-so-important for the immersion is greater, and your choices you must think through.......not 'just' see-through ;)On that note, this game really reminds me of the Isometric Swat4 I don't know how they do it, make games like these but do it they good and more often it should.... Hope we get to see more Isometric games in the future, as gamers....Have Fun :D Strangers in the dark.			"

								A turn-based strategy game that mimics the original XCOM games that started the genre in the mid-90s, Xenonauts is one of the better indie games currently in development. You start with a ragtag group of soldiers with the best technology humankind has to offer, which isn't much. Aliens invade with their own weapons in great force, striking against ships and towns, and it's up to you to shoot down their UFOs, aqcuire their technology, and use it against them before they turn human forces against you. Much like the originals, you never really have the upper-hand. As the game progresses and you learn the secrets of alien technology, the invasion ramps in difficulty with larger UFOs and more intelligent aliens armed with even stronger weaponry.  You must rely on your own planning and a bit of luck to pull through. The game can be brutally difficult and is not ideal for people new to turn-based strategy.For gameplay footage of v19 Beta:

												OK. I have seriously mixed feelings here.I am one of those folks who spent hundreds and hundreds of hours Playing the original XCOM. I played it on Playstation, even with all the crappy control bugs it had, including the awesomeness of having your soldiers run right out into the middle of an empty area with aliens all around when you tried to end a turn.And I loved every controller-throwing moment of it. It was and forever will be my favorite game of all time.This game is essentially an XCOM: UFO Defense clone. Same technologies (laser weapons, plasma weapons, interceptors, avalanche missiles, etc.). It's almost like the XCOM universe equivalent of Spaceballs, only instead of the Force and the Schwartz, you've got Sectiods and Caesans, Elerium and Alenium, alien alloys and...alien alloys.It's virtually THE SAME GAME.Depending on who you are, that's either a really, really good thing or a bad thing. This title brings back things that made the old game feel more tactical than the 2K version like time units, rotating soldiers to look different directions, and multiple bases. It feels much more like the old Microprose game than the 2K reboots. There are some new elements like scrambling squadrons of interceptors rather than individual planes, a tactical air combat battle system that didn't exist in the original, doors on the sides of the Skyranger (oops, I mean dropship), which is nice so you don't have to knowingly unload all your operatives out the back into certain death in certain situations.It's definitely fun and nostalgic.I picked it up on sale so I'm more or less content, but in all honesty I was hoping for more originality and less blatant copying of the original format.If you pine for the days of the original XCOM and The Long War mod for the 2K version didn't tweak the AAA reboot enough, I recommend this game and give the devs props for their faithful recreation (and slight enhancements). If you're looking for a title that's breaking new ground, I would look elsewhere.			"

If you've played XCom: UFO Defense/UFO: Enemy Unknown, Jagged Alliance 2, Breach and Clear, Silent Storm, or the new Xcom, and enjoyed it- you'll like Xenonauts.Every update adds not only features I'm used to, but new features that streamline and improve the experience.At the time of this writing, I'd say that the game is probably a year off being pretty much complete, but the current level of development is impressive. I'm looking forward to the final product, and have absolute belief that it's going to be one of the deepest and most compelling games on the market.EDIT: Final product review, 07.OCT.14.Xenonauts has turned out to be everything I'd hoped for. This is the true spiritual successor to Julian Gollop's genre-defining UFO: Enemy Unknown (AKA XCOM: UFO defense). There were only two games that ever perfectly demonstrated the potential of the turn-based tactical genre- Jagged Alliance 2 and UFO: Enemy Unknown. These two pillars of the genre are now joined by Xenonauts.The grand strategy? It's there. The micromanagement? It's there. The research and development? It's there. The tactical challenges of storming a crashed UFO full of very hacked-off aliens with plasma weapons? Oh, yeah, it's there.  If you're a 'thinking' gamer rather than a twitching gamer, this is a game that lets you sink into the role of planetary defence coordinator. Hours can slip by as you arrange UFO interceptions, juggle base creation against reserach and development, and weigh up airstrikes on a crashed UFO against sending in recovery teams.I cannot recommend this game highly enough to the grognard-type gamer who wants a deep gaming experience without interface complications. I honestly place Xenonauts in my top ten games of all time- and I've been playing computer games for thirty-five years. Bravo, Goldhawk. Bravo. Here's hoping you make enough money from Xenonauts to buy the rights to the Jagged Allliance IP and treat it better than the last mob of semi-competents. The last feedback I can give is to comment that it's a little jarring to have female special forces soldiers in a game set in the 70's/80's, but I'll take a little Sarkeesian-mollifying Social Justice Warrior history revisionism if it means I get to play a game this good.

												I'm a bit bummed about this game. I had lots of friends recommend it to me due to my love of 2012 XCOM, and even more recommend it to me after I got around to playing and beating the original UFO and TFTD. I had high hopes going in, really expecting to love this game. Unfortunately... I didn't. I haven't even finished it yet, and I don't think I even will. I've hit a wall, not due to difficulty or too many countries dropping out, but instead my own lack of enthusiasm to keep going. With the original games, the game was slowly ramping up as you made more progress and got better equipment. In 2012, it was somewhat the same, however you would reach a point where you could really stomp out the threat. I like both of these models, X-COM faces you with an always increasing danger even as you make progress, and XCOM gives you the chance to overpower your oppenent entirely.Xenonauts really has neither of these. I feel no more capable of fighting the threat with the best armor and weapons available than I do with the starting equipment, and I'm still facing the same aliens. It feels like there is huge lack of variety with the aliens, as it seems all of them were introduced before I even got the second weapon type. Even with the best armor and weapons, it still takes multiple shots to kill a single alien, while they can still kill you in one hit. The difficulty just feels completely static, the only things I actually feel are changing in difficulty are the interceptor encounters.This game really improves a lot on the original X-COM, but it just lacks the charm. I just don't feel excited to see what comes next, because so far everything that has come next has been basically the same. If you liked the original X-COM, you'll probably like this, but it's just not as charming. I'm disappointed.			"

												Soo, Xenonauts are out. And they are damn awesome.Wanted that old school X-com like game, but with fresh graphics, mods and enhancements?Didn't get that from new XCOM series? Want multiple bases? Interceptors? Inventories for soldiers? Well, Xenonauts got you covered. This game is better at being X-com than anything else new out there.More details in the video:

Closely resembles the original UFO: Defense, but with new graphics style, verbage, and its own unique aliens.Still has a few annoying bugs and things that never got polished, but playable.Recommended for fans of turn-based squad tactics games.

												A fantastic X-Com style strategy game, the basics are the same but there are enough changes to keep it fresh and interesting, i.e. combat is more streamlined, adds more action to arial combat, differences in the tech tree. Highly recommended, lots of replay value. It needs more variation in maps and a few more weapons and armor.			"

												Did you like the origenal x-com games?  Then you should give Xenonauts a try!  It has all the features that made the origenal such a huge hit, plus quite a few of those little extras you secretly wished was in x-com.  Can't be bothered to recover the small ufo closer to end game?  Airstrike!!  Wished that for once the damned cops would at least try to shoot at the alien hordes?  Well, lets just say the natives of earth can sometimes be mighty hostile!  Those are just a few of the many small little enhancements to the game!  This game is a must have!			"

												If you ever enjoyed Xcom, the strategy ones, you will enjoy this game. It seems like a more up to date xcom classic with features that are more in-depth than Xcom: Enemy Unkown. I have spent up to ten minutes thinking out just one move in the turn based combat system. You will have to weigh options as you build your base and research new technologies to combat the alien threat better. This can be done in many ways as you shoot down UFOs and have to decide wether or not you should go to the crash site or airstrike it to just gain money. Overall you will have to face choices that can make or break your game. If you enjoy xcom then you will enjoy this game.			"

												I had doubts about whether I would be able to enjoy this after playing Firaxis's XCOM, but boy was I wrong. If you've enjoyed the challenge the original Julian Gollop's X-COM provided, Xenonauts is going to delight your socks off.The dev team behind it have come a long way and have learnt quite a few lessons from other X-COM spiritual successors released before it. This shows as a much more fine tuned balance between being able to micromanage while still feeling like the overall commander-in-charge of your organisation. The oppressive feeling of a world unsure of your ability to deliver its salvation adds to the atmosphere of urgency, uncertainty, dread and hope all at once. Planetary Defence Simulator indeed.Highly recommended!			"

												Alot of people love this game because they didn't like xcom 2012 remake and prefered the original. Well I loved xcom 2012, It was my first xcom I didn't play the originals. So if my opinion as a non xcom hipster is revelant to you, read on.To me xcom 2012 and xenonauts are two opposite approaches to a xcom remake.  Which means we have 2 very different games which are great in thier own right. In my mind both have strengths and weaknesses when compared. And if you are a big fan of this tiny genre, then both are worth sinking hours into.The most immediate difference presentation and feel, both games evoke the original in different ways. xenonauts keeps the old school full 2d enviroments and sprites, but opts for more realistic and modern art design. While xcom 2012 goes full 3d modern high quality models and enviroments, and yet its art style is actually more reminiscant of the original, cartoony and a bit daft.To me neither is superior. I prefer fully 3d presentation and destruction of xcom 2012, but prefer the more realistic and grounded art style which is more fitting to a serious game; I prefer xenonaut's chinook and m16s than the kitch skyranger and haircuts of xcom.Xenonauts ground combat is much more similiar to the original, and it frankly just feels very aged and not as tight or fluid as xcom 2012. Having a much bigger squad means generally less need to employ tactics, as each individual is less important. The fire/cover/hunker system in xcom 2012 is genious, xenonauts doesn't require nearly as much decision making on the ground.  You mostly just line up all your guys and fire away, often relying on numbers rather than cover or flanking. One thing xenonaut's ground combat has is that enemies are spawned from the very start, which is miles better than xcom 2012 hugely flawed spawn on LoS system. Overall I have to give ground combat to xcom 2012, but it depends on your own preferences.The place where xenoanuts really shines and becomes WAY superior to xcom 2012 is the geoscape. That is base building/management aswell as air battles. There is simply tons more depth and freedom and is the reason to buy the game. Once you play it makes xcom 2012's geoscape seem totally meaningless.You can directly contoll air battles, your bases will be attacked and you get ground battles to defend them, you can build multiple bases. There is tons of decision making that xcom 2012 lacks, and it's a core part of the game not just a afterthought.So it depends if you want a in depth planetary defense sim, buy xenonauts. If you have no interest in geoscape and only like turn based tactical combat, then stick to xcom 2012 or something else.			"

 As of writing this, Goldhawk Interactive (devs) are in the making of a sequel. I say this to raise awareness if you find yourself buying this game and enjoying it, as they've taken huge steps in listening to and incorporating feedback from the community. -----------------------------------------------------First off, it's inevitable that XCOM will be mentioned at some point, so lets start there. Yes, you're likely to enjoy this if you enjoyed the original XCOM games. Xenonauts began as a passion project on Kickstarter for those wanting to relive the original XCOM experience. It stays mostly true to XCOM without replicating it, even expanding on originally lacking features like interceptor combat, which is now much more involved.Some elements of this game work in real-time (aerial combat, although you can pause), but the majority of your time (~85%) will be spent in grounded, turn-based missions. I should mention that both ground and aerial combat missions are skip-able, but of course you'll miss out on a lot of resources if you decide to pass on them. There  are  workshop (cheat) mods out there that allow you to essentially skip areas of gameplay you might not enjoy, so if you find yourself wanting to focus on the ground-based missions for example and ignore the Geoscape, you can pretty much do that. About aerial combat: it is, in my opinion, not that great. It's not particularly bad, but it doesn't feel fleshed out beyond the dodge and missile mechanics. I tend to think of it more like an optional mini-game that gives you a break from other points of strategy every now and then. On a normal run I found myself skipping most aerial combat scenarios with little to no penalty for doing so, and apparently that's fine. Although I didn't enjoy it personally, I'm glad I was given the option to skip as it seems a more experimental point of gameplay compared to everything else. Ground combat is brilliant, and most things in the Geoscape are brilliant. You'll need patience and time to plan out your approach to the alien invasion, particularly since this game is a multifaceted strategy. By the end, you'll probably be managing several bases and many troops/employers/vehicles at the same time. For those reasons, this might be a game you need to stick to before moving on, and certainly not play if you're an amnesiac. That would leave you with an overwhelming amount of management to do and no memory on how to do it. Also, if you like your micro/macro organisation, you'll fall in love with this. In the micro sense for example, each soldier can be personalized by name and load-out (there's a pretty huge arsenal if you research weapons), with class-specific types you can set as defaults. One thing that's lacking which affects both ground combat and the Geoscape, is vehicles. Only one vehicle variant exists in this game and it requires a hefty amount of resources to get up and running. But... is it worth it? No. Even when you acquire it, you sacrifice two soldiers in exchange for having it on the ground. Unfortunately it isn't even worth two soldiers. In short, vehicles are pretty underdeveloped in this game and almost not worth bothering about. You can upgrade it into pure bad-assery way later on, but the climb to get there isn't economically efficient. Another flaw: monsters and civilians sometimes have stupid AI. Aliens tend to be at their deadliest when they're throwing grenades at you non-stop and the AI still has issues with pathing and awareness, as it tends to know where you are half the time without a good reason as to why. I was able to ignore these issues as the experience was mostly fluid.Oh, as a side note; pretty much everything in ground combat is destructible. My lord, the writing. It is monstrously good, and might honestly be the best experience with reading I've ever had in a game ever. And normally I  hate  taking time to read in games. Hell, Xenonauts even comes with it's own novella, yes, a freaking  novella  hidden away in the extra features. Now, I don't think it compares to the in-game text you get for completing research projects, but it's still kind of impressive that they actually hired an author to do it. One of the major things keeping me coming back to this game was the thought of completing a research project and being handed a bit more information of the alien invasion. SO, I recommend this game. It's worth the price, but most of all it's a lot of fun. A lot of issues posted in top reviews have been fixed/have fixes for download or are already within the game but need to be enabled. I suggest that upon starting the game you click the mod manager and enable the mod already downloaded which adds a ton of map variety. I'll close out saying Xenonauts has a lot of really awesome mods in the Steam workshop section, so at the very least give it a glance over before or after playing for your first time. The community is regularly patching this with updates even after the devs recently stopped, so there's also a community build if you switch over to beta.			"

												Love it! I played the original X-COM game may years ago, for hours on end. This is as close to the original X-COM, with modernised graphics and ideas, as I have seen to date. Growing up in Namibia, where at that time internet virtually did not exist, I figured out how to hack the save game files of the original  X-COM with notepad and converting HEX by hand, which allowed me to create a game experience I wanted.Being able to also hack Xenonauts and add all kinds of mods is for me a bonus, as I play for fun, and being able to change the game how I want makes it more fun.

												By the time of this review I have played around 40 hours/TLDR: BUY THIS GAME! The game opens with a world map and the ability to place a single base which will give you radar coverage and a few planes. From there your job is to build many bases and cover the landmasses of earth with air protection while sending out your ground teams to clear out alien crashsites and defend cities. It is incredibly deep, from the customization of each soldier which ranks up over time; to the building and upgrading of bases which have much more than just hangars for your different planes. This game also has a much richer gameplay than its more ''AAA'' counterpart XCOM albeit it does have much simpler graphics. Really the only two things that could disuade you from buying it are the retro graphics and the isometric view of the maps. P.S: This game has a huge amount of mod support and a growing mod scene with at least 5 complete mods that change completly the way the game is played and about a 100 smaller mods. It is growing everyday.			"

												Less flashy than XCOM but with all the right stuff - I actually prefer it to XCOM, and that's saying a lot. It has all the best parts like the planning, base building, turn based tactics and air combat elements but the best thing for me is the overall feel of the game, its a good take on the alien invasion scenario with enough identity that makes it feel like more than an XCOM clone (like the setting in 1979; seeing the world divided up as Soviet Union, Indochina etc along with troop backstories showing combat experience in Vietnam/Afghanistan and the awesome music makes the game much more immersive). Basically it feels to me like Men In Black 3, MGS3: Snake Eater and XCOM had a love child.I *would* however reccomend watching a couple letsplay videos on youtube if you arent used to XCOM/turn based squad shooters, as a bad first impression can ruin any decent game. That being said the game is more than fair, one of the reasons I prefer it to XCOM is that strategy actually works, as opposed to experiencing ""that's XCOM, baby"" when the RNG decides to f*ck with you. Repeatedly.Tl;dr - a cold war version of XCOM that doesnt need to be flashy to be awesome.			"

												If you're looking for a newer version of the widely renowned original XCOM: UFO Defense, you've come to the right spot! If you've never heard of XCOM, think the original was released in 2012, or came looking for a new strategy game that keeps you on your toes, you've come to the right spot as well! This game successfully meshes turn-based squad combat with a reaserch / funding / air combat strategy layer to keep you thinking about everything you do. I'd heartily reccommend this to anybody with an eye for such games, although be warned, the game is no A to B cakewalk... 9 / 10 I think it's worth $30 personally, but if you're on a tight budget, grab this if it ever goes on sale for $20 or less.I'll assume your read the game description, so I'll spare you the back story and get right down to the gameplay. In the geoscape (the world map view), players control bases and their facilities:  equipping soldiers, researching, manufacturing, managing planes, and managing resources. From here, the goal is mainly to send dropships to crashed / landed ufos or alien bases in order to slow the invasion. The air combat is nice, but not too deep, and is usually resolved based on the tech you have unlocked more than skill (although there are already fancy mods to make this more skill based). These dogfights can be autoresolved if they aren't your bag of tea. The difficulty chosen affects the rate at which the invasion progresses on the geoscape. Although certainly a nice way to progress the game, the geoscape isn't where you spend most of your time.That place would be the battlescape (the turnbased squad combat). This section of the game is incredible. Each unit is given time units to spend on its turn that let it act (all actions require different amounts of TUs) and the remainder of those are used to react to the aliens on their turn. Combat is highly tactical, and the differences in difficulty are most noticed here. The AI is extremely intelligent. The enemy is stronger and heartier than your troops, not to mention extremely intelligent. As the invasion progresses, so will their tech, alien / ufos composition, and numbers. Once killed, soldiers are gone forever, and this gives each firefight a nervous tension (The ironman mode continuously saves your actions to improve this feeling if you enjoy it). Never before has a game made me think so thuroughly during a turn as Xenonauts because of this.The downsides? It's an indie game, so it's not to fancy visually. That said, it still has some incredibly detailed and hand painted sprites. At the time of writing, the game just got out of early access, and it still has one or two bugs two work out. On top of that, some oddities occur due simply to the engine constraints of the game. Beyond that, there really isn't anything to complain about, and my gameplays have been pretty smooth! The game is easily moddable by fiddling with the xml files (doable using notepad), and a nice handful of talented map makers have already begun adding maps to the game. The maps in this game are semi-random, so after multiple playthroughs, you will undoubtably see similar looking maps, and the ones the community makes keeps the game nice and fresh!I trust that if you were an XCOM fan, you'd already have bought this - if not, you should just stop reading and do that. So to all those who have never experienced the thrill of XCOM - the thrill of defending the Earth from an invasion of unknown magnitude and power with technology you prioritized, researched, and manufactured so you could give them to men and women you armed, commanded, and lost - this is a great place to start.

Early Access Review
								All right, first things first; I would say (largely) discount the negative reviews. (Apparently some folks still don't yet understand how the concept of 'Early Access' works.) That being said, if you're the kind of person who might agree with those people, I would wholeheartedly recommend waiting until after development is completed to pick up (or at the very least, play) your own copy of Xenonauts. Goldhawk has been releasing updates with fair regularity, the game has been getting better and more complete each time, and they are currently very close (I'd venture to guess somewhere around 90%, give or take 5% or so) to having the game ready for its final update.Is Xenonauts X-COM? No. (Of course, if you asked me if the most recent X-COM was X-COM, you'd get the same answer. I thought Firaxis did an interesting job with Enemy Unknown, it's just not the X-COM I grew up with.) Again, that being said, Xenonauts is the game that comes closest to emulating the feel of the original X-COM that I have ever seen. There have been many, many, MANY attempts at recapturing that brutal magic over the years; many have been interesting, some even enjoyable, but none that I felt were truly close. You can tell that this game was designed by people who clearly played the original game to death. Put the cosmetic differences aside, and it still *looks* like X-COM, and it *feels* like X-COM. In its raw, unmodified state, the game is difficult - I'd even be willing to say brutally so. (I personally went to the trouble of digging into the data files to give myself a bit of a New Game+, just so I wouldn't lose entire funding regions within the first hour of play. Oh yeah, btw - this game is moddable. The data files are somewhat dense, but with some time and effort, you can modify quite a bit.) The original UFO Defense experience of having troops plasma-blasted to death instantly upon leaving the transport can and does happen. Also included is that feeling of finally having a leg up on the initial alien opponents when you research better weapons and armor - only to have a whole new group of enemies show up and proceed to lay waste to your crack troops with the same level of ease. The UFOs will have an even bigger field day against your interceptors if you let them - they get progressively bigger and nastier and will seem to simply shrug off hits from even your biggest guns.The graphics, while not nearly as rendered and flashy as Enemy Unknown's, are still a huge leg-up from the original game's, and the interface is familiar without being clunky. The game's 1970's Cold War setting actually plays well with the alien invasion theme and helps many of the other design decisions and features to make sense as well. Almost everything that makes up the base of this game has been pulled almost directly from the concepts behind the original UFO Defense, from the basebuilding, tech, and tactical mechanics to the enemies and the weapons. Yes, the UFOs and interceptors look unique and different, there are more types of armor and weapons, and some of the aliens look different and have unique names - but Enemy Unknown did much the same thing, albeit to a lesser extent. Xenonauts really shines in the areas where it makes improvements on the base gameplay from the original game. Air combat in Xenonauts is how air combat in Enemy Unknown should have been - interactive and fully tactical. Just like in the ground combat missions, what happens to your aircraft is entirely on you - make a mistake, and your planes will be shot down, potentially leaving that region of the world defenseless against the next alien attack. Xenonauts also improves on the tactical missions by including local armed forces on the ground combat maps, a genuine cover system, and more transparency in exactly how your troops' physical skills improve at the end of each mission. This game is definitely worth picking up if you are a die-hard fan of old-school X-COM, or if you just like deep, challenging strategy games in general. Oh, and did I mention that you can mod it? Just imagine, an X-COM-like that you can customize to your own liking. Make it easier, make it harder, make it so you can sell alien corpses to museums - whatever you like. It can be done. Remember, with your help, Earth CAN survive the alien invasion! Now get out there and do your part, soldier!			"

Most important -- the  Xenonauts: Community Edition (X:CE) which is an improved version of the original game, including additional bugfixes and various new features that do not fundamentally alter the intended game experience (rather, they just make it play better).I also used:2.

Khall's Tundra TilesetThe game play is faithful to the original XCOM game.  Your primary concern overall is money.  You must keep nearly all of the countries satisfied and contributing funds or you will lose. Tips on how to keep them satisfied:1.  Destroy alien bases immediately as they are discovered.  2.  Stop terror attacks as soon as they start. 3.  Stop bombing attacks as soon as you can.4.  Shoot down as many UFO's as you can.Radar coverage of the map is key to all these.  I used only three bases, leaving only South America uncovered.  The loss of South America alone is not too damaging to your funds (I completed the game with almost $2 million in hand)  My bases:1.  North Africa.  First base, positioned (coords 4822/1707) so that three radar's coverage included all of the african continent, all of Europe including Great Britain, and extending to east into Indochina and the Soviet Union.2.  North America.  Positioned  (coords 1827/1358) on the North America/Central America border, with radar coverage extending from the artic icecap to cover all of Central America and all of North America with the exception of Alaska.3.  Indochina. Positioned  (coords 4574/1527).  Coverage of all of Indochina, central Soviet Union, and half of Australia.Base contents.North Africa.1.  3 Radars2.  4 Batteries3.  5 Hangers (4 fighters, one troop aircraft)4.  1 Hospital5.  2 Research labs6.  2 Workshops7.  2 Living Spaces8.  1 StoreroomNorth America1.  3 Radars2.  5 Batteries3.  6 Hangers (5 fighters)4.  1 Research lab5.  1 Living SpacesIndochina1.  3 Radars2.  5 Batteries3.  6 Hangers (5 fighters)5.  1 Living SpacesTo build new fighters you transfer one fighter from North Africa to one of the other bases, and then build the new fighter at North Africa.  5 batteries are sufficient to prevent aliens from succeeding in attacking and destroying your bases, so there is no need for soldiers in North America or Indochina.Major Spoilers for Air CombatYou will need to use manual combat for the air once the alien craft get dangerous because you can't afford to lose your aircraft.  Fortunately there is an easy way to do this.  When your fighters intercept the alien craft, always select one of the ""Follow"" options.  After a few seconds you can click on your fighters again, and this time select engage.  Your fighters will appear directly behind the enemy ship.  Turn on all after burners and wait until your craft launch their missles.  Immediately stop the battle and set your craft way points so the they fly behind the enemy craft.  Once they are clear, click on the X to get them to exit the map.Bombers are always escorted by two fighters.  Use two fighters to lure the alien fighters to the east and west.  Have your third fighter move to the tail of one of the alien fighters and shoot it down. Get the second fighter in the same way, then exit.  The bomber will now be an easy kill for another of your flights.Second flights are necessary not only because two are needed for bombers, but also because as the alien craft get bigger and stronger they can not be killed by the six missiles carried by one flight.   Only three fighters can be in one flight, but fortunately each base can put mulitiple flights into the air at once.  Simply click on the UFO and select intercept, and assign three planes to attack.  Then click on the UFO again, and you can assign a second flight to the same UFO.			"

												  Don't be fooled by the simple looking graphics from the screenshots: few games offer such a great deal of entertainment and deep gameplay as Xenonauts does. If you enjoyed UFO/X-Com as one of the best games of the 90's, then THIS is the remake you always dreamed of. If you didn't play UFO/X-Com, then what are you waiting for? :). None calling himself ""strategy gamer"" should miss it. The guys of Goldhawk Interactive have retained and enhanced the original deep gameplay and excellent progressive flow of game from the original, one of the best all-time game designs.Manage your squads of marines and learn to deal with unwanted casualties; intercept flying UFOS all over the world; research and craft captured technology from crashed or captured UFOs; defend cities and your own bases...A final recommendation: from the start activate the ""Community Edition"" version of the game (easy instructions found on the game launcher). It enhances the gameplay and fixes some minor glitches.And a tip: try to build at least 2 bases from the start ;)			"

												A great remake of the original X-Com.  Use strategy to defend Earth from invading alien ships by building bases, radars, aircraft, and weapons.  The success of your defense efforts determines how well your program is funded as the game progresses.  Research new technology to keep up with the increasing intensity of the invasion, and to understand the aliens' plans.  Secure landing/crash sites of alien ships using your Xenonaut team(s), which plays out in a turn-based tactical style.This game has a lot of deep strategy elements to it and is done in a cool retro art style.  Not graphically the greatest game ever, but it is well executed and has compelling gameplay.			"

												Please do not quit in anger and frustration! Been there, almost uninstalled and moved on. For many people (like myself, more casual gamers, modern XCOM fans, or people just looking to ENJOY a game in this genre), I must highly recommend starting on ""Easy"" difficulty. And on top of that, with mods such as ""Deluxe Geoscape Cheat Mod"", or simply increased funding of some sort. It's worth it. There are at least 50 hours worth of enjoyment to be had, including some fantastic artwork and brilliant writing (detailing everything from ET's to advanced technologies and weapons). Not too bad at all. Looking forward to XENONAUTS 2 soon enough, despite the psychological trauma (thanks Reapers). My rating for XENONAUTS (with mods): 8 out of 10.			"

												As a veteran of X-COM UFO Defense, Terror of the Deep, Apocolypse as well as the more recent remake XCOM Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within, I was very excited to play this.I just finished it on Normal difficulty and I have to say I'm disappointed.While its extremely faithful to the original (UFO Defense) and improves several things which I'll list in a bit, this iteration did not have the same charm as the original. While the finale was abrupt just like the original, it offered even less closure if thats possible. The gameplay was very similar to the original.PROs:-Riot Shields offered new options for troop deployment-Weapon diversification worked very nicely. In the original you could easily get by with everyone just using rifles.-Some UI improvements-Research flavor text was amusingCONs:-Manually controlling the interception portion of the game wasn't fun. I wound up auto-resolving all of them after some time.-Music was atmospheric like the original, but wasn't as good. Some parts were extremely noisy and hard on your ears. Yes its supposed to be unsettling but it was almost painful.-Time period: While an interesting idea I don't think it did enough with the concept. It was basically just a different art style.-Lack of psionic attacks A nice change of pace from the original...but not one I'd play again.What I wanted was just the same X-Com UFO Defense with a better interface, and this failed to meet my expectations.But if you enjoy UFO Defense, theres no reason you won't enjoy this. I'm just disappointed it didn't offer more.6/10			"

												If you're ok with running a whole agency and doing squad based missions this game is for you. If you dont want to manage a bunch of cash, buildings, personnel while inbetween, carefully attacking any alien ships you shoot down to loot them for technology. Then go for something a bit faster paced. This remake has a slower reward system more like the older xcoms than the new ones. As a fan of around 1000 hours of the original Xcoms on floppy disk and finishing my first game (and loss) of this new Xenonauts i can summarise a review of it as: Quite good.  Cons : Clunky UI at times, world map is not always smooth to navigate around.Isometric engine is a bit clunky and cant change angleMaps are not radomised!  unlike in the original (a tiny Xcom coding team accomplished that 20 years ago)Open Xcom (is free) and might be viable within a year (maybe?)Pros:Despite what the devs claim, this certainly is a clone of the original Xcom: UFO defence. And a good one,Music is spooky, the ambient sounds.. are spooky. Artwork, is awesome. The graphics look dated but the style is consistent and feels like you're running a secret agency during the cold war. streamlined features like not having to re-buy ammo for standard issue equipment after each mission you send your poor troops on. Overall:Great remake, makes you think and the game depth gives good immersion if you have the time. Interface is a bit clunky.			"

												Hey, remember X-COM: UFO Defense? Well, Xenonauts is like that. A lot like that, actually. If that sounds appealing, maybe you didn't care for Firaxis' modern interpretation of the series (I did, but eh, you can like what you like) or just want a well-made strategy game that is admittedly unambitious in its aims, then this is exactly what you want. That's not to say that Xenonauts doesn't tweak and modernize certain aspects of the 1994 original, but only in ways that make sense and throw a little more balance into the mix (i.e. no more broken mind control). If you've never played UFO Defense but want something a little more complex than Enemy Unknown, then this wouldn't be a bad place to start. Same brutal taste, but with a little more player freedom and ability to mess around.			"

												The true spiritual successor to the fabled original  UFO: Enemy Unknown from 1994While the recent 3D XCOM: Enemy Unknown by Firaxis was a decent game in itself and has some great ideas it was very limited (Or ""streamlined""), especially in terms of the strategic side of the game where things like base building and base missions were markedly absent (And the scripted one from Enemy Within doesn't count :p ).This game has it all, I cannot see a feature missing from the original game that is not implemented in this one. Think the 1994 version lovingly re-implemented with modern tech and a fun little UFO interception mini-game.There is also some great writing in the research reports etc. which give character to otherwise static screens.Downsides? The graphics are not great (But then you do not care about that do you?) and the tactical map selection can be limited. There is a solution to the second issue in that this game is moddable and there are already map-pack mods out there to increase selection.Im summary: The main thing is... I actually feel like the boss of an organisation dedicated to protecting humanity from the Aliens and making tough decisions rather than a spare tyre like in the recent remake.Massive thumbs up.

												BIAS NOTE: I personally think the Original X-Com / UFO is the best game ever made, so my opinion is slightly loaded.Xenonauts is an old school base management and turn based tactical strategy game based on the 1993 game X-Com: UFO defence / UFO: Enemy Unknown designed to savagely punish and bemuse the unwary, but inside many rewarding things can be found.If there has been one marker of the 2010s in games it has been nostalgia goggles. In the late 2000s the mid 20 to 40 something have been looking back on the games they grew up on and wonder why the IPs are being abused and how the content they grew up on now no longer exists. Weird reboots of series such as Syndicate and the announced X-Com sat badly with people and much yelling happened. Then Kickstarter happened, and... the less said about Kickstarter as a whole the better. Some results however were fantastic and Goldhawk Interactive's Xenonauts was a good example of a dev sticking to the original quite tightly.For old X-Com / UFO players Xenonauhts is a very faithful update to the original series containing the iconic tactical map, intercepting, base management and, of course, the turn based ground missions. The whole game will no doubt be extremely familiar to old X-Com vets and within a few minutes you will be back to reserving Time Units for snap shots and figuring out how to research those alien corpses.Xenonauts does make some small updates and the game is different in subtle ways, mainly in the context of balance, streamlining and user friendliness. Air combat is more interesting with areal dogfights being a bit more interactive, ground combat involves less clicking about and a number of fluffy items have been removed e.g. mind probes and while there are the clear super-powered weapons, there are no blaster launchers with an almost magical ""I win"" button effect. The interface and micromanagement has also been overhauled, for example ammo management, manufacture, purchase and scavenging is not as much of a stress as the original games, but at the same time the big money makers like selling the excess enemy weapons and corpses are done away with. Essentially you are not going to play database sim while trying to figure out what you have and have not researched.While the game has clearly been rebalanced around these new systems, it is still the same as the original in the context of how bloody minded and unforgiving it is. Unless you save-scum (which Ironman mode helps you resist) early missions are more than likely going to be bogged down with many, many dead soldiers. Even on easy mode this game is brutally unforgiving and will quite happily kill your commander with a reaper from behind.Reapers in this game are essentially Chryssalids. Yeah, they brought them back.A major turn off for many however will be the abstract nature of the game. Like the new reboot of Xcom Xenonauts also includes the diceroll random luck when you attack enemies. One second you will get a perfect crit damage shot from a human pistol miles from the target and take down a Andron in one hit, then you use the Mag carbine (basically the top end shotgun that fires railgun slugs) at point blank range and somehow miss with all the every pellet. While you can indeed be very tactical and be a military genius in reality, in game you will sometimes just come out unlucky as the guy with the LMG gets mind controlled sitting a few feet away from the remainder of your crew. Ultimately this is one of the strongest pulls the X-Com series always had so it would be rather unfaithful to remove it, but if you absolutely want a game of skill without any behind the scenes dice-rolling abstraction then this game is not advised at all.At the end of the day Xenonauts is either a love letter to the old fans, or if new a masochistic punch in the face. If you are looking for a turn based strategy game that will punish you, regardless of if you deserve it or not at times, then this one is a good pick.And yes they brought back Cryssalids. THEY BROUGHT BACK THE MOST FRIGGING EVIL MOSTER IN GAMING HISTORY! WHY GOD?! OH WHY?!?!?!?			"

								Это как окунуться в детство и снова играть в самую любимую игру, только кто–то заботливо учел все твои детские замечания и добавил в ремейк. Это как снова поверить в чудеса, увидеть то, что такое действительно случается - истина где-то рядом, победа над капитализмом, песнь о человечности и человечестве. Доработок невероятное количество, новых фич множество и я с трудом удерживаюсь о том, чтобы не рассказать вам о паре десятков эпизодов произошедших в игре, которые впечатались в память своей яркостью и неповторимостью. Рандомные евенты, воздушные битвы, в которых вы управляете сквадами истребителей. Отдельно необходимо отметить великолепный игровой дизайн. Игра года для меня уже сейчас.			"

												This guest review is used by permission of Elethio ""China"" Burton who is one of our few Stardrive approving members.  But that's Ok as diversity is the spice of life.  And regardless of that China and I agree that Xenonauts is a great game and the closest thing to the original XCOM: UFO DEFENCE  we've found.  We've both been playing that since it first came out.  Thanks for being generous in sharing this with us China.This review has a rare 100% approval rating by the way.Recommended66.3 hrs on recordFollows the Xcom1 very closelyYes! at last a game that does it right, a worthy succesor to the origional Xcom.Its at least as hard as Xcom1, maybe harderBe warned though, even if your an Xcom pro this game is tough, I'm good at Xcom player but after 4/5 failed attempts at this on ""veteran"" I had to start playing it on ""normal"".It has some differences, but you will be glad.Despite following the origional game closely, for most of its mechanics, Xenonauts does make some minor changes that improve thinngs, stores are less of a chore (many items like ammo and standard wepaons are free and infinite), intercepts are more important and more fun, funding is more important (the old exploits won't work here).Also you will generally have to develop new strategies to win.Obviously the story is different and the techs and the style, but they are all still enthralling and brilliantly done.Just buy this now.Honestly, I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this game... although the head scientist is so obnoxious you will want to punch him, but I think that's deliberate.

												Xenonauts started development before XCOM: Enemy Unknown was even announced to the public. It aimed to be a modern day remake of the original 'XCOM: UFO Defense', also know as 'UFO: Enemy Unknown' in Europe.Xenonauts has stayed true to the original, plus expanded on it. Everything that was great about the original XCOM is here and even better. The UI is very nice and clean, Air and Ground Combat both feel great, and base/research/production management is very fun as well.Edit 1: Now that the game is released, I can finish this review. From when I first made this review, there's been quite a few changes and much balancing, which made an already fun TBS even more so. My only real complaint is that the soldiers stat generation has had its minimum lowered, so when starting a new game or recruiting a new soldier, you often get soldiers with annoyingly low Time Units(TU for short).The only saving grace is that they changed how much TU's shooting costs. Instead of a flat number, it's a percentage of their max TU's. This means that no matter how few TU's you have, you can still rally off as many shots as a high TU character. However, movement TU cost is still a flat number, so low TU will greatly restrict how far you can go, and if you want to shoot and move, you'll have a hard time with low TU's.They also nerfed some of the armor and the shield. The shield is the biggest in my opinion. I used to love having two soldiers with shields, but with its small nerf, they start to become a liability far sooner than before. There IS a shield upgrade, but you get that option LONG after the first shield becomes a liability. Doesn't help that they nerfed the pistol pretty hard too.With the release version I tend to drop the shield pretty quickly, and I rarely use the pistol due to its poor accuracy and range.Anyway, enough with complaining. Despite the whining, this game is still incredible. If you like XCOM and/or Turn Based Strategy games, then this is definitely a game you'll need to pick up.Edit 2: I made a mistake in the first paragraph. Xenonauts was not announced before XCOM: Enemy Unknown.			"

								Hello good friend Xenonauts! If you like XCOM Series you should try out the classical Modernized 80s-90s Alien invasion! i say i enjoy this game alot as it's simple and good spirited, It's intense and scary as XCOM in many ways and could say it's MORE punishing and lasts ALOT longer, I honestly haven't finished the game so i might be wrong in alot what i say, But i enjoy this game for allowing me to do whatever the flurck i want, Shoot down ships, Small or big, Fail horridly, Capture aliens with my Spam of gas grenades ""♥♥♥♥ing love you for adding Capture through gas grenades, How about wine?"" And other tools to get you through the encounters.Things are scary and unknown in the early age of this invasion, you are still advancing in the old tech of our past time, You suffer and will have big losses due to the sole fact that they are alinens with pure energy based weapons and you with puny yet reliable ballistic weapons.Get this game and give it a try, It's really fun and lasts long.Again like XCOM you can modify this game aswell to suit more things you'd like, More UFO's, more encounters or attacks or even aliens, funding, research, parts or materials, it's all harmless to the indevidual person, You are playing as you want, Even if other thinks you cheat or not, Your game, Your modificatons, beside it's a single player game, blood have fun.

								[Edit] Just started playing the release version (1.0), and it`s really awesome [end of edit]I enjoyed Fallout 1,2 and tactics in it`s day, spent a few hundred hours on Jagged Alliance 2 (still an amazing game to play now). That being said, Xenonauts is an awesome love game that is just satisfying to discover and strategize with; The game does a great job at simulation what I see as key elements in defending Earth; At this time the game is still in Beta, I played version 19 stable, a few months (hopefuly) before release. I fully recomend purchasing this game even if it never develops beyond this stage, you will get your entertainment`s worth if you like this genre(I played more hours of this than Diablo 3); (but it`s being built very fast and very nicely so don`t wory about not being developed);Now, if you never played any of the titles writen before, but want to tryout this ""turn Base"" simulation thing, I recomend you search 1 2 youtube videos to be sure the art style, animation, and isometric perspective is something you like; It`s not a big budget AAA title, and they made a clear choice to invest a lot in gameplay and replayability rather than eye candy; If you`re coming here out of the latest Firaxis X-com titles, I recomend you really give it a try! you may sometimes miss the flashy animation, awesome explosions and gorry deaths, but the strategy is much more seducing!Good luck defending earth!

												Gist of the game:Build air bases around the world to try to achieve air supremecy over nations so they continue to fund you.Recruit and equip ground troops to investigate crash sites, enemy bases, and alien terror attacks.Perform research and to learn about the aliens and build new advanced planes and battlefield support equipment (guns/tanks/armor)Manage budget and upkeep over investments in winning on the battlefield VS winning in the air.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What got me to recommend the gmae:I. Ground combat feels dynamic;Alien got your squad penned down? Blast a hole in the wall with c4 and flank him!Use machine gunners and flash grenades to suppress enemies.Use anti-ballistic shield to make an assault on an alien UFO.Do you toss c4 and rockets into the UFO to soften up the enemy or do you go in without the explosives in order to salvage alien items?One wrong turn (the ground combat is turned based) in which you leave soldiers exposed in the open leaves the possibility that one alien machine gunner can mow down half your squad.Many different kinds of grenades with different uses.Fight a diverse variety (but not excessive) of aliens.II. Somewhat dynamic air battlesjust go watch a youtube video for this one.The air battles are fun but sometimes very repetitive. III. DifficultyI like the difficulty a lot. The game has 4 options I believe: easy, normal, hard, insane.I play on normal and it is very much a fun challenge. I have to do a lot of thinking. Overall:I predict this game is an instant classic and will be played long after its release for many years.9.5/10i put 9.5 instead of 10 because I think multiplayer ground combat would be really awesome and I think air combat is neat however it maybe could have been done better			"

												If you are a fan of the original UFO:Enemy Unknown (AKA X-Com:UFO Defence), then know that I used to play it from time to time until 2013, when I found Xenonauts, and since then I can't really play the original game anymore. The simplest way to describe Xenonauts is that it keeps the spirit of the original game and adds many improvements.If the only game related to X-Com games you know is Firaxis XCOM, then know that XCOM doesn't really have much in common with the original game, despite the name, as at the core they are fundamentally different games. Asking which one is better is like asking whether apples or steaks taste better - some will like one better, some the other, and some will like both while knowing that they are simply different. And the same applies to XCOM and Xenonauts, they are different, and whatever you learn when playing XCOM is best to forget when playing Xenonauts. XCOM is like a Hollywood action move: It's flashy, with explosions, brave superheroes who eventually defeat the aliens with style while uttering their lines, avenging their fallen mates who the aliens had the nerves to inevitably kill early on. And if you like action movies, it doesn't really matter that it's cliched, gamey, doesn't often make much sense, and is hardly ""Enemy Unknown"" when somebody pops up to explain everything three times the moment you encounter something new. Xenonauts is like a thriller: You don't really know what is going on, and may get lost if you don't pay attention, or may figure it out only later. Things start in a miserable situation, the aliens keep their pressure until the very end, people die when mistakes are made and sometimes even if not and they are merely unlucky. The war is all but lost and hopeless, but it has to be fought, because there's no option and it may be won despite all the losses and setbacks. And that is exactly one of the charm's of Xenonauts - anyone can win a fight that is meant to be won, but it's an entirely different matter if the victory is not given away merely for a pretense of effort, and aliens in Xenonauts do not show up to be just target practice. In Xenonauts, you have to deserve your victory, and the game won't hesitate to utterly defeat you if you fail to deliver. But if you do win, then it is the sweetest of victories, because it was you that made it happen despite everything. And it doesn't matter that there were no cutscenes, because the best story was inside your head.And if you have never heard of any X-Com or XCOM for whatever strange reason, then know that Xenonauts is a great game, but it is not a game for everybody. If you expect casual play, you'll lose quickly. If you judge a book by its cover, you'll be disappointed by the lack of cutscenes or flashy graphics. If concepts such as ""planes with only heavy missiles can't win against nimble fighter UFOs"", ""soldiers in the open are likely to die"", ""aliens may attack from behind if that area has not been checked"", ""humans do not see well in the dark"", ""items need to be in hands in order to be used"" or ""your mouse has more than one button"" remain a mystery to you, the game will end up being frustrating and ""confusing"", as there is no tutorial and the game does not spoon-feed information to the player, but rather just provides the information and expects the player to figure it out (or there's of course the manual, but it's 2010s, so nowadays it's much cooler to spend an hour on trial and error rather than skimming over a manual for a couple of minutes). But if you think about what happens, pay attention, are relentless and careful, and like to win because you are good, then this is a game for you.In Xenonauts, aliens will keep you on the edge for a long time (unlike in X-Com, where it felt more like the aliens were just occassionally stopping by, and they will not wait forever until you research your next ""priority"" project as in XCOM). You will need to quickly manage setting up additional bases around the globe (wherever you want), expand your air force to hunt flying UFOs (and you really need to hunt them), research new technologies to try to keep up, manage your funds (which may soon get low if the funding regions decide you do a lousy job of defending them), and last but definitely not the least, equip and lead your soldiers to fight ground missions at downed UFOs, cities terrorized by aliens, alien bases (yes, plural) and defences of your own bases (yes, again, not necessarily just once) until the very end. Which, for many soldiers, may be their own personnal end, given they fight a superior enemy, and it is expected for soldiers to die throughout the entire game. Your soldiers have a selection of different equipment available to them, and it is up to you to choose it based on their strengths and weaknesses, and create tactics that will fit your style (there is no perks system giving soldiers ""magic"" abilities as in XCOM, it is the equipment and the ability to freely combine it that provide variety). And it is up to you to balance all of that.No game is perfect, of course. First of all, I suggest you consider using the Community Edition, which provides additional bugfixes, tweaks and mods that alleviate some of the problems you might have with the vanilla game (such as a relatively low number of maps). As said, there's no tutorial, so you need to either figure it out using common sense and information in the game (Xenopedia, tooltips), at least glance at the manual, or watch a (good) YouTube video. The game is quite long, so it may feel a bit repetitive if you try to finish it quickly (but there are airstrikes to help with that). You may also easily end up in a death spiral if you do poorly (but then you shouldn't do way too poorly, it either means that you are too careless and do not pay attention, or you should play on easier difficulty). The alien AI is probably the smartest I have ever seen in any X-Com game (in other games they often just wait or wander aimlessly), which may prove annoying if you do not expect that: Alien leaders will often take defensive positions (here the aliens actually care about their UFO) and mindless attacks will often end up in a carnage, and occassionally the aliens are way too smart (the aliens do not cheat as such, but generally smart AIs are hard to do without the AI getting access to internal information, and even though it usually makes the game better, in some cases it may tip the scales of the AI's decision making into doing the unlikely). Finally, the grid structure of the battlefield leads to some unintuitive (even though not buggy) line-of-sight/fire issues, for example round shapes such as UFO hull are rather poorly mapped to the grid.But none of that matters much if you immerse yourself into the game and let it to scare you during night and terror missions, to make you feel overwhelmed in desperate fights, to get shocked when your soldiers die, to organize your force the way you want and make progress in the hopes of overcoming the enemy, and to let you feel the joy when you make that happen.All in all, if you like X-Com games, or if you like games that actually challenge you, this is a game for you.(Note that I do not use Steam for launching the game, so the number of hours played is way way off. I've probably spent few hundred hours on just playing the game, and since the game has hooked me enough to make me contribute to the Community Edition, I'm probably past a thousand.)			"

												Tactical turn-based squad combat within spitting distance of its finest.The upsides:The time unit system, inspired by the original X-COM. If your soldiers are fast, they can shoot their weapon several times, then run. Or shoot and move and shoot again.The overwatch system. You just point your soldiers in the right direction and leave them some time units, and they'll shoot reactively when they see something.Research. This could be better integrated, but the basic idea is that you need to acquire specific alien technology to study and thereby improve your equipment.Difficulty levels. I'm playing on easy right now, and it is in fact easy. A small challenge in places, but if I'm a bit careful, I don't lose soldiers. Higher difficulty levels are progressively harder and require more care to get through.The midsides:Enemy variety is okay. You've got normal mooks, regenerating enemies, androids, reavers (scary), fliers, and psions (also scary). Enough to keep you on your toes, but I rarely see much difference between androids and baseline Caesians.Weapon variety is a strict progression on one axis, with different purposes on another. Shotgun to scatter laser, for instance; rifle to laser rifle to plasma rifle. Armor progression is similar at first, but branches out a bit later, letting you choose between medium armor, flying scout armor, and walking tanks. The variety is just sufficient, no more.The controls are mostly intuitive -- but who thinks about controls unless they're bad?There's a decent number of maps, but you'll start recognizing them after a bit. For standard missions, I think there's like industrial, city, arctic, farmland, and desert, with about three maps each. That means you've got good odds of seeing a duplicate after just a few missions. And terror missions always take place in a city. Enemy bases have more variety, but you're not likely to see that many alien bases. I would have liked to see procedurally generated terrain, but that's difficult and time-consuming to create.The downsides:The UI is a little clunky for switching between levels (upstairs/downstairs).There are occasional bugs -- the other day, I encountered a ghost Caesian. It wasn't aligned on tile boundaries, my soldiers could overlap it, and I couldn't shoot it. I had to run away. There are occasional crashes, too. Not quite stable enough for me to recommend ironman mode.It's somewhat expected in this kind of game, but losses can snowball. You spent a lot of time building up your forces, then got a full team wipe and lost half your equipment in a bad mission. At that point, you should maybe scrub the campaign and start over. You research things in the wrong order and things get a lot more difficult than they would otherwise be.			"

												I was hoping to extend my XCOM 2012 experience with xenonauts....well, I was pretty wrong. It's better under some aspects (the air battles are better developed, the story seems more interesting, the base management is greater and better designed) but...ground battles just suck. And that's the bigger point in that kind of games. Weird things happen so often that, in the end, you'll just lose interest. Let's just tell about what's wrong :1) LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG "" WAITING FOR I.A. "" !! Seriously, the waiting at the end of each turn is much, much, much longer than the loading times !! and this "" Hidden movement "" artwork image is, after a while, worst than just looking at the map...2) big map and lot enemies...it isn't a good thing ? well, no, most match, especially during the terror missions, will ends up with you searching for some single xeno running away...add this to the point 1) and...you'll know about those stolen and frustating 5-10 minutes !!! 3) despite the lore, even the aliens that should have a "" worst vision than human "" can still see you while you cannot, even when you're facing their direction e.g. you'll be shooted from nowhere and you can do few about this4) the black fog of war outside the buildings is boring and make no sense. WTF, they don't scout the area at least while approaching with the dropshp ?5) you cannot throw granades over a small wall but the aliens can.			"

												I never played the original XCOM; despite that, I love the genre, and played more Fallout Tactics and Chaos Gate than I care to think about, as well as more modern games like Silent Storm. This is to say that I'm viewing Xenonauts on its own merits and not colored by any association with its spiritual predecessor.There's a lot to like here, and some parts of this game I'm really fond of. I like the setting, with retooled F-16s and MiGs giving things vague Independence Day vibes. The strategic game is fun, establishing bases, managing personnel and research projects, and dispatching interceptors to engage UFOs. Some might find the micromanagement of every soldier and every F-16 a little fiddly, but I enjoy it. The overall atmosphere is intriguing and the basic premise of defending Earth from alien scum is a classic.Unfortunately, that's where the good ends. Manual air combat is lackluster, feeling unresponsive and offering few options other than to bring more firepower to the table and win the resulting slugging match. This is only a minor complaint, however, as it serves its purpose and air combats can be autoresolved if one wishes.Ground combat is where I was truly disappointed. Again, I don't care if it's ""faithful"" to a 1994 game or not, this game came out in 2014 and those are the standards I hold it to. At first glance, it seemed a little reminiscent of Silent Storm, with action points (TUs) and Snap Shots, Aimed Shots, Bursts, etc. It lacks Silent Storm's depth, however, and yet also somehow manages to exacerbate Silent Storm's worst flaws of unfathomable line-of-sight/vision/detection rules, a tedious RNG overwatch system, and an AI which knows just how to exploit both to maximize player frustration. Added to this is a downright awful movement system, which punishes you for any kind of movement and making many tactical maneuvers virtually impossible.My favorite moment thus far is when I was stacked up to assault a downed UFO's cockpit. Because of the frustratingly punishing movement/TU limitations, only my two soldiers immediately on either side of the door had enough movement to open the cockpit doors, run inside, and still get a shot off at the occupants (grenading was impossible, both because of the way the doors were set up and the even MORE punishing TU requirements for grenades). I had to make sure they ended their turn at the doors in order to get a full turn's movement the next turn, meanwhile, the rest of the squad covered the door from behind cover elsewhere. So, naturally, during the AI turn the aliens pop out of the cockpit to take a shot and then pop back in, Silent Storm style. During one of these, one of my guys gets an RNG interrupt - which I have no control over - and unloads his machinegun... directly into one of my stacked-up assaulters, despite being BESIDE the door, out of the line of fire! KIA.Maybe the game is going for some kind of wacky ""Haha, see how many hapless idiots you can turn into cannon fodder"" theme, but the detailed service records explaining that my soldiers are Soviet VDV or British SAS with combat experience in Northern Ireland seems to undermine the notion that my soldiers are supposed to be high-mortality idiots intended to be thrown at the aliens like disposable meat shields.I like that the strategic layer and overall atmosphere of the game are so much deeper and more intricate than the new XCOM, but the tactical gameplay is so painfully backward that it drains any real fun from the experience. Masochists and 1994 nostalgists might get a kick out of it, but anyone else is advised to just go reinstall Fallout Tactics or Silent Storm instead.			"

												This is honestly what I expected the X-Com remake to be, and was disappointed that I didn't get. It's a tasteful homage to the originals, with an art direction all its own. The developers have obviously put a lot of thought into making a beautiful and fun game. I like it a lot 11 hours in, and I can see myself sinking 40 more into it. ""Meh"" things:The combat is a bit simpler than I like in my TBS games. I feel like they could have worked in more complexity to movement/posture/aiming (like JA2 did), and come out with a more engaging, tactical game. However, it's still a step up from the remade X-Com, so I won't nitpick here too much.The maps feel a bit same-y after a few battles (crashed spaceships are generally in the same location relative to your skyranger).Don't be dissuaded, though - this is good stuff. 7/10 or so.

												Awesome!  Xenonauts is an incredibly clever and rewarding game. Great game mechanics, streamlined micro-management and wonderful  60's type of artwork.Tough strategic and economic decisions await you:  should you build one more base to save Australia or improve your existing ones?  Hire more soldiers or modernize your jets?  The combats are very,  very challenging:  if you rush,  the aliens will wipe out your best teams, those it took you weeks to promote to majors. And you will lose money, and you will lose continents.  On the down size, the repetitive, corridor style combats in the alien bases. Superior to the XCom series, which has its own merits,  Xenonauts is the proof that you do not need 3D or fluffy animations to create an enthralling and wonderful game. Oh, and I love the map and the passing of time idea!			"

												A tactically sound XCOMXenonauts is a great squad-based strategy game. I found out about it around the time XCOM was really hyped and it had great potential while in Beta. It is also closer to what the original games were from what I have seen and been told. The game became a basis for a lot well-made mods that got the game to the level of quality that I could recommend the game without any doubts. One of the great aspects of the game is that while the progression of the invasion will develop in a straightforward manner, the success and ways you will be able to resist it can be very different depending on the decisions you have made of how to spread your limited resources and how successful you have been with downing UFOs and killing aliens on the ground.The element of randomness and unexpected development in the invasion is what really makes this game addictive and repayable. You constantly have to adjust and prepare in advance for new threats and improve the defence of the planet. The game does not lead the player as a child and you are often forced to adapt the best way you find possible which is often not very effective. This fits well into the setting as no one has ever experienced an alien invasion, so you can’t expect someone to tell you how to deal with it. However, this can result in the need to start a new play through when you realise that you have fallen too far behind, but I didn’t mind it as I enjoyed the game greatly and had to abandon only my first play through because I was playing it as if I was playing XCOM: EUThe gameplay is divided in three parts: the world map, where you track UFOs and manage your bases, soldiers and interceptors; the air fights where you actually control the interceptors and fight the UFOs; and the missions on the ground where most of the time you fight what’s left of the UFO’s crew. The world map is well-made and has all the necessary functionality like patrolling the skies and setting a course for the interceptors. The air battles can be tedious and annoying when you do not know how to deal with the UFOs yet. Finally, the ground battles are what really make the game great and are the essence of it. They take place on a random map (randomly generated with some mods) and they can have different objectives. Unlike the simplified battle in XCOM, here every action takes Action Points, from shooting to looking around. Reaction fire is based on how many APs your squad member has and everything fits really well and the flow of the battle feels really ‘organic’ while in XCOM you have to select it as a separate action, your inventory is limited to slots and squads are based on specialisation. In Xenonauts inventories are only limited by a RPG-style grid and the strength of the character. Also, you decide the class depending on the stats. If the character has enough strength you can give him an RPG as well as a machine gun and a sniper rifle. The feasibility of that is limited but you can play around with different loadouts. This shows that the approach taken in creating this game relies on giving the player the freedom to make decisions and learn for himself what the best approach is.The graphics are satisfactory, however the 2-d engine can lead to some unlikely shot trajectory and unbelievable deaths which can be frustrating. I am glad the next game is coming on a 3-d engine.Lastly, I will give a few hints for new players. Get the community version straight away. The instructions are on the official forum. It makes the game what it was supposed to be in the first place. Start the game on normal and learn how to play there. You will end up having to start a new game eventually so used that to see the pace at which the game becomes harder. Once you lose hope during that play through start a new one on Veteran because there the aliens are not nerfed and will have 100% stats which to me it seems is how the game is supposed to be played. I can’t suggest switching Iron Man mode on but you should play the game as if you have it on and suffer the consequences because that is what makes the game interesting. Only replay things if you believe the game has been very unjust to you, as these moments will take place. If you are not used to the air battles check youtube for a guide as this is of crucial importance for your success. Happy alien hunting!			"

												I don't see any ""non-early-access"" reviews of Xenonauts down below, so I figured I should put one up.  I don't review things normally, but I find this game interesting enough to do one regardless.  I won't arbitrarily assign number values, I'll should post my thoughts on a few areas.  My review is mostly based on comparisons with other games in the genre, so to speak.To help you all learn what I am talking about, XCOM refers to the recent Firaxis game, while X-Com refers to the significantly older Microprose game that inspired both this and XCOM.Looks:  I imagine that most people today might be taken back by the ""cheap"" 2d graphics and general lack of flashy-ness.  You need to realize that the simple ui and graphics really help make the game look clean for modern audiences, while maintaining the feel of the original X-Com.  The UI does a remarkably good job at allowing you to understand what is going on (which I think is the worst way that the original X-Com has aged).  The game also has a decent variety of environments to look at, which helps evoke the sense of a global war as you battle among the ruins of downed UFOs from Middle-Eastern deserts to downtown Edinburgh.  That said, the graphics often seemed underwhelming when compared to the action taking place (something that XCOM did a great job of fixing I think).  This is a minor gripe though, and the graphics in the game do a great job of letting you know what's going on while giving a good sense of the era the game takes place in.Gameplay:  Being someone who has played a great deal of both X-Com and XCOM, Xenonauts does a great job of ""fixing"" a lot of the things that were broken about the original game.  One my biggest gripes while playing through XCOM is that while it was fun, I never really felt the same sense of horror that X-Com inspired.  Instead, I felt that I had a squad of colorful (literally) superheroes out of an action movie kicking alien ♥♥♥.  While that's a blast, it is quite different from the creepy atmosphere and balls-breaking difficult gameplay of the original (and yes, I have played XCOM on difficulty levels higher than Normal).  For me, Xenonauts captured the utter feeling of terror that the original had in the tactical game.  It also fixes a lot of the dumb micromanaging of the original (like having to re-equip soldiers for each mission), as well as making certain tactics unnecessary (you no longer have to send suicide rookies through doors because you can open them finally!).  They also added in a second victory option on the tactical map, where you only need to hold a UFO for a certain amount of time before winning, which eliminates the need to go on those time consuming hunts for the lone alien cowering in a corner somewhere (which you can still do if you really want to).  Xenonauts also brings back X-Com's basebuilding and geoscape game, as well as (I found at least), vastly improving the interceptions.  Finally, they added in the very nice option of simply authorizing airstrikes against downed UFOs instead of sending in the grunts, which makes the game feel much less dumb at moments.  If you are a fan of X-Com, be warned about a number of changes they made though.  In order to make you reliant on council funding, they removed the efficiency with which you could produce and sell items for cash.  I believe they also removed many of the end-game options that make enemies irrelevant (such as blaster-bombs), although I could be wrong since I have not played this enough to say for certain.  If you are neither of those groups and this is just something on the front page of steam, this game uses an adjustable speed real-time global strategy map where you plop down new bases and send interceptors and strike squads as you try to save the earth from a massive alien invasion in the 1970's.  When intercepting UFOs, your fighters can either autoresolve the battle or you can command a quick realtime interception minigame.  When you send choppers full of your troopers to take downed UFOs, the game switches to being a squad-based, turn-based tactics game.  The goal initially is to just find out about the aliens and get the weapons that can take them down, all while surviving the invasion, and the gameplay does a pretty good job of making you feel that.  If you haven't played any game related to this one, you might find it difficult to figure out what everything means and how to play, but I might put a total noob's guide or something soon to help those in that boat.Price:  I know many of are looking at that price and saying that the game can't possibly be worth it.  $25 for a 2d game that is basically a clone of a game that has already been cloned?  MADNESS!  If you are on of those types of people, I imagine you also seldom buy any game that doesn't seem like a sweet deal to grab, so just wait for a sale if it seems to strike your fancy.  If you like XCOM or X-Com, this game is different or better (respectively) enough for you to probably enjoy it.  If you don't mind throwing down the dosh for the game right now, I can tell you that as a fan and owner of both X-Com and XCOM, this game is a great addition to the collection.  Since it changes a lot of issues that X-Com has while remaining in its style, it feels nicely different from XCOM and just superior to X-Com.  If you own neither of those games, this is still a great game in its own right.  It's also one of the few games in recent memory that hasn't hit me with buyer's remorse.Conclusion:  Xenonauts is really different from XCOM, since it plays much more like X-Com.  At the same time, it really improves on the old X-Com formula, making it worthwhile that way.  It might look a little weird, and if you aren't used to it, it will likely feel incomprehensible, but it isn't impossible to figure out what is going on.  If youa re interested in the premise, I think it does a great job of executing on that front (much more so than X-Com ever did).  If you don't normally buy games at full price, wait for a sale to hit like you always do anyways, but if you don't mind it, this game is worth the full price in my book.			"

								First Mission was a Total Wipe,2nd Misson only 2 soldiers survived,I've lost 2 Interceptors and civilians are being picked off world wide.And it ain't even the end of the first month.And I have loved every painstaking second of it.This is the natural successor to Old School X-ComSo glad I got this game, just sorry I didn't get it sooner.Heading back to try and salvage the planet.i don't expect to succeed.

												It's a winner. Doesn't even slightly joke about being a better version of the groundbreaking classic that was Ufo Defense (or X-com, depending where you're from)It takes all the good things from that and innovates on them, making it a better version of itself. Currently as of writing this, there's still a tiny few bugs around, but no gamebreaking ones and judging from the awesome support for the mod community so far, this one is gonna go long, and stay high up for a very long time.If you've never had the chance to play the original X-com, this is your shot, and highly reccomended at that.

I just finished the Vanilla version (no-mods) of the game with patch-level 1.59 so following comments apply to this kind of setup.Xenonauts is a good (almost great) remake of the original X-Com (in Europe Ufo - Enemy Unknown) classic. It took me approx. 30 hours to complete the game on easy difficulty. 75 % this time was quality gaming - 25 % was boring grinding with too familiar ground maps.Almost all the areas work well and all in all I like this game more than Firaxis version which I played last year.I only have following negative comments about the game and I guess most of these might be issues which could be fixed with mods:Repetitive maps (you get way too familiar with the maps after hours of grinding them)Psionics and the lack of countermeasures for psi-powers. Aliens can take control of your soldiers and you cannot do literally anything for this. In original series you were able to have your own psi-soldiers and also equipment which helped against psi-powersReapers and ship invasions (when you storm downed enemy ships the reapers and their 100% kill-rate-attack gets so boring after they use the teleport elevators to kill you soldiers)Too narrow tech tree (more stuff to research would be nice)Air Combat balance. Too difficult in the beginning and too easy in the end. Also the actual air-combat mini-game is not so nice and I used automatic all the timeSoldier development. You cannot influence how soldiers improve and you as you cannot influence what skills and attributes you get you don't get attached to your team (I only noticed who had the most time units - rest of the attributes in my team were pretty much a ""black box"" to me) "

												It plays like X-COM without being a direct copy of X-COM.  Xenonauts offers you a lot more in the way of tactical planning and decision making, while still leaving room for you to fall into your own pattern and strategy for successful missions.  The variety of weapons is a huge upgrade from X-COM's typical Pistol/Rifle/Heavy weapon, and the balance between the weapons is pretty spot-on; you can use whatever you like, provided you plan accordingly, a strike team of pure pistol-wielding xenonauts is totally viable.  The research text is flavorful and a nice addition, immersing you more in the world and the reality of the invasion while still offering some form of believability.  The geoscape is far more lively, with alien activity being broadcasted as ""casualty reports"" around the globe when left unchecked, and rather than a single UFO or a few on the same mission appearing, you get swarms of UFOs appearing all over the globe simultaneously, each operating on its own agenda.  This makes having a competent airforce not a luxury but a necessity. While the game is far from perfect, it still gave me literal days of playtime fun, along with a few agonizing losses and times of near rage-quitting.  Definitely a must play if you enjoyed any of the X-COM games, including the newer reboot.Just remember to close the door before you end your turn and keep your eyes peeled for reapers.			"

												Imagine this : You send a squad of eight, somewhat experienced troopers to a shot down UFO which you have never seen before nor do you know who or what's inside.It's night, pitch black to be exact.Your squad moves away from the security of the helicopter and slowly move forward, checking around every corner for any sign of aliens, their morale slightly lowering due to the darkness and the strange sounds.They reach a cornfield, the UFO probably located behind it, so ofcourse you order them to enter the field as a sudden burst of plasma nearly hits your rifleman who took point. A big reptilian alien was hiding behind some strawbales and was waiting for you to take the bait, luckily a well-placed shot in the head took care of him quickly, good thing you brought a sniper along.The troopers start throwing flares all around, watching every part of the field carefully as your pointman suddenly finds a patch of blood on the floor next to an empty shotgun, presumably of the farmer who lives here, yet no body to be seen.A silhouet suddenly passes through an opening, only visible for a brief second, but enough to notice that that thing was something new.Your heart starts to pound as you order your troops to stand ground, watching every possible entrypoint for that thing to come through.You gunner suddenly opens fire, unleashing a hellfire of bullets to the opening you first came through, the large, bug-like horror flinching as it falls to the floor before it could reach them.So now that's dealt with, it's time to breach the UFO...and that's where the true horror starts...9/10 would get scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ again			"

								While the new XCOM: ENEMY UNKNOWN is a good continuation of the XCOM franchise many of us enjoyed so much, Xenonauts stays truer to the older X-COM games. While there are a few thematic differences - the cold war era, and the names of organisations, aliens and objects being different (copyright evasion powers activate) - the game plays in an almost identical way - you can have multiple bases and troop craft, the interceptions are more interactive and still good, bases are viewed from above - and the tactical combat keeps up the level of tension fans will be wanting.I also want to praise the addition of civilian combatants. They're not amazing, but sometimes it's nice to see the rest of the world fight back.There are a couple of UI issues that need to be resolved, but nothing that makes it a chore to play, or breaks the game.

The most broken thing in the game is the aliens ability to mindcontrole one of the members in your team. This destroys every decent strategy.

												Full disclosure: I'm writing this review from the POV of someone who's certainly heard of but never played any of the Xcom games before starting this one.Xenonauts is a strategy game where you command the titular international military group tasked with defending Earth from alien invasion in the late 1970s. It's supposed to be a remake of the original X-Com set during the Cold War, and as far as I know it's a pretty faithful recreation right down to the battlefield, base placement and troop equipment micromanagement. It seems deeper than, say, the newer XCOM series, not that that would make the newer games bad.For me personally, it feels more like a classic Doctor Who serial without the Doctor or indeed almost any sense of optimism. (It doesn't really take advantage the fact that it's set during the Cold War - often you'll have NATO and Warsaw Pact soldiers working together in the same squad.) This game can be pretty brutal at times. The only thing that will save you from the nasty, aggressive aliens is attacking them wherever possible with maximum firepower, then stealing their stuff so your scientists can reverse-engineer it into even more firepower.I quite like it myself, and it's an impressive indie effort, so I'd say it's good, but given its problems I would only call it good. Let's hope the sequel[www.xenonauts2.com] will be great.My other observations:Air combat is ""aces"", perhaps the best expansion over the original X-Com, though it's 3v3 max and takes some getting used to. Make sure you don't insta-deploy to the first sight of UFO activity before formulating some sort of tactic for the situation, and make sure you know your aircrafts' limits before sending them out to fight.Breaching downed alien ships can become tedious - the devs should have added back doors, side entrances and/or destructible hull points to at least some of them. You pretty much need explosives, shields and/or expendable soldiers because at least some of the aliens will have holed up inside and they will shoot the hell out of your troops.To my understanding, the original X-Com eventually gave you tools to counter psionic attacks and develop your own. Xenonauts doesn't seem to give you anything of the sort except letting your braver troops/those who survived previous psychic attacks resist them more effectively.Bullet trajectories aren't really modeled past your units' line of sight, from what I can tell. If you fire on where you know an alien is, but the alien is out of your LOS, it won't do anything unless you use projectile weapons such as rockets.Lines of sight themselves can be weird. Soldiers seem to have a difficult time throwing grenades over objects, but alien forces seem to be able to see your forces often before you can see them.Workshop support is truly this game's saving grace. There's already a number of mods that try to fix what I've described above.I would say this is a rather rough but ultimately enjoyable game for people who want a no-holds-barred slugfest with MiGs and M16s against invading aliens. It's certainly smoother around the edges for people who don't want to play the original, which is more than 20 years old at this point. It also seems more grim in tone than the original, but that could be just me.The prequel novella included with the game is good, at least.Two tips. Alien activity is punishing here, since they love to screw with humanity and since every violent act you fail to stop drains your support and therefore funding - this means air superiority is key. Get at least 3 bases up ASAP and make sure they cover at least a decent portion of the map. On that note, MiGs and enhanced torpedoes are some of the most important research projects in the earlygame, followed shortly by dropship tech. You can usually pick and choose where to send in the troops, but you need to be able to match your enemy in the air war ASAP. Noticing a pattern here?Also, ground combat is usually challenging to the point where you want to avoid night missions until the lategame, and start avoiding industrial areas around the midgame. Automatic weapons in close quarters and dangerous enemy types that run up in your face mean things will get very messy. Of course, if that's what you want, don't let me stop you from staging Stalingrad With Aliens.			"

												Back in the dark ages I found a demo of X-com for my newly cobbled together 486. I wore that demo out. Even though the demo only contained one map I was able to get hours and hours out of it due to the high difficulty and the complete lack of any tool tips or tutorial. Some decade later X-com got a reboot which was massively dissapointing to me. Discovering Xenonauts was like finding that girl from junor high who gave you your 1st kiss then lost track of in highschool, has grown up into a hottie who makes pizza from cratch and cuban sandwiches while wearing heels and an apron (also she regards you as her 1st love).  Xenonauts is what X-com's re-boot should have been. Big studio AAA titles are falling into the same trap that hollowood blockbusters have. The cost of production is so high that risky ideas (read as good ideas) get a pass for more tried and true formulas (I'm looking at you infinity sequal titles). I guess a bunch of younger folks who never played the insanely hard original may try Xenonauts because they loved the re-boot. Most of those people will probably hate this game. They are going to die and die and die and not understand the satisfaction of keeping an entire team of veterans alive or the dread of losing an old friend. Xenonauts for what is it, and how it was dev, is 10/10. It's not just a carbon copy of old x-com, it's better in all the right ways without losing any of the exacting tactical nature of the original. The coldwar setting is sick and adds immersion for me (I'm a grey bush who remembers the end of the cold war). The writing is great and combined with the art really draws you in and  adds depth and flavor, yet can be completely ignored if nobody got time for that and just want to grind out another mission real quick. In fact lots of things in this game can be sorta glossed over or invested in as the particular player sees fit. This is what I love most about this game. You are free to solve this puzzel however you want. Some players are going to master dog fighting and some folks will auto calculate every air battle. Some may read every bit of flavor text in the game and soak up all the small details, and others will have eyes for ruthless ground games only. Whatever you find enjoyable you can go deeper and whatever you don't enjoy, you can dial down and not have to go down that road.			"

												To put it simply, Xenonauts is an oldschool remake of the classic X-COM. And that means it retains the brutality of the original while still being incredibly fun to play. The graphics, while somewhat cartoony in places (notably cars) serve the art style well and convey the message of grimness throughout the game.Sound is fine, but some noises I found hurt my ears with headphones. Other than that not much of note aside from the good soundtrack.UI is somewhat complicated but easy to learn, while providing most of the vital information to keep your guys from not dying a horrible, awful, painful, and plasma-y death.Gameplay, the big G.It feels like X-COM. Not in a shoddy knock off way, but in a ""The devs knew what they were doing when they made this glorious game graced by the almighty Gaben himself"" way, complete with Time Units, Panics, and a boatload of potential ways for your poor plasma sh-err great soldiers to die. This includes fully playable air battles (which I recommend autoresolving for the most part), terror missions, abductions, and my love/hate favorite, the classic base defense.Have I mentioned how hard the game is? It is pretty difficult, but if you have played X-COM style games before, you will know what you're doing, but still get completely and utterly pimp slapped if you act like your soldiers are Rambos and Rambas.All in all, get it, or get plasma-ed.

												Rarely do I drop cash on a game when its fully priced. But with Xenonauts I broke that trend, and the defilement team deserves every penny. The game is a brilliant spiritual successor to X-Com. It has its improvements over the original games, however any seasoned veteran of the games will be able to take to this as if they were right at home.The new and improved air combat system is also a welcome addition. Though at times it can seem a bit dumb, having to micro your ships to fly directly at the enemy ships is a bit weird (when you click on them they adjust to their flight path but that's rarely what you want)I would suggest anyone who lives X-Com buy this game. If you don't like the originals however, this game is not for you. It is every bit as difficult as the originals and every bit as nail biting.			"

												The original X-Com was pulled into a time machine and this is what came out, if you want deeper strategy, base building, and loyal human soldiers dying by the truck load fighting an alien invasion then get this! Pros; More micro management of resources, technology and building. More than one base, build as many as you want so long as you have the money. Air combat mini game against those pesky alien UFO’s. Send down bucket loads of soldiers down to fight the alien invaders (as not all of them are coming home). A longer prolonged campaign that can be drawn out.Cons; No streamlined and snazzy graphics. Can sometimes seem overwhelming management wise for those not into deep and heavy strategy gaming.I liked it, thumbs up! "

												First of all don't go into this game looking for XCOM, you will probably find some elements adapted from it.  But yeah .... not XCOM.  I went into this expecting a turnbased strategy/management style game and left my Fanboy at the door.    If you can do that you probably will enjoy the game much better.  Its nice enough still trying to play it,  The learning curve for this game is extremely sharp and on the higher difficulty settings even more so. Don't expect much in the way of tutorials or explanations in game.  The game is very slow paced, its not something that you will complete in one sitting.  I enjoyed playing it,  the graphics are okay, the management and combat are complex. I am having a fun time, currently trying to get use to the interface and screwing around with the gameplay elements. Not really much of a story element.  I don't hate it so far and would probably reccomend it,  If you don't have a short attention span, and can handle the fact that it just drops you into the game with only a vague idea of what the hell your suppose to do.  Not saying that is a bad thing though.			"

												I missed out on the delight of XCOM in my youth, and the modern incarnations never grabbed me, however this game has been fantastic and I have already sunk plenty of my time into the vanilla, community edition, and CE modded versions of the game. I highly recommend playing the Community Edition over standard release at this point as the community has created about the best version of the game that can be made.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original XCOM, or missed the boat and wants to see what the fuss is about. Warning: This game is pretty difficult, and so far I have yet to muddle my way through a full campaign on normal. Though I play on iron-man, so it's difficult to tell how well I'd do save-scumming. If you're unsure, check out some videos or take full advantage of the refund policy - but don't let this one pass you by if you like the idea of defending against a cold-war era alien invasion.			"

												Play balancing has a long way to go in this game before it will be worth playing. Don't buy it until they have released a few patches to fix it. Alien psychic abilities are way too powerful and you have no way to defend against them. Expert marksmen will miss more often than not, even with a high % chance to hit. And the worst (possibly a glitch, I'm not sure) is loading a saved game only to have the situation different than when you saved. The worst example, in my own experience, was when I had cleared an alien base. All except the last room. (the command room) Decided to take a break, saved my game and exited. When I came back and reloaded, suddenly my troops were surrounded by aliens that hadn't been there when I saved. I couldn't continue the fight because my soldiers were automatically killed every time I reloaded. This and a number of other balancing and glitch issues make the game no fun to play. A perfectly good playthrough can quickly and easily be ruined by bad code and balancing. Hopefully they fix these things soon because the game has promise, it's just not where it should be yet.			"

												I played the original UFO defence back in the grim and dark days of the mid and late 90's.  This, is what X-COM should be, should have been, not the flashy remake Sid Mierer's did.  For me, that one was all show and no go, even with the expacs.  This however, feels like X-COM, and I am fighitng for my life as hard in it as I was in UFO Defence.  This is what I remember, the fear, and, the fustration.			"

												============================================XENONAUGHTS============================================Overview:On the face of it Xenonaughts is a high quality 2D planetary defense game with stratergy and minigame elements with a little story telling all thrown in and mixed with a heavy influence from the Xcom Series and perhaps a bit of a steep price tag for an indie game attatched.What the store doesnt tell is that the actual gameplay is a fantastic weave of impeccible timing, forced strategic and tactical improvisation and improvement, and delightful frustation when your elite squad wipes out for no apparent reason other than ""better guns"" which will often cause you to swear vengence upon the alien scu- ""liberators"" the developers have done a fantastic job with this number which i shall go into further detail below, fair warning though.                                                               !!!!WALLS OF TEXT!!!!                                                              You have been warned============================================The Guts:Simply a fantastic game, I have been gaming for a little over 10 years now and I almost exclusively play stratergy and/or survival games, and of all the stratergy games I have played this has to be the most perfectly timed and tailored one fo them all at no point are you ever truely able to outgun the enemy your often outnumbered and if you turtle up one grenade or well placed lizard thing and your squads dead forcing you to rethink and restratergise without overwhelming you add the fact that if you dont plan and execute your stratergy and tactics right or do something stupid you cna lose your entire squad (and the alien victory conditions) adds an element of survival which automatically triggers the ""KEEP EVERYONE ALIVE!"" switch in me keeps me coming back after a rage quit form losing my entire squad (and not saving :P hey i refuse to accept a wipeout!).the Pacing is also fantastic at no point are you ever really given too much to handle if you know what your doing (excluding the terror missions I failed everyone because of those *Censored tangent* reapers, the fact that both you and the aliens can build and attack bases also just putrs the cherry on the cake for me simply amazing the thrill i get when i discover an alien base, the first time i did i literally shouted out YEA I GOT YOU NOW YOU ALIEN MOTHER *censored* ... course it was 1 am and i got told off but still xDto be fair there are a couple issues, 1 would be the graphics BUT it IS an indie game but if your into the more modern games it may not be summin you can get around, personally? i loved it, simple but detailed enough to let you know whats what and tell the differance between an alien lizard and a rock and perfectly fits the top down stratergy feel for me, the second is bugs there are a couple which are frequent such as aliens shooting through walls or the psionics unnerving your men from start to finish regardless of location and distance BUT both of those and much much more are covered in the community edition which i have started playing and that just adds that extra little something to really finish off the game.============================================The Meat of the matter:the game itself is split into 3 distinct parts, the first is the tactical display, a screen with a selection of tabs ranging from geoscape (live view of the planet) to base planning, research military assests such as squads vehicles hangers etc all the way to a alien encyclopedia (did i spell that right?) the 2nd part is minigames which in itself is a novel but entertaining little piece fo frustration that i have never been able to pull of yet (but that may have something to do with the single fighter in use at any given time) where you cna either auto resolve or play yourself, the third is the meat of the game for me, ground combat a classic top down view of the map where you can use the terrain to your advantage and i reccomend you do some fo the enemies only think 2 dimensionally which is fantastic for the sniper up on the third floor but terrible for the heavy round the corner from him about to be eaten alive============================================Conclusion:I cannot praise this game enough the developers have done a simply fantastic job that i havent seen anyone else do so far and the fact that they are putting some community mods into the next patch as official parts of the game just instills so much confidence in them i am really excited to see what they do next.my advice to anyone who loves stratergy, alien invasion, or base defense there WILL be something for you here, if your a fan of indie games or high quality design this is DEFINATELY something for you.

												I'll try to make this simple for you.Liked the original X-COM: UFO Defense? Then get this game.Never played the original X-COM: UFO Defense, but enjoy turn-based strategic games like Chess, Jagged Alliance, etc.? Get this game.Liked X-COM: Enemy Unknown (2012) but felt it had flaws in terms of strategic depth? Then get this game.Liked X-COM: Enemy Uknown (2012), but thought it was too hard? Don't get this game.Thought X-COM: Enemy Uknown (2012) was too ugly? Don't get this game.You're looking a very fine turn-based strategy squad base assault with base construction elements. It's slow, even a little dry sometimes, but definitely atmospheric. You'll need some wits and a whole lot of patience, but damn is it rewarding. Especially recommended for those who liked the original X-COM, because it is basically the remake we hoped we'd get in 2012. It's easy to compare XCOM:EU to Xenonauts, but it's also a little unfair: EU tried to do something new and accessible, and actually delivered quite well. In fact the only real complaint I had with the game was that it had bad support from devs, but that's because it had a console release and those don't patch easily. Regardless, Xenonauts comes out on top easily compared to EU, simply due to the superior basic design which was, for the most part, copied from the original XCOM.Some significant changes from the original:- Interceptor battles are now a mini-game with significant depth. An auto-resolve mode exists, but it is now actually a fun and worthwhile strategic element of the game (well beyond rock/paper/scissors);- Troops can now easily be organized by class equipment sets;- Workshops aren't profitable! Money management is very tricky;- During combat, HUD/Interface changes allow for easier troop and time-unit management;- During combat, obstacles are calculated in an intuitive and accurate way (something that looks to use virtual voxels to calculate whether the line of fire is obstructed. Very effective!);- There are now shields, which have 80HP (compared to a soldier's average starting HP of around 50) and can be combined with a pistol or a stun-baton;Etc.Concluding, for those familiar with the original XCOM, this is an interesting alternative frmo one perspective, or a viable upgrade from another. Personally, I consider it the latter.I score it 8.5/10 and consider it one of the best games I've ever played, notwithstanding the fact that it doesn't have the virtue of originality. Nonetheless, its execution is extremely refined and it's gameplay is enormously interesting.			"

												This game is very much indeed a true remake of the true x-com series.It gives you everything X-com 1 have, and adds in alot of the features from the new x-com aswell.Also they have improved the story setting aswell as making the game userfriendly.Also vehicle section is more thought around, than in the original series.Graphics, ambient sounds and all, are very well done. Did I mention that the story is very well written?Only downside I could find, was that I could wish for more research and maps. But I recond that will be added later, or through mods. Could be me that is being picky, its around 40ish researchable things or more. But i want more.Highly recommend this game over the new X-Com. The scale of the game gets into its true form since its not for the x-box. "

												In love with the Xcom series, but finished them, well, then this just might be the game for you. It has the feel of the first couple of Xcom games, but nowhere near the graphics og Xcom enemy unknown. However, if you're not in it for the graphics, this is a fine game indeed.Pros:- Same nice Xcom athmosphere that many of us have come to love- It matters what you choose to research, and it's not as linar as Xcom- Turn based tactics on level with XcomCons:- Maps get a bit too repetitive. About on level with Xcom series- Limitied replay value. The same thing happens every time- Dated graphics			"

												This game is actually pretty great. I may be alone in this, but I have *not* played any of the original XCOM games. I've played the recent 3D remakes (both of them), but none of the originals. Despite that I enjoyed this a lot more than the two modern XCOM games I played. It just felt more strategic and difficult. Yes, the graphics suck. But I've played much worse.I'd recommend this game not only to fans of the original XCOM games (that should be a given) but also to anyone who played the recent newer XCOM games and felt they were too easy, especially if they don't mind simple graphics.

												The best darn $25 dollars I've spent, easily. Originally, I'm sure the developers thought they were making a xcom clone, and to be fair, they've tried their damnedest to do just that. But just playing 70 hours before its release, I can say they've made a true game, worthy of its own merit, with no need for the acclaim that comes from the backs of giants. You get what I'm saying? I don't think Chryssalids anymore, I think reapers. Sebilian and Caesan role off my tongue more easily than sectoid or mutan (whatever its called). Xenonauts is a true alien invasion simulator, with all the inherent learning curves and complexity therein. You pick the placement of your first base, and go on from there, with some great tooltips for your first time round. Speaking of which, you will fail. Try as you might, there's a detail you overlooked, and you'll have a base attacked and destroyed by the aliens, or your chinook will be shot down after taking out an alien base. Something will happen. And you'll want to keep going. Not immediately, you understand, you build sentimental attachments to your crew, but after a while, you'll get than xenonauts itch.			"

												214 hours.It took me 214 in-game hours to beat this game.It was boring and tedious, it was a constant wading through a full hoard of bugs, and in the end this game became a chore.That's my experience with this game.I never want to see this game again.However, this is a good game.This game is a full-on realistic approach to an alien invasion scenario, that blows both the original X-Com and X-Com: Enemy Unknown out of the water. Once it's done, it will be awesome.I say ""once it's done"", because this game was released back when it was very much still in the beta stage. That was a year ago, and the dev team is still working diligently at fixing both bugs and crashes to this day.I got stuck having to play the ""legacy version"", with half of the sprites for the endgame missing. I cheated by increasing the game mength to a 200 hour marathon run, and I also had to restart the game 2-3 times over because I was still playing the beta....so I both love and hate this game. You will love this game.Just don't forget to save at least once before and after your every turn.			"

I loved the original X-COM games. This is literally a direct copy, with updated graphics. There was almost nothing new or creative used in this game - and I mean that in a good way. The original formula worked, but it was just dated as far as the actual software. This game is awesome in keeping that formula alive.Pros:+Awesome, addicting X-COM esque gameplay+Better global management part of the game (play other than when in battle)Cons:-Price is a bit steep-While it would be a gamble, if done right it would have been nice for them to make it slightly more of their own game-Text can be thick, and while I want to read the lore and all the details, I find myself skimming. I just wish it were more conciseIf you loved the old X-COM game(s), you will not be disapointed, although I would wait for a sale since part 2 is on the horizon. "

												[20$ tier Kickstarter backer]Yet another x-com remake, this time in realistic-cartoon art-style, streamlined, simplified and with tycoon mechanics being completely cut-out.Ground combat is pretty standard and since standard is what makes this genre, that means it's good (unlike XCOM, which plays more like JSRPG than TBT). But with smaller scope of the whole game and cutting out of a lot of mechanics from x-com, ground combat is the thing which you will do a lot, so much, that you'll start to use airstrike button to skip it. Which makes lack of auto-resolve button on some other mission-types, like terror, slightly annoying. Chasing aliens on the big map with lots of civilians and slow-thinking AI starts to wear thin after 30th hour. With new balance and items, you won't be playing with squads of highly trained army-men till the endgame, but with lots of spec-ops assault doods holding riot shield and throwing grenades everywhere, since it's extremely effective.Meta-game is significantly shrank, compared to the x-com, tech tree is smaller and manufacturing is not constant concern, but used for single time upgrades. Instead of Lord of War simulator, now your whole economy is based on governmental dotations and looting crash-lands. With it all storage management is absent, everything which is not falling in line with developer's vision is automatically sold. Using alien\civillian weapons is possible only during missions and with great penalty, which kinda creates negative possibility space. Same goes for prisoners, everyone is auto-executed, all bodies are destroyed; no more supplying disneyland xenopark with new live exhibits. Even the bases do not become outdated, but automatically upgrade themselves for free. Air combat features new mini-game, which should be improvement over x-com, but it's so convoluted, cluttered with unreadable GUI and overall unnecessary, that you can just use auto-resolve all the time and fly in bigger squadrons.Art-style isn't striking or beautiful, but it's that clear, realistic cartoonish look, which is often used in 2d indie tycoon-games, so it makes it peculiar to see it in the different genre. Game works fine in UHD UWS Surround by using pillar-boxing. It's kinda pity to lose all that additional space, but as far as i can remember it works just out of the box. Though it's easier to scroll with keys than with mouse edge scroll because of that.Technically game isn't in perfect condition, some events are causing crashes, so better to save more often. But overall at least nothing is game-breaking.Overall it's very streamlined and simplified x-com with not much new mechanics, but it is serviceable and utilitarian, despite being buggy. And most important — unlike XCOM it's not a soapy console movie in the completely different genre, all-while being equally\more buggy but from rich AAA publisher churning out DLCs and not small crumbling indie development team.Will now wait for aquaxenauts bug-fix-re-skin-expand game.

												I've played: the original three X-Com games from Microprose; the re-done X-Com: Enemy Unknown (and the DLC and expansion packs) from 2K Games; and Xenonauts.If you're looking for a true spiritual successor to the original Microprose version of X-com, look no further than this game.  If you're familiar with the game mechanics, you'll easily adapt to this, once you figure out the way the various weapons and aliens work.Make no mistake: this game is harder than Enemy Unknown.  It's also a lot less visually polished.  Still, the graphics are perfectly acceptable as 2D sprites (and also far more moddable).  Chances are, if you're considering this game, bleeding-edge graphics aren't your major concern.  You're (hopefully) in it for the gameplay.  Admittedly, I haven't played this one for a little while, but when I last played, there were only a few ""cheap"" items that appeared in the game, all of which could be modded around if you cared to.  I gather the developer has changed some of this since then, but I haven't followed up on the development in a bit.  The main cheap aspect was the mind control and other mental powers that aliens get later in the game, mostly because (A) humans didn't get psionics, and (B) they generally had little to no defense against it.  But, as I said, that's all moddable and it's up to you to decide if you want to change it (as with many other aspects).  I'd say the game is definitely worth the $25 you'll pay on Steam, but keep an eye on GOG.com and Steam both for sales.  The game does go on sale periodically, and it's even more bang for your buck if you pay under $25.  Even so, this is one of the few newer games that I'd say is appropriately priced at $25.			"

												I do think Xenonauts is, in technical terms, a very well made game. However from a personal perspective I didn't enjoy it all that much.Xenonauts is tedious. Most battles tend to feel the same which is in part due to the minimal number of lackluster maps (mods may at least provide some more variety).Losing is extreamly punishing. When a team is wiped not only is funding lost but also any of the very expensive gear the team may have been carrying. A very motivated player could probably manage this and even find it engaging. Others will be bored by it.The game does at least provide far more depth than the modern revitalisation of XCOM.			"

Even if you enjoyed the new one and want to see what was cut from the original games to make the new one, it's worth a look.If however you didn't like the new x-com because it was too complicated.

												Xenonauts is a great game. I can't stop playing it! The old school XCOM buffs will love playing it for sure. Xenonauts also runs great on my Linux (Linuxmint 17.3) Windows 10 and Window 7 computers. The game play is very stable without the mods on Windows 10. And I have yet to crash it in the 75 plus hours of game play. There have been allot reviews and Youtubes on Xenonauts game play. All I can say is the game is to tough to beat on any setting! The Steam Game tips at the link below are a good read for starting points for new players. Critical -- I built three bases to begin with good coverage a cross America's, Midlde East and Soviet Union. Make sure the bases give good worldwide fighter coverage. Critical -- Get the aircraft reseach going right away. Build hanger bays and if you have to BUY more fighters do it !  (I use six bays per base.)   Critical -- Once the game starts it is a race to to research, build aircraft, build facilities, build or research weapons and armor. If you don't the enemy will over take world countries, bomb cities and then you will lose funding which will end your career as a commander. :)There are weapons which will take the enemy down in one shot! But it will take time to aquire and finish the reaseach! Once you have the right weapons both air and ground battles move right along. :)   Tips at the link.

												I hesitate to call Xenonauts a spiritial successor to one of the greatest games of all time - UFO: Enemy Unknown (X-COM: UFO Defense in the USA) - rather instead, it's purely a spiritual remake.The earth has come under attack from aliens, and you manage a PMC tasked with fighting them. The nations of the world fund the company, and based on how you defend each country the funding can rise or fall. This is done from a map view of the earth, showing your base, and craft as they start to appear. To begin, just a few small scout craft arrive, easily shot down. If you intercept the craft over land, sometimes it crash lands, forming a crash site you can investigate. Alternatively, the craft sometimes lands and you can send a dropship to the location. Once the dropship arrives at the site you enter an isometric view where you can move your units, and shoot at any aliens you encounter. This section is turn based, and the amount of movement you can make is determined by how many Time Units each unit has. Once you have cleared the site, you can recover alien technologies and take them back to your base to research, leading to the ability to manafacture new items. There are many other elements to both the management and tactical section of the game, which I won't spoil here.If you're looking for a modern take or an evolution on this forumla, look instead into the excellent 2012 Fixaris reboot, XCOM: Enemy Unknown. This is a very different experience however, and I'd still throughly recommend trying the original. However Xenonauts now presents an interesting new third option. I've recommended the original to people, only to see them never really get into it thanks largely to the outdated interface. Xenonauts allows you to experiece the brilliance of the original, but tuned to remove those frustrations.For example, one of the least enjoyable parts of the original was surely the inventory management. While I love the base management overall, manually replacing every last clip, medkit, rocket, grenade wore thin pretty quickly, especially when most of the items were cheap enough to never really be a concern. In Xenonauts, this is thankfully gone for most of the mundane consumables. Other areas which have been simplified include reloading, and using grenades. In X-COM, using a grenade was a series of actions, removing it from your belt, putting it in your hand, pulling the pin/setting the timer, throwing it. Each took a small amount of time units, and it was entirely possible to pull the pin, only to realise you didn't have enough time units left to throw it. While this did invoke exactly the feeling of panic it was no doubt supposed to, it was largely just frustrating. In Xenonauts all of this is just replaced with a single action with a single time unit cost. To my tastes, they developers have thankfully only simplified elements which probably needed it - it certainly doesn't feel dumbed down.It might just be me, but Xenonauts does feel a little easier than UFO was. However, this really is no bad thing - UFO was punishingly difficult, and it wasn't unusual for newcomers to be in real trouble before even their first funding review. In Xenonauts, easy mode should allow new players to get a good long feel for the game before they start ramping up the difficulty.If you loved UFO, or you enjoy classic tactical games, if you like retro graphics style, you'll most likely enjoy this greatly. It's such a closely tied remake of UFO it almost feels like I'm reviewing that, rather than Xenonauts - either way, I cannot recommend either one highly enough.			"

												A phenominal X-Com remake that overstays its welcome.This crowd-funded game has everything I look for in an x-com remake, and if you prefer classic x-com with TU's and stun rods and destructable terrain to the newer, friendlier, class-based game, this is the remake for you. UFO interceptions become their own fun little minigame, base building (and defending) is just like X-Com original, and the turn-based tactical gameplay, while not the same, is very close to the original, with less of a budget for explosions. If you're interested in this game, you know what you want, and this game will deliver it.One thing I should mention that really hurt my enjoyment, though, was how much of an unfriendly slog this game is, due 100% to its economy. Provided you keep all your funding nations happy, you'll make enough money for base upkeep, but not really enough for expansion, research, and building new weapons to replace your old ones. You can make some money (but gain no alien resources) by destroying downed UFO's from the world map, or you can send your soldiers on ground missions to make about twice as much money. While this ensures that you'll want frequent ground missions (that is, the whole point of the game) the fact that UFO hulls are one of the few objects that aren't subject to destructable terrain means that each time, you'll have to breach and clear UFO's through their own single-path construction, which is the least fun thing, and takes the most time. Every alien bridge is accessible from only one direction, often through two doors that are placed so that anyone on the bridge can get reflex fire on any soldiers entering. Psi isn't restricted to seen targets only, like the original x-com, and alien psykers will always stay in their invulnerable UFO bridges, and there's no psi defense like the original x-com, so you basically get soldiers berzerking and falling under alien control with no defense right up until you win the mission. All in all, this game took me 77 hours. I was done with the core gameplay at maybe 45 or 50.Buy it if you like X-Com or Jagged Alliance; no other remakes have done it for me (the newer friendlier X-Com has excellent gameplay to be sure, it's just not the same kind of excellent gameplay). It may be sad that fans keep chasing the X-Com (or JA) dragon, but there's a reason for that: They're brilliant games.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. If your into X-com you will love this game. You have a lot more freedom in  the game compared to x-com.  Most of the time when you shoot down a UFO you can wipe it out with ground forces or just bomb it and get paid for it. It's very slow paced in the way that you have to move your soilders very slowly and point them in the right direction. You can be right next to a bad guy and not even know it, which at times is annoying. It's more tatical than X-com, and I like that you can change your soilders roles at anytime. Some roles end up being pointless, but it's nice to be able to do that. I will say the game is very unforgiving the first round or two till you get some armor. Other than that, it's a different type of x-com experince. There are some differences however,  you might find youself being able to do more than just 2 attacks in xenonauts and though as I said before you can change the role of your soilders you still have to find what best suits them.

												This far out performs XCOM and even the newest ones because of its depth of play and unrelenting difficulty to survive. IF you are up for a challenge than this is your game, if your up for replaying the same level 3-20 times to get it right this is your game. IF your up for replaying that same level 20 times and you still can't do it without losing 2-3 squad members thats pretty much the best your going to do. The only drawbacks, if you pick up alien weapons you can use them but with huge penalties and they dont go to your inventory which is strange. And the explosives I wish the C4 got more powerful because honestly levelling buildings is entirely too fun.			"

												This game is the remake of our beloved X-com that we've been waiting.-All the things I always felt X-com was missing this game has in spades with a nice shiny art style in beautiful 2D sprites.  -The game has sounds and a soundtrack that help build up tension while your troops on tactical missions that keep you hoping the next corner is clear as you round it with just enough movement left before that soldier is stuck.  -UFOpidia? Perfectly done and a modding comunity has crafted addons that will further expand upon what was presented in game if you desire more.-Greatly expanded air combat gameplay where it is its own mini game if you wish to skillfully down higher grade craft not to mention you can reasurch far more aircraft than any other Xcom style game that I'm aware of.  No more T1 fighter then the T2 late game and T3 is an all in one transport.. now you have many times more to choose from and they are rather role specific which keeps them fun and interesting as you realise you're not doing direct line upgrades but rather expanding your arsenel with something that tacles a new role.-Body armor?  This game decided that each new suit of armor shouldn't nessisarly replace all prior armor but again fits a nice role so you might wish a few of each suit type if you want to take full advantage of their skills.If you enjoyed any of the X-com games and even the most recent you will find this game by far the best X-com like expirence you have ever had.  With a modding comunity adding more content and regular patching still streaming in I can easy recomend this game to anyone who enjoys this style of game.			"

												I've finally hit 100+ hrs on this game, for me that is the milestone that says I should write a review.PrenoteActually had this game on the wishlist for a long time, mostly because the Store screenshots are -how to put this politely- a bit subpar. Compared to XCOM that is. Atleast, that's what I thought at the time. Including the inherited assumption that this game is -probably- just another X-COM wannabe.Boy, was I wrong. Not only do I enjoy this game madly (with Mods) - it has even made me want to dabble with mods. That is creating mods, not just using them. How come? Well, let's explain that right now.The GameThis is one of those games that you can play in sessions (casually) or play in one go (hardcore). You can save at any one time and exit. It plays during the late '70s with the Cold War raging silently over the globe. You're the commander in charge of an operation with the aim of putting a stop to the alien threat. You can think X-COM, but technically it is also Jagged Alliance 2, even though it never refers to it. Really though, JA2. You get to build bases, modify the bases as you see fit, recruit engineers/scientists and soldiers. The latter from all over the world (depending on the Mods), including stats like previous Regiments and if they've seen any conflicts. Your soldiers will rank up gradually, retain their kill counts etc, are customizable with different gears (depending on tech & Mods) and classes, and can be renamed. Your planes will need to take down the aerial forces of the aliens so your groundtroops can recover the remains (through vicious battle).TLDR+ can always Save/Exit+ '70s era+ X-COM / Jagged Alliance 2+ customizable base / soldiers+ fairly realistic technologies & tactics+ fairly intuitive base building / GUI+ rewarding/useful upgrades & options+ compelling gameplay & progressionDownsidesNo game is perfect. So, what does this game do wrong or what does it neglect?Well.. I did spot a few typo's in both the game and in the coding. You also want to Save every now and then as the game _can_ CTD (it's not much a problem if you always manually do ground battles as the game will autosave at the beginning and ending of it - but it can become unnerving if you've done an hour of customizing all your soldiers and the game CTD's). You can play without Mods, but really - you want to play with Mods. Recovery statistics are shoddy with math. Ground battles _can_ become boring (however, Mods that add groundbattle maps can relieve a bit of that boredness - although playing in sessions could work just aswell). Aliens are ruthless, just like in XCOM - if you get upset about that then this isn't the game for you.TLDR- the odd typo- can CTD, so save-a-lot- needs Mods to be fun- shoddy math on Recovery screen- groundbattles can become boring- expect ruthless alien resistanceJudgement DayIf you don't like Xeno, their invasions, their abducting of cows, their offensive smiles as they descend upon _your_ house and set the neighborhood on fire - then the time has come for you to take up arms and join Commander Cable. Cable knows what is good for you and that is dead Xeno scum. You heard him! Now march to that store and get that Rifle out of the closet so you can join his army! Dismissed, soldier!			"

												In my opinion, OpenXCom is still the best planetary defense game out there, followed closely by Terror from the Deep. Now with that said, Goldhawk has done a better job of capturing the magic formula than anyone else. In fact, no other X Com clone comes as close to perfection as Xenonauts. Needless to say, I cannot recommend Xenonauts enough. Not only is it a far superior product to the newer X Com reboots, but it's the greatest planetary defense game since X Com Apocalypse.			"

												Best remake of the old XCOM game out there, incuding the reboots and sequels. Veterans of XCOM will feel right at home, but newcomers will find it a bit unwelcoming.The algorithm they use for pacing is great at keeping the game tense and challenging, but has the downside of that you never feel like you're getting ahead. You unlock new weapons just for the aliens to start using armor. You unlock new armor, and the aliens equip bigger weapons, etc. "

												This game is everything I could possibly want in a game. Awesome turn based squad battles. Alien invasion storyline with an X-Files feel. Base Management. And you can name your soldiers whatever you want!! I have been waiting for a game with turn based squad battles like this since Warhammer 40,000 Chaos Gate, a DOS game I played as a kid. This blows the new XCOM games out of the water and into dust. Buy it, Play it, Love it!!! Its freaking great!			"

												If you liked the original X-Com, this game is a much more faithful update than the Firaxis games which were produced about the same time Xenonauts was released.  If you miss the turn based combat and base management aspects of the game, this one is worth a try.  There are some new/improved aspects worth mentioning such as the air combat game which is slightly more involved than in the original X-Com, and some of the penny-ante management has been dispensed with, such as you are always assumed to have adequate ammunition for your basic weaponry.  If you enjoyed the original, then you'll find plenty to enjoy with this game, plus improved graphics.			"

Early Access Review
								Beginning with the conclusion: If you enjoyed the original XCOM, buy this game immediately. It is a faithful modern remake. It is not precisely the same--and every single change I have noticed is for the better. It provides additional control over some matters (such as UFO interception) that used to be purely automatic. Conversely, it automates some matters that used to be purely tedious, e.g., you are afforded an infinite supply of conventional infantry equipment. Like the third game, Apocalypse, you can view soldier stats prior to hiring. Like the original, soldiers are likely to die in one hit before you develop new armor, while aliens are noticeably resistant to less than concentrated fire. An ""airstrike"" option lets you deal with crashed UFOs when you cannot afford to send in the ground troops, and still nets a minor gain.Comparing it to the AAA title is more difficult, as it has virtually nothing in common with that that it does not have with the original. The graphics are modern and pleasing but most resemble higher-resolution versions of Apocalypse's sprites, maintaining a mildly retro feeling.  While soldiers have ""roles,"" these are less classes and more changeable, customizable equipment loadouts, allowing you to quickly change equipment according to any established preference. Soldiers gain stats with experience, but do not gain unique skills.			"

												Let me start this review off by saying that this game is the spiritual successor to X-COM all of us fans of the original have been waiting for. Now, before all the Firaxis fans come out of the woodwork to make angry remarks, I have nothing against XCOM - from what I've heard it's a very good game in its own right; however from what I've seen (yes, I haven't yet had a chance to play it myself - yet - although the opinions I've heard/read and videos I've watched all seem to agree on this), the Firaxis remake changed the formula that made the original great into a more streamlined experience, that had been tailored to appeal to a larger audience - thus removing some of what made X-COM so enjoyable for some of us.However, Xenonauts has very much kept the formula the same. The basic gameplay mechanics are spot-on compared to what the original X-COM was like, except with some much needed touch-ups. First and foremost is the game resolution and interface - no longer will you need to suffer with an 800x600 resolution window and a clunky UI where the buttons don't reveal much (""What does this do? Oh I just placed some primed C4 at my soldier's feet""), and the interface taking up a third of the screen! Xenonauts has really improved these aspects and honestly, I really think that this alone makes Xenonauts worth considering, due to the sheer increase in playability that has resulted by actually having a nice, clean interface that didn't come straight out of the 1990s.Secondly, there are the combat improvements. They've really changed up the air combat in this game from what was in the original, and although I acknowledge that it's not to everyone's taste, it's certainly a lot closer to it than what X-COM's air combat was like, to be quite honest! All you really need to take into account are the manoeuvres (roll left/right and afterburner, primarily) for each plane and once you've gotten the hang of timing them and avoiding enemy fire, you'll be dropping those UFOs like flies in no time! (Although, don't mistake this for a lack of difficulty - some of the UFOs that get sent down to earth can be quite punishing!)As for the ground combat, not all that much is different from the original X-COM: soldiers are nothing more than fodder (don't grow attached and restart the game if you lose some; they're all expendable and you should always have a couple of Chinooks' worth rotating in and out of active duty, so you've always got some skilled backup soldiers in case a mission goes bad) who can all be killed by a single well-placed round by an alien if they're unlucky (it's always a ""lucky shot"" if the aliens happen to get you - ALWAYS ;) ), so using cover and smoke is very important. On a similar note, one of the things that Goldhawk have added to ground combat is a suppression system, where if your rounds miss the aliens (or vice versa) but either hit their cover or whizz by near them, they will become suppressed; meaning that they will drop to a crouch, will be unable to perform reaction fire in your turn and will have reduced TUs (Time Units) in their following turn.As for cons, I must say there aren't many. I'd say the only real cons are are there's not a HUGE variety of the randomly-assigned nationalities - although there's still quite a lot - and former units that help add some background to your soldiers, as well as the variety of generated maps being rather more limited than what was in the original X-COM. Although again, this isn't a great issue unless you replay the game a lot (but then again, who wouldn't?). However, due to the fact that modding this game has been made to be quite easy, there are community-made mods out there that remedy both of these cons.In summary, quite frankly I'm no longer able to recommend the original X-COM to people, simply because THIS exists, and that it's regular X-COM, but with some really nice improvements. If you've been hanging out for X-COM but want something a touch less dated, then definitely pick this up! I'm honestly very happy I Kickstarted this game a while back and I consider the extra money I sink into the game by buying gift copies for friends to be money well spent.			"

												Basically, if you liked X-COM and/or similar games, this is one that you must have. Compared to the new X-COM games, Xenonauts simply has more depth added to it and pretty much has everything you'd want for an X-COM clone. Don't let the 2D graphics fool you, this game offers everything that's lacking in the new X-COM: Vehicles, ability to customize loadouts further and mix between classes, an inventory system, and best of all, a more involving geoscape with air battles that offers you means to not only take command on the ground, but achieve air supremacy as well, if you know what you're doing, of course.Not to mention the excellent support from the devs, even for the Linux version of the game.

												If you liked original X-COM, you will like this; it is almost exactly the same but with a much nicer UI.The cold-war setting adds an interesting flavour, and the overall feeling while playing is very tense. There are a few minor bugs I've noticed with the UI, but nothing showstopping. The only weak points I see are that the tactical locations are all very similar - they're using prebuilt tile maps and not randomly generating locations - it breaks the immersion a little bit when you  realize you've played the same map on a previous play. The dog-fighting mini game isn't very fun and you don't seem to gain anything by not using Auto Resolve. The Civilian AI could be a better too, as they seem to just run around in random patterns without any real objective or tactics. Keeping yourself in the black seems a little bit too difficult as well - but they provide full modding ability if you want to tweak any of the games parameters to tune the difficulty.Those points aside, I really love this game. I enjoy approaching it like a roleplaying game - naming all my soldiers and coming up with Cold-War-Esque code names for my bases, dropships, and vehicles. Highly reccomended for fans of deep strategy or tactical games.			"

												The game I've been searching for ages. Since 2000 there has been so few of these really. Original X-com but updated. I've forgotten how much fun it is to individually equip tens of soldiers. Ground battles are as dangerous as they should be, air battles are innovative. Reminds be a bit of star wars rebellion space battles which was an excellent concept. But it's faster and more exciting.Realism is there and it's not been sacrificed in order to maintain game balance. Your tank is cheap and overpowering. If not very accurate. I've yet to discover many aspects of the game, I'm not googling stuff to gain advantage so I don't want to share my other guesses about the tactics. I might be wrong after all.There can be many additions for the game and from the start screen I understand that it is highly moddable. Which means a high replay value. I'm sure modders will add many fascinating stuff.In short, I highly recommend if you are a turn based strategy fan. If you are new to the gendre you might find it a bit old school but trust me, you will love it after you spend 15 mins in your first pass and will want to start again the game.It's not for casual gamer obviously. Even though it's not very hardcore, you still need some time to go through all the way and you need to be a patient wolf. It's not a fast pace game.			"

												Totally Addictive!This game is in many aspects a clone of the original XCOM.Which is a good thing!Few games offer this kind of tactical gameplay: Jagged Alliance comes to mind, the rather crappy UFO Afterlight series, Silent Storm .... Of course there is the Firaxis XCOM, which is a really good game and I really liked it. But it is different from the original XCOM in many ways, and this is not.Xenonauts gives you the basic XCOM experience with a graphical update and an improved interface. The game is very playable and it does not suffer from any crashes whatsoever.There is mod support and a lot of mods are available.One word regarding the difficulty level: When playing on veteran and above you will probably get your ♥♥♥ kicked. Basically after the first month it becomes very hard to do missions without losing men. Unless you are really experienced with the game and you know how to raid the larger UFOs.			"

												Amazing game, I feel like I am playing the original xcoms but 1000% better.  Its like the new Xcom with graphics not as good, but you can have multiple bases and there isnt any of that horrible camara angle crap on kills (anyone else notice how you could tell if you hit based on the camara angle you got after a shot). Plus time units are back so every move counts.  And even on normal its actually hard and either you win a mission with 2 deaths or you lose.  Feel free to save and re-play a mission 30 times, you can do it and not die but its hard even still.  The ufo fights are awesome, depth is good, and with the add-ons it will take time to get old.  Wish this was out before i bought the new xcom, beat it, got bored and stopped playing after a week... 9 outta 10 for me (wish they let you rotate the camara, but they do a good job with see-through objects).

If your looking for something challenging and in my opinion better than XCOM, welcome to the Xenonauts, an all round excellent Planet Defence Simulator that unfairly punishes you for the smalliest tactical errors, Enough said ;).

												I have never played the old 1990s X-Com this was based on, nor was I a really big supporter of the Indie game scene. My attention was directed towards Xenonauts, after a chance splurge had me acquire the new Firaxis X-Com, and while I found that game fun, I wanted something more challenging. Something mixing the depth of Jagged Alliance 2, with the concepts found in X-Com. And I found that in Xenonauts.After setting down my cash for this game after it's release, I have found myself hooked on it. The game has a great challenge to it. and I find the setting choice (Early 80s Cold War) to be very unique given most games of this type focus on the near future (201X) Earth. If X-Com: Enemy Unknown is a fun, console-ish romp, Xenonauts is the thinking man's version. You are facing a constantly mounting war against aliens, where you feel the underdog. You have to manage very limited finances, as well as maintain success in both ground and air engagements. You have to plan your base deployment, and do it very sparingly. You will quickly find yourself running out of money in this game if you aren't careful. You can also find your best men slaughtered by bad choices in ground tactics or your entire aerial squadron grounded for three days of repairs if you make a bad call while aliens ransack the world.This game is not brutal, but it doesn't pull it's punches. It reminds me of the old days of gaming, when PC graphics power had a ""ceiling"", so games had to focus on depth and gameplay. Xenonauts doesn't have the prettiest of graphics, but graphics is not it's selling point nor should the game be judged on such.My only complaint regarding the game, is that you can't use any successful profit-making skills in it, and while this has been addressed by Mods, my attitude towards Mods is skeptical, at best.I highly recommend Xenonauts, as it is a very amazing game given the limited resources the developer had. I'm now looking towards Indie Games, cause of what I saw Goldhawk Interactive do with it's Kickstarter campaign.I hope Xenonauts gets an expansion or some new additions, and that it's future is *NOT* left in the hands of User-Made Mods.

												I played all the original x-com series and this is pretty good. however it has some balance problems and air combat can be quite repetative and slow. I just rage quit my latest game after turning up at a terror site to find at least 8 aliens stuffed into the corner of the map with me along with a bunch of blokes who were sitting ducks for the wierd things with fangs, so that number went up every turn. and as I didnt have laser weapons yet, each one would need multiple shots to take them down. even if they hit of course. the % chance of hitting something is wildly optimistic.so 4 turns in its obvious that this mission is toast, i've no chance. i could try and grind it out but i would loose all my men, leaving me turning to random soldier generator and its list of people with huge strength and accuracy but with so little bravery they drop their weapons and run off like a big girl if an alien so much as coughs on the same map, or incredibly brave people who have so little time units they have to run along at the back of the group trying to catch up like an asthmatic fat kit or with so little health they croak when they get hit by a so much as a glancing blow off of a nerf gun.or i could pack up the soldiers i have been training from that bunch of schlubs into an elite fighting unit and surrender and run off like the french army whenever they see so much of a menacing looking bratwurst appear on the horizon. And by doing that I'll loose a whole bunch of funding and possibly the region, so ending the whole game a bit earlier.i chose ragequit.again the laser weapon thing is annoying. you can pick them up off the aliens and use them, however when you end the mission they are automatically sold. WTF? Who in their right mind would automatically sell weaponry that a) you could use and b) was better than what you currently had? You can almost imagine the Python-esque conversation that would happen back in the barracks over that one...			"

												Wow!  There have been a ton of games that have tried to do what X-COM: UFO Defense (or UFO: Enemy Unknown) succeeded so well with back in '94.  A scope that seems global, and you have soldiers that may well only make it through one mission alive.  Casualties are expected, and you feel like you are engaged in a true war with the aliens.2012's XCOM by Firaxis is fantastic--it plays well, it's easy to pick up, and it's fun.  Still, to me that game felt more like an action movie.  I had six soldiers that survived more often than not (then again, I don't play the super high difficulties, so that might change things a bit).Xenonauts puts you into a larger scale war, with dozens of troops at your command that you will need.  And some will die.  Heck, many will.  But this game has that skin-of-your-teeth feel to it that the original X-COM had.  The graphics are similar, and almost and updated version of the mid-nineties hit.  Yet there are numerous improvements that help troop and base management, the interceptor game became more strategic (with wingmen!), and there are more options overall that let you take the war to the aliens.I'm re-learning the strategies to win all over again, like it was twenty years ago.  And I'm having a blast doing it!			"

Xenonauts has really improved these aspects and honestly, I really think that this alone makes Xenonauts worth considering, due to the sheer increase in playability that has resulted by actually having a nice, clean interface that didn't come straight out of the 1990s.Secondly, there are the combat improvements. They've really changed up the air combat in this game from what was in the original, and although I acknowledge that it's not to everyone's taste, it's certainly a lot closer to it than what X-COM's air combat was like, to be quite honest! All you really need to take into account are the manoeuvres (roll left/right and afterburner, primarily) for each plane and once you've gotten the hang of timing them and avoiding enemy fire, you'll be dropping those UFOs like flies in no time! (Although, don't mistake this for a lack of difficulty - some of the UFOs that get sent down to earth can be quite punishing!)As for the ground combat, not all that much is different from the original X-COM: soldiers are nothing more than fodder (don't grow attached and restart the game if you lose some; they're all expendable and you should always have a couple of Chinooks' worth rotating in and out of active duty, so you've always got some skilled backup soldiers in case a mission goes bad) who can all be killed by a single well-placed round by an alien if they're unlucky (it's always a ""lucky shot"" if the aliens happen to get you - ALWAYS ;) ), so using cover and smoke is very important. On a similar note, one of the things that Goldhawk have added to ground combat is a suppression system, where if your rounds miss the aliens (or vice versa) but either hit their cover or whizz by near them, they will become suppressed; meaning that they will drop to a crouch, will be unable to perform reaction fire in your turn and will have reduced TUs (Time Units) in their following turn.As for cons, I must say there aren't many. I'd say the only real cons are are there's not a HUGE variety of the randomly-assigned nationalities - although there's still quite a lot - and former units that help add some background to your soldiers, as well as the variety of generated maps being rather more limited than what was in the original X-COM. Although again, this isn't a great issue unless you replay the game a lot (but then again, who wouldn't?). However, due to the fact that modding this game has been made to be quite easy, there are community-made mods out there that remedy both of these cons.In summary, quite frankly I'm no longer able to recommend the original X-COM to people, simply because THIS exists, and that it's regular X-COM, but with some really nice improvements. If you've been hanging out for X-COM but want something a touch less dated, then definitely pick this up! I'm honestly very happy I Kickstarted this game a while back and I consider the extra money I sink into the game by buying gift copies for friends to be money well spent.			"

												Xenonauts is a strategy game that closely follows the original X-Com:UFO Defense in which you order a team of people who should never hold a weapon to kill or capture aliens in order to turn back the alien invasion. It feels like they took xcom and refined the UI and controls to make it less tedious and 'mis-click' prone, you don't have to build alien containment chambers and there's less chance of you making your solider move unintentionally. There's also a more in-depth interception mini-game that involves manuevers but I'm terrible at it.But yeah if you like UFO Defense get it, or if you like the idea of UFO Defense but those early 90's style of gameplay don't appeal to you get it.

												Xenonauts-------------Summary: X-Com 1.5Multiplayer: NoCompletion: 30 hrsCards: YesCloud: NoCan't get enough old-school X-Com? Xenonauts strives to be the spiritual successor of the original game. It brings a little more of everything and streamlines features that should have been in X-Com in the first place, while simultaneously removing certain elements. Thankfully the story doesn't completely retread the original game, and opts to create its own alien backstory, which is fun to experience. The story takes place in the Cold War era, where everyone stops fighting and bands together due to the alien threat. Cue in the Xenonauts, a world-funded organization to counter the exterrestrials, study their technology, and adapt it for our own use. As the months go by, the aliens grow ever bolder, sending bigger and better ships, as though they are adapting to our own environment. Their numbers seemingly countless, they must be stopped, one way or another.Since the game is basically X-Com, I'll just outline some of the changes and what i think of them. The following are changes I thought were good:-All your loadouts are saved, and you can create your own custom loadouts and quickly equip soldiers to match that loadout with the press of a button.-Shields are a great item to have, and are much appreciated. Sadly you can only use 1-handed weapons with them.-Simultaneous movement. 'Nuff said.-Able to launch ships and soldiers while injured/low on fuel.-Civilians help you out! Suddenly the world doesn't feel as lonely as before.-UFO designs are varied and interesting.-I haven't seen aliens forever camp in one spot!-Walking consumes 3TU instead of 4TU, letting you scout about 33% further.-You are given all basic weapons for free in unlimited quantities.-Good tiles, though some art is a little off, like the portraits.-Enjoyable new story.-Air combat is very involved, though I suck at it. Also, they will run from your fleets, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.-Airstriking is great. I don't want to do every UFO mission.-Showing radar coverage is great. Makes me feel not-wasteful.-Stun rockets and grenades are great, and can be obtained early.-There's much less need of live aliens.-You are automatically refilled on supplies when the mission ends, thus you can fly multiple missions in a row in a single flight.-360 vision suit is awesome.-Easy to edit the game (though poorly documented).These are the changes that I feel could use some improvements:-Holy balls there's so many aliens! They always come in waves, multiple times a week, and the likelihood of one getting away is high.-Therefore there are a bazillion ground missions you could end up doing if you don't airstrike them.-Your aircraft are limited to 2 missiles. Considering the volume of UFOs that attack the world simultaneously, this problem is magnified.-All aircraft have considerable monthly fees. You don't even get a refund for decommissioning them.-Explosives destroy equipment upon death, which strongly discourages their use. Their blast radii are also way lower, further discouraging their use.-Aliens do not suffer from morale problems. I miss the feeling of knowing the aliens are panicking.-There is no means to train against psionics short of experiencing it first hand.-Aliens do not need to spot you before they can start blowing your mind.-No mind control or blaster launchers for your troops. Those were fun!-Burst fire got removed from most weapons. Those that do have it consume too many TUs.-The maximum accuracy on any shot is 95%, even at point blank range. You can and will miss on the 95%.-Weapons consume much more TU on average compared to X-Com, so you rarely get many shots on a full TU bar (not counting machine guns).-New weapons completely replace old ones. There are no TU or accuracy differences.-Most weapons are 2-handed now, removing many potential combinations that could have been fun.-Destructible terrain plays much less of a role. Stray shots rarely destroy stuff, and high TU-shots means creating your own entrance is rarely worthwhile.-Lack of instant movement. When you start to do dozens of missions, the time spent watching things move really adds up.-Maps are not procedurally generated. I saw multiple same maps in the same game.-Overhead map is gone.-You can't earn money through item production. Thus engineers are a constant drain on your funds, and they will never turn a profit.-There's very little stuff to buy and sell. Money is very tight in this game.-You cannot use alien artifacts. I miss being able to grab a dead alien's cannon and use it against his buddies.-You cannot fire in the air in a flying suit. So much for death from above.-As odd as this sounds, Xenonauts might be too long. It's very difficult to beat in one sitting, which is discourages replaying the game a bit. The fourth tier weapons might be overkill.-Sometimes crashes on Win 10.-The sarcastic scientist isn't very funny.As far as X-Com clones go, Xenonauts is probably the closest I've played that stays close to the original formula. It's a lot closer than the official XCOM: Enemy Unknown. However some of the changes they made oddly made the game less fun, such as the lack of mind control and blaster launchers. I don't deny these made the game much easier, but darn it, I just want to obliterate the battlefield and rain death from the skies. I like it a lot better than UFO: Extraterrestrials. I'm rather curious how they would write for a sequel to this game. By the end of the game you gain access to exceedingly powerful technology (infinite power??), and I can't imagine where they'd go from there. I give Xenonauts a 8.5/10. It's not without problems but is certainly a fine game.			"

												As some one who has never played the original xcom: ufo defence, I can thoroughly say this game doesnt just try to capitalise on nostalgia. It is a brilliant game in its own right. I would recommend it for any hardcore strategy fan. It can be very unforgiving and will punish sloppy commanders in both the overall strategic conflict and in the combat missions themselves. You need to stay vigilant as you are truly fighting a superior enemy. The atmosphere and aesthetic is very interesting and while the graphics wont blow you away, there are some really nice renders with some lore which create a good picture in your mind of what you are facing even if the little models of the aliens and men arent very detailed in combat. The music is also nice and eerie when you have to face the enemy or soars when your interceptors thunder towards alien craft to shoot them down. The combat itself is tactically very satifying. It has lots of depth and once you take the fight to alien bases and they do the same to you things really start to get interesting. I have many memories of individual missions and the stories that unfold in them. The heroic rookie that pulls of an unbelievably feat of bravery and kills the last few aliens even as his comrades' bodies grow cold around him. The time when I dropped my rocket launcher at the other side of the map coz my man got wounded and then had to hoof it all the way back because i had cornered an alien commander and i was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and wanted to blow his ♥♥♥ to xeno hell. The bunch of ill prepared and under equipped soldiers who fended off an attack on my one and only base. There are plenty of moments like this. Buy it...and suffer! In a good way haha			"

												Do you want a game more brutal than X-Com? Do you want a tactical game where you make all the choices? Do you want to have a mission, everyone dies but doesn't destroy your game?This game is for you! Xenonauts has been around for a while and it is aging well with the mods making it better.  The best example being is the improvement in lore and the extra explaining the progress in the game for both you and the aliens.This game is basically the remake of the original X-Com, you control everything in your base which you NEED to control, not to worry about petty stuff like fuel, food and who got friendzoned by the hot accountant.  Instead your job is to control the men, control where to defend, who to send, what weapons given, what research to look into, what to invest, airpower, tanks or infantry equipment and where to even locate your base, 2nd and if able your 3rd.  Aliens come in a variety of ways, while the early game is somewhat bland, you do face 2 types which require certainly different tactics. Things will pick up in the mid game and things will get much harder, crazier and you will be expected to win. When Aliens begin to have the numbers, they will strike you back and destroy your base if you are not careful, soldiers are the key. This game is hard, on any diffulty expect to lose men and women left and right, many will not survive the hordes of Aliens which will be BRUTAL AND UNFORGIVING. You will make bad decisions, you will falter, you will be blamed for things out of your control. But Xenonauts are responsible to protect the world. Also General of the Xenonauts Program. Good luck.			"

												TL DR:Want to have steamlined,fun experience,without reading manuals or spending time pondering strategy?Go get X-Com Enemy Within,it is a great game.Want a game that expects you to think,learn,plan,and struggle?I'd reccomend Xenonauts to you then.This game...(was played only on Veteran difficulty,Community Edition.Dunno how much anything described below applies to un-modded game and lower difficulties)After beating the X-Com Enemy Within on Classic(read:""hard"")difficulty with almost no effort in  the ' global strategy' part,I wanted to try something more like the original X-Com of which I heard (who didn't,really?) so much.But decided against Open X-Com and went for Xenonauts instead,as the latter reportedly was something like original XC,but with improvements in balance and UI departments....after 3 tries on hard difficulty,being absolutely trashed as late as 3rd in game month,trying several base-management strategies,around a dozen of squad setups,half as much attempts to manage my air fleet in such a way,so it won't be swarmed,outgunned,outrunned,outspaced by UFOs(unsuccesfully,so far),I dropped the game just to get a break and think of new ways to not get screwed after a few hours.Main part of the game is still a ground assaults on UFOsWhere newest X-Com had satisfiyng combat,it never once felt near so INTENSE(even on Iron Man) as it is in Xenonauts.I can't say for sure,why exactly playing Xenonauts I felt more engaged in the game.But when I had lost a squad member,or even a whole squad in X-Com Enemy Within my reaction was 'well,whatever' at most,after getting my A team slaughtered by Androns(terminator-stlye implacable SoBs) in the night ambush, I quitted Xenonauts for a freaking WEEK.Mind you,not RAGE quitted.I  just felt exhausted,because I had no idea how to win in that conditions,where I evidently screwed up somewhere strategically,so much that neither my air forces nor ground teams were up to the task.A week later,restart of the whole campaign and different approach got me through that road block,only I found a couple others...terror missions,enemy psychics,mind control...oh yeah.Yes,this game is brutal.But it is brutal in the most awesome and satisfying way possible,where you actually need to settle down and THINK about your decisions.Because if you did a wrong choice-chances are good that you won't get a disadvatage.Not being able to keep up with the enemy's 'arms race' will make it so that winning would be simply impossible.And no,it's not fake or unfair difficulty,because there's more than a few ways to do things right,as well as there is plenty ways to ♥♥♥♥ everything up.

												For decades people have been screaming ""just remake the original XCOM with bugfixes and without the 16-bit limitations"" and Mythos/Microprose have both resoundingly ignored this advice because uhh they're British and too busy driving on the wrong side of the road to listen to reason or something I guess. Anyway there was an open-source XCOM like ten years ago but it was pretty buggy and ugly and basically an uninspiring failure like most of the open-source Free As In I Don't Give A Sh­it games of the time were. But now these other people have made Xenonauts and it's exactly like the original XCOM but with bugfixes and without the weird 16-bit limitations so lol guess the original developers missed the boat on this one.There's also, of course, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, which is sorta like the original XCOM except dumbed down and with pretty bad/non-existent map variety. It's more streamlined and more instantly-playable than Xenonauts, but it's also dumbed down and the map variety is terrible. There's a place for both games. Get XCOM if you're a noob or Indie, Casual or just wanna shoot aliens or whatever; get this if you want the original XCOM, except with bugfixes and without the weird 16-bit limitations, or you're a bushy-bearded strategy game beardo.

												For quite some time I've been looking for a tactical game which brings both (kind of) grand strategy- and MAINLY tactical-squad-driven-gameplay and also works on my old macbook, which unfortunately the newer x-coms don't. I've played through excellent games of this genre like door kickers and breach & clear, but needed something more. Finally, I believe I have found that game. If you like tactical, turn based combat where you have to put thought behind your movement; then you are going to LOVE this game. I have only played it for about two hours now, but I believe it will be plenty more hours of enjoyment to come! So to sum up: I strongly recommend this game. Strongly enough that I felt I had to pop my cherry of reviewing games on steam.			"

												I had never heard of the original X-Com games before this, so I am not a longtime series fan but I'll tell you I love it. This game is the Indie-Kickstarted-Unofficial sequel to the original X-Com. It sticks closer to the original X-Com in terms of gameplay mechanics than Enemy Unkown, but does a great job improving them. A community version that is maintained by the Xenonauts community is available with the purchase of the game, and it improves on some of the few flaws in the game (none were gamebreaking).I found this game highly entertaining and well worth the investment, definitely on my top 10, maybe even top 5 list.

												Something about the screenshots of Xenonauts always put me off playing the game in the past, I couldn't put my finger on it; although I think the game itself looks great, the screenshots didn't do it justice. But as a big fan of the early X-com games as well as the 2012 reboot I was lured towards Xenonauts, it was one of those games that got under my skin, I kept looking at it on steam, on the fence as to whether it was worth the full asking price; I'd have to say after completing the campaign that it most definately is.Where as the 2012 Firaxis X-com reboot was more of a reimaging, Xenonauts is an up tp date version of the older X-com games, bringing back time units and a whole list of other unit statistics giving the game a certain retro charm.The main story arc of Xenonauts was brilliant, although it's another version of what has gone before, in my opinion it's a story which is more believable than those that have gone before it. The pseudoscience that backs it up is second to none and the tech tree that backs the game up brings some fantastic ideas with it, bulking up what we're used to in this type of game, again all of the research topics are given great entries, made to sound believable, as if all of the technology could potentially exist.The new additions over the original 90's X-com are great: - Realtime air to air combat between your fleets of interceptors and UFO's- A variety of weapons for ground combat, shotguns, assault rifles, LMG's etc- Suppression effects for human and alien units- The ablilty to see a soldiers stats before you hire them- Flashbang grenades for assaulting enemy units- Cover that offers units protection and can be effectively flankedIn addidtion to the above the alien units are all unique and all have unique combat tactics/ablilites which maintains a real ""alien"" feel to the first encounters you have with them, more than once I struggled to comprehend what I was faced with on the battlefield resulting in a last minuite change of my tried and tested tactics.All in all, a must for fans of the 90's X-com games; as well as those who enjoyed the Firaxis reboot and don't mind learning the new interface.

												If you liked the original X-Com (UFO Defence), then play this game. Xenonauts is the spiritual successor to the original DOS classic; with an original storyline set in the Cold War era, you are responsible for the defence of Earth against an escalating alien invasion. Cover the entire Earth's airspace with your interceptor aircraft, take out alien craft and send in your strike team to finish them off in turn based combat. Research alien technology and interrogate captured aliens to discover more about the invasion and ultimately turn the tables.			"

												Xenonauts is what Xcom should have been. The most important feature in the game I can see is the Action system instead of 2 action move or shot. You can move or shoot as long you have enough action point for that action. Want to do a reaction shot save up enough for that shot. I like how this game force you to look in every direction unlike XCom your soldiers are nearly deaf. You can only hear the sounds of doors and no the game won’t deal you which direction did that sound came from. From what I read about this game lots of people said it has lots of micro management I disagree the game is simple enough for every and the UI is well designed. Having the ablity to ship items or rearranging my strike force is a plus for me. It is good to mention that this game has big modding teams doing and add lots of great maps and weapons as well as unities and UI fixes in this game I recommend checking them out.If you like Xcom get this game It will suck you in very fast and you will have a love/hate relationship with it  "

												If you ever played and enjoyed the original XCOM then Xenonauts is pretty essential while if you played and enjoyed the XCOM reboot 'Enemy Unknown' then Xenonauts is still worth looking into. In many ways this is the spiritual sequel to the original XCOM and while I can understand that it may be too 'hardcore' and intimidating for alot of people I still believe that anyone who enjoyed the XCOM reboot should still give it a shot. It might end up being too much for you to take in, or it might prove to be too difficult  but I'm pretty sure that you'll enjoy the process of discovering that because it scratches the same itch in so many ways. The base grounding of knowledge that you'll have from Enemy Unknown will also help you bed in gently as alot of the systems are very similar, it's just that in Xenonauts they're also that little bit more indepth. Steam Workshop support was recently added and already there have been mods uploaded which add even more variety and quality content to the game and I'm sure that in time that content can only grow. In short. Xenonauts is smashing. Give it a shot if you like this sort of thing. It was without doubt one of my games of the year 2014			"

												As a huge fan of X-Com/UFO: Enemy Unknown (and Terror From the Deep) I felt let down by the path of  the modern remake of ""XCOM"" with its smaller squad sizes, missions that took a fraction of the time, and the overall feel of its base management system.Well what have we here? ""Xenonauts""? I have NOT been disappointed. Touted as the spiritual successor to the original X-Com games and it really does live up to the hype.PROs:- Base management: Way more in tune with the original, building hangars, labs, living quarters, workshops.- Research: Still figuring out the order in which I should be researching but loving it so far, trying to improve the classic stuff (weapons, armor, aircraft, etc).- That classic feel! Guess what? Your prize Lieutenant is going to get shot by an alien in the dark, your recruits (Privates) are going to panic, and that frustration of combat missions is really recaptured. You hate it, but you LOVE it!- Computer AI: Very very good. The aliens don't just walk around shooting you as they see you. They can be quite content to know you're outside their craft from having had their pal shot to bits, and hole up in there behind some cover... waiting for your Lieutenant to say... ""open the door, Private!""- Mod community: Not looked into it, but like a lot of titles on Steam it seems to have a community for mods, and that can only be a good thing!- Music/Atmosphere: That sometimes menacing, sometimes spooky music from the old X-Com? It's not the same, but it has that same feeling.CONs:- They could do more to lessen the learning curve for new players. Things like outfitting your soldiers with grenades should be done as standard. I think I did my first 4-5 missions wondering why grenades weren't on Xenonauts because they'd be damn handy! Turns out they are, you just need to outfit your soldiers before the craft leaves the base.- Targeting. I know this will come across as a gripe, but when you run up behind an alien within touching distance, with a shotgun, get a 95% chance to hit and MISS... well, part of the charm? Or outright unrealistic? ;)OTHER THINGS:- Civilians are present on some of these missions, some of them are armed (most of them panic and crouch with their hands over their heads), but the armed ones  WILL fire at the aliens!- ""Normal"" difficulty. Damn hard! As it was in the original, and I'd recommend jumping in at this level for nostalgia's sake ;)Overall then... if you're looking to play an updated version of the old 90s X-Coms then I would HIGHLY recommend this. As always, check out some YouTube footage before purchasing, but I'm having a blast! Sadly, so are the aliens!			"

												This is truely the pennicle of the genere in my opinion. More polished and fun than the original X-com and more detailed and challenging than the ""Enemy Unknown"" remake, this game really scratches my itch for turn based tactics and global scale strategy.  It's not as pretty as a lot of other games, but that is well balanced by the addictive ""one more turn!"" gameplay. Of course, there are a few niggling details that are bothersome. Even at lower difficulties, this game can be punnishingly, frustratinly hard. When you're first starting out, it plays more as a rougelike with frequent restarts or save loads until you can get your initial base(s) established and have figured out a good order to unlock the tech tree. Additionally, the maps get reused more often than I would like, though there are workshop projects that remedy that complaint. Hell, even the difficulty ends up adding to the charm (and nostalgia) of this game. Seriously, though, if you're even remotely interested in this kind of game, you're doing yourself a diservice if you've not already aded Xenonauts to your cart.			"

												My introduction to X-COM was a mass effect clone called The Bureau, a very underrated game, but that's for another review. I also played another X-COM games like UFO, but that one was unplayable with my actual PC and Enemy Unknown a few weeks ago. So I'm not going to compare this game to UFO or EU and of coruse I will focus of why this game is great even if you never played a X-COM.This game has a great lore at even at 80 pages prologue novel, but it's not focused at all in the story, the entries in the xenopedia are fun to read but that doesn't count as plot. So this game focuses on the gameplay and it really shines in that aspect, every action cost Time Units (TU) and you can make any action in any order if you have enough TU, you can't shoot and alien move  to another position and if you have enough TU shoot another alien or reserver some TU for reaction fire in the aline turn.Xenonauts is one of the most addicting, well made and challenging TBT that I played, their graphics are pleasing for today's standards beside being 2D they are hand drawn style and the particles from the explosion, and shoots and others  are pretty well done.In conclusion Xenonauts is a great game for that's who love TBT and want something refreshing but just a pure TBT.

												Xenonauts is an excellent spiritual continuation of a defining turn based franchise. The graphics, gameplay, and UI stay true where they were successful while parts that were lacking have been improved or redesigned. The game is very long, and in some instances will feel drawn out and repetitive, but on the whole it does not detract far enough to avoid playing.Know that this game is tough and will take careful thought, experimentation, and a bit of luck to win.

Xenonaughts incorperates indepth stratagy of bases, much more economics, and my favorite feature...fighter combat. Although it's not very complex, it's amazingly fun. I'd buy just the fighter combat as it's own game. Definatly worth the money, as it is half the price of Enemy Unknown and just as good.On a side note there have been some glitches, but that mostly involves my soldiers being able to see inside alien ships without suposedly being able to, and the occational sprite glitch. Nothing that breaks the game however.			"

												This game is probably my favorite game in the last few years. Honestly, I almost like it better than XCOM: UFO Unknown. I've played through it once now. I DID play on Normal and without Ironman Mode and saved, like, every three seconds, but I still played it.But anyways, what's so good about it?-Feels similar to the old XCOM, which is good-Pretty deep base management-TONS of technology. More than either of the XCOMs. -An EXTREMELY awesome air combat system. Much better than either of the XCOMs. Instead of fighting one-on-one, you can go up to 3v3, and the way it works is almost perfect. Once you get the hang of it. Spend the time getting really good at it.-A pretty decent economy, you do well, you get more money. I do wish you could sell your advanced weaponry for more than what it is now. You'd think countries would want to get their hands on some shiny new guns.-Really good tactical combat. Lots of fun. Pretty darn hard if you aren't careful though. -Mods. You can mod the game. I haven't, but it's there.-Tons of overall content. There's not much I didn't like. Mostly just stuff with the difficulty. On normal. So, IT'S HARD. Get it if you want a challenge. IF you just want to blow stuff up like in XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, this game might not be for you.As of the creation of this review, I have played one game through, which took me 40 hours to complete.

												Old school X-COM with nice graphics, well-thought features and controlled air combat.Played this game along it`s development (a little bit after it started to provide premium access to alpha builds). Witnessed most of the dev`s decisions during that time, most of which were influenced by the premium access players. So, basically, what you get in the game is based on old school X-COM fans` opinions and suggestions.The game while being complex is a bit simplified compared to old X-COM series. For example - there is no such thing as ammo buying/producing. You are always stocked up with infinite ammo even for produced weapons. You are still limited to what your soldiers can carry into battle. Other simplification is options to autoresolve air battles and get rid off indesired ground UFO recovery operations. You don`t want to go down and risk your soldiers for a mere amount of alloys? Just blow up the crash site by a single click and get some money for that.Geoscape (the global view of the world) provides reports of alien activity. These reports indicate presence of UFOs and allows player to send interceptors beyond the radar coverage of Xenonauts bases.I recommend this game to anyone who is familiar with the old school UFO\X-COM (not the one that Firaxis released).

												In many ways an impressive game.With many hours of extremely fun gameplay.It's a game you should own and should have played.I finished the game offline and Steam did not count my hours, but I spent probably 80-100 hours playing it.The first two tries I failed than I played at easy and with a changed strategy.It's very close to the original XCOM which IMO is a really good thingas it is still one of the best games to ever have been made.But the graphic of the original is dated and this game even improves some over the original.Because its depth, atmosphere and gameplay.Many remakes have been tried and failed because they lackedone thing or the other that made the original so good.They lacked turn-based rounds, they lacked how high the soldierswere standing as a tactical part of the game or buildings were not destructible etc. This game have it all! The music has the exact right kind of atmosphere.The graphics is not too cartoony as some in the first new XCOM by Firaxis, its just right.It is not an easy game to remake, as it has a lot of depth but Goldhawk made itvery good and in some ways even improved upon the original. Also the graphics is much cooler than on the screen-shots. There is no such thing as a perfect game but this comes close.What brings it down is the difficulty level of the game. I played it to the end and when I look back they made the game a little too hard even on easy, which will cause a lot of frustration.The best tactics you are supposed to use to complete the game is notexplained. This means that you may end up spending a lot on new weapons to your soldiers, but that makes it impossible to complete the game whichyou will only discover after 12-20 hours later on in the game when you havelost a country which means you will get too little money to build new bases,and new airplanes, which means you will lose other countries.In this way it is old-school and close to the original game, which you could easilyspend 100 hours on and still not manage to complete.For those that want to avoid having to replay here is a winning strategy:To be able to complete the game one strategy is to try and as soon as possible establish three bases with up to 3 radars oneach and with mainly lots of hangars and fighter-jets.As shooting down UFOs will mean that the countries will raise your income and you willkeep the alien invasion under control and when you attack a UFO with the maximum amount of fighter-jets.you will almost never lose a plane.Do not put too much into producing expensive soldier weapons at first.Do not spend money on missile defense as those are not needed in the first 10 hours of the game.What is not perfect.When on missions it is almost impossible to not get soldiers killed, which later on in the gamebecomes frustrating as the soldiers after completing 20 missions are much better than new recruits.They aim better, can do much more during a turn and can carry much more.This makes new soldiers frustratingly bad when you are in the middle of the game.In order to manage this, you have to either constantly have twice the amount of soldiersthat you cycle through on missions, which is just tedious and also slows down the leveling up of your soldiers, but could easilyalso affects the game in that later on in the game some of the weapons are very expensive and takes verylong time to produce and if you produce them for every single one of your soldiers youhave wasted money on weapons instead of base upgrades fighter-jets. etc.One way to save that money is to reuse the same weapon for whatever soldier that you are sending on a mission, sure it is nice to think of that as a way to save money similarly as to how governments try to save money, but swapping the weapons before missions just to save money is not that fun in the long run.So what you will end up doing later in the game instead of cycling through several soldiers and swapping their weapons is kind of cheating. You will save very often, almost after every action a soldier has taken, and if a soldier of yours is shot down you will reload and replay.Because the game will force you to do so in order for you to know that you will at least stand a chance of being able to complete it. The problem is that you can do everything right, you place your soldiers in strategic positions guarding all exits and entrances.Letting them have time units left to react and fire at any aliens that comes around a corner.But they still get shot at because an alien can see from a longer distance than you or your soldiers can losetheir mind and start to fire at their own squad.So even if you do everything right you will lose soldiers in a somewhat unfair way which makes you grow tiredand you feel forced just starting to save often and replay instead.In that way they should had made the game much easier and more forgiving on Easy. Easy right now is what you would expect normal or hard to be.However the game is still extremely fun and entertaining during many many hours.And for many reasons it is one hell of a game.One of the things that makes it so is how research works. Unlike other games you do not know really know whatthe result of researching a new technology or interrogating an alien will be. This makes it hard to stop playing as you find that you just have to research that newweapon or technology to find out what it is and when you have you find out it is an awesome new weapon that will toast the aliens. Now you just need to produce that weapon.Than you get greedy and want all your soldiers to have it so you continue playing andalong the way you discover new things to research and your intelligence will report newthings they have discovered to you. And just when it starts to get tedious a new element isintroduced. The AI of the aliens is also quite good and you will find some of them doing quite smart things later on in the game.Don't put your squad members to close together or they might throw a grenade at your group!

												Faithful re-creation of the old UFO games, it provides the same excelent challenging gameplay with better graphics and interface. Simplifies on some pointless tasks and adds some content on top as well.Some minor bugs persist, and inability to rotate the map and see characters behind walls will grate with the modern player.Strongly recommended to anyone that either enjoyed the old games, or would like to see what all the fuss is about.

												As somebody who still plays and loves the original UFO: Enemy Unknown (or XCOM: UFO Defense) I am delighted to be able to say that I won't be playing it any more.  Xenonauts is XCOM's equal or superior in every way, and I would encourage anybody and everybody who is interested into getting into XCOM to pick up Xenonauts instead.			"

												Storytime - very mild game mechanics spoilers;It was my first base assault. It got called in the middle east, and I'd been putting the raid on hold for a geoscape week. The team was led by Lieutenant Jennifer Miller, a strong shieldwoman previously of the American Navy Seals. She was the one who I could count on to open doors and have the Reflexes to not take reaction fire, and ""shock-jock"" with a stun baton to take alien scum in alive.The firefights were long and daunting, fending off aliens in their own sprawl, and constantly keeping an eye on my rear-guard. Reapers and assault sebilians made me pay for every corridor in blood, to the point when it came to the alien base's command center being the last room, Lieutenant Miller was the only one remaining. A sebilian officer geared for war charged my team of three, killing the sniper who failed to hold down the kill zone corridor before the command room, and mauling a rifleman on its way.Lieutenant Miller retreated and bunkered down with just a laser pistol and a broken riot shield, ready for a last stand, but the sebilian officer withdrew back to the command room to hold the fort confidently. Lieutenant Miller fell back herself desperately, over the gore of firefights that happened a half hour ago. But among her dead allies, one had a RPG launcher still loaded, and some rockets on their belt. It was enough munitions to seek out the base's power core and destroy the base, but Lieutenant Miller wanted blood. Personally. She gathered up all the grenades she could find, and went back to the corridor, knocking on the command room's blast door with an RPG.They flooded through the smoke and fire of the blast, three sebilians, and opened fire as Miller was hunkering down and putting in another rocket. She took a graze, but responded with a stun grenade that culled the weaker ones unconscious, then filling the command room with two more rockets. To much relief, the mission became a success. The base was captured.On the lonely carrier back to home, it was shot down by a very, very angry squadron of alien fighters over the Atlantic. Yet fortune would have it that the local navy would find Lieutenant Miller barely alive out at sea, and ushered back to HQ to receive decoration and promotion to Captain for her legendary service.

												A good remake of the classic UFO: Enemy Unknown (or X-COM: UFO Defense for the 'muricans). Better than Firaxis' 2012 X-COM, though that game is good too. It's set in the cold war era, which is great, but not much is done with the setting. It's mainly in the art.Gameplay is pretty much the original UFO with some improvements, like bit more elaborate air combat and cover system. There is a lot of little things that bother me, but mods could fix the most of them, and there seems to be a healthy modding community. For example, the maps are generated semi-randomly like in UFO, but the maps generated are often boring, but there is mods that adds a lot of new submaps for the game to build it's maps from. The weapon tiers are a bit too obvious and gamey, this bothered me on the Firaxis' game too, but I can see how mods could fix that.Something not as fixable by mods is that the engine doesn't seem to handle z-axis so well. The sightlines are sometimes illogical when looking above and below. That's probably why the UFOs have teleporters instead of those lift tube things of the original game. The enviroment destruction seems to be on par with the original game, not as great as in X-COM: Apocalypse, but OK.It has some of the addicting quality of the original UFO. Endgame drags a bit, though. Overall very good and I got to try some of those mods.			"

												Tried of games where you have to min/max to win?  Well search no further!  Even your best stats won't help you for ♥♥♥♥ in this turn-based strategy game!  Sick of aliens that you can kill in one shot?  Don't you worry, these aliens will regen more hp per turn than you can dish out in damage.  Do you hate spending action points reloading your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun?  Just pick up an aliens weapon!  They don't have to ever reload... unless you use them, then yes, yes it does.  Hate it when you get to cover and don't quite have enough action points to take a shot?  I wouldn't worry, the cover won't help you anyway! Do you have your flank covered by a belt fed, fully automatic machine capable of cutting even the toughest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in half?  That's great!  Because even with his finger on the trigger he still won't get to shoot first.  Do you have an arch of fire totally free of objects and friendlies?  That's good work soldier, cause you still somehow shot and killed your best equipped guy.Xenonauts - the aliens can shoot through walls, you can't, so play safe.10/10 - would save, re-load, re-load, re-load, re-load, save, re-load and re-load again.

												Xenonauts developed by Gamethunks, Goldhawk Interactive & released on 17 Jun 2014 for PC. According to Metacritic (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/xenonauts) it has:    An Average user score of 8.0     #75 Most Discussed PC Game of 2014      #69 Most Shared PC Game of 2014  I'll dare say that Xenoaunts is a great remake of the original XCOM title. If you've played Firaxis's XCOM, you should give this title a try. Both titles differ in many aspect of the game however both are notable titles for the remake of XCOM. Xenoauts on the other hand could do with a little more love and attention for what it's worth.The Story:To keep it short, alien invasion on earth seems immanent and a multi-nationality milatary organization known as XCOM is task to defend our beloved earth from these invaders. Take command of this organization. Build bases across the world, research, manufacture and battle these invaders. One things for sure, soldiers will die. Period.User Interface,Controls, Visuals:The UI on a whole; on battle/soldier/weapon stats window were designed in blocks (nothing fancy), clean and organized unlike the original XCOM where there were tons/clusters of buttons on the  screen.The information are presented in a simple, clean & organized fashion. This also includes research result/aircraft/vehicle capabilities/alien autopsy. This is important because you may need to look them up after some time or after a break.To be real honest, controls are easy. It's quite standard for me really but for some who are new to turn base RTS, they may feel overwhelm on what's being shown on the screen. With the options and bars and what not & freak out far too soon. Or when they see the list of key bindings, the fall off from their chair. Lol. In actual scenario, all you need is the tab key and your mouse. That's it.Visuals:Xeno is a 2d, top-down looking game. It looks good for me. Nothing fancy  if compared to Fira's XCOM. The entire art style looks like hand drawn. Don't get me wrong, it is not a negative point. Everything in here has been designed/colored cleanly with details and a whole lot of effort has been put into the images as you progress with more technology getting unlocked. Unlike Firaxis's XCOM, where its design lean closer for sci-fi futuristic looking gears@soldiers. (those shiny & glowing things) Xeno takes place in cold-war era. Ballistic weapons, bazookas, grenades, tanks and jet fighters. You might feel unimpressed as you are in plain clothing with a standard machine gun/shot gun.  Due to word count limit, I'll just summarize that the human world art concept and the aliens art concept are totally different. Units, ships, weapons are all designed differently but with “realism” still the main point of design. Kudo's on the graphic department. Mechanics:I've said this and I will say this again, beautiful games without substance is no fun. What Xeno (may) lack in visuals, shine in it's mechanics & game play experience. Xeno resembles closer to the original XCOM with greater emphasis on micro managements. It takes a while to understand the weapon handling and on the TU points. Once you do, your gameplay are much more direct. In Xeno, there is no nonsense of that shot missing a 75% or 80% chance. Xeno shooting mechanic is more realistic and is largely affected by the  distance. The good news, there is base building and the aliens can invade your base. They can even build base across the world and you have to disable it. Similar to Fira's XCOM, once you lost majority of the world continent@support, you lose the game. Xeno has better air battles than Fira's XCOM. Air Battles are tricky when you don't have uber jets to fight for you. Some air battles require micro mgt to win. The ground battle is always tedious but rewarding. You need to understand the aliens capabilities and your weapon capabilities to have a decent chance against them. Failing to understand your weapon capabilities will only make you waste turns. Grenades are the highlight of xeno. They are an important asset to storming into room, provide cover and the best way to deal with aliens. Which is why Fira's XCOM later introduce enemy within with more grenade design.Game difficultyTo be honest, I feel xeno is generally harder than Fira's XCOM in the early days until Firaxis released XCOM Enemy within a major bump in game difficulty.I dont feel that the aliens are hard to beat or that this game is hard rather I feel that the game is annoying. Because the aliens capitalize on their advantage and with the constant nuisance from the praetor messing up my squad. But I guess, that’s challenge for you.There's day and night mission as well. Yes, Night missions are harder due to the vision disadvantage. To aid night missions, your entire squad is presented with unlimited amount of flares. It helps in a certain way but not effective enough because the aliens have higher stats then the humans and can shoot further. Oh and their weapon hurt more too. Many have mentioned this and I am going to say this too. Please re-tweak the reapers. They can see players out of the visibility range – they can move in and kill your squad with ease. It is rather an unfair design decision because the reaper only has to poke your unit and say goodbye to whatever Armour/weapon your unit has – or how utterly useless your squad reaction fire is. =(The final mission was really tricky, interesting and freaky suspense. As you try to make it out alive from the endless wave of repears. lol. On a whole, the game felt paced right. You are constantly battling against time for research/manufacture something to give you a slight advantage over the aliens. I use the term ""slight"" because no matter what tech-tree you research unlike in Fira's XCOM, xeno's aliens will always have the upper hand whether its in stats, numbers, weapons. I can share with you the moment I researched tank/super heavy suite/uber 1 blast kill weapon, I thought to myself: ""this it man! this is the game changer!"" but no matter what, if I am careless/I don't plan properly, the aliens will whop my sorry <bottom>. My SummaryXenoauts is a solid product. Thank you Gamethunks, Goldhawk Interactive for this product. While trying to stay true to the original XCOM title, many of the retro/feel/game mechanics have been adopted into this product. You did a great job with Xenoauts.Many might not have heard of xenoauts - unlike Firaxi's XCOM due to marketing approach maybe? But the gameplay experience is on par for both titles. It's not sci-fi and it tries to remain grounded on many of its design choices. Xeno does offer slightly more option for ground battle, where you are able to bring in a whole lot of soldiers (more than 6), the choice of soldier weapons and Tanks. Xeno gives you the option to train your soldier however you want and allows you to equip whatever weapon you so desire. The retro feel is there. Xeno's air battle@base planning will always keep on the edge as you try to cover a part of country/continent and prepare air crafts. All of the micro mgt aspect will allow players to feel more engaged unless you don't fancy that. I am a little disappointed on the ending. Upon completion and saving humanity from the alien invaders, players are presented with a screen of ""hey congrats! you won!"" After all that battle, terror missions, blowing up alien HQs, XX soldiers dead. My reward was 1 screen. Hmph. lol. I love the game, please don't repeat this in future titles. Please give players a much more rewarding ""ending"". Something which if they do share on youtube, people will go ""wow, what a good game. I must get this"" or ""yeah you did good. congrats""So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Xenonauts is a solid 8/10.			"

												I'll get the obvious out of the way; if you liked XCom Enemy Unknown, you will probably like this. If you liked XCom Enemy Unknown, but at times wondered: - Why can I only send one strike team at a time? Why only one base of operations? Why only one interceptor at a time?- Why do my troops seem to have seemingly unlimited sources of conventional ammunition? - Why are the aliens so reactive to my scouting that I'm rewarded for crawling forward at a snails pace to 'discover' groups one at a time, rather than actively scouting things out? - Why don't the aliens ever try a direct attack against XCom (if you have enemy within, why didn't they try for a conventional attack a second time?)then get Xenonauts; which does an amazing job of both bringing up the level of depth and realism that I've come to love from XCom (don't get me wrong, I think XCom is one of the best games out there and I love its character and offerings), and delivering something thats still unique and distinctive. If you're looking for a game that does an excellent job tracking what a campaign against a hostile alien invasion might be like; Xenonauts is amazing. Buy it; buy it now!			"

I can share with you the moment I researched tank/super heavy suite/uber 1 blast kill weapon, I thought to myself: ""this it man! this is the game changer!"" but no matter what, if I am careless/I don't plan properly, the aliens will whop my sorry <bottom>. My SummaryXenoauts is a solid product. Thank you Gamethunks, Goldhawk Interactive for this product. While trying to stay true to the original XCOM title, many of the retro/feel/game mechanics have been adopted into this product. You did a great job with Xenoauts.Many might not have heard of xenoauts - unlike Firaxi's XCOM due to marketing approach maybe? But the gameplay experience is on par for both titles. It's not sci-fi and it tries to remain grounded on many of its design choices. Xeno does offer slightly more option for ground battle, where you are able to bring in a whole lot of soldiers (more than 6), the choice of soldier weapons and Tanks. Xeno gives you the option to train your soldier however you want and allows you to equip whatever weapon you so desire. The retro feel is there. Xeno's air battle@base planning will always keep on the edge as you try to cover a part of country/continent and prepare air crafts. All of the micro mgt aspect will allow players to feel more engaged unless you don't fancy that. I am a little disappointed on the ending. Upon completion and saving humanity from the alien invaders, players are presented with a screen of ""hey congrats! you won!"" After all that battle, terror missions, blowing up alien HQs, XX soldiers dead. My reward was 1 screen. Hmph. lol. I love the game, please don't repeat this in future titles. Please give players a much more rewarding ""ending"". Something which if they do share on youtube, people will go ""wow, what a good game. I must get this"" or ""yeah you did good. congrats""So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Xenonauts is a solid 8/10.			"

								Hey kids, have you played x-com. The original one? [jontronmoment]wwwhuszat? yusaidno? Wellthat'sunbeliavable, i don't even see how you came to that conclusion[/jointronmoment]If you played xenonauts - you practically did. Basically it is a very faitful remake of x-com made by a huge fans, which resembles original almost on 80%. Everything is there - ability to damage terrain, free fire, science and assembly division, neat ambient music, etc.And it improves on so many levels which were under-taken in original x-com - like to example - aerial fighting manual mode is best one yet i've seen in fan-made x-com(1-2)'esque games. I mean - best one in series were in x-com 3, but i feel that lots of a-holes which did not actually played 3rd part gonna downvote me for that, but whatever. That's my review, i do whatever I want, god damn it.Anyway - the game is neat and polished -it crashed only 2 times in 13 hours, and i were able to quickly recover from autosaves, authors just need a little more kicking to make finishing touches and find all the bugs. But even at this point - this is very stable release candidate rather than beta.Almost everything is there, i believe teleporter and psionic sounds are the same, which they shouldn't be, also some plasma rifles have same sound. But besides that - core is there, feeling of progress is there too, game just as addicting to mea s the original, and i just spent 14 hours playing it non-stop, for the note - in recent xcom reboot i got bored after 3 (6 in ufo afterlight) and barely finished it. Something to cosider. I think main thing about this game is that it keeps throwing new stuff at you even after you think everything is done and beaten - on normal difficulty progression is rather slow, but rewarding at that - it doesn't feel rushed, nor does it feel too slow. Just hits the spot. In the conclusion - buy this game guys - it worth every penny and delivers+it has crazy potential for modding since EVERYTHING is in xml+it has map editor. And even if you played only reboot of xcom - but original x-com and this one and compare them back to back - they are pretty damn close and xenonauts most certainly can be called X-COM: UFO Defense 2.0.

												Frustrating at times. It improves on elements of the original XCOM series, though the AI is extremely predictable and sees everyone and everything. Easy to counter after a few games, but that can be worse.Overall, it is good. The AI issue isn't so bad that it's a dealbreaker (for me) but if you're not sure maybe wait for Xenonauts 2.			"

								Absolutely amazing game, the basic idea is they took the old XCOM:EU game, updated the graphics, added in a dogfighting minigame, and threw in a little more humor to the reports and panels.  If you like tactical shooters, killing aliens, starting with a group of wet behind the ears rookies and turning them into hardened veterans, and upgrading your weapons to rediculous levels, this is the game for you.

You should treat yourself to the xenonauts experience and have a taste of getting your ♥♥♥ wipped by a lone allien just by being overconfident.			"

								This is a great game. I was unsure if I wanted to buy it because it didn't look all that exciting and fun in the state it was in when I bought it. Wow, was I wrong. If you are coming here from the new X-Com (like me), there is one major thing you should know. This game's missions is A LOT slower than X-Com's. This is not a bad thing, for me at least, but missions can become sort of repetative, but you don't have to fight the battles if you do not want to, you can choose to just bonb the crash site for some money.The begining will be one the most difficult parts because you are very ill equiped and the mission variation is limited. But the missions begin to vary the further you get in the game (bigger crash sites, alien bases, and terror missions).This game is AMAZING, and some of that is due to the fact that it is in Alpha/Beta (I'm not sure which one). So I can't even imagine what the completed game will have.			"

												Sooo, I am currently limited to a weak tablet as only means of computing power and decided to give this game a try, seeing it's requirements were rather humane and the screenshots looked neat. Handdrawn graphics, classic turnbased action. Seemed nice enough.What I got from that was absolutely amazing. This game managed to pull me in entirely and made me go through hours, making progress and playing to see what it might pull out next. The handdrawn nature made the absolute best out of this. Detailed depictions of the autopsies, backgrounds for the sections of your base that look like a masterpiece each and change over the time as you develop new technology. It really proves that great graphical experience has nothing to do with a powerful GPU.The narrative style of the game and lots of lore that come with it only increase the experience and keeps you going on, wanting to see the next artwork and the self loving speech of your chief scientist as he tells in his eccentric way of mixing imperial and metric systems what he developed this time.Gameplay wise there is nothing too revolutionary, the game relying on what had been proven good on the early XCOM games and making you wonder why so much was lost in Enemy Unknown. It's a good strategic experience that challenges your mind at times but doesnt frustrate you or make you desperate to a point that you toss away the game. I definitely recommend this to fans of Xcom and the genre in general, a good experience for casual players and more experienced alike and a pleasure to look at.			"

												Did you used to play XCOM back in the day, and now crave a (slightly) more modern experience? Or maybe you played the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and found it a little too... gamey. Well, send in the Xenonauts!COMPARED TO XCOM:Xenonauts is a more user-friendly, streamlined version that replaces clunky UI for more strategic depth. And this game is DEEP. Spend you hard-earned cash on buffing up your wimpy troopers and giving them sweet, sweet gear or spend it like any rational government agency would and buy more bases and jets. Lots of jets. Upgrade those babies. Yeaaaaahhh... that's it. Jets are the future. I know those lasers look pretty, but jets make those governments happy... yeaaaahhhh...Also you'll be happy to find that, although challenging, you won't have your entire team mind-controlled on the third mission.COMPARED TO XCOM:EU or EW:So you have your flashy graphics and simplified UI. But do you have air combat? Do you have the possibility of managing multiple bases around the world? Maybe you just want one base to have xenonauts in it and the rest filled with jets. Maybe you can't aford anything because you are bad at finances. This game has all the strategic depth that XCOM: EU lacks. Pinch those pennies, ladies and gents.In Closing...For those looking for a more management-oriented, strategic experience, Xenonauts will be more satisfying than its flashier cousins. It has its problems, but the free Community Edition fixes the majority of them. I really hope XCOM:EU and its sequels consider adopting the strategic management elements from this game; it makes it a vastly satisfying experience.			"

I can barely beat the others and now THIS THING?""Some tips:Don't be fooled taking a scout tank and thinking that thing is decent.It's papermash against anything but the first 2 alien classes, and even they can destroy it sometimes.Don't build to manny bases at once or you'll run out of funds pretty fast.Advance slowly, nothing is gained by moving too fast/finishing quick.

												Faceblast was an excellent soldier, a true hero, victor of many battles. He had an amazing collection of medals, including multiple purple hearts. He never abandoned his trusty shotgun (well, maybe once when he panicked).His only mistake during his otherwise excellent military career was throwing that grenade. Into his own feet. Killing him. And several of his comrades. Maybe explosives weren't for him?10/10, would throw grenades again. For mankind!			"

YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Xenonauts Critique (Release Version Review) 

			Views: 4,531		

			An in-depth critique by SwashbucklingSir of the strategic tactical turn-based game Xenonauts, a remake of the classical X-Com series. Does it live up to the spiritual predecessors. Let's find out!		

STORY: Just as in the original X-Com games, extraterrestrial beings attack the earth and the poorly prepared humanity tries desperately to fend off the incoming aggression. Over time we learn to adapt and use the alien technology to our advantage, while at the same time stronger UFOs and aliens try to assault our planet.GRAPHICS: The polished graphics are quite nice and offer a throwback to the old generation, however offering a surprising amount of detail at the same time. Some levels are, by their nature (arctic and desert), rather plain and simple, however other areas are rather impressive.SOUND: The sound design is diffident. It creates a tense atmosphere where not encountering aliens is even worse than having them in sight. The minimal sound effects will make you sit on the edge of your seat as soon as something happens!GAMEPLAY: Both the ground combat as well as the geoscape offer very strategic gameplay and an immense variety due to an array of tactical possibilities! Balancing when to expand your base, which planes to utilise to intercept which UFOs, which equipment to bring for ground assault and when to know that retreat is the best option is key to Xenonauts. The air-to-air combat seems rather shallow though and I found myself using the auto-resolve function most of the time.PROBLEMS: The game does a really poor job of tutorializing itself and thus especially the UI, the cover system and the reaction shot system need a lot of getting used to. Once those initial hurdles have been overcome however, Xenonauts kept growing on me and the more I played, the more strategic options opened up due to the very flexible Turn Unit (TU) system.There are a few minor annoyances like the fact that the soldies customization is incredibly limited since you can only change their name but not face, origin, etc., or the fact that changing equipment is rather time consuming and laborious, or the fact that the UFO's doors close after each turn and thus you always have to put a soldier in harm's way, or the fact that doing an airstrike on a ground target is always worse than actually assaulting the crashsite with your soldiers, even though nothing is to be gained there, resulting in a grind, or the fact that the calculated walk distance sometimes is shorter than it could actually be if you would have optimized the path manually, or the fact that your soldiers cannot utilise their jetpacks to jump over stuff on the highest roof due to level restrictions, etc etc etc. Nontheless, I can forgive all these minor annoyances due to the incredible atmosphere that oozes from Xenonauts, especially when fighting at night in an uninhabited environment.There is one huge problem though, that still hinders me from playing Ironman mode, and that is the camera of Xenonauts. As it cannot be turned and as working with heights is incredibly clunky and frustrating, I feel that improvement on that front is required. Possibile solitions would be to include a rotate option for the camera or the possibility to switch off the walls similar to the Sims games. If no official solution is on the horizon, I hope and feel that the integrated mod support might lead to great solutions provided by the community in the future!COMPARISON WITH ENEMY UNKOWN: Xenonauts has a far greater entry barrier and thus addresses an audience looking for a more strategic experience compared to the latest X-Com game (Enemy Unkown). If you are new to tactical turn-based games, consider checking out X-Com Enemy Unkown with it's Add-On Enemy Within, preferably in a Steam Sale. Should you be looking for a hardcore experience reminiscent of the old X-Com games, consider picking up Xenonauts as it offers not only the tactical turn-based combat but additionally a strategic geoscape, which was simplified heavily in Enemy Unknown.CONCLUSION: Xenonauts is not perfect, however the tactical possibilities and the amazing atmosphere overcome the annoyances and problems. Thus Xenonauts gets a recommendation for every gamer with an interest in tactical-turn-based games.			"

												This is simply a must-have if you enjoyed the X-COM games, or any of the other tactical combat games. It taps directly into the same vein as the first X-Com, in terms of what you do and what you see. The enemy will kill you, there will be death and destruction, and you'll watch the world fall apart.			"

												Well, I have finished the game for a second time (after a number of mis-starts) and have had a great time with it.  I enjoy the base/financial management aspect but the ground combat is what makes the game.  (The air combat I enjoy watching, but not manually fighting....I generally auto-complete it and hope for the best).  I actually enjoyed the game a bit more on Easy mode than Normal mode.  Normal mode was a challange, but felt a bit grindy to me after a while.  Ground combat is turn based style similiar to the original Xcom (or early Jagged Alliance games).  Fun to flank, blow up buildings, fly, etc.  (more variety mid to late  game).  Note you will get punished for sloppy ground tactics, even on easy levels (but not nearly as painfully as the higher levels).  While there may be ""best tactics"", I found you are able to complete missions a number of different ways.   I will come back to this fmame with the Community Edition/map packs (after a short break to work on my backlog).  The game was very stable for me (although I did have 2 crashes in 40+ hours, I suspect it had to due with my PC trying to run stuff in the background).    Cons - the final mission was a bit easy and the end screen anti-climatic.  Pros - great fun with turn based tactical combat; for me at least, definitely provided the flavor of the original game.   Also has a very active modding community which will give this game some staying power.			"

												Xenonauts has captured all the fun, excitement, and intrigue of the original X-COM games, and only intensified them in this amazing revival. With over 100 hours of play time logged on this gem, I can safely say that it is one of the most immersive and fun games I have played in a long time.      I have played Firaxis' X-COM and while I loved it, it still failed to quite capture the true spirit of the the original series. Not a problem with Xenonauts. Playing it feels like it was made by the exact same developers that made the original x-com, but with the approach and complexity that decades of gaming refinement have brought to the table.     I've heard some friends express a disenterest based on the graphics, but I can assure you that the elements of the game itself more then make up for this, and seeing how some 3D modeling can end up looking rather...cartoony or kind of silly (Planetary Annhiliation, Showrun Returns), I find it pretty refreshing.     I can't say enough about the content of this game. From the well written and detailed UFOpedia, that keeps a detailed description of every relevent item/creature you will come across and/or research, the rich histories of your team members; their prior combat experience, assignments, countries of origin, etc; to the HUGE tech tree to be plotted and explored.     The game takes place in 3 seperate environments...the ""Geoscape"", where you lay out your bases, set up manufacturing and research, hire and equip your soldiers/engineers/scientists, and watch for alien activity. Once an alien ship is spotted, you must dispatch interceptors to shoot down the enemy. Once your interceptor has engaged the ship, the second environment is entered     In the second phase, the ""Tactical Air Battle"" phase, you control up to several interceptors in a top down arial battle against the enemy ships. I have seen this tactical phase balance and transform as it was developed, and can say they have done a fantastic job with this and the balance as you research and develope more powerful crafts.      The 3rd and final phase is the ""Tactical Ground Combat"" phase, in which you control your customized team of soldiers (and various Heavy Weapon Platforms) in turn based combat against the alien invades after you have shot them down. You may also enter this phase without shooting down an alien ship if you get your lander to an already grounded UFO, a terrorist site in which the aliens are already grounded and engaged in terrorizing a major city you must defend, or an alien base they have established on Earth's surface.      There is a fantastic variety of terrain, maps, aliens, weapons, armor, etc throught the game, so it always seems fresh, even 40 to 50 hours in. even after my 120+ hours of gameplay (have played offline at times, who knows how many hours there) I still see new maps and have to come up with new strategies/approaches depending on situations.     All in all I would recommend Xenonauts to any gamer that won't be caught up on a lack of graphical complexity, and especially for anyone who likes management, strategy, simulation, or turn based games. At $25, this game is a great buy. I think the only thing keeping them from charging more is the lack of advanced graphics. The content is certainly up there with any Blockbuster game, in my opinion. Thank you to the fine developers at Goldhawk Ineractive for a wonderful product.			"

												Do you like the old XCOM but don't know how to feel about the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within?  This is your game, then.  Old school battling, XCOM hard, and with a refresh visually as well as a somewhat active mod setup and devs coming in.  I actually really like XCOM:EU and XCOM:EW.  But sometimes I want to get my strategy on, and want to tilt the game back towards a strat-action game , instead of an action-strategy game.			"

												I love this game. I think the developers did an amazing job in recreating the old school feel of XCOM and turn-based squad mechanics.Also, I love their dedication to their fans and their game. I bought the pre-release and even though I had to set it aside for almost a year because of bugs, I continuously checked the forums for progress and release dates so that I could play a full version.My ONLY compplaint is that since it has been released, the patches are frequent and although no one reported too many problems, I did have a late game break (due to a wierd strategy game mechanic that cost me too much funding because I couldnt target UFOs for a few days) and had to start all over again.I think Goldhawk Interactive sets and EXCELLENT example for Steam Early Access, especially at a time when many people are skeptical about Early Access companies delivering on promises.

												Sooo, I am currently limited to a weak tablet as only means of computing power and decided to give this game a try, seeing it's requirements were rather humane and the screenshots looked neat. Handdrawn graphics, classic turnbased action. Seemed nice enough.What I got from that was absolutely amazing. This game managed to pull me in entirely and made me go through hours, making progress and playing to see what it might pull out next. The handdrawn nature made the absolute best out of this. Detailed depictions of the autopsies, backgrounds for the sections of your base that look like a masterpiece each and change over the time as you develop new technology. It really proves that great graphical experience has nothing to do with a powerful GPU.The narrative style of the game and lots of lore that come with it only increase the experience and keeps you going on, wanting to see the next artwork and the self loving speech of your chief scientist as he tells in his eccentric way of mixing imperial and metric systems what he developed this time.Gameplay wise there is nothing too revolutionary, the game relying on what had been proven good on the early XCOM games and making you wonder why so much was lost in Enemy Unknown. It's a good strategic experience that challenges your mind at times but doesnt frustrate you or make you desperate to a point that you toss away the game. I definitely recommend this to fans of Xcom and the genre in general, a good experience for casual players and more experienced alike and a pleasure to look at.			"

												Did you used to play XCOM back in the day, and now crave a (slightly) more modern experience? Or maybe you played the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and found it a little too... gamey. Well, send in the Xenonauts!COMPARED TO XCOM:Xenonauts is a more user-friendly, streamlined version that replaces clunky UI for more strategic depth. And this game is DEEP. Spend you hard-earned cash on buffing up your wimpy troopers and giving them sweet, sweet gear or spend it like any rational government agency would and buy more bases and jets. Lots of jets. Upgrade those babies. Yeaaaaahhh... that's it. Jets are the future. I know those lasers look pretty, but jets make those governments happy... yeaaaahhhh...Also you'll be happy to find that, although challenging, you won't have your entire team mind-controlled on the third mission.COMPARED TO XCOM:EU or EW:So you have your flashy graphics and simplified UI. But do you have air combat? Do you have the possibility of managing multiple bases around the world? Maybe you just want one base to have xenonauts in it and the rest filled with jets. Maybe you can't aford anything because you are bad at finances. This game has all the strategic depth that XCOM: EU lacks. Pinch those pennies, ladies and gents.In Closing...For those looking for a more management-oriented, strategic experience, Xenonauts will be more satisfying than its flashier cousins. It has its problems, but the free Community Edition fixes the majority of them. I really hope XCOM:EU and its sequels consider adopting the strategic management elements from this game; it makes it a vastly satisfying experience.			"

												FML This game is hard and unforgiving even on normal.Don't buy/play this thinking ""Oh it's like X-Com but with old graphics!"".X-Com is casual stuff compared to this.Your footsoldiers WILL die.Every new enemy makes you think ""WTF! I can barely beat the others and now THIS THING?""Some tips:Don't be fooled taking a scout tank and thinking that thing is decent.It's papermash against anything but the first 2 alien classes, and even they can destroy it sometimes.Don't build to manny bases at once or you'll run out of funds pretty fast.Advance slowly, nothing is gained by moving too fast/finishing quick.

												To compare Xenonauts to XCom series would be the easiest, but also unfair way to deal with this enormous strategy. Quite certainly and without any shame, Xenonauts developers Goldhawk Interactive are speaking out the truth about their inspiration - Xenonauts is spiritual successor of acclaimed strategic game XCom: UFO Defense. Gameplay resolves in circles which comprises of three main elements: management of your bases and strategic command centers via Geoscape, your game screen; real-time air combat and final stage - turn based ground combat. Although we live in cruel time when hand drawn graphics are unfairly judged as unworthy by most of the (childish) players, get over retro, but charming hand-drawn sprites and you'll enter the world of comprehensive, multilayered strategy where you can manipulate every single aspect of your gaming experience. Numerous classes, weapons, tactics, strategies, upgrades and ideas have been brought upon the table and shrouded in mystery and atmosphere which perfectly collides panic of alien invasion and Cold war isolation.There are numerous selling points to Xenonauts, but one of the most important IS and SHOULD BE that it's an honorable, greatly improved over original and richer hommage to XCom which delivers in every single aspect. It's unbeliveable that an indie team can deliver a game that even surpasses the original on so many fields.If you're into aliens and hungry for some long-lasting strategic battles that will test your nerves, luck and decisions, go for it.

YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Xenonauts Critique (Release Version Review) 

			Views: 4,531		

			An in-depth critique by SwashbucklingSir of the strategic tactical turn-based game Xenonauts, a remake of the classical X-Com series. Does it live up to the spiritual predecessors. Let's find out!		

STORY: Just as in the original X-Com games, extraterrestrial beings attack the earth and the poorly prepared humanity tries desperately to fend off the incoming aggression. Over time we learn to adapt and use the alien technology to our advantage, while at the same time stronger UFOs and aliens try to assault our planet.GRAPHICS: The polished graphics are quite nice and offer a throwback to the old generation, however offering a surprising amount of detail at the same time. Some levels are, by their nature (arctic and desert), rather plain and simple, however other areas are rather impressive.SOUND: The sound design is diffident. It creates a tense atmosphere where not encountering aliens is even worse than having them in sight. The minimal sound effects will make you sit on the edge of your seat as soon as something happens!GAMEPLAY: Both the ground combat as well as the geoscape offer very strategic gameplay and an immense variety due to an array of tactical possibilities! Balancing when to expand your base, which planes to utilise to intercept which UFOs, which equipment to bring for ground assault and when to know that retreat is the best option is key to Xenonauts. The air-to-air combat seems rather shallow though and I found myself using the auto-resolve function most of the time.PROBLEMS: The game does a really poor job of tutorializing itself and thus especially the UI, the cover system and the reaction shot system need a lot of getting used to. Once those initial hurdles have been overcome however, Xenonauts kept growing on me and the more I played, the more strategic options opened up due to the very flexible Turn Unit (TU) system.There are a few minor annoyances like the fact that the soldies customization is incredibly limited since you can only change their name but not face, origin, etc., or the fact that changing equipment is rather time consuming and laborious, or the fact that the UFO's doors close after each turn and thus you always have to put a soldier in harm's way, or the fact that doing an airstrike on a ground target is always worse than actually assaulting the crashsite with your soldiers, even though nothing is to be gained there, resulting in a grind, or the fact that the calculated walk distance sometimes is shorter than it could actually be if you would have optimized the path manually, or the fact that your soldiers cannot utilise their jetpacks to jump over stuff on the highest roof due to level restrictions, etc etc etc. Nontheless, I can forgive all these minor annoyances due to the incredible atmosphere that oozes from Xenonauts, especially when fighting at night in an uninhabited environment.There is one huge problem though, that still hinders me from playing Ironman mode, and that is the camera of Xenonauts. As it cannot be turned and as working with heights is incredibly clunky and frustrating, I feel that improvement on that front is required. Possibile solitions would be to include a rotate option for the camera or the possibility to switch off the walls similar to the Sims games. If no official solution is on the horizon, I hope and feel that the integrated mod support might lead to great solutions provided by the community in the future!COMPARISON WITH ENEMY UNKOWN: Xenonauts has a far greater entry barrier and thus addresses an audience looking for a more strategic experience compared to the latest X-Com game (Enemy Unkown). If you are new to tactical turn-based games, consider checking out X-Com Enemy Unkown with it's Add-On Enemy Within, preferably in a Steam Sale. Should you be looking for a hardcore experience reminiscent of the old X-Com games, consider picking up Xenonauts as it offers not only the tactical turn-based combat but additionally a strategic geoscape, which was simplified heavily in Enemy Unknown.CONCLUSION: Xenonauts is not perfect, however the tactical possibilities and the amazing atmosphere overcome the annoyances and problems. Thus Xenonauts gets a recommendation for every gamer with an interest in tactical-turn-based games.			"

												If you're a fan of the original X-COM: UFO Defense (or other Time-Unit based games, such as Jagged Alliance), then I highly recommend this game. I played X-COM: UFO Defense to death (I even beat it on the highest difficulty without saving the game) and I've played many other games in an attempt to capture that same gameplay feel, but without success. Until now.This is not merely a re-skin of the old-school X-COM, though it is very familiar. There is enough difference in game experience to keep the game fresh. I enjoyed reading all of the research reports and discovering all over again why the aliens are invading, and how to stop them.The game is challenging, but not overwhelming. I will very likely play it again.			"

												I honestly think Xenonaughts is one of the best games ever made, you can customise your troopers & give them different weapons to make them the perfect strike team! The ground combat system is truley amazing, the game designers have kept things simple yet realistic you can crouch behind object thus reducing your chancing of being hit.  I seriously reccomend buying this game if you are a fan of turn based games. My advice is to start the game on normal difficulty and in Ironman mode, this is because you will just end up save scuming when your best unit gets killed.  Your soilders are expendable wich is a shame because you can really get attached to them. Also you can name soilders to people youu know in real life, its pretty funny at times.  There are lots of really good mods that the community have made for this game aswell, so if you get bored with one set of rules you can subscribe to a mod and change them to another set.  This game is amazing! I just wish i had more time to play it.			"

												Game is good.Critics:Wish for a little more description on xenopedia (i.e. newly developed spacecraft ammunition).Ground combat sometimes has some bugs, (Shooting through corners, inner map of spacecraft occasionally does not reveal when entering, spacecraft not enterable)Economic has been simplified (which partially makes sense) as in you don't buy standard equipment such as a pistol.But unfortunatley you cannot sell all of the newly found Alien equipment. Price level when selling home made products are set to be unprofitable.Maps set is limited and with the large amount of ground combats you tend to know the map to begin with.I would love to have some option to make use of scout drones.

								I'll do my best to give a rundown of the game, up to the point I've played, as well as explain it to those of you who have never played a game like it.   Sadly the sheer size and complexity of the game, won't allow me enough room to give you a short and long version of my review.  Either way I hope this helps! If you'd prefer to see the game in action, please take a look at my LP, it should give you a very good idea of what's going on.  If you grabbed the game and are stuck, check it out for a semi-tutorial/walkthrough, as well.

			I finally get to start a game I've been excited to showcase for everyone, Xenonauts! Xenonauts is a Strategic Planetary Defense Simulator set in the cold war era where you are the head of Earth's...		

orhttps://www.youtube.com/bumpymcsquigumsXenonauts has been heralded as the classic X-COM games spiritual successor.  It's been compared to both new and old X-COM and it's still making quite a bit of noise.  The game is very playable and very enjoyable in it's current state but the devs are still hammering out little issues, doing balance and stability updates and trying to get Xenonauts perfect.  If you liked the old OR new X-COM games then you should very much like Xenonauts.  I could spend hours talking about the similarities between the two games, but you can read that virtually anywhere.  So, I will try to explain the game for those of you who have never played it before.Xenonauts is considered a Strategic Planetary Defense Simulator.  It's around the time of the cold war in the late 70's and aliens have invaded the Earth.  You are the commander/leader of the Xenonauts and your goal is to basically do battle with the aliens and save the world.  You are ""graded"" each month by the nations of the world and based on how much you helped them, you will break even, gain or lose monetary support from the nations.  You have a lot of responsibility and control on how everything pans out or works.  You control where you want to set up your bases, what to build in the bases, which aliens ships to shoot down, what to research, what to engineer, what roles your soldiers have, which soldiers to hire, and even which crash sites/missions to take.  There's a ton to do and it can be overwhelming at first.  I'll try to break it down a bit more.Your base is pretty much the very start of the game.  You have to place your base so you have decent satellite coverage over land.  The more individual nations you can cover, the more likely you are to please them when the end of the month comes.  Anytime you shoot down an alien ship or send troops to deal with a crashsite or landed alien vessel you gain a sort of ""reputation points"" with the nation.  The more you deal with aliens in their nation, the more they will fund you.  Likewise if you do not have coverage and alien activity occurs in other places or you ignore it, you will lose those ""rep points"" and funding.  Base placement is important as is what to build in your base.  It might take some experimenting to find the perfect build.  Xenonauts does have a quick start guide to help you and one of the good things is, it does not overkill you with a tutorial phase.  :)The air combat is a pretty cool feature.  There is a mini-game you can do for the air combat when you send your interceptors after the alien ships.  It's well done and enjoyable but one of the really cool features is that the autoresolve is actually really really good.  So if you don't care to do the air to air mini-game, you generally can autoresolve it and skip it.  To explain the mini-game briefly, you can pause or unpause at any point and your ship(s) and the alien ship(s) will close with one another.  Then any weapons you have active at the time will fire on the aliens.  The aliens will fire back and you have the ability to do evasive manuevers as well as retreating.  The aliens also can avoid your missle fire, so you have to plan accordingly.  It's all sort of RTS-ish with the ability to tactically pause.The bulk of the game is spent in the ground missions.  It's what makes or breaks this type of game.  You have a roster of soldiers.  Hopefully you outfitted a decent variety.  There are preset classes as well as the ability to make your own.  It doesn't CHANGE the soldiers in anyway, it's more to ease you gearing up people.  The classes are: Assault, Sniper, Shield, Heavy, Rifleman, Scout & Rocketeer(and of course the ability to create your own).  So basically you click and assign your soldier to assault, outfit it with whatever you want, then save the gear configuration.  Then anyone you make an assault class will automatically get that gear.  They have different icons in certain places so it makes it easier for you to tell what role they play.All that being said, you chose your soldiers, and deploy them in a drop ship.  Send the dropship to an alien landed craft or a crashsite and the ground battle begins.  It's a throw back to classic squad turn based strategy combat.  It's your turn and you can use any of your soldiers in any order.  You can move each and every one of your soldiers before you end your turn, then it's the aliens turn.  You move cover to cover and with the implementation of the shield units, you even have mobile cover!  All your moves/shots/actions are based on TU's (Time Units).  So any time you move out, turn, crouch, throw a grenade, or shoot, you use up a certain amount of TU's.  You can conserve TU's to make sure you can still shoot and move, or have enough for reactionary fire (taking a shot at an alien if it moves past you or shoots at you).  The entire ground combat system is done extremely well and once you get the hang of it, it's amazing.Those are the big things to cover most of the game.  A few other things worthy of mentioning is the fact that you can rename your soldiers, aircraft, and I'm pretty sure vehicles as well.  Naming your soldiers generally makes you care more about them and is a nice tool.  Your soldiers DO level up, they climb in ranks, the lowest being Private and the highest being Commander.  Each time you go on a mission with your soldiers they have a chance to not only earn a promotion(i.e. level up) they also have a chance of increasing their stats.  The longer your soldiers survive combat and the more they do in the missions the better they become.  So it pays to play it safe and keep your people alive.  There's a ton to this game and I like virtually all of it.  I don't think I could explain each and every part of the game as there is simply SOO much.  I'll give a word of caution about some stuff and those are kind of my ""things I don't like"", or ""what's bad"" in Xenonauts.Two things I'd say to be cautious of are:1.  At the current point in the game, the devs are still hammering out issues here and there.  I have literally only run into one major issue at this point and that was my ironman game got stuck in permanent ""Alien's Turn - Hidden Movement Screen"".  They had planned to take the game out of early access at the end of May, but decided it's not quite ready.  My word of caution is to NOT use Ironman mode until the game is out of early access.2.  Money is a bit of a challenge in this game.  Spending enough to keep everyone happy and getting good coverage but not so much as to over extend your funds and end up negative is a big challenge.  A LOT of people are having the issue of balancing what they need and what they can afford.  I know Goldhawk Interactive is still doing balancing, so it's something they are trying to tweak.  It's just something to be cautious of.All in all, Xenonauts is an amazing game and I highly recommend it.  The UI is great, the graphics are nice, the music fits the game perfectly.  It's well worth the investment of time and money, it draws you in, it's challenging, and rewarding when you pull off a perfect plan.  Grab it now and support the Devs! "

												No disrespect to 2K's XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but this is exactly how I imagined a modern XCOM game would look like. It's a must buy for XCOM fans. It's a must buy for fans of the genre. The developer's story about the game's creation is also worth mentioning. Read it (and also the included short novel) to really enjoy the game.

												This is almost completely a redone X-Com and guess what? That is great! It offers depth and the core game play of X-com is so very satisfying. They fixed some of the biggest issues with the now old X-com. It looks decent and is now set in the late 70's which adds some flavor to it. All and all I would recommend this to serious tactics and strat buffs.			"

												Look at all these crazy video games about alien invasions!!! There are many ways you can waste aliens from the comfort of your slowly flattening computer chair. What's Xenonauts all about then? Oh, it's a remake of the original XCOM: Enemy Unknown!Like the original XCOM, aliens invade, you shoot the aliens in the face, etc. Also like the original XCOM: It takes the ♥♥♥♥ing scenic route!!! Seeing through a game of Xenonauts will take a long, long time, and a lot of the time spent will occur in ground combat, where the idiots you're guiding through the ♥♥♥♥♥ town or the ♥♥♥♥ forest will need constant adjustment in order not to get blown up (and during the early game, your dudes will get blown up as much as the ones you're shooting, because this game is balls hard. Even on Normal.). The scenic route is made even more scenic-ier, because all the missions start to bleed through and look the same. It's not all tedium - the game allows you to walk into the enemy's UFO, kill everyone inside, and hold it for five turns to win the mission automatically, which is a nice touch. The game is all about destructible environments, so you can take a squad of fast-moving shotgunners, blow a hole in the side of the UFO with a rocket launcher, and win a mission that way. There's all these neat little additions that fit nicely with the original's ethos (saving AP for return fire on aliens dumb enough to wander into firing range). There's also a few unconventional ones to make gameplay less pedantic and fussy, such as allowing unlimited flares on night missions. The developers COULD have not included them, making night missions extremely sucktacular engagements due to a very short LOS and with one soldier having to leave his gun in the dropship to be 'the guy who throws lights everywhere who is shot from behind by some extra-terrestrial ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hiding in a tree'. But they did, and you can throw as many as you want. Yay!So it's kind of bland and it goes on for a long while (a campaign run is in the 50-100 hour ballpark). But it's a neat take on XCOM-style play, and mods are being added by the community to hammer out flaws. It's not going to replace the 2012 XCOM for me, but if you're looking for an update that captures the original very well, give this a shot.			"

												I love this game. I've never played any actual X-COM games since most of them came out before I was even born so for those of you who want that sort of view point read another review I suppose. Anyways, so far as I'm concerned this is a really great turn-based strategy and while the graphics/animations aren't that great in themselves they are crisp and clean enough when paired with the music and sound to create a very immersive experience. In fact the immersion is really my only complaint about this game, that complaint being that it is too immersive. Seriously. The sound and music of this game is just ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. It really makes you feel like the entirety of humanity is completly screwed cause these aliens with their super advanced technology are here to wreck ♥♥♥♥ and kill. Not to mention how attached you get to your soilders. Had this one that had seen some real ♥♥♥♥ and been with us since the very beginning with no small number of kills and in one move I killed her. I had her run up to a corner and hide behind some crates then I clicked ""end turn"" and a reaper came around the corner stabbed her and boom turned her into a zombie. In just 3 seconds I had just lost my most experienced and well equiped soilder all because I thought those crates looked like a safe place to hide. The sound she made when she died didn't help either nor the fact that I had to kill her zombified self. It was really quite heartbreaking. This game is immersive and depressing, it will make you contemplate the meaning life, question if anything really matters, and it will keep you coming back 'cause ♥♥♥♥ those alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s welcome to Earf.

												Xenonauts is NOT: A brand new experience cross-platform remake of XCOM franchise, with hyper photorealistic 3D models, motion capture animations, addictive multiplayer, improved gameplay, gamepad-ready interface and focus on the latest generation of gamers...Xenonauts IS:    Ufo:Enemy Unknown. With slightly better graphics, UI and mods. Love it.			"

												I really want to like Xenonauts, but the unadulterated unfairness in the first hours is too much. Soldiers in cover dying to single shots from enemies across the map (who you are advised to engage at long range), enemies firing through an angle that was 100% blocked for my turn, assault soldiers with high reflex doing nothing as aliens waltz up to their face and one shot them.I was hoping for a version of XCOM:EU with more depth, only got frustration.

												After almost 110 hours of gameplay time, I cannot recommend this game.Let's start with the pros. The air battles are interesting. They certainly are an upgrade to the original XCOM. Unfortunatly, there very few cases where you would want to manually resolve them. Once you reach mid-game, you will in most cases use the autoresolve feature. The kick for playing another XCOM can be a plus if you are a nostalgic.Cons include:* Limited enemies variety. They get stronger, they get more hitpoints and armor but they are just the same.* In about 70% of the cases, your soldiers will die in a single hit. This highly limits all your strategic choices in ground battles.* Still quite a few bugs are present. Mission objectives are wrong, trees appear in ships, soldier can go off map limits, impossible line of sight are visible, there is an annoying looping walking sound effect bug from some standing enemy.* There is a just a single overall strategy: get air superiority ASAP. It is almost impossible to lose once you get it and you can achieve it early on in the game.* Good base locations are limited. There is a pattern that you must follow.* Limited maps variety. You will see them once and you will see them again and again.* Tedious grind. Research is slow and painful. You will be facing many of the same alien waves before you progress and nothing important seems to be happening during that time.* AI is predictable and quite dumb. It won't be looking to get into cover that much, it will always target the solider that is easier to hit, it will only use grenades when you are grouped. It does not try to flank you.* Vehicles are mostly useless. They are often limited to the surrounding area around the dropship because they are too big to go anywhere. They replace 2 soldiers and they are only worth like 1.2 soldier. In the end, you will not be using them. They do not offer enough strategic possibilities.Only buy the game if you are a huge fanatic of the XCOM series, turn-based games, you played them all and the game is on sale.			"

												I like old UFO games and I like the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown (and EW add on and LW mod). I like tactical games. I like turn based games.And I really tried to like Xenonauts. I tried to like it because in theory it's a great game and because I wanted to justify spending money on it. But I couldn't.EVERYTHING in this game is crappy. The first jarring thing is air combat. While in theory very good, it's just too bugged. About 5-10% of my air fights end up in my and enemy aircrafts circling around each other forever at the same spot, and if I try to move my plane it's an obvious suicide, so I can either do that or alt+F4. Other than this annoyance air combat is fine as it is, however, it's much better to just hit autoresolve and spare yourself some irritation from time to time. The next extremely annoying thing is a field of vision of soldiers. It seems they are are incredibly shortsighted to a point they can't see anything over 10 meters away and miss targets that are five meters away by fvkking miles. The best tactic is to run at enemies to stand one meter away from them as in melee fight and then shoot them because otherwise your dvmb ♥♥♥♥♥♥ t4rded soldier will miss or even perhaps kill one of the other squad members shooting in a wrong direction by a 90 degrees. In addition, while the player is walking around the maps almost blindly, aliens always know where the player's units are. Even if they are on the other side of the map they already see you. So skreew you if you wanted to use a short vision against the enemy. The next thing is that aliens just love ""camping"". A bunch of them will just sit in their aircraft with a closed door (so far I did not find a way to just blow upthe whole aircrafts with those t4rrds inside) and wait for you. If you run a soldier over there, they will murder him and close the door. In consequence you just put a bunch of soldiers around  the door, run with one tw4t through the fvkken door and get him shredded due to aliens' reaction fire and then shoot everything inside with the rest of the squad. Every fight same tactics. It's repetitive and boring.While your guys can't shoot anything 5 meters away, aliens seem to have better aim, but that's not even very noticeable. What is very noticeable is that sometimes they shoot from twice your vision or through walls which are impenetrable for your guys. Ultimate trolls.It's also funny to see a fully armored combat vehicle to explode into pieces after a ""bullet"" from the enemy's gun hits it. It looks like a tank exploding after being shot by a gun. Why, what I don't even... either don't put such vehicles in the game if they seem too powerful or make them very expensive, but why put such a vehicle only to be as easily destroyed as a random soldier? Especially when the vehicle takes 6 slots, meaning you could put 6 soldiers on its place? Sure, it has a very powerful gun, but so what if it gets destroyed withing a few rounds.The game also crashes like crazy on Linux. Loading new map... crash. Air combat... crash. New round... crash. I do not recommend this game to anyone. It's a waste of money, time and nerves. If you like old XCOM/UFO, then just play them or go ahead with the modern casualized version that is XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, which is still a great game on its own. Try out the Long War for more fun. But for your own good stay the heck away from a tvrrd that is Xenonauts. I wasted money that would buy me a few sacks of potatoes or some burgers, do not make the same mistake. Actually, don't even buy it when this game will get cheap and hits -75% sales. It's just unplayable.			"

												The Metacritic is actually right on the money on this game.The game is a decent stab at the old x-com game. Interesting setting, faithful to the original game mechanic (both the good bits and not so good bits), nice art direction and basically an enjoyable, stable indie game. Personally I rate this game better than the vanillar XCOM. BUT, the EW expansion and the Long War mod are both far superior to Xeno. Why? Xeno suffers from being a pre-KS funded indie project that presumably had only a modest budget. The later half of the game runs out of steam with generic aliens, bland tech and pure incremental weapons era progression that makes everything kind of dull. WARNING: there are even LESS things to do than in the vanillar XCOM.If you are itching for the classic x-com game and wished XCOM had TU instead, then pick up Xeno for a spin. Otherwise, try the long war mod.			"

												I really love & hate this game. The entire premise is fantastic. What I really hate is that aircombat is frustratingly stupid (fighters won't fire their missiles even when they have a lock sometimes). Ground combat has the oddity of even seasoned soldiers overreacting and shooting your own guys when they see an alien. These buggy bits could be argued to be realistic... but only slightly. Also everytime your soldiers are in sick bay and then come back they conveniently forget all the items they were carrying into battle before. I know you can make new roles... but it's all a huge pain in the rear.You can't lob a friggin grenade anywhere you can't visually see... which is pretty much how grenades are supposed to be used.The ultimate armored suit doesn't seem to be that effective (pretty sure my guy gets hurt just as much in that thing as out of it.Berserking is stupid... your guy will decide to turn around and shoot his own people.Also... no one warned me you could lose countries and not gain them back. Even though the death toll only states there's a few thousand killed. It makes no sense unless the aliens really did cleanse the earth in those places, which they didn't.This has the makings of a great game. Xenonauts 2 will hopefully improve upon this because the idea is really really great in conception but not execution. Just too many frustrating things (especially the combat that leaves a 95% burst with 0 rounds impacting on target) Also the heavy machine gun should carry about 200 rounds per drum... but you only have 30 rounds per.

												Why go throught all the trouble of making such a realistic remake if it is to break all the realism by making the earth flat ?The original XCOM had it all right, the earth was a sphere.  And I'm not just speaking about the type of map projection used, I'm talking about the way aircrafts are travelling, the way radar ranges are depicted and things like that.I don't feel like I'm defending a planet, I feel like I'm defending a flat table with a distorted map drawn on it, or more accurately a cylinder since the map connects on the sides.In this game, on the ''flat map'' globe, the radar ranges are circular, no matter where you are on the globe, well they should'nt, the range of the radar should be factored for the fact that it's a flat map, it should widen towards the poles, otherwise the map is all wrong.  Every aircraft travel in a straight line, just like if the earth was flat, well they should'nt.  The map is distorted, and so are the trajectories and distances.  Now what would be the advantage of putting a base on the north pole, since the distances are so wrong when you consider the earth as a cylinder with very wide poles.  For example, in real life, the shortest route from the southern tip of Chile to Australia doesn't involve going all the way on a due east trajetory, it should be trought the south pole.  ( Where is the south pole anyway in this game ? )  By using such an unrealistic approach to the ''globe'' aspect of the game, it really breaks a big aspect for anybody who liked managing strategically the globe part in XCOM.  Once again, the original game from 20 years ago had it all correct, why change that ?Don't get me wrong, I'm going to recommend this game to any XCOM fan.  XCOM was one of the greatest game of all times and any attempts at bringing back some memories of it should be funded and encouraged.  This remake is an excellent game, with one unnecessary big flaw in my opinion.			"

""on-progress""-entries on their forums and ""closure"" as a PDF-file as an extra-content).---Here is also a comparison of Xenonauts to (Open)Xcom in “what do you get out of the package”-style.:What do you get:- Simplified base-management- Reduced amount micromanaging inventory-wise- More guaranteed soldier training- Cover-system - Vaulting- More alien mission variants and events- More control over air-combat- More weapon & equipment type-variants- Surprisingly good hard-science-fiction-story- More personalities among the aliens- Story-alerts and auto-progression- Grenade Quick-slotWhat you won’t get:- Charts / Graphs- Same amount ground-combat actions - Fidelity-options- Less tweaking possibilities- No elevated grounds- More complex super-weapons- Well-enough in-depth instruction-booklet / manualThe bad(dies):- Lots of line-of-sight bugs- Cheating Alien Intelligence- The almost identical “waiting-game”-problem- “Roofed” Funding amount - Only affected by interceptions and not ground-combat-results- No “industrialist”-option- Unavoidable non-Xenonaut-casulties- Some other general bugs, especially the ones related to roof of buildingsOther mention-worthy things:- Dropships don’t have cargo-space /weight-limit but max-personnel-amount-limit- “Smoke-grenades” work as a significant accuracy-penalty instead of line-of-sight-reducing-block-wall-thing - Psionics come in more variations, but can also be completely disabled (via “modding”)- “Stun / Unconsciousness” is permanent- You can capture / recover UFOs by clearing and holding them for five turns, thus not needing to hunt down the last strayed alien- Modding in generalMods come in all forms:From simple XML-file-modifications (which pretty much anyone can do since the XML-files are “written” for the most part in plain-English, provided one knows the small “nuances” (E.G. “Time-Units” are called “ActionPoints / AP” in the XML-files)).To more complex graphical and mechanical overhauls and additions, which also includes more-or-less total-conversions (E.G. “X-Division”).In this regard tweaking the game for ones likings, this can be surprisingly simple:For example I “disabled” “Hallucination”-psionic-attack by simply changing few numbers of the time-unit / action-point-cost for this particular attack-type into over the maximum value anything in this game can have in total;I did this due how utterly un-fair it was in comparison to actual “MInd Control” (mainly because because “Berserks” happen instantly when the human / Xenonauts-turn starts (Hallucination 100%-guaranteeing them shooting at team-mates), while mind controlled-units are unavailable for two-turns and only act during alien-turns (thus allowing you to subdue the units either knocking them out or suppressing them, or simply taking cover from up-coming friendly-fire).)I personally recommend doing most of small-tweaks (E.G. adjustments of the “Field-of-View-cone(s)) by own hand to avoid conflicts or otherwise game breaking down (especially since a large amount of the “Steam Workshop”-items are very outdated).“Community Edition” or at least using various “Fix Packs” and such is my suggested way of playing this game, especially since they’re still on-going (as of posting this review that is).---Following link also contains some nice comparisons:http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenonauts------""Xenonauts"" is a surprisingly good attempt to make a good ""Xcom-clone""-game....I frankly really don't what else to add this end-note-summary-thing...---------			"

												Game too hard for me Im going back to Xcom...I'm really impressed with what Goldhawk Interactive has done in Xenonauts but as I've said before it's harder than Xcom, or at least the RNG really kicks you in the balls and with outragesly bad luck as mine who needs Insane diffuculty.It's pretty much like the old UFO Enemy Unkown interface just improved. But if your luck is worse than mine then you might just lose the whole game just because your Xenonauts can't defend against Psi attacks and guess what unlike an Xcom Warrior, Xenonauts can't learn Psionics so you would have to rely on either bravery or Mods to protect them from the attacks.

								Xenonauts is the best. The guidance and action may be terse, but the strategy and 1980's setting are engaging. Give a recruit a proper callsign after they kill their first invader and later- when the plasma is flying hot and your squad is pinned down behind the burning wreckage of your laser robot tank, when the assault robots and zombie culling reapers draw near, when the electroshock grenades and stun gas rockets have exploded and Major Blast HardCheese only has enough time units and ammunition in his machine gun for one more burst...You will know what you must do.

								A very loyal remake of the original X-COM, Xenonauts is a perfect substitute for people who felt Firaxis' XCOM was too shallow, with only one skyranger and base, and as the creator of the original X-CCOM put it 'the geoscape [feels] irrelevent'. Xenonauts, despite having a much smaller budget and team working on it, manages to capture the spirit of the original game much better than the recent XCOM.			"

												I think at first, like many people. I was being put off this game becuase i was copmaring it directly to XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Once you break away that stigma, and take it as a standalone game - it really shines.The game is brutal, and the maps are nice to play. I will amdit that multi story building can be hard to navigate, but in a 2-D Spirte enviroment that was always going to be a problem. I think with the addition of the community edition and the hundreds of new maps it added, you are almost guarnteed to never come across the same map in the same playthrough.I think overall this game is good. I wouldn't say excellent as there are a few things that i think could be improved. But they are just minor things.Get this game, you won't regret it.			"

												I never got the chance to play the original X-Com.  I heard the legends, of course, of all the things it did right that no other game (incuding newer X-Com titles) had managed: the perfect balance of weapons and gear so that every type of loadout has its use, the punishing yet fair difficulty (the aliens are stronger than you, but it's always possible to beat them), the general sense of dread at every crash site, the amazing metagame of base building and resource allocation across continents, and so many other features that added up to an amazing, tense, immersive, and satisfying experience.I cannot say if Xenonauts is as good as X-Com, or how the two compare, but I can say this: Xenonauts does everything right.  It sounds crazy to say, but it's true.  The balance of both your equipment and enemies', especially with the latest patches and Community Edition, is perfect.  Both the metagame and tactical encounters are complex and satisfying.  Every choice, every action has weight, tension, and immense significance to your war with the alien threat.  Battles are tense, tactics are paramount; your soldiers' survival is tenuous, but if you use the right tactics, there is hope.So, I cannot say if Xenonauts is as good as X-Com was, but I can say that it is as good as X-Com's hype, which is even more impressive.

												A worthy successor to the classic X-COM legacy. In my opinion, Xenonauts takes the best parts of X-COM and expands on them while downplaying the less fun parts, while giving the whole thing a nice facelift. Fans of the series will likely be satisfied, even at the $25 price point. Others may want to wait until a sale happens.			"

Even if you do everything right, there's a good chance one of your guys will take a fatal shot. This game is brutal, but rewarding, and will give you all kinds of entertaining stories of how your team took on the alien invasion. Also, a few ridiculous stories of how random civilian NPCs pulled impossible feats of badassery out of nowhere.			"

												This game is as close as I've seen to a ""clone"" of a previous game. That being said, the game it is cloning (X-com, the original) was a 5-star classic, and this version of it is actually quite good. Xenonauts managed to preserve nearly all the best parts of the original, while fixing some of its bigger flaws (especially in regard to the user interface) and avoiding introducing any new negative elements that step on the experience. I also played the X-com reboot, which enjoys the triple-A budget and graphics lacking in Xenonauts, and find Xenonauts to be the much better game. The X-com reboot forces you to choose (over and over) from a set of missions where you can only do one from the set (and the aliens win automatically in the places you opted not to go). I really, really -hate- that mechanic. Xenonauts gives you multiple threats at the same time, but gives you the option (over time, if you play well) to build multiple bases, acquire more interceptors, bomb the crashed alien ships you can't or don't wish to engage on the ground, even run multiple dropships full of troops, letting you eventually build up to where you can deal with more than one of those threats successfully -- perhaps even all of them, in some cases. That, I found, to be much more satisfying than the heavy-handed ""pick one and only one"" mission to do, where you are forced to sit and watch the world burn everywhere else. X-com2 is about to come out, and it looks like more of the same: smaller squads, only one base, only one dropship, a very heavy hand from the designer, channeling you down the road the way he wants you to travel at, at the pace he sets. Probably still has that cheap design shortcut of aliens not spawning on the map until you trigger their scripted appearance, when they always get a free move on you. (You can never catch them by surprise: there is no strategy that will let you get the drop on any of them at first encounter). Whereas in Xenonauts, the enemy units behave under the same rules you do: they are all on the map at the start of the combat and have to move using the same kind of Time Units restrictions that your troops must endure. You can lure some of the more aggressive alien types in to traps or crossfires, while others will patiently set traps for YOU that you have to figure out how to deal with. Luck plays a smaller role in Xenonauts, so of course that is the game that I favor.Do yourself a solid and pick up Xenonauts instead of the Xcom reboots. It's fun, challenging, and highly replayable, with more emphasis on strategy and tactics, more room for creativity and variation in how you tackle the challenges, and has more of the goodness that made the original X-com so special.

												I was excited about this release back in 2013 but for many reasons have not gotten around to it until recently. I don't have a lot of hours in yet but all I can say is WOW. This is the most faithful reproduction of X-COM: Enemy Unknown by a wide, wide margin - and that's no knock on the recent reboot by Firaxis; they are simply dramatically different games. Xeno distinguishes itself with the faithful depth and unforgiving, unapologetic tactical harshness that is carried by poor or reckless decision making. It is amazing that we have both XCOM and Xeno, and that they are both such great games and I found a fantastic article below by Phil Hartup that dives so well in to exaclty this topic and provides an excellent history of what the franchise has gone through. Absolutely worth the time to read if your exposure to the franchise is rooted larely in the recent reboot, and if you loved the classic from 1994 and have, like so many of us, given up hope of a faithful reproduction after decades of disappointment - this is a slam-dunk to run long nights in to the dawn.http://www.newstatesman.com/killing-time/2013/10/xcom-enemy-unknown-xenonauts-dumbed-down-game-any-less-fun "

Challenging, but doesn't take cheap shots. Sometimes your ground units will get their asses handed to them. It's immersive and addictive like a Sid Meier title, and has a great amount of background material (Xenopedia) to give it serious depth. There's a level editor and basic modding tools included. The music and ambient audio work well with the game.CON:Air-to-air combat is too easy. The ground combat graphics are bland and somewhat dated. There's no multiplayer mode (!?!?!!?).			"

												I'm a huge, HUGE fane of the original X-Com.  I was really looking foward to this game and hoped an indie company could restore the glorius gameplay that was X-com -- but they fall short.They really try to be true to the source material, but nothing quite meshes.  Graphics and animations are meh and the A.I. still makes those magical shots from 300 yards away, around the tree, under the car, through the two house windows -- killing your soldier instantly.  On the other end of the spectrum, you will miss the alien standing next to you, with a plasma shot gun and 99% CTH -- and if you are lucky enough to hit it, it will take a whopping 5% damage, while the other 7 of your soldiers will panic, drop their gun, and run right up to the enemies for a merciful quick killing.It's very frustrating, to say the least.  So close, but so far.			"

												""When it comes down to it, “Xenonauts” is a challenging and at times, gut-wrenching experience…especially if you’re a perfectionist like me.  Watching each one of my soldiers die was a painful reminder of just how unforgiving this game can be.  On the other hand, it makes victory taste all the sweeter.  It’s currently priced at $24.99 (as of 6/19/14), which is a good deal all things considered.  When you consider the amount of play time you’ll spend on one playthru (twenty to forty hours on average), you’ll realize that you’re getting a lot of bang for your buck.  The “XCOM” Firaxis/2K Games remake originally retailed for fifty to sixty bucks, just to put things in perspective.  This game IS worth your time and money, though those who get easily frustrated by difficult games should probably remove all breakables from their immediately vicinity before playing.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/xenonauts/ "

												For those who loved X-Com: UFO Defense/UFO: Enemy Unknown and want to have roughly the same experience as that 20+ year old game with the benefits of modern technology, then this is the game for you. Big battles, multiple bases, and a pretty severe difficulty. But there is new stuff too, like a better interface, a variety of neat toys to use against the aliens, and much more. On the downside, It can get a bit repetitive over time as you send a team to clear out yet another UFO you shot down, but I guess that just adds to the atmosphere of an endless conflict where you are badly outnumbered and outgunned. But you can fix that in time, of course. Still, this game will eat up alot of time, so be prepared for a major time commitment if you are planning on playing this to the end.Save the world from the aliens! Yey.			"

												For those who loved X-Com: UFO Defense/UFO: Enemy Unknown and want to have roughly the same experience as that 20+ year old game with the benefits of modern technology, then this is the game for you. Big battles, multiple bases, and a pretty severe difficulty. But there is new stuff too, like a better interface, a variety of neat toys to use against the aliens, and much more. On the downside, It can get a bit repetitive over time as you send a team to clear out yet another UFO you shot down, but I guess that just adds to the atmosphere of an endless conflict where you are badly outnumbered and outgunned. But you can fix that in time, of course. Still, this game will eat up alot of time, so be prepared for a major time commitment if you are planning on playing this to the end.Save the world from the aliens! Yey.			"

												FINAL RELEASE REVIEW: This review was originally a negative review. It turned into a positive one, and now it's negative. Prepare for a rant.Xenonauts still feels like it's in beta. Civilian A.I is stupid. You can't tell them to stay put; they still run around like idiots and get killed. The game pretends the aliens have moved. A lot of the time, you won't be able to see an alien after your team JUST took potshots at it. You will have to move up a squadmate (wasting that soldier's TU) so that you can see the alien again, which has not moved. The game's rendering system is RIDICULOUS. Here's an example: I activated C4 on the front door of an alien ship. The turn ended. The area where the fire should have been was dark. It seemed like the C4 failed. I brought my soldier up and he walked into fire that didn't even render until he stepped on it. Seriously? Also, if you have your tank (hunter scout car) blow up in front of the UFO doors, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. You can't open the doors, shoot through the tank, get on top of it, or push it away. The animations are lacking severely. The doors just snap; there isn't any cool animation of their opening. The geoscape takes a bizarre amount of time to load, too. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing PICTURE, not some 3D holographic image from XCOM: Enemy Unknown. The soldiers are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, too. Am I hiring my family members and people off the street to join my organization or something? Like I said, this game still feels like it's in beta.			"

												More Reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.comIf you were looking for the spiritual successor to the X-Com franchise, Xenonauts feels like the game you’ve been waiting for. Even though The Buraeu: X-Com Declassified and Enemy Unknown/Within were great games in their own right, they just didn’t quite capture the same feeling that the classic games had. While some things need to evolve and change, there’s something to be said about making a recipe with most of the same ingredients to enjoy the meal you remember. (That’s especially true if they are going to say that it tastes similar.) I covered a lot of the basics of this game in the X-Com: Enemy Unknown VS. Xenonauts review so I’m not going to cover everything since Goldhawk Interactive finished up everything that needed fixing to transition from Early Access to Launch status pretty smoothly.Let’s start with difficulty shall we? That was a trademark aspect of the originals. (I still can’t complete TFTD.) I started Xenonauts on the Regular difficulty and had both starter interceptor planes shot down in one-on-one dogfights. (At which point I had nothing to shoot down enemy aircraft.) The enemy craft ended up landing after downing my two aircraft giving me my first mission… out of pity. During the pity mission (which happened to be a night mission of course) I had lost two soldiers before I got ten spaces from my Chinook from enemies I couldn’t see. Needless to say I started over and changed the difficulty to easy. I usually don’t like playing games on easy, but this game just kicked me in the nuts and laughed in my face.Thinking that the game was going to be too easy after the difficulty was changed was a bad assumption on my part. That little dead alien in the corner reminded me that I shouldn’t let my guard down. This little bugger skirted around the edge of the map taking pot shots at my guys almost killing two of them. I was throwing out flares left and right to try to find him to no avail. I eventually found him by sending one soldier randomly to the side of the map and just happened to spot him. Needless to say, when he became visible, the bullets went flying.Moving on, research has been overhauled to be more convenient for the player. Let’s just say that you go out on your first mission and you clean house very well. When you get back to base you have only a few options to research, general concepts like alien electronics or alien interrogations if you managed to capture an alien alive. What about the dissections and the alien craft that you left behind? Well, it’s being taken cared of. That’s being done behind the scenes and you’ll get that info in good time and the other related research options therein. You still have plenty of things to research so don’t feel robbed here; Xenonauts makes research feel streamlined.Another interesting note is that wounded soldiers heal more realistically. This is a neat update while at the same time pretty frustrating. I liked it when people just took a few days off and then poof they were combat ready and good-as-new. In Xenonauts they take time to become combat ready with reduced stats and even more time to fully recover. When the number of days are up for your soldier to enter the field again, they are given a percentage of how much they’ve recovered. You’ll have less health to run around with and lose when you get shot. As time goes on, they do get better, but that’s with time.There are plenty of different looking locals between deserts, desert bases, towns, farms and enemy bases. They have different maps for the same type as well so you’ll never really feel that “you’ve been here before”. That is a very nice feature, because few things feel as cheap than reused levels. Some may call the graphic choice dated, but not only does it look nice aesthetically, the devs do a great job setting a creepy atmosphere with it. I really like the presentation of Xenonauts.One last note, the NPCs in Xenonauts are freaking amazing. Some are just helpless civilians and do stupid civilian things, but the guys with guns (soldiers and farmers) actually use thier guns to defend themselves. I’ve had some levels be finished by some random farmer killing an alien before my guys got to the part of the map. Well played Goldhawk Interactive, well played.Score: Tasty!There is a lot to love here for fans of tactical games. Nothing feels rushed and sometimes that’s a concern people have when games come out of Early Access. It’s all smooth running and gunning here. With the varied locals and very nice looking isometric scenery, there is some really good “retro” (if you want to call it that) eye-candy to be had. Goldenhawk Interactive doesn’t go out of their way to revamp the series with light blooms and next-gen graphics. They pull from what made the originals so great and modernize it. I have nothing bad to say about Xenonauts (especially since they allow me to lower the difficulty setting). I will try a harder difficulty later, but as of now I appreciate having my ego padded a little more.			"

8/10, Very good gameReview is for default v1.59 game. For enchanted playthrough, see notes about CE-version.True successor in the spirit to the UFO: Enemy Unknown (1994), its sequel Terror from the Deep (1995) and Microprose's latest 'UFO-colors' game, X-Com: Apocalypse (1997).Earth is under the attack by menacing alien forces which are gathered around the Earth orbit. Player is tasked to command Xenonaut-organization and plan the battle against this threat. Game consists of two parts: Geoscape where strategic planning happens and tactical turn-based combat which is heart & bone of the UFO-games.When compared to it's predecessors, game plays fairly lot in the same way. On Geoscape you build your own bases and try to maintain air superiority. Xenonauts get their (small) funding from the continents of the Earth. So one of the top priorities is build air superiority cover over the world parts if you want to receive spending money in the upcoming months. Air superiority means that you have to acquire interceptors, research upgrades to keep your edge up and shoot down UFOs. In addition of embarking to turn-based battle, any UFOs shot down could be airstriked for fixed sum of money and saved real world time.Aliens seem to first have problems to enter inside Earth atmosphere except with small crafts but that is rapidly changing. Therefore ground combat also has an important role: you acquire alien artefacts and your hired soldiers will get more experience. Increasing your soldier's statistics is one game aspect where you prepare to the end game. Also as this is an UFO-game, there are some inevitable combat losses which means you need to keep up healthy sized pool of soldiers. Also you have to protect your bases which usually means keeping the garrison on the base.On turn-based you get usual TB-game mechanics, with mid-turn interrupts and soldier movement is limited by 'time units'. Game design blunders are mostly avoided: xeno-soldiers can 'peek' from the corner facing diagonally towards it. Protection and cover is calculated only using the largest blocking object, making the decisions very simple. Weapons are labelled in very generic categories instead of giving you multitudes of the same. Assault rifle is an assault rifle, until you get a laser rifle (which works in exactly same way). This means you could pick generic weapon genre and chosen weapon would work in that role as expected. Combat system sounds very simple, but in practice it's working. Sure, you could have bad luck with the dice roll and aliens might get lucky shots, but that's UFO for you... do not leave your soldiers to the line of sight. :-)However, some things does not exist even advertised, like jumping through windows or are not advertised at all even they are actually useful (melee attack). Structural damage seems quite mild and there are no spectacular building collapses and wild-fires like in Apocalypse. Game will still have some irritating bugs for which I seriously considered score of 7 from 10. Also I would have liked to have several dropships on the same mission to train my rookie hordes, but you can't get everything, eh? Until you realize there's modders community...Interface works enough well to do it's job. That's all I have to say which means it's pretty mediocre, simplistic but it won't get in your way. Some people on forums have commented on lack of tablet/touch screen support.To the credit of the writer every game tech has fairly convincing description how this particular piece fits to the game universe. Even the upgrade works in exactly same way - like assault rifle works technically exactly as plasma rifle  - there is explanation how this particular piece of technology would affect the game universe. Also game soundtrack consists only of few pieces, but these are fairly moody.If you have waited all these years to pickup old UFO/X-Com and play again, look no further than Xenonauts. Game package additionally contains a short novel. Fairly generic reading, but entertaining enough and it adds to the game lore.Edit: To avoid already fixed bugs and errors in the game, you may want to use Community Edition (CE) version for your first playthrough. You can install CE version through the Steam.			"

There are also mods to make your game even more similar to original (music sounds etc) I had a lot of fun with firaxis official remake, but lets be honest it was very simplified compared to original. Xenonauts its only way to bring you 100% xcom experience. 9/10+ its almost 100% mechanical clone of original xcom/ufo+ very engaging and demanding but well balanced and rewarding game+ combat missions have this special mood of original game+ dogfights are much better then in original+ full mod support can make game even more original like- graphics are very outdated, its not a big deal in game like that but still they could done better job- some alien races are not well designed- cryssalid (reapers) are not even close so scarry and demanding like in original  "

												I'ts great...  But Another game where the aliens NEVER miss but you will fire shot after shot after shot after shot and every time they will miss.  It's just not fun to play.  I'm 1 and a half hours into this.  And my soldiers HAVE NOT landed more than a single, solitary, hit on the enemy.  I have had to keep reloading and trying again.  I think this is what people call ""hard core"".  Yeah - I haven't even managed yet to get all my troops off the back of the helicopter.  It's like that bit in Saving Private Ryan, at the beginning where they are trying to get off the life boat things, except the American's can't hit a thing and they have machine guns, and the germans have a pistol and every shot they fire kills a GI.All of the XCom games have sort of done this and I've always thought it sucked.  The worst were the games in the UFO trilogy.  I imagine that this game NEEDS you to have a maxed out Stat squad to stand a chance later on in the game?  So you simply CAN NOT tollerate taking a casualty?  Is it another of those?  Because if you have to replace someone with a Private later on and they come out like this.....The game has been a hugely dissapointing and not-really-fun waste of an hour and a half so far.			"

												Absolutely Amazing!Faithful to the original X-com, xenonauts keeps the core gameplay mechanics and tense atmosphere that made the original so awesome. Personally, i see xenonauts to be superior over the new X-Com: ennemy unknown, because the gameplay is alot more tense, visceral and complex. But not only does it come true to the original, it even expands on some concepts, adds alot of new mechanics and gadgets such as the deeper air combat missions and increased arsenal of your soldiers. Time units are back, and so comes the class-less soldier promotion system. it is up to you to choose the exact equipment and role of the soldier, and you can come up with very individual loadout choiches perfectly fit for the individual stats of the soldiers, adding alot more depth to equipment. Like in the original xcom, there is a fog of war and aliens shoot out of the dark. if you are careless with a soldier and run around a corner without looking to your side, you will soon run into trouble.And the thing that makes a real xcom game: Absolutely hilarious/dramatic soldier deaths, situations that escalate quickly, missions that end up in absolute disasters and horror. The best moments were when a plan just did not work out, one soldier after another dies, and suddenly it becomes all about saving the remaining soldiers from their certain death.The music adds to the atmosphere, and so does the fantastic art direction.

												Xenonauts is a strategy game in which you control a multi-national military organisation defending a Cold War-era Earth from alien invasion, using small squads of persistent soldiers to eliminate the extraterrestrials and recover their technology in turn-based ground combat.			"

												Absolutely Amazing!Faithful to the original X-com, xenonauts keeps the core gameplay mechanics and tense atmosphere that made the original so awesome. Personally, i see xenonauts to be superior over the new X-Com: ennemy unknown, because the gameplay is alot more tense, visceral and complex. But not only does it come true to the original, it even expands on some concepts, adds alot of new mechanics and gadgets such as the deeper air combat missions and increased arsenal of your soldiers. Time units are back, and so comes the class-less soldier promotion system. it is up to you to choose the exact equipment and role of the soldier, and you can come up with very individual loadout choiches perfectly fit for the individual stats of the soldiers, adding alot more depth to equipment. Like in the original xcom, there is a fog of war and aliens shoot out of the dark. if you are careless with a soldier and run around a corner without looking to your side, you will soon run into trouble.And the thing that makes a real xcom game: Absolutely hilarious/dramatic soldier deaths, situations that escalate quickly, missions that end up in absolute disasters and horror. The best moments were when a plan just did not work out, one soldier after another dies, and suddenly it becomes all about saving the remaining soldiers from their certain death.The music adds to the atmosphere, and so does the fantastic art direction. I absolutely love the minimalistic, but effective graphical design, and the grim soldier portraits really add alot to the entire scenario.

												Seriously, I don't understand how this game can be so bad when all it had to do was copy what the original XCOM did like 20 years ago.I've got planes that the manual says should be auto-rearming...and they aren't. Everything generally takes forever and the menus aren't intuitive how to navigate. About the only plus I'm seeing right now is better graphics.Pro-tip: Buy the original XCOM and get OpenXCOM mod for it to make it playable on modern hardware. Probably way cheaper and MUCH BETTER than this game that can't even rip off the source material properly.			"

												If you love Xcom but wish it were more fleshed out, or if you love Classic Xcom and find the graphics just too painful on the eyes this is an amazing middle ground.No nerfing of the tactical gameplay, fully destructable environs and fully customizable characters that are not class locked by a pointless skill tree.Buy this game if you are a strategy gamer. Just do it, this taught me so many lessons. It is because of this game I might survive the next major world confict by KEEPING MY DUMB ♥♥♥ IN FULL COVER.This game is almost perfect, minus a few graphical glitches and the fact that it is low res. It is one of my favorite games I have ever played, I wish they could translate this to modern graphics soon.Top 5 game. If it is on sale and you don't buy it, you've cost yourself an opportunity.

								Okay.Painstakingly handselected loadout for 8 soldiers - Check.Strategically placed them inside the carrier - Check.Let's go.The door opens. A farm. How quaint.A single smoke grenade rolls out, as 2 troopers with shields rush through and draw sightlines.... nothing.Still clear.Flanks covered, a man with a huge shield keeping an eye on the rear as the rest of the squad move onward.A panicked farmer runs towards us. The men hold their fire.2nd shield rounds the first corner and CONTACT.Alien spotted.Wait. Hold on.All my men are clustered pretty close, but I don't think aliens will have grenades or area effects on day 1.Hmm.I can use a missile to blow out the wall between the alien and my full squad, using only my rocketeer's turn - everybody else gets to fully unload on the first alien I encounter.It will be glorious.I click the rocketeer.... how do I target the enviroment?Ah, click the weapon again, I see.Now, let me make sure I have the rocketeer selected and click him aga...Oh.My entire squad minus 2 shield guys is now pink goo.10/10Will play again.

								If you had any fun at all playing the original X-com games, then this game is perfect for you. It sucessfully takes the old X-com and improves it in every way it can. Whilst still a bit unfair in aerial combat, most of the game is greatly balanced, and by that, I mean you will get your ♥♥♥ handed to you on a daily basis. So yeah, the original X-com difficulty returns. Your troops still have the accuracy of a drunk stormtrooper, carry weapons that are about as effective as Nerf guns loaded with napkins, and wear laser attracting magnets on their faces. It's awsome.Edit:The game is out now! And a sequel has been anounced!I can't wait to name my soldiers after people I know and cry when they inevitably die all over again.			"

												The ground combat is like the first xcom with better control. Your men will die. You will reload to save them!And over time you can bring like 12 guys into combat. or 10 guys and a tank. Its better then the new xcom imo.other then the gfx. This game will crash  when in the troops inventory screen,it will ♥♥♥♥ you off.(the update to fix this bug is fail) No psi lab in this game to make your troops better at reciving mind attacks...so..you will only hire rookies with high bravery 55-65+ off the rip,cause bravery as a stat only increses if you survive mind attacks.And when you get medals. I changed the gameconfig file so all rookies stats are min 65 max 65.also no night vison for these troops,so night missions are avoid at all cost. i know pretty whack for a game with plasma guns and jetpack armorOther things to mention with the ground combat(night or day) Troops will shoot cover their behind while aiming at a guy 40 feet away..(past lame) as if the combat script is that dumb,,,it is. Cause even your highest rank troops COL, down to the new guys will pretty much shoot their feet all the time.wasting ammo,lifes and really just start to get under your skin. But after you get about 8 guys built up a bit,you will not need cover. The price for the game is imo,way to much. it should be around 10 bucks.But this game is very easy to mod. So most things you find you do not like,change it.			"

												This game feels a lot like XCOM: EU where all they did was remove the best parts of the game but this time they did it even worse. The only thing great about this game is the workshop, because the vanilla game is actually pretty bad.You see, what made you invested in the tactical part of the game was the alien loot you could grab when you finished the mission. From there you could continue your research, or if you were low on funds, sell it to foreign powers. That was the best part of the game, manufacturing weapons, and then selling them to the governments of the world. It allowed you to continue funding science projects, and recruit staff had the odds swung against you. Sometimes you couldn't get enough missions or things didn't turn out right, and a few nations stop funding your project.That was removed, and from what it seems, the political aspect as well. You aren't trying to convince the governments of the world that your project can work. You seem to just get a set amount of income each year, I don't know who funds us, or why, we just get money.Well, I can take a good challenge, tough aliens, and the great level design the game throws at me. But the most disgusting part of the game is aiming. This game takes XCOM's difficulty over the top. While yes, enemies did cheat a bit, but there were few times when they could shoot through walls. But the game's difficulty doesn't come from enemy health, uniqueness, or powers or even intelligence. No. The game's difficulty comes from your soldier's ability to aim, alone. I find it hard to be invested at all in this game, with the ability to sell loot, manufacture items, or attempting to convince the UN that the xcom project works. I find it even harder to invest myself when soldiers shoot like idiots.You can have 1 alien surrounded by four soldiers, and have ALL of them miss. You can have the odds in your favor, the perfect LOS, and miss. What? You don't think it's that bad? ""It might not be that bad, I'll give it a go"" Let me give an example of how BAD a soldier's aim is:There was an alien in a ship, the door destroyed by my rocket launcher. I took my heavy weapons soldier, told her to fire at the alien inside of the ship. You know what she does? SHE TURNS AROUND AND SHOOTS THE SOLDIER NEXT TO HER. SHE UNLOADS ON THIS POOR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LIKE SHE WAS INJECTED WITH ADAMANTIUM RAGE. KILLING HIM INSTANTLY.This game has so much potential, but it's like the developers thought the only way to make aliens any kind of threat was to nerf your soldier's aim. Down to the point where they couldn't even shoot an alien that's in a square next to them. Stuff like this NEVER happened in xcom, in xcom YOU'D HIT! But you were never sure if you were going to KILL!Also, the morale in this game feels so screwed up! Your soldiers would take one hit, and then immediately go beserk? The last time I played xcom, your soldiers would only go beserk if someone DIED. In fact, beserking soldiers were actually pretty rare if you kept everyone alive. And even if I'm wrong on this, they should fix it, soldiers should not beserk or panic after getting hit once.This game is frustrating but I feel like the workshop fixes some of it's problems.			"

If you are interested or someone who played already without mods, for all of you who likes the game or hated it, i recommend you to use XCE version aka Xenonauts Community Edition which got tons of fixes and new things.

I've only tapped the surface of this game but I see potential for 100's of hours of gameplay here-depending on how masochistic I want to be with the difficulty slider. The community and developers are endlessly finding ways to improve the game while adding content like map variety which I find to be crucial for a game like this.

I have played for about 20 hours, i know it aint much, but I'm not really made for these kind of games, i find them taxing to my bored mind so i play them on and off.

Instead for going into alot of details, let me say i always read the negative reviews on games before buying anyhing,Now- this game really is entertaining, it is enjoyable and easy to play,  but remember you will be extinct if you stick your neck to far out.Is it worth 25us?!Yes it is.!

												This homage/ripoff of the original 1994 version of X-COM is generally updated and improved, but is actually more clunky and awkward by the standards of its time than the now old-enough-to-drink original game. There's no tutorial (and the game DESPERATELY needs one), you can't rotate the camera in combat, preparing your squad for combat is needlessly split across three different areas of the base, soldiers are MORE difficult to tell apart in combat than the original game because every race and gender has the exact same sprite (except for the weapon it carries).There's just NOT enough effort here to make things clear. In air combat YOUR planes show how much HEALTH they have left, but alien ships show the reverse - how much DAMAGE they have taken (remember that bit in the Bruno movie about the importance of consistency?). You can only see your weapons' stats at base (and only in a particular place at base - can't examine the weapon your soldier is actually holding, no sir, we don't like that kind of basic UI consistency around these parts, Yankee!). In combat, you don't even get to see how many Time Units you need to reload a gun - the reload button just beeps at you if you don't have enough. And don't get me started about the horrible system for reserving Time Units to shoot your gun, which doesn't reserve the Time Units you need to be able to actually turn towards the target so you can shoot it (would anyone really object if they just let you turn for free when you attack, like in the Rebelstar game on Gameboy?!)Oh, and the art and sound are just nowhere as good as the original X-COM. X-COM's blurry VGA graphics didn't age well, but at least all the aliens looked scary instead of goofy (well, maybe not those dumb Floaters or that Jello alien) and you could clearly tell which room in the base was which - you can't say that about Xenonauts. And a chill still goes up my spine whenever I hear that blaster bomb sound effect used on TV for something else.You can make a strong argument that X-COM 2012 lost some of the original's charm with ""gamey"" elements and being dumbed down, but it also had some clear improvements that Xenonauts is sorely lacking. Despite 2012's many terrible design choices, it's still clearly the true sequel to X-COM.			"

												It's great to finally see a game that lives up to the x-com legacy. It tries its own thing here and there and most of the time it manages to improve on the concept. It is not perfect, but it is a damn well realized vision and re-imagining of the original X-Com formula. If you enjoy strategy games in general, or turn-based squad combat in particular, it's a no-brainer. Buy it. Will not disappoint.			"

												This game was not made in a vacuum. If it were not for XCOM: UFO Defense, I doubt this game would have been made. That being said, it is more than fair to strictly compare Xenonauts to XCOM:UD and the latest, much more streamlined, XCOM: Enemy Unknown.Given the choice between XCOM:EU and this, I would choose the former. The over-simplification of XCOM that Xenonauts sought to address is no longer a concern once The Long War mod is installed. Xenonauts' incredibly plain graphics and visual design are something I just cannot get past. Everything about it is pure blandness. XCOM has unique visuals, and most importantly, small graphic nuances during the tactical combat that makes it feel like a thrilling shootout. Xenonauts on the other hand is a VERY by the numbers turn-based tactical game.			"

Yes, this game right now is in beta, and a good amount of bugs/glitches are present, but I've been having a blast with this game! It improves on a lot of the tedious features of UFO Defense, while still having the same awesome feel that it has.			"

												Although I enjoy playing the game, it definitely has really clumsy and illogical mechanics to it. The game has great artwork, and the actual strategy and gameplay is solid enough for me to want to play it for a few hours at a time (which is rare), but there are things in the game that make it hard for me to recommend it.For example, corners turn out to provide 0 cover and there is no clearly defined cover system. This means that a guy crouched in a doorway with a riot shield is actually completely exposed from 45 degree angles. And the game is full of things like this. Where did you toss that grenade? At the alien? Or is it at your feet? You'll find out soon..The game is full of small bugs, poor design, and crashes every once in a while.The menu system is also extremely clunky, and could've been much better. A huge amount of the game is spend managing through the menu system that is simply painful to use, especially for the outfitting of soldiers.And soldiers are completely depersonalized except for a portrait and their origins. No matter what backround or gender a soldier comes from, they will appear on the map as a faceless white guy. There is no dialog or anything.. just feels like a missed opportunity.I love the game for the strategy and the cold war art style, but I just can't recommend it to anyone who isn't a hardcore strategy fan			"

I really feel playing the exact same game. (I finished the 1st and original one hundred of times)But with THIS game, the real difference is they raised the difficulty to be STUPID.I got the best start of the game with 4 bases going in the 1st month + capacity to shoot down almost all enemy aircraft but I still loose MONEY revenu. Not to talk about my solders aim accuracy... even leutnants can miss a aimed shot at 10 feet...Honestly... skip this game, and download a free version of Xcom, you will get the same pleasure...			"

												It could've been great game, if combat, essential part of it, wasn't partially broken. I.e. if you cover one door with three soldiers, pointing all effing guns in that door, it should be obvious that when alien opens that door, he gets a hail of hot lead. Well, in this game, enemy acts first, usually opening the door, yawning and throwing a grenade in the midst of you soldiers doing nothing like some band of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So, any reasonable tactics are out of picture, you can only press tactics that game allows, not much of it though. And this is jus one of the issues, there are many more little annoyances, that made me drop this game. If devs wouldn't screw such small things, that'd be game I'd put hundred of hours in. XCOM is way ahead.			"

												I dont want to be too harsh, as I kind of enjoy the game. Problems are front and center though. Like aliens having amazing accuracy and your soldiers dying quite often. Its not that the loss is unbearable, I like that, its really just a balance issue. The combat is way off. Its best to just have a random guy you didnt name, push up with a shield. Then all the other characters use sniper/rifle, and a machine gunner. This circumvents the crazy high enemy accuracy/damage. It makes the combat dull and even without that element, the combat is dull enough since its really a very standard turn based combat system. The building of your base is clunky, after awhile you figure out what does what (most of it), and why you need it. But building is expensive and income is limited. Early on you can only wait to loot UFOs you shoot down. Thing about that though, is on my first game I had the game is max fast forward and waited a literal 8 minutes before a UFO triggered my radar. Bad placement, I thought... Worst of all, I couldnt catch the UFO. I waited another 3 minutes in max speed, until I got my first UFO. Then inbetween them, they were so scarce. My 3rd game was much better, still more rare then I liked, but I got about 11 of them, out of maybe 18, shot down and secured. The research and mechanic shop are nice, the game does have a good feel to it, but overall the problems with it bog it down from being overly exciting or absurd fun. I got it on humble bundle for like 2$, at that price I absolutely recommend it.			"

												This is not the improved x-com for which you were looking. It feels unfinished and in time modders may fill the gap but its painful and repetitive in a way that the original was not. The start of the game is well tuned and feels like the original and you don't notice how the AI reacts to your approach often increasing in aggressive level (which in gameplay terms equivalent to knowing you where you square are). However, the gameplay barely advances as the game progresses; at least on veteran alien scales faster than your weapons and there is no psi combat. This just means later missions are just slower and longer than at the start. The tech tree has the same feeling, repeated upgrades but without any excitement or dynamic change to you as the player. In addition without psi combat of your own alien psi is just another random frustrating element to add to the handful of aliens with three times the health of your toughest troops you will find camping in the final room of each downed alien battleshipI am amazed after my first few hours to say that the latest xcom reboot that i felt i barely made through the campaign without being bored probably has more replayability.

Early Access Review
								Xenonauts is quite ok game honestly, but do not expect too much. It is slightly modernized X-COM and that's all.Graphics is indie-good. Transition to Cold War times is a nice move and ufo-generated events (abductions, crop circles etc.) adds a lot to the game creepy atmosphere. The story... well, I can't tell much about it yet, but it can turn out to be good.Otherwise this remake of X-COM is extemely close to original, even in its awful, really awful interface and slow uneventful combat system. Seriously: Time Units suck, especially when interface doesn't help you much to predict whether you have enough of them to complete your plan. Soldiers can't look behind a corner! They need to WALK behind a corner, then TURN - take a REACTION shot from an enemy - then maybe SHOOT, then WALK back. WTF. Cover system is very obscure. You cannot tell at first glance how much protection a cover offers and where you should place your soldier to use it effectively.New air combat is unnecessarily hardcore though it can have an appeal of its own. I struggled to fight against light scouts losing a fighter after a fighter, while autocombat offered me a 100% victory. It's not impossible to master, but well, it's hardcore. I warned you.Back to ground missions. Maps are extremely similar to each other. I found myself playing on the same map three times in a row, only differences being my starting place and UFO type!Xenonauts could be a much better game if they dared to shred some X-COM's obsolete features like TU's and interface micromanagement, but well, we have Firaxis XCOM with Long War mod for that.

												The game is buggy to all hell, and crashes constantly. Often not randomly. The keyboard binds do not save, and the interface is.. sticky and unpolished.Between losing support, the insane maintenance cost of multiple bases, staff, vehicles and production costs,the game difficulty curve never changes, and there is nothing you can do get ahead of it. Your troops never even get as good as the aliens troops, they are ALWAYS better, faster, more accurate.The aliens are ALL snipers (even the blind ones). They can shoot through glass, over obstacles and kill your troops in one hit easily on normal. Whereas my troops will sometimes miss a 3 yard shot with an 85% chance to hit, 4 times in a row. Or a heavy weapons soldier with a 25% chance to hit will miss all 10 bullets with his\her burst. Even with 8 Colonels for a fire team my troops cant help but shoot each other and miss 95% accurate shots way more often then they should. Additionally, shots are % based on your total time units, so your troops NEVER get to fire more shots per round, just move further.The reaction fire system makes it almost impossible to kill any aliens without getting shot yourself by the alien who's turn it ISN'T, because all the aliens seem to have AMAZING reaction times.2 Months into the game you need 4 bases and 20 fighter craft to deal with the entire worlds ufo problems and you will only have money 1\5 of that. Ufo invasions come in literal swarms so your ships sit and wait or are outnumbered 3 to 1.Scientists and engineers can NOT be moved from base to base, they must be fired and re-hired.(What year is it and how many turn based strategies have there been?)Tech options (research trees) are mundane and boring. Its the same old Balistic-Laser-Plasma, blah, blah, blah. Translation: more damage, better accuracy, different sound effects. Nothing interesting like a toxi-gun, or other biologic warfare. Even the bullets from the shotgun look like sniper and assault rifle bullets. Same with laser and plasma.All in all. The game is glitchy, my soldiers would rather shoot themselves, and it's a save\load-fest even on normal, the load times on the larger ship missions are un-godly long..oh and no quick save\load option.X-Com Apoc is STILL the best turn-based strategy. It was beyond stable, ran like water off a hydrophobic surface, good mission time vs geo-scape time balance (didn't spend 98% of your time in missions), well balanced difficulty curve (troops got dope), with interesting tech options.The soundtrack on Child of Light would get a better score than this game.

												I got this game while to hold me over until xcom 2 came out and was quite hyped for it after some of the gameplay I had seen. The logistical aspect of the game, managing your bases , building facilities and hiring more staff is awesome. and has even more scope then xcom eu. The abilitiy to build and field TANKS was one of big things I was looking forward to in this game and I was not disapointed.I never played any of the original xcom games so I found the combat a little hard to grasp, and it took me awhile to figure out how turn units work, but after I got past the learning curve it wasn't bad at all.The artwork is top notch and all the lore behind research projects is well worth the read.You're probablly wondering why I'm giving this a negative review after hearing how great I think the game is, but the last is also the most important.The game feels dead.......When I go on a mission and deploy my troops there's no life, A simple idle animation would suffice so people don't look like cardboard props standing in a field. There's no discernable ambiance and while this may not sound very important, it is. The game might actually be very entertaining but after a few minutes it simply gets to dry to play.I hold high hopes for the next game because with just a little more work this game could easily be better than the current xcom.

Around the 100th hour i just wanted it to end and about 30 hours more it did.The game works. The majority of bugs have been ironed out and the turns pass quite a bit faster than they used to.

												Have you ever wanted to be bullied by extraterestial aliens that came from space to have sex with your fine booty? Well this is your game. You can command a massive army made of Russians, Amerifats, glorious Commonwealth soldiers and Jews and send them off to cause police brutality to the invaiding aliens with tear gas, night sticks and even elctroshock grenades. You can also build any form of jet to do drive by shootings of your enemies or bomb your neighbors house because they didn't pay your fee of being unraped by xenos scum. From landed ships and crashed ships from Bane to terror missions and even base assaults and defences this game has it all in the way of old xcom games but still miss the overly complicated overlay and a few rule sets.

												I waited on this game for close to what... a year now? At first I was unsure if it was worth the money, and people's complaints about LoS and other annoyances held me at bay even more. Today, finally, FINALLY a discount worth getting the game at. I love it more than the new X-Com. Not only do I already enjoy it's systems just a few hours in, but besides the stray trick-shotting alien, the game runs perfectly and feels fair. The time period is spot on, the music is spot on, and the atmosphere gets so tense that I have jumped twice playing so far. Top this with the time units, allowing you to pop out of cover and fire, the great LoS(the ability to face your soldiers and actual vision arcs)/cover (the abiltiy to crouch, and intervening objects actually having an effect on accuracy) systems and you have a tactical game that is better than most on the market. I've dumped copious amounts of money to my regret into games that are too slow or too shallow, where the atmpshere it too light for the game or the game too light for the atmosphere. Xenonauts does not stand in the ranks of those games. If you played the new X-Com, throw it away and come learn how to run an actual defense network. Buy it. I give you my word you wont regret it. The truth is out there.			"

												I played this one through just out of boredom. First I tried playing it on ironman, but soon noticed that the whole game is riddled with oneshot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t through walls and other cool stuff like that which you have zero control over in any way and absolutely no way to counter them, in any way. Your guys will constantly get oneshot, even in the best armor, out of the blue, or sometimes, through walls.I especially love the grenade mechanics in this game. You see that comforting animation of something flying and you're like: ""yay! grenades!"". Sadly, the reality is cold: they thought it's too much hassle to actually code grenades to have their own mechanics, like flying path which would allow them to fly OVER the obstacles. Instead, they fly in a straight line like bullets hitting every possible obstacle on the screen and in addition to that they have ridiculously low hit % and the scatter is random to the max. Of course this doesn't prevent the aliens from throwing grenades THROUGH EVERYTHING, including walls, and hitting with them 100%. More ofthen than not that results in the death of everyone in the blast radius, even with best armor and 100hp. Mass oneshots, yay. If you ever happen to hit with your own grenade, you can feel happy if it makes a scratch on the alien. Also you can't even blow up covers effectively with grenades thanks to the... ""interesting"" explosion mechanics they use. And in addition generally you need 2-4 grenades to destroy any envinroment block. So yeah, grenades, why are they in the game?Also your hit % with most weaponry is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly low unless you go into melee and the cover mechanics are iffy at best. If there's a pebble anywhere in the path between you and your enemy, your shot will lose hit %. And I mean literally a pebble. A pebble will lower your aim by 10% and anything fist sized will lower it by 25% and so on. And... I don't even want to get started about the % based action costs. Basically your virgin rookie who hasn't drawn first blood will shoot his/her gun as just as many times as your battle-hardened commander who's looked death and slaughter into eyes and laughed. Your highest rank soldier will move a few squares further and that's it. He'll still get oneshot anyways.The combat is extremely simplistic, exactly like it was over 20 years ago in the original X-COM games. That's all nice and cool, but if I want to play a game with 20 years old technology I'll play those games, which actually have functioning grenades as well in addition to some other cool stuff. Additionaly they have the great excuse of actually being over 20 years old, so you can forgive their flaws more easily. From the newer X-COM games I really missed the classes and how they affected the game play in various different ways. It added spices to the old mix, making missions different and changing your approach. Also another thing I missed was the ""trinket"" items of the newer games. Like S.C.O.P.E.S. and stuff. The lack of player usable psionics is also a con.But is there anything good in this game at all...? Well, I liked the base buildling and how you had to manage more than one base to save the Earth. Also the air combat mechanics, even though simple, were a nice thing. Both of these could've been improved on, massively. The base structures could've had more variation in different ways and so on. But still, it's an indie game and at least they tried. And why do you have storerooms in the game at all if they are basically not used? You store what? 2 items in those? Alien alloy and energy things. Why do you destoy the alien corpses after the missions? I'm sure there would be a market for alien skull decor for housing if you have no other use for the corpses. Also the rewards of doing missions are pretty lackluster, but in this game that's a good thing when you think about it...Apparently there's going to be Xenonauts 2 so we shall see if they manage to actually improve the mechanics. I hope so. This one had potential, but you can see through it's flaws after a very short time of playing.I can't really recommend this game unless you're suffering from massive boredom. If you want some turn-based alien action I'd recommend you to try The Long War mod for X-Com:Enemy Within.			"

												XENONAUTS FANBOIS BEWARE : THE FOLLOWING WILL BE A HARSH COMPARISON TO THE CLASSIC XCOM (1994 - 1995), DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOUR WELLBEING DEPENDS ON CONSTANT GLORIFICATION OF THIS GAME OR IF YOU GET UPSET EASILY : (scroll down if you want to read about reality, please)1) in parts buggy2) bad, miniscule research3) interesting aircraft-recovery, losing a craft costs nothing but WILL cost time (usually 72 hours)4) difficulty-progression is worse / more steep than in XCOM (yes, the real, classic ones) - basically you have 2 years  ... which is far from good and isnt any fun --- unlike XCOM in which the player has at least a decent amount of time before ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan5) available money seems adequate at first - but if you dont want to lose after 2 years you will need to invest EVERYTHING and fear every loss because that can (and will) end the game. Thats XCOM on high difficulty, in this game its medium. Thats sad. (i dont remember the exact difficulty-names, sorry)6) research doesnt make much sense - the results are well explained but its senseless to gain knowledge about ARMOR during PLASMA RIFLE reseach, for example - that should've been available after ""alien alloys"" .... and its only a small example7) air combat is a bit more fun than in XCOM - but its also a bit harder8) air-retreat has a big bug : the match ends only once the UFO (!) has left the screen, even if your fighter has already left9) ground combat is ... not bad, it basically looks like XCOM with high resolution but in that case i prefer a lower resolution - either polish the classic combat in ways which make it better or keep it like it is .... there is no in-between, everything else looks pretty cheap to be honest and thats exactly what this game is -- even the dying-animations (if one could call em that) are cheap and consist of .... one (?) single step - in XCOM it was at least 2-3 per alien.10) Music is good but the soundeffects are pretty bad - most sounds are missing or replaced by very bad ones11) It has no XCOM-like feeling, the ground combat does not instill fear, there is zero tense anywhere and  it looks like ... something boring.12) ground combat-view is not rotatable. Yes. One of the most important features in tactical, turn-based games is missing. XCOM had it. Because its necessary.13) the world map looks bad - even XCOM had a (much) better one, even in 3Dconclusion : its worse than the classics in some ways. The few additives make it worthwile for a few hours but thats it ... if you want a new (and ACTUAL) XCOM-follower this is not your game, its basically a bad version of what should've been released from the original XCOM-developers a few years after the last of the (original) series ... not bad but also not really good.

												Certainly an interesting experience, and certainly not the worst in terms of value-for-money, but unless you are interested in the old XCOM I found that the mechanics can get quite grating towards the end of my playthrough:There is a lot of UFOs, and thus crashsites to clear, and this doesn't exectly hide the fact that there is a VERY limited number of maps - about 8, so you can expect to have to clear EACH map about 30 times if you were to manually do every mission. A related issue is that the game doesn't handle multiple levels very well - e.g. so move a soldier from the first floor to the ground floor you need to press tab once, select the soldier, then press tab about four times to cycle back to the ground floor before issuing a move order. Enemies on higher elevation can hide in spots not visible from the ground, occasionally annoyingly prolonging combat.And sadly, there is not a huge amount of gear to choose from - e.g. you end up with two choices for armour (heavy armour limiting the user to machine guns, and light armour with a jetpack that makes the character FLY nearly every time you give him a move order and also makes checking corners redundant due to 360 degree vision), which ultimately contributed to me rushing towards the end; having everyone in the annoying jetpack armour was just too damn annoying.If this review had been for the first half of the game I'd have recommended it, but with the 2nd half I don't think I can recommend the game overall UNLESS you are already into what I assume old school XCOM was like; I, at least, won't be playing it without looking very hard at mods to fix the above.

												UPDATED: With the release of version 1.51 I decided to give this game another go.Unfortunately after putting in enough time to get to the final mission I still have to give this game a thumbs down.  Much of the game has been improved, many bugs fixed but there's ultimately still some very weak or bad mechanics and a lack of balance to the game.The difficulty level even at Normal is still punishing of even the smallest of mistakes.  By the end game even with troops with almost all max'd stats using the best armor and weapons available it's not uncommon to be sniped at by monsters that are beyond view range and are very good shots, sometimes killing your soldiers in one hit or two hits.  This turns the game into a load/save fest because if you lose your well trained troops in late game it'll be very hard to train new troops with bad stats up to the level your previous troops were.There's still issues with visibility and firing angles that often don't make sense, such as cases where I'm 100% blocked from shooting an alien I can see but yet it can shoot at me.  Also missed shots are entirely too erratic, standing right behind your own tank your veteran soldiers can still fire off a shot so badly aimed it hits and severely damages your own tank.  Or trying to shoot an alien in a second story window and having the missed shot hit a stack of pallets 10 feet in front of my soldier at ground level.  I've never fired a real gun in my life but I'm confident I could get the bullet to go in the general direction of the window with minimal training.Morale also gets silly, my squad has been on dozens of missions, each member killing dozens of aliens, but still will find reason to panic or flee at times.Many UI elements are not well designed or missing information.  When you unlock new weapons that you can build in your workshop there's no tooltips in the workshop to provide details on what the stats of the weapons are.  So you end up having to blow money to build a single weapon to then look at its stats to understand if you want to bother making more.  Item weight is not listed in the tooltips either, you have to equip them and do the math to figure it out, not hard, but annoying.  It wasn't clear to me until late game that when intercepting an alien craft you can send multiple planes.  Hiring a soldier and putting them in a dropship requires going through 3 screens.It's odd that you can't build other base buildings until the command center is completed. This isn't apparent until you experience it firsthand.  So be careful - the second base you build is going to take 10 days longer than you think it will.  They should really let you plan out/execute a blueprint all at once for the entire base.  Take into account build times and existing structures automatically if you want.""Run in Windowed"" option only works if the resolution is less than your native desktop resolution.Other countries that you don't have coverage over seem to lose money faster than reasonable when playing at normal difficulty even after version 1.51.The entire interception portion of the game is entirely too tightly balanced and crucial to success.  I'm here for the TBS not the interception game.  Having said that, I can't stress the value in having a large air force and doing airstrikes on many of your alien crash sites.  You can't and will not want to raid them all.I ended up having to tweak the monetary values of several items in the game in order to loosen the difficulty up (on Normal) to something more reasonable to the point where the focus of the game was on the missions with your troops rather than trying to balance a checkbook.Don't get me wrong, the game isn't horrible.  However unless you're dying for a new TBS game (and I was) I'd recommend waiting till it's on sale before trying.  If you're a fan of the new XCom and are expecting more of the same look elsewhere.

												If you are an autismo dank memelord philosopher-warrior like myself, then this game will give you an insufferably persistent erection of the most dire intensity. This is simply one of the best strategy and tactical games I have played in years. You are leading a black ops organization that exists to defend the Earth from alien invasion, and it is multinational, receiving funding primarily from the USSR/USA but the rest of the world as well. You start at the beginning of an alien incursion into Earth, and you are charged with building base[s] from which to base interceptors, infantry strike teams and their helo transports, radar, SAM sites, research laboratories, workshops to build dank new memes for your infantry and pilots, medical centers, et cetera!The strategic side of the game occurs in the geoscape, where you make decisions regarding the administration and disposition/construction of your bases. You monitor world events - alien incursions will occur with the aim of terrorizing populations, and the more South Americans ♥♥♥♥ their pants, the less money they will allocate to fund your operations. You can increase your relations (and funding!) with regions by intercepting and destroying UFOs. By shooting down a UFO over land, you create a crash site, which you need to launch a raid on aliens and recover alien technology and resources. This is critical. The strategic side of this game is very engrossing.On the tactical and RPG side of the game, you scout, hire, and deploy infantry in a variety of roles, with a variety of equipment, on a variety of missions including raids/assaults and base defense. Your troops come from all over, with pertinent information (aside from their ability statistics) being age, nationality, prior unit, and combat experience. I've had an American paratrooper with combat experience in Vietnam, Soviet Spetsnaz GRU member with experience in Ethiopia, Soviet Spetsnaz with Afghan experience, Norwegian FSK, British Paras and Royal Marines, Italian Bersaglieri, et cetera... autismo dreamscapes! DANK #swagover9000Combat itself is very well thought-out and challenging. You never know what sort of enemy you will be facing, and caution is a good idea while moving out from your infil point. Assaulting a crash site is always messy, and a genuine challenge.One point of contention - I'm a Marine, and as such it pisses me the ♥♥♥♥ off to see virtually 50% of troops in the game be females. There has never been a female SEAL and never will be - why the ♥♥♥♥ am I see female Alfa, SEAL, Royal Marines, etc.? Stupid SJW ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, very offensive.			"

												I've played a number of X-Com games... and in fact X-Com Apocalypse is my favorite game of all time, and I really wanted to like this game.  The game artwork is sorta mediocre, but the gameplay graphics are more than adequate although not anywhere near the quality X-Com Enemy Unknown.  What is most important to me in this type of game is the gameplay, and this is where Xenonauts falls woefully short.  Let me give a couple of examples.I started the game on the default ""normal"" difficulty, chose my starting base, and proceded to ""fast forward"" towards the first enemy encounter... Seconds later, a target is spotted and I send both my aircraft out to intercept the bogey.  Once they get close to their prey, they violently circle around the target at dizzying speeds until eventually they run out of fuel and have to return to base... hmm... okay.. no problem.. I will just start over.  This happens again and again over the next 3 or 4 restarts (from scratch choosing a different start location each time).. Apparently they didn't play test this part, or apparently I was very unlucky about ship positioning.Okay... Finally I get a non-spin cycle encounter, and I heroically down the bogey with barely a scratch... Time to send in the troops !   My troop ship lands and my 8 ground agents are ready to kick some alien butt !   I deploy my troops from the landing craft in pairs, being sure to reserve some Time Units for a shot or two in case aliens are close.  From past experience, I also make sure to ""kneel"" and take advantage of cover whenever possible.  My last troops out of the ship are Joe & Bob... and I deploy them kneeling side by side behind a nearby fallen tree trunk and I End My Turn.  The hunt is on !  Seconds later during the Enemy Movement phase, I strike it rich !... My planning has paid off !   An unwary alien has appeared direectly in front of my two would-be heros, and Bob carefullly lines up a shot with his Sniper Rifle using his extra Time Units that he saved.... HEAD SHOT !... Not the Alien... but Joe crouching 90 degrees off to his right one square away  :(Twice I removed the game from my hard drive, and twice I reloaded it in hopes that it was a quirk experience... But these experiences happened each time.   I sincerely hope that the developers/programmers work to correct these problems, and I hope I have the opportunity once again to try to play this game, but as for now, it will be removed again, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.

												The game is, I suppose, ""fun"" if you're interested in nothing but a strait rehash of the original XCOM series. And by that I mean if you're a fan of fustration and like having your butt handed to you on a platter on a consistent basis. I played through, all the way, on 'normal' mode (which is actually easier than what it's supposed to be played on, which is veteran) and the sheer unfairness of it all was mind boggling.Grunts that would have something like a 17% chance to hit at point blank range, the absolute worst RNG ever (consistent misses, also at point blank range, with shotguns when you've got like a 90% chance of hitting). Aliens that can see across the screen when you *can't*, absolutely insane maintenance costs that basically mean that if you don't optimize your initial base you'll basically never be able to make another base. Which is a problem because you *need* at least 3 or 4 bases in total if only to get radar coverage of the whole world map. To say nothing of the extreme cost putting hangers and fighters in those locations.TLDR- Horribily unbalanced combat in favor of the aliens, horribly implemented and unbalanced economy. When it's literally impossible to make a second base because your funding is so low you can't even afford to *start construction* there is a problem. Especially since the odds are extremely good that once you hit that critical point where you aren't making enough money you'll basically stay there for the rest of the game.I recommend this game only for die hard purists of the original XCOM. In every other way however the newer XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within is a superior use of your money. That and if you're really a die hard purist of the original XCOM then you could, you know, just buy the original XCOM since it is also on Steam.			"

												I'm someone who has played all the X-COMs when they first came out, including X-COM Interceptor and X-COM Apocalypse.  I enjoyed them all.  I really haven't been able to enjoy Xenonauts, though, despite  wanting to.I think it's because of the 1990's graphics and animations, and the timeline of the setting.  I have no idea why the developers chose 1979 as the time to set the alien invasion, but the fact that they did and actually made some of the aliens look like 1970's aliens (Caesans) makes the whole thing feel kind of cheesy.  I mean, the original X-COM felt more stylistically appealing than this groovy rendition.  So a blah rating from me.			"

												I don't understand the positive reviews because this game is not very polished or playable. The level of polish is from a game I would have expected 20 years ago. It doesn't have the same playability as the original XCom and shouldn't be compared to it.1. The in-game help does a poor job. Why does it say I don't have enough hangar slots for a new fighter when I have a free hangar? This and a bunch of other questions send me to google searches 10 minutes into the game.2. Why is it when I buy new solders they don't show up in my ship list?3. Why it is when one research completes it doesn't automatically start a new research on my queue, instead of requiring me to manually assign scientists?4. It's extremely cumbersome to reserve action points. I have to click or make a hotkey to reserve a certain amount, but this doesn't account for kneeling or soldier rotation.5. Melee attacks don't work, clicking the button just uses action points and does nothing.6. How many action points do I need for grenades? No way to tell that doesn't take a lot of clicks.7. How does cover work?8. How does overwatch work?9. Things which should be simple take many clicks - healing myself, throwing grenades, assigning soldier gear.There is no in-game narrative. Unlike XCom which has animations and voice acting to flesh out the feel of what is going on, you are just dumped into a bunch of spreadsheets and left to figure things out.The only real positive to the game is the 2D art, which is generally well done.

												TLDR: Game is too repetitive, slow and has very bad UX, further exacerbating the slowness.I've completed Xenonauts on veteran today. And Xenonauts is NOT a good game. The user experience is horrible. ***Mild spoilers ahead***2 main points to illustrate, strategically and tactically:1)Strategically, this game pointlessly drags on for many, many hours more than necessary because the UFOs that contain necessary tech just simply DO NOT arrive until VERY LONG time into the game. Case in point: First Battleship for me? UFO-199... You have to go through like 100+ tactical mission drudgery just to advance the game... And you sort of HAVE TO play the tactical part because Airstrike doesn't give enough resources. Then, even when you have some Marauders (but not a lot yet), you still have to play each air combat out, and it's exactly the same, you patiently click and wait, click and wait, until you are tailing UFO for comfortable Cannon takedown to avoid taking damage... And you will have to play 10s of air battles, which gameplay you solved 10+ hours ago, just to farm enough money to afford 10+ Marauders so you can autoresolve.2)Tactically the game is also really bad. The maps are too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ large and Industrial map is the biggest nightmare of them all - you will have to advance at a REALLY SLOW pace, or else you will get killed. That is not difficulty, that is just boring. And all 90% of deaths I had was because I got so bored of advancing a few tiles a turn I just rush in with all TUs spent. Late game things get even more messed up - Once you got Sentinel Armor, you cannot simply order a soldier to move to a point, and then do it with the next one - The camera will FORCEFULLY center on a soldier who's flying MULTIPLE times and will break your control of someone in a Predator armor because your previous soldier is flying at a DIFFERENT ALTITUDE LEVEL... And thus you are forced to watch EACH of 12 soldiers SLOWLY move one by one to the target point. The same bull$hit happens on UFOs with multiple levels.I think the developers didn't play this game themselves. I do not know how they could subject anyone to this mindless boring repetitive piece of krap.What's the difference between old school UFOD and this?1)Turns resolve momentarily. In Xenonauts they take 5-15 seconds on I5-3570K. The simple AI logic doesn't warrant this amount of computation.2)The animation was instantaneous. Courtesy of DOSBox speedup, but still. In Xenonauts. you have to watch people fly for like 7-10 seconds each in Sentinel armor for NO good reason.3)The UFOD does not swarm you with pointless spam of UFOs. Maybe it should have, but you should NOT have to capture EACH of them in order to barely have enough money for anything. I've had 10 colonels by mission 30-35. Then what? Nothing - you still play 100 more combats with them, with barely any progress at all once TUs and Accuracy are maxed out.4)Game pace in UFOD is much better, you do not have to trudge through 50+ UFOs to advance to next tech level.5)With late game tech you can own small UFOs no problem. Not true in Xenonauts. Due to best armor in the game being unable to stop the very wild 50-150% damage fluctuation, you still have to be wary of a lucky burst from a simple Caesan.6)UFOD had Psi. Xenonauts? Only aliens do.Would I play this game again? Hell no. Too much time wasted NOT playing or making decisions, but watching unit animation, and waiting turns.			"

												DEVELOPER'S REVIEWHi. I'm the developer of this game, and I will provide an honest, accurate and totally fabricated review for XENONAUTS.First of all, we needed to find the most suitable engine for re-making X-COM. The choice was this browser game engine I found the other day. It was no longer supported, but hey---making another X-COM shouldn't be that hard, yes? So I picked it up.We ended up struggling five years to make this engine to fully address our needs. It still can't. I blame the engine. I could have asked somebody who understands game development, but I didn't. One would say I could Google it once, but I didn't do that either. Sorry that your game can not run properly. I know my apology makes it up for it, so don't thank me.While we were designing the game, we strictly followed the X-COM features. But we didn't implement random map generation, Psi-Combat, aliens being affected by morale, alien path finding, reasonable difficulty scaling, destruction, inventory management, and also any AI which is acceptable by the standards in 1994. But I think XENONAUTS is still VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY accurate and faithful to its roots.The reason why these features listed above didn't make it to the full game is, simply we're not that good at programming. Personally it took me a month to understand the necessity of loops. Our top programmer at the other hand, just figured out how to solve 8 Queens on a Board problem. Other programmers knew how to write code, but they don't know how to read code. I suspect it's because they don't write reusable and documented code, but that's just my insight. I might be wrong.On the visual side of things, we needed talented but cheap artists. It never occurred to me that these don't usually match, especially if it is marketed. So I picked up some people from DeviantArt. Overall, the game looks OK but character portraits really rule IMO.Then we had a painful period of designing the game elements. With all the lacking features that made X-COM great, we decided that the aliens should see the location of all the Xeno operatives. Also which direction they're facing so Xeno trapping the aliens is almost never possible. While we posted on forums that, random map generation and dynamic AI pathfinding is surely not possible, we were somehow incredibly skilled at keeping aliens out of Xenonaut FOV. There came the magic stroke: we made the alien FOV greater than the Human FOV. Because it makes sense and definitely not to force difficulty on players.As aliens seeing the location of human operatives are a settled and a realist fact, an inseperatable reality of extraterrestial combat at this point, we also decided to make aliens act as defensive as possible. We made the cover system work for aliens, only at times the game would feel like it. And the obstacle angles generally favor the aliens, because it's also the fight against the computer. It can process and evaluate millions of conditions in a second. In a second gentlemen, millions.In the end we finished with an X-COM remake, presented to you, made as faithful as possible. I look back at this point and I see, that I've made some mistakes but they are not as many as any game developer out there. The players on Steam are already used to unfinished, unplayable, badly programmed, unpolished, buggy, extremely slow at saving / loading and lacking games. In fact, there are already people out there who fixe our game by themselves. It'd be foolish to not use their efforts. So, here's XENONAUTS; an X-COM remake that doesn't dumb it down as Firaxis' X-COM reboot does. Have I told you that it helped us a lot that they chose to make a ""crappy X-COM reboot""? It really made up for our incompetence so we could trick you classic X-COM gamers to buy this game.Thank you, XENONAUTS Dev.P.S.: Mac and Linux ports don't work. Sorry about that.			"

												Be careful what you wish for. Xenonauts is a detailed re-invention of PC classic X-Com, which was difficult in the masochistic way gamers seem to love these days.Xenonauts also dispenses with tutorials about core game functions and mechanics. It's a complex game, and unforgiving of the slightest mistake. If that sounds appealing to you, dig in. Personally, I found it similar to those ""Tough Mudder"" ""fun"" runs. I get why some people enjoy it, but I think it's ridiculous.As a hardcore fan of the original X-com, and a fan of Firaxis' remake, I find Xenonauts tough to enjoy. Maybe I'm spoiled with ""fun"" gameplay, intuitive controls, and being able to play a game without reading a Wiki for hours first. But having a starting soldier equipped with ""default"" gear he lacked sufficient Time Units to fire, one of my jets shot down on the first UFO, and my first squad fully wiped on 3 starting playthroughs didn't make me say ""wow, this is great"". It made me want to do just about anything else.			"

												Pushed forward as a spiritual successor to the classic 1994 X-Com, it tries to mimic the classic game while pulling in the mechanics of Jagged Alliance, but somehow loses the fun aspects from either game.  The ground combat lacks punch or amusement, the world map is bizarre (Mercator projection with no adjustment for curvature) in the geoscape, research and manufacturing feels limp and while the air combat actually makes sense now (compared to the old X-com) and is quite tactical, it becomes a chore quickly.Overall it just seems to be missing the aspects that make it fun.

												I really wanted to enjoy this game.  But I didn't.It's hard to quantify exactly what sucked the fun out of the game for me, I think it's a combination of elements.Graphics:  awesome .. if it were the late 90s and the game were a direct sequel to UFO: Enemy Unknown.  But it isn't.  I just found the graphics - whether units, localities, base drawings .. to be very underwhelming.  I know they were aiming for ""retro charm"" possibly because they couldnt afford/achieve ""acceptable for modern gaming"".  (I do like some retro-charm games, like FTL .. but I guess I suffer the graphics because I enjoy the gameplay.Gameplay:  where to start .. ?   I found the AI to be pretty simple -- the action point system quite painful, especially managing large numbers of units -- the fog of war to be quite annoying (I dont mind fog of war in general, but in this game it's just an ugly mechanic and in many ways not intuitive .. like not seeing over a hedge) -- on a good note, the progression of units felt OK -- the strategic map and base building was OK but .. dunno, it didn't feel to me like a gripping financial sim, which was one of the appeals of the original.Research tree, all the incidental stuff - dunno .. just felt ""been there, bought the t-shirt, don't need to go back"".I had no particular expectation of the game .. which is usually a good thing because you're not set up for disappointment .. and yet somehow I came away disappointed anyway.Maybe it's just because the formula hasn't aged well.  I enjoyed the original games, played up to Xcom: Apocalypse (which I also enjoyed despite being outraged and culture shocked by the fact that they confined it to a city).  But yeah .. in my opinion Xenonauts is a pretty bland game .. maybe a 6/10 ..My advice is to kick the tyres and look at some videos before deciding to pick it up. "

												If this game is on sale, and you like tactical/strategy games, Xenonauts is a fairly good experience.In a decently imagined world lifted directly from the XCOM series, you can watch your apparently untrained trained soldiers fumble with their weapons, panic, fail to aim completely and die horribly at the hands of a wide variety of alien scum.If playing the game on any difficulty is too frustrating and arbitrary, you can just re-balance the game with a text editor of your choice.4/9, Would bang.

												Abysmal and painful to play.This really is a classic example of the boring retro for the sake of retro trend that is the equivalent of hipster music fans insisting that anything after a band's first demo is crap. The same people who obsess over this will be the same ones who whine about the brilliant Xcom enemy unknown game for being ""cinematic"". Such heresy, how dare modern technology actually make games fun to play and enhance the atmospherics and visuals while also giving it a gameplay system that actually works. The negative reviews here hit on some key issues, the combat is unbearable, illogical and random, crouch makes no sense, visibility is a mess as well, can be a few tiles away from an enemy and they'll just disappear from view, you can't use anything properly for cover or aim over or around anything, but hey, I guess realism and better gameplay don't matter, that's ""too cinematic"" and we must rigidly cling to the outdated systems of early 90s video games. Also even on easy the game is not so much hard as plain awkward as your soldiers can't shoot for s**t and half the time end up firing at each other instead, the interface in general is as awkward and inaccessible as the old games if not worse and unlike modern games that actually have these things called tutorials and learning curves it just expects you to figure all of this out at the start. The graphic style leaves a lot to be desired, whereas the likes of shadowrun, wasteland 2 and xcom have done a fantastic job of updating the visuals while remaining faithful to the classic and newly revived isometric format, Xenonauts has this silly cartoonish style that I really can't take to. Also the audio mix seems a bit off, can barely hear the ambient music, but the only settings in the game you can alter at all are controls....Just the whole combat system is so outdated and tedious to play, as soon as someone's wounded they can't do anything, does the game tell you what to do to heal them? Of course not, but I guess you can only know how to play this game if you grew up with 90s xcom games. I guess this is something for rigidly conservative gamers incapable of trying out anything made past 1995, but modern turn based games do the whole isometric sci fi tactics much, much better. Trying this overhyped disappointment just makes me more impatient for a follow-up to the Xcom Enemy Unknown and Enemy WIthin games.This modern trend of just shamelessly regurgitating retro games and outright refusing to take on board what games since then have achieved and moved forward with is just very tedious and pretentious. I am all for a degree of nostalgia and for reviving the classic isometric style but it's been shown in shadowrun and enemy unknown that you can take the best of both worlds without completely straying from the style of the classics. They're still old school at heart.			"

												So far, I'm rather disappointed.  While I was hoping for XCOM UFO Defense expanded and prefected, what I got was a rather dumbed-down version with some Facebook-esque artwork.  What's worse is that upon researching the game, I learned that there were several great features cut during early access and dumbed down, with developers being extremely hostile towards anyone who thought otherwise.Let's start off with the good: First of all, it's more XCOM.  No, not Firaxis' streamlined and modfiied reboot, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but the classic XCOM: UFO Defense and Terror from the Deep.  It's got a wider scope than the reboot, more micromanagement, and places equal emphasis on your planning as it did combat, unlike the more combat-focused reboot.  Regardless of your opinion on Firaxis' attempt to reboot the franchise (which I absolutely loved), this game is a completely different experience.Air Combat has been revamped, and feels like a game mechanic rather than a short prayer to the AI Director that has screwed you over so many times in your Warframe loot tables and L4D2 sessions.  It's one of the few changes I genuinely enjoyed, a fully realized version of the air combat in which you operate your ships in real-time and attempt to outmaneuver the alien contact.Variety of weapons.  XCOM classic had launchers, Assault Rifles, and pistols, Xenonauts added Snipers, LMGs, and Shotguns.New feature: Airstrikes.  They cost $15,000 and you miss out on loot, but if you simply don't have the resources to respond, you may have to take the loss to control damage.  It's a great addition, and one of the ways this game's best points is interception.  Now, let's go ahead and address the neutrals.External launcher.  I count this as a negative, but it's simply something I really can't take too harshly.Civilians are almost ALWAYS present.  I have mixed opinions on this, as while it gives the missions a bit more tension, it turns civilians into a regular instance of combat.  In XCOM, The announcement of a terror mission genuinely scared you, as it put your entire monthly rating on the line.  It threw off your usual strategies, and it forced you to take risks you would have never done before... now, civilians are just a ""oh well, let's go through plan D.""You're no longer protecting a planet, you're looking at a map.  Whatever, I think I'm done nitpicking for now.As much as I love some of the changes present, the rest of the game completely kills the praise I could have had for the game.  Well, let's get the pitchfork and burn this thing down:Artstyle.  It's cell-shaded and looks like it belongs in a Facebook game.  XCOM UFO Defense can pass as pixel art, and its visuals have aged fairly well.  This game already looks dated and distgusting.As I said, the mechanics are horribly dumbed down from XCOM UFO Defense, and combat isn't nearly as interesting.Somehow, they managed to make the XCOM UI block even more convoluted and unorganized.  I didn't even think it was possible, but despite the fact that XCOM was meant for resolutions ranging from 200p to 480p, it's amazing that with all the extra screenspace Xenonauts managed to do an even worse job of organizing the UI.If this were its own game, I would be willing to overlook the flaws and recommend it anyway.  However, it isn't an independent game, it's just an XCOM clone without the same kind of flair that the classic holds.  For $15 less, you can get the original and with the OpenXCom mod, it stomps all over Xenonauts.  If you really want a streamlined XCOM experience, you should just buy XCOM Enemy Unknown Complete when it goes on sale for $10, as it does often, then enable 'aiming angles' to make the RNG elements more predictable and balanced.  I'll still give this game another chance, but I'm not very optimistic.			"

												After enjoying XCOM Enemy Unknown (XEU) and Within, I decided to give it  a  try.  I started the game and had no clue what to do. Had to go back and read stuff. OK, lot of common elements to XEU but with a very clunky interface. Fine. So this game has an strategic level more complex than XEU. Many of the mechanics are similar to  XEU like constructing the base by expanding locations and selecting what to build. Combat is also similar turn based and using cover, changing weapons, etc. But I just have no fun with this game. Here is what I dislike. The combat in XEU is implemented much better. For example,  in XEU line of sight works is carefully implemented. In Xeno it seems they use a random factor to simulate it and it doesn't work well. For me combat was the most fun part of XEU and it is the worst part of Xeno. Xeno relies low hit rate to simulate difficulty. Chance is not a replacement for implementing strong combat elements like line of sight. XEU adds chance on top of strong combat elements, that is fun. Xeno adds chance as a replacement to implement strong game elements, that is not fun. I will stop purchasing games with low production values like Xeno. This seems implemented for the 1980's before dedicated graphic cards were implemented.			"

												Direct ripoff of the UFO series, which would offer a lot of quality time is implemented in a nice and clear manner. However, not only bugs like an occasional bullet through wall mar this incarnation of UFO, but the gameplay is basically broken. You'll end up with a boring series of save / make a move / see if it turns out well in the enemy turn / load. Save / Load. Save / Load.... which makes a boring play. The reason to save so often is that you can ill afford losing soldiers, whose abilities will get better with time. Also if you're new to the game you have no way of knowing which research does what exactly and base management is a silly drag with limitted space. What finally killed the game for me was the Predator armour. Going into action with two heavy armour suits had shown that they're a bit better than Wolf, but they'll easily get penetrated by the aliens. Anoter note is that aliens are not much worse than your squad, so statistically your chances of making it through 100 fights with your people intact are zero unless you save and load and load and load ...I've had more fun at work than playing this game.

												I have been in the beta for this for an age and have tried really hard to like the game.However it fights back just too hard.  Window mode does not work, the game still crashes regularly and performs poorly despite a very decent spec PC.  Even though the game is now released, It still feels very beta and riddled with bugs and design faults.  It's a shame, the concept has been done before and done very well.  A carbon copy of previous Xcom games with better graphics would be so well received, but even with this game being released in 2014 the graphics are very poor.  I'll keep coming back every couple of months but Xenonauts needs significant work to become a finished product.			"

												Well I was a fan of the original X-COM (since 1994) and have (I think) played all of the X-COM-likes and X-COM clones to date.  Some have been interesting, most have been fairly bad but Xenonauts is special.You could put it this way, of all the X-COM clones over the last 20 years, Xenonauts is the most faithful.  In a way it is aiming to be the ""ideal"" version of X-COM, like it want's to be more X-COM-ey than X-COM somehow.  It does not attempt to introduce new core mechanics, blasphemy!  No wacky moves into mixed real-time mode and definitely no newfangled 3d!  It's like the dev sat down and said something like ""This game is going to be EXACTLY like X-COM exept where it is better!  Because, I don't like things that are different!"".Unfortunately the result is inferior to X-COM in every possible way.  And, it comes off as being devoid of any creative inspiration.  It looks like the Chinese, knock-off t-shirt of X-COM games.Since Xenonaut's only selling point would be the graphics, to review it you have to talk about that.  The graphics in Xenonauts are a slight improvement over the 1994 X-COM game.   But, they're embarrassingly crude by today's standards.  Xenonauts released shortly after games like X-COM Enemy Unknown and The Banner Saga which have set consumer expectations for this sort of game fairly high.An effort has been made to give the Xenonaut sprites smooth (rotoscoping?) animation.  Despite this welcome improvement the visual style is... well... bland, I suppose... insipid, maybe?  This whole game honestly made me wonder why this developer bothered to publish this product.  But, I think it might have had something to do with cashing-in on X-COM's recent popularity, in what essentially amounts to stealing IP.Anyway, that aside, Xenonauts is playable but don't get your hopes up for a ""dream come true"" X-COM update / remake.  It borrows freely from other, better games but gives nothing back to the genre.  It would comfortably make the grade as a marketable product for steam but beyond that it is only memorable for its extreme lack of creativity.It's very, very strange to see this sort of game come from indie developers.  It's a postcard from a topsy turvy world where indie devs cannot innovate and try to compete based on graphics.			"

												Aliens dont follow the rules of the game. It can say 100% blocked line of fire for you, but on the aliens turn they stay in the exact same position and kill your men. You can stay right behind a tall one square obsticle and it will say 100% blocked line of fire for you, in spite of the manual saying otherwise, and still the aliens can kill you behind that obsticle.Sometimes the ""cover"" system works, meaning you can stay behind a corner of a wall and shoot around it at a spotted alien by another unit. But other times you cant.UFO doors that you open on your turn stay open when its the aliens turn and they fire at you, and then closes when its your turn. If the doors are opened by the aliens on their turn, they close just the same on your turn. Spoiler: Blow the fricking door open.Losing soldiers to faulty game mechanics is not the way I want to be beaten by the AI!Downed UFOs are all the same. They never have holes blown in their sides that can use to enter the craft, you allways have to use the front door.Combat maps are decent. They are made of several smaller chunks, smaller than other X-com clones I've played, making the maps seemingly more varied. I've come across the same chunks very often, so there arent alot of them - yet. Maybe a modding community can rectify that.If you compare it to the original, which they clearly want (they even called their game X-COM one place in the manual) they have less stats than it. Xenopedia lacks info. You need to visit the soldier equipment screen to find the stats of the different weapons, and then only in a hard to activate mouseover popup. Cudos to the role system they have for the soldiers, making it very easy to switch equipment on soldiers. Is the game bad - No. Is it better than all the other clones out there - No, not really. Developers did their best. Its just so fricking unfortunate that they did the same misstakes as others did. ""Fully destructive terrain!"" - yea, only if you try to blow up the parts that they want you to blow up. Too bad. Its just another clone that doesnt meassure up as a successor. Disclaimer: This wall of text is without spelling errors and faulty grammar. If you see any - then the gnomes did it.			"

												I REALLY wanted to like this game and was excited that the team put together a turn based tactical game. Something that has been sorely missing for a while, but this game is just tedious.  Aliens shoot you from way beyond your vision and through corners/walls that show as 100% obstruction.  Enemies literally can be standing behind you without your knowledge as the Line of Site is absolutely wonky.  My 'elite' team sent out to save the world usually misses the braod side of any barn, while aliens with horrible vision seem like well trained snipers shooting around corners and despite 2-3 points of cover.  The best hit chances for my guys usually tap out at 30%. I suppose I should have simply bought a baseball game so those averages would be quality.Despite my best intentions, I just cannot give this game a positive review.  There are hints of a great game here and there but the tedious pieces need to be addressed.			"

												Don't waste your money. I bought this on another site and played it and got this as part of a humble bundle, I didn't want to gift it because I don't dislike anyone that much. So I decided to redeem the key to write a review.I'm sure the developers had good intentions. But this game is hot garbage. There's no reason to make a game purposely using horrible design, simply to make the barrier of entry too difficult, for old times sake.We use to read manuals and draw maps on graph paper and all that. We've evolved game design to involve a tutorial which welcomes a player. Even Civ, which has more complex ideas I think, has a tutorial complemented with a full in game manual which is easy to access and use.Hopefully we don't get a Xenonauts 2.			"

												Child soldiers would do better against the aliens in this game. They would have equal accuracy, moral, and team work skills (i.e. not shooting your own guys in the back of the head when in formation). So why would they be better? Because they would be smaller targets when the aliens snipe then from across the map. Hell, maybe then your squads might actually survive a mission.			"

												Generally a good remake of original UFO: Enemy unknown in year 1994. Would want to give the game ""recommend"". However, the unrealistic setting in regarding to the financing, world political, world economy setting (by comparing to another xcom title - x -com : Enemy unknown) and the excessive punishment setting which prevent me to enjoy the game. 1. The organisation is poorly financed by the world and expectation is unreasonably high. Easily get financial punishment without a proper reason. Unable to expand due to financial problem.2. Reward setting is poor. Success in high risk mission do not end up with equivalent high reward. (Destorying an alien base do not get apprasal from the local government)3. Financing setting is poor. Limited option to get additional financing. Reselling price of advance equipment is unreasonably low just like the alien technology is commonly available to the world4. With such high end technology and elite soliders on hand, the organisation can simply choose to walk away and get financial from other source (selling alien technology, equipment in black market, team with the most rich in the world) and deal with the alien threat on its own (just like some other sci-fi fiction). Therefore, the excessive punishment setting in the game is not enjoyable. Beside, if the government choose to kill itself, who care. The end of the government does not mean the end of the world, so long the organisation continue to exist. Sadlessly our real world actually telling you this in these recent years.Anyway, the main point is, as a simulator, it would not be harmful if the game include the original rule set, improved rule setting and custom rule set for player to suit their style.

												This game is XCOM. It ***is*** XCOM. If you own any of the XCOM games, save your money and play them instead.Don't get me wrong: there's nothing wrong with it. It's just that it's so much like XCOM that I'm surprised it's allowed to exist. There's nothing new about it except for a graphics update, and if you've played any of the latest console versions of XCOM, even that's not there. So, why am I surprised it's allowed to exist? It's just a photocopy of the XCOM. To me, this game borders on trademark/copyright infringment. It's like me opening a McDonald's restaurant and making just one change: calling the restaurant McDanold's.I've read other reviews where people have written, ""This is XCOM as is was meant to be,"" or ""This is XCOM perfected."" Really? Well, I guess it was perfect before, then, because as I wrote, there's not much new about it. There are some changes: it takes place during the Cold-War, you can control your interceptor when fighting UFOS (think Zaxxon or Defender), and I guess sometimes your interceptor faces multiple enemies. However, these things are all superficial changes.Now, I have to say that I've only played the game for around three hours, so maybe there's something new that pops up at five hours, but I highly doubt it. I also have to say that I really didn't look into what this game offered before I bought it, so my feeling of getting ripped off is my own fault. But please listen to me: if you're looking for a game that might be like XCOM but better, this isn't it. This is just XCOM: Enemy Unknown. If you already own that or another XCOM game and you like it, play that when you're hungry for a fix. Don't buy this one. "

												Oh alright. I've finally found myself reviewing this game. There's a lot of thoughts slewing around in my head about this game. And I've finally come to a conclusion. In it's core concept it's a literal sucessor to UFO defense. For, at the time of this post, 5 times the price of the original  X-COM UFO Defense on steam. The guns are pretty unbalanced, generic and boring, the game feels odd, it doesn't feel like an advancement from the original. There are currently a lot of problems with this game. And I could go on and on about them. Most of them have to do with the gameplay. (However I should note the modder community is currently doing a lot for the game, making a lot of new weapons and whatnot to be put into the game.) There's a difference between 'Difficult but fair' and 'Difficult and stressful'. The developers have yet to figure out how to do the first one. Until the game is patched up a lot and a lot of the game hopefully fixed, I don't recommend this game to anyone. It's not so much that it's bad, but you almost might as well get the original game unless you're willing to spend $20 more for updated graphics and unbalanced gameplay.			"

												If you did not play classic X-Com, stay away! This game is rife with dated choices and overly complex mechanics. Lots of awesome ideas ruined by a strict adherence to emulation of a decades old game. Combat is a snooze fest and air combat is complex for the sake of complexity. However, the fluff of the world is fantastic and I really enjoyed unlocking new technologies  just to read the descriptions. I would have loved to spend more time with the game, but the very long and tedious battles just wore me out.			"

												Do not buy this game unless your the nostalgic type. It is very much like old school turn based strategy games, but also lacks modern game mechanics and improvements of newer turn based strategy games. The GUI is awful. It is poorly laid out. It isn't even remotely intuitive. Theres no cover mechanic. In fact it seems like shooting from cover makes your shots inaccurate. Sometimes your shot will hit the waist high wall in front of you. The complex gameplay is good. The game does have a lot of depth to it, but it is just poorly made. Its an indie title so I'll allow for the poor graphics, but it is not worth $25.1 / 10 would not recommend. DO NOT BUY.			"

												aand once again an attempt to do the XCOM of the new decade... and like the firaxis attempt, a miss.Tactical combat is ruined by cover system implemented over horrible map design.geoscape interface suffers from illogical command order (launch interceptors-select target-select planes, WHAT?)and apparently hotrigging an alien plasma rifle with a tactical handle plus trigger wire system is too high-tech so you research plasma rifles to... be able to sell them, or something.shame, really. Nonetheless after 20 years and more than 10 different sequels/spinoffs/copies if you wonder between buying this one, the 2012 firaxis ""xcom"" or the original do yourself a favor and buy original enemy unknonwn, terror from the deep and XCOM Apocalypse and play them on dosbox.

												Xenonauts suffers from what many other games of this type suffer from, and that is ""click to roll dice.  input not required further.  listed results not guaranteed, unless it disadvantages player"".  This is probably the best game in this genre in many years, far surpassing the Xcom remakes, but is still more of a dice simulator than a game.  Actual gameplay does exist in Xenonauts, but its built in such a way that every decision is a pass/fail state.  IE, build your starting base in the wrong place, fail after an hour or two.  Build in the right place, survive for a couple hours.  Research the right techs and build the right corresponding devices, extend playtime 30 minutes to an hour.  Build anything else, end gameplay with failstate.  This will continue until the game over screen or the campaign victory screen.  Its a lot like hardcore 2d platformers in that its all about memorizing the right steps to take at the right times.  The most painful aspect to this is that you can easily survive awhile with the wrong decision, which gives you a false sense of progress, only to run into a brick wall that jolts you with ""hmmm so choosing X tech over Y tech an hour ago would have trivialized this new threat/mechanic.""  That is all there is to this game. Positioning of your soldiers in ground combat is nearly exactly the same.  There are 2 or 3 tactics that are nearly guaranteed to win you battles, and about a million tactics that literally wipe out your entire squad/fleet/base in a single round and end your campaign, and most succesful tactics involve exploiting some factor of the design.  Save scumming is easy in this game but really isnt that useful unless you want to avoid the dozens of hours required to get to the next pass/fail state and figure out the required move(hint: save scum for awhile to figure it out, then play a perfect campaign at whatever difficulty you want.  then uninstall. otherwise your just going to end up disapointed with the time you spent running the campaign to figure out the states). Something about the artwork and written lore however, really give this game VASTLY more atmosphere and character than the high budget cutscene and voice acting laden sexed up Xcom remakes.  That is both a compliment to Xenonauts and a slash on the Xcoms, but the fact remains there is almost nothing redeeming about this style of game. Getting attached to your soldiers is something much talked about, but neither Xcom nor xenonauts really have any personality in the characters and thus losing them is really only troubling due to losing a unit that has higher on screen dice rolls that ultimately are utterly meaningless given the inherent hit/death gameplay.  Much has also been made about the difficulty and Ironman modes, and to that i refer you to the wall of text i just wrote.If you are into it though, then Xenonauts is the best game you can buy in this genre on the market currently in my opinion.  It at least feels the most like a game and seems to be from developers that are genuinely interested in fake gameplay and interesting universes.			"

												This game has two levels: the strategic geoscape, and the tactical maps.The strategic aspect of this game is spot on.  Building facilities and managing your budget are key aspects to this game.  And the most enjoyable.That being said, the tactical part of this game sucks.  It is ENTIRELY based on a poorly designed random number generator (RNG.)  The RNG determines if shots will hit or not.  Your shots frequently miss (and your soilders are ex- SPECOPs by the way,)  while shots from the aliens will pass through several solid objects, including shields and other soilders (without injuring them) and fatally strike a soilder you were retreating.  Shots will frequently miss even at point blank ranges with all weapons, especially with shotguns and sniper rifles (I mean, really, shove the gun down the xeno's throat and pull the f---ing trigger.)  Your troops seem to have failed basic training (read: boot camp.)  They will FREQUENTLY panic without even being shot at.  They will throw down their weapons and run (I once had a soilder run INTO a UFO.  (What the f--- made you think of that idea dumba$$?)  You can not sling a soilder's weapon, throw a grenade, and unsling the weapon (so its back in your soilder's hands) during the same turn.  Needless to say, this make a panic smoke grenade impossible.  It seems that some doors are incapable of being closed (really, you're in the military and you can't close certain doors?)  It seems your soilders are incapable of melee combat without a certain weapon (a stun batton.)  (So, let me get this straight, you DON't know how to slam the butt of your rifle into a xeno's face?)  I've also had issues with soilders throwing grenades at thier feet.  (I'm not even going to say anything about that.)  Finnaly, the alien's psionic abilities are completly imbalanced.  Theroretically, they are capable of mind controling a soilder they can't even see while he is still on the dropship (and possibly dropping a C4 charge with zero turns on the timer.)  Not good at all when a core mechanic of the game is permadeath.(My English teacher would be saying to start a new paragraph here, so...) Then there are bugs.  Aliens seem to be capable of seeing through walls (then running up to your assult trooper holding a shot gun and blow his (your soilder's) brains out.  Meanwhile, your three other soilders covering that door don't do a damn thing.  I've had issues with blank screens and freezing as well (and this is a very resource unintensive game runing on a gaming PC.)  I've had soilders get shot, survive, and then drop dead as soon as my turn begins.  Finnaly, in the year 2014, this game uses a launcher.  A launcher that will not launch itself with certain background programs running (i.e. firewall and anti-virus.)			"

												Unlike some of the other reviewers I have no nostalgic tendencies towards games of this sort, I'm just a new user coming to it fresh. I found the graphics clunky and then spent an hour trying to work out how to kill some aliens at a crash site, with my soldiers shooting each other, before giving up. The rest of my steam playtime was idling for the trading cards.Maybe I should have spent more time on it before writing a review but the bottom line is that I just couldn't be bothered. A game has to appeal to new users as well as experienced ones, and this fails miserably. I'm afraid I can't recommend this as I've been spoiled by the far superior turn-based strategy game, Frozen Synapse.			"

								Still too buggy.   Lost my entire roster of soldiers when I reloaded my save from the previous night.It is a fairly faithful re-creation of X-COM, except for the cold-war skin they've wrapped it in, but I'm reluctantly forced to admit that Time Units are a fairly bland and overly complicated mechanic that ultimately slows down the game flow.  Games have been dumbed down quite a bit since 1994, but in some ways they have evolved as well.  What Xenonauts tries to do, it does well, but better ways to do it have been thought up since then.XCOM EU used the D&D4e rules to great effect on ground missions, and it was much less headache inducing.

								Interesting concept. On the plus side this game does offer gameplay reminiscent of the original XCom series. The abilty to research alien technology and then reverse engineer to enhance your team of elite soliders as they battle aliens in a variety of tuen based senarios is still there. Also there is the need to manage the logistics surrounding managing your resources including contsructing new equipment and costs associated with expanding  your bases facilitites. What is different is the pace of gameplay. Even on easy setting this game is very difficult, so much so that you find yourself saving and reloading again and again. The result is slowed gameplay that often feels like a real slog whereas the original titles were challenging but well paced. Other annoyances include the constant bugs that plague each release. All of my games work seamlessly with the expcetion of this title which crashes again and again. I accept this is a beta but this game is well into its software development life cycle so I'm dismayed to see so many problems still cropping up this late in the piece (the designers state they want to release this game in its completed form early this year). With the exception of die hard fanboys I can not see this title have much appeal to mainstream gamers like myself. Good effort but still not enough to dethrone the original Xcom titles.			"

								I was tricked into buying this game a week before the X-COM came out in the market.The developers had that as a ""release date"" initially on desur a. The game kept crashing at that stage and I couldnt get my money back so I remained silent and waited for the game to finally release for real.Now, that much time later, it's still called an ""early access game"" while the X-COM has already released expansions.This game could have been a good one if it was released 5-10 years ago, but in its current state and horrible graphics (the aerial battles are just ridiculous, atari had better graphics... Honestly).In any case- you don't play a game just for graphics- so lets hope battles are a bit balanced or something. They aren't. The easy mode doesn't feel easy to me and I have finished XCOM in difficult setting. Targeting around corners needs reworking too.If you have money to burn buy this game, you'll get bored though. Oh, also every couple new releases your last save won't be working.			"

								A poor remake with arcade realism. The developer himself admits to watering down the game. They've based the entire game economy on the air war, and, at the same time - made the air war far far too easy. Buy this only at a deep Steam sale discount. Probably in the $9.99 range, but at full price it just isn't worth it.If more dissappointing is the fact that your fighters can NEVER be killed. If they get shot down they magically ""crash land"", only to be completely rebuilt FOR FREE in a short 72 hours. Also, pilots never get injured and you get a free one of those aswell.The ground game is half decent, but air combat is candy land that one cannot simply dismiss it. It ruins immersion and any sense that you were playing a panetary defence simulation.Avoid.This is NOT the X-Com you so fondly remember.			"

It is more close to the old X-COM system giving you a lot of choice as to what goes down, you can have a large amount of deployable troops and generally the combat seems to be more ""tangible"" than X-COM: Unknown.Problem is it has a lot of problems, I told myself I wouldn't play it again until it's release so thus, fuss and ergo...Here we are.I'm scoring it now because I'm going to gamble the team vanish to dust before it's released.2 out of 5 chiliwigs.

It has a very similar flow and game mechanics but despite hardcopying everything, it could still manage to do its own thing. It feels more old-school and much less unforgiving than most contemporary games - but these are absolutely good things in my book.For the fullest experiene it's recommended to enable the Community Edition mod.

												I'm playing the community edition, which polishes up some of the mechanics.  This game is pretty solid, and well thought out.  The geoscape and air combat feel pretty authentic, and that alone sets this apart from the new XCOM.  The ground combat is tedious, but in a good way.  I'm constantly counting my TUs trying to decide when to run up to an alien to blast their face off with a shotgun, and when I pull it off, it is extremely satisfying.The CE maps are challenging even in the early game, and this game doesn't ease you into the mechanics as much as XCOM did.  I play this game on normal difficulty, and I'm not ashamed to save scum because sometimes I still take dead soldiers at the end of a mission if the trade off was worth it.  That's because the risks and rewards in this game are balanced, and the progression is logical.  I'd reccomend this game if you like spending an hour planning every 5 minutes of action.			"

												Great game! It's a good one for whose who want a game in where you need to actually think and feel challenged. It""s fundamental to have stategies, and if you go out playing recklessly, you'll definately lose soldiers, vehicles and bases. There's a whole width of things that you can do, strategies that you can take, approaches that you can make! It's a game that you look for the gameplay, not for the graphs or something. If you like strategy games, go for it and don't think twice! It's totally worth the price.			"

								If you liked XCOM: Enemy Unkown, then Xenonauts is the game you want to play. It's more advanced, detailed and a little less sci-fi. Still in development, so invest now if you want to make this game better. Plus, Xenonauts will be a lot more expensive when it comes out!			"

								Classic Turn-Based Strategy. It's basically a re-newed version of the old X-Com Game. Not quite finished but nicely done and alot of fun for those who like the genre. Grow your force carefully, once a soldier of yours dies, there is NO going back. Keep those Veterans safe and play smart. ;)			"

												I've been following this title for ages and while I couldn't resist trying out the alpha demo about two years ago, mainly checking the looks and feels, I never really played the pre-release versions. I prefer having a complete experience, so I patiently waited for the magical 1.0.And now it finally arrived. I am not disappointed.I completed a playthrough on Normal not using Iron Man Mode in an 18 hour session, interrupted only by a short break to catch some Zs. I was pretty much hooked right from the start. The base building and overall beginning of the game is very XCOM-y. If it wasn't for the 2D geoscape you might as well be thinking you're playing the original. But there are certainly differences.Aerial Combat:The mini game for this got made over quite a bit. You can manually move your jets around the battlefield and issue basic orders like 'evasive maneuvers', 'fire missile' and 'retreat'. I found it especially fun to fight bigger UFOs. Get one Jet to distract the enemy and another to get on the bogeys tail, hammering away on his butt. If you don't like this kind of gameplay you can just let the CPU auto-calculate the outcome for you, with the approximate winning chance displayed on the encounter screen.Annoyances:- The Corsair is way too strong, making alien air superiority fighters nothing more than a nuissance.- The amount of UFOs appearing during end game can get quite the hassle. Not because they are dangerous, but because it ends in a neverending clickfest.Ground Combat:Awesome. Finally you can freely equip your soldiers again (unlike in Firaxis' XCOM, which had way too few options after my fancy). You can use a squad with different specialists or just stick to a jack-of-all-trades kind of team. I managed to work with the latter, but it was way more difficult and less fun at the same time. However I only played on normal difficulty, so I don't know how viable this is in harder modes. I'd definitely recommend going for specialized troops.Aliens behave differently. There are smarter ones and dumber ones. Overall the AI is ok, but not breath taking. Yet the suspense IS there. Playing the game in a pitch black room, sweeping the area for hostiles while trying to keep your men and the civilians alive never ceases to be great and thrilling fun.Movement and aiming hasn't changed much, but the newly included suppression system makes the combat feel way more alive. It counters reaction shots, so you can't just camp in a good position until the sun explodes. However this tactic is very often neglected by the AI. Would like to see them be more aggressive. Yet again, maybe that's the case in harder modes.Also, you can now just bomb crash sites if you don't need anything in particular from it. This will yield no XP/loot but money. Really saves you from getting dizzy doing the 100th scout UFO ground mission for just some crap loot. Good thinking there.Annoyances:- Why no quicksave/-load? The hardcore crowd will play in Iron Man Mode anyway, so why not include this simple feature? If I just didn't see the button, shame on me.- Sometimes maps repeat, I only ever had it happen twice I think, but it shouldn't happen during the same game at all.- Alien Bases are too similair. I always found the base commander in the same corner of the base (I did 5 base assaults). Can this be randomized a little more? (Why did I just write 'base' four times in one sentence?)- Why are there ALWAYS civilians? If a UFO crashes in no man's land, there shouldn't be any. Just a minor thing, but the occasional map without friendly NPCs would do for some randomization as well.Tech Talk:Uhh, well it's an indie game with a 2D engine. If you expect some fancy AAA effects and stuff you will be disappointed. But I have to admit the ingame sprites and art work in the game's encyclopedia are very good. The battlegrounds look great and especially the alien assets (and UFOs) look very nice. Sound effects are nothing too special but meaty enough. The music during ground combat is awesome though and really helps create the creepy mood. Well done!Conclusion:That pretty much sums it up. The geoscape gameplay is mostly the same as always. Research, build, expand, intercept. I wouldn't know what to drastically alter there and everything is well made, so it's fine for me.All in all I am very impressed and would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the old XCOM games or is looking to get into this kind of genre.tl;dr: 9/10 would play again "

Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of turn based games and especially those who played Enemy Unknown but were left wanting something more challenging and complex.Another thing worth mentioning is that the game is very moddable and according to the developers the game will get Workshop support in the near future so things can only go up from here.

												Finally! Xenonauts replaces the original X-Com for me! The remake by fraxis didn't but I like it for separate reasons (like the Bureau). The game can be a little long the first play through since you dont' know what your doing, and the geo strategy game can be brutal. There are also a few bugs, but most of them are harmless. The end game has one that's crops up every once in a while, that requires you to reload.  The graphics a good for a indie project, but not state of the art. Despite the downsides, this is the modern X-Com! It adds a lot of new twists,  I love the strategic depth of Xenonauts, managing multiple aircraft in dogfights with UFO's. Truth is,  I didn't immediately realize the tactical depth in this when I first started playing, but after a few hours I realized it had more depth (and control) than I initially relaized.I also loved the addition of tactical shields to your teams arsenal, makes a new tactical element to your teams, and being able to set up defeault equipment for a role, or create a new role, or a hundred other small improvements over X-Com really show how Xenonauts isnt just a clone, but a player that sets a new bar.I love the armed civillians,  Billy Bob on his farm with a shotgun killing the aliens for probing his cows. The local cop who saved my beacon in a  tough fight. The military that shows up later in the game armed with the laser rifles I supplied them with, now helping my team out (somewhat). I loved my predator armor that could walk through walls and obstacles. I really enjoyed setting off several chain explosions with my explosives and firefights that clears large portions of the map! I'm really impressed with this game! It really is the ultimate X-Com homage. Its going to be tough for me to try other indie efforts after this unless they bring something vastly new to the table. Others have come close, but Xenonauts gets enough of it right to take the mantle. I hope some aspiring moder converts it to the original X-Com with the included modding tools. I would so play that mod!There is also a lot more under the hood that could be used. Some modder created a nice wav collection that realty amped up the tactical combat with lots of military chatter, lots of mods already and can't wait to see where this is in a year.			"

												Overall a solid experience. The only thing that annoyed me was some questionable mechanics in the ground combat mode. Ex* No melee weapons except the stun baton?* Experienced solders going berserk without any apparent reason killing your squad with a bazooka or other weapon of choice. And apparently when berserk they have hugely increased accuracy?* Soldiers missing shots at point blank range (95% hit)* Soldiers that cant throw grenades over flowers/bushes killing them self in the process (same with bazookas).* Reaction shoots works poorly. Quite often your soldiers never takes reaction shots even if an alien is running around in front of them. I solved this by doing 2 saves each turn (At the beginning and at the end of each turn) and reloading if any of the soldiers messed up. Would be fun to know how many times I did a quicksave but i'm sure its 2000+ times. 7/10			"

Early Access Review
								Review based on V1.01Most of what is good in this game has to do with the fact that for the most part its gameplay is copied directly from the original (1994) XCOM. XCOM is easily one of the best designed games ever, so a faithful remake can't be too bad by definition, and this one is not bad at all.Where Xenonauts tries to diverge from XCOM it does that with mixed results. For example, the alien races are quite a bit more diverse. One of the starting races is tough, has innate regeneration, but poor eyesight and is best dealt with from a distance. The starting weapons are great - the classic pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle and machine gun differ not only in stats (as in the original), but in their tactical values. Shotguns are deadly close-up, machines guns dish out tons of damage and can easily punch through obstacles, sniper rifles are amazingly accurate from a distance. Advancing the weapon tech is, unfortunately, quite boring. It is the same set of classic weapon archetypes all over again, only gradually more powerful. This is exactly the same as in the original game, but after seeing the initial diversity of ballistic weapons this was very disappointing. I had the same issue with the Firaxis XCOM - a ""laser shotgun"" just has to be one of the silliest sci-fi weapon concepts. The more interesting parts of the original tech tree, like the mind probe, the motion scanner, the psi technology and the blaster launcher are no longer in the game. The UFO activity seems to be much more involved, later in the game the aliens will start defending their missions with aggressive fighter wings that will bring down your dropship or fighters returning from a mission if you are not careful. The aerial terror missions are also a nice touch.On the other hand, the interception mini-game is highly repetitive, and very slow-paced - I have been using autoresolve most of the time because it gets very tedious after just a few interceptions, and the game will usually swarm you with UFOs because of how the economy works.I really didn't like the change where the engineers can no longer build items for profit - that option made a lot of sense in the original game (though was  probably too good to the point of Xenonauts' authors calling the feature an ""exploit""). In Xenonauts your engineers are just wasted resources unless you need something built immediately, which you don't always do, so they have to be fired / re-hired as needed to save money.The funding provided by the nations is just about enough to run 2 bases and fund two workshops. The only source of income for further expansion are the UFO raids, which are (relatively) less profitable than in the original, and therefore have to be more frequent. There is even an option to earn about 33% of the downed UFO's worth by bombing the crash site in order to avoid losing money when the ground squad is not available. Still, the income is quite low. For instance, the cost of a new base is $1M. Medium-sized UFOs that are prevalent in the mid game are worth about $50-75K if you raid them and $25K if you bomb them, minus the combat losses that can be VERY painful (a basic scout vehicle costs $60K to produce, and they are easy to lose). This means that in order to get a new base you need to raid about 15 UFOs with near perfect performance, and that is not considering the cost of buildings, staff and maintenance.Ground combat is pretty much the same as in the original game, except for the cover system that can sometimes be frustrating because it is not at all obvious how it calculates the lines of fire, and the game won't show you the cover calculations unless you are aiming at something.The game's performance is frankly embarrassing at times. The Geoscape scrolling is very laggy, visibility calculations cause obvious frame rate drops on larger maps, and the animations seem not to load until they are played for the first time, so the first time a new animation is shown it is basically dropped frames. This is simply unacceptable for a 2D game that is not particularly more complex than a 20 year old game that ran fine on computers compared to which your today's phone is a freaking alien planetary mainframe.Overall, the game does not really add that much to the original XCOM experience, however it recreates it quite successfully. I am finding myself returning to play just a couple more missions all the time.			"

												Bought this game a while ago and thought it was time to write a review.If you love the old UFO/XCOM games (the MSDOS ones from Microsoft) you will love this game. It is VERY similar comapred to those classics, with of course imrpoved graphics and gameplay.Everything you loved in the old games is here..and more....or better,sometimes both.The intercepting of an ufo for example. Now you can control andgive directions to your fighters,where to fly,to evade,afterburner etc. Its possible to shoot down a large UFO, by using inferiour/outdated crafts and weapons, by just apllying a good strategy. Some UFOS have escort crafts, some ufos need rockets(torpedos) to make them land. There are alot of options.The actual isometric ground combat is much harder than in the old Xcoms. The aliens are more deadly and smarter than the Mircoprose ones. It requires care and patience to surivive the first missions without casualties. In general, the learning curve for thsi game is steeper in every aspect. The financial part is very challening. To keep your bases running and build new fighters and weapons or armor is costly. Even the base locations took me several starts to really get a cost efficient coverage of the globe. Of course all the other game aspects from the classics are here. Base construction, research, building items, improving your squad etc are all here...but as i mentiond just better polished.I played the early 2000 UFO games,which were realtime and hated them. I played the 2k Xcom and never really liked it. It looks flashy, but the gameplay is just boring and stale. It does not feel grand and very limited.Xenonauts gives me all the freedom i want ...and it makes me pay for it, if i make poor decisions....but i love it. "

								Xenonauts is Xcom's less flashy, more in-depth brother: where Xcom is streamlined and sexy, Xenonauts is more tactical and strategic. In other words, where Xcom is more about how a team of super heroes saves the world by working their way up to god-like power and ability, Xenonauts is more like a real special forces sim: sooner or later, something is going to get someone (or half the team) whacked, and your going need to prepare if you don't want to lose the game. In other words, the loss hurts, but it is far more manageble than Xcom.			"

Early Access Review
								Xenonauts is a wonderful clone of the original XCOM - UFO DEFENSE and is in many ways a better experience. Xenonauts is more intuitive and pretty than its predecesor as well as creating the same feeling that you are juggling 9001 balls at once, and are constantly a few poor choices away from total collapse. All in all, the game is a great experience.Although I have not completed the game, just scratched the surface really (I've played three months in-game), I can say for certain that all of the difficulty of the original game is present. Every desicion is vital and it is imperative to really consider the best course of action at all times. If you don't, well, let's say there have been more than a few missions which resulted in complete annihilation of my squad, a terrible loss.The game is also much more faithful to the original than XCOM - ENEMY UNKNOWN, bringing back TU's, much larger squads, and a more complicated geoscape portion of the game. In many respects, though, it improves on the original. The OP Blaster bomb has been removed, the graphics look polished and attractive, and useful/relevant data is more easily accessed.However, I do not mean to say that the game is without faults. For new players to the series, there is hardly and tutorial to introduce them to the many facets of being an international super-secret alien defense force commander. This means the learning curve can be quite steep. Furthermore, the game has some frustrating line of sight issues. Sometimes, I will attempt to move my soldier to firing position, only to discover that the bush I was trying to shoot through might as well be a solid wall. Although over time I have been able to more successfully ascertain what I can and can't do, it has provided a great deal of frustration.All in all, the game is excellent, and in my oppinion more pleasurable to play than the original. (Although the punishing nature of the original adds a bit to the feel. Ironically by making it better it's worse?) Anyway, if you are a fan of strategy games or the original series then I would highly recommend you purchase this game immediately and begin fighting off the extraterrestrial invasion!			"

								Mostly like the original X-Com, or at least it manages to come closer than any of the other attempts to re-create it. Most if not all of the new features and quality of life improvements are going to anger the grognards (""WTF!!!! destroyed interceptors are replaced automatically!?!? I have infinte flares?! what is this babies first strategy game?!?"") but for people not living in a magical fantasy land where in all the good games stopped being made around 1994 these improvements will be welcome. I still like EU/EW and the original X-Com better, but this is still good.			"

Early Access Review
								Revist/remake of the old school Microprose UFO: Enemy Unknown game. Its very similar to the original with a lot of the content removed(multi-format release) from the latest XCOM game returning .This game has improved strategy in the global setting over Xcom, with you needing to way up more options like; do I build another base to incease radar & aircraft range or add labs & scientists to get better equipment. Time is not on your side, funding dissapears very quickly on hard settings, especially due to unmonitored alien activity.The visuals do a decent job as does the AI (on normal & above). The maps are reasonably varied, yet do repeat slightly more than i'd like. They're about the right size & unlike the original I havent found myself hunting the map for the last camping in a loft alien for 30 mins. Theres also a nice addition in the form of being able to airstrike downed UFO's rather than sending a team in. Overall I've throughly enjoyed this so far and am happy to recommend it, if you havent played the original this is well worth your money. Do bare in mind though that the game is very unforgiving, especailly on the more challenging modes. "

Early Access Review
								Most games find it difficult to provide a challenge, and make it feel fair, most end up having situations in which your character or characters are killed, and you feel cheated at tge way it happened, it normally feels like a cheap shot.Not in Xenonauts though.If a soldier is killed, you don´t feel like the game pulled a ♥♥♥♥ move, no, you know it was your fault, that you ♥♥♥♥ed up, and that you ♥♥♥♥ed up hard.Even then, losing soldiers is part of the game, the game clearly tells us that for all your preparations and tactics, you are still going to lose men and women to a much superior foe, and even if you start closing the gap, that it will keep happening, and happening, and there´s not much that you can do about it.But, that´s the alure of Xenonauts, a game that manages to strike a balance between challenge and fun.So, in short, this is a well recommended game.

								At the time of this review, the game was still in development and thus there were some glitches, bugs and balance issues.With that in mind, I still recommend this game as a somewhat successful x-com copy. Graphics arent the best, but I have to admit that old school graphics scare me more than fully detailed 3d and shiny aliens in newer games from bigger studios. the pace is quite slow and you have to ponder every move, slowly get your team into position for every corner (a thing about tactical turn based games) Difficulty wise, Xenonauts is a bit tough on beginners, however if you are reading this, that means you are after some depth and challenge in a game, anyway. For x-com veterans it should be a walk in the park (while getting killed many times by an unseen alien and reloading every now and then)Although targeted to a limited market, this game can only get better with time as developers work on it.

												Okay, so this is not a review so much as the ravings of a rabid fan boy.  This game is amazing. If you even remotely liked X-Com:UD and were saddened by Firaxis's approach to the reboot, give this a try.  The art style is great, the writing in the UFOpedia is well done, and the battles have a nice variety of tactical options if you use all the toys at your disposal. It is for all intents and purposes a clone of the parent game, but it is lovingly done and has enough new things to keep this one in my library for a long time.			"

								This is the best remake of XCOM yet. I loved Enemy Unknown but it's got nothing on the original. Xenonauts is as close to an original as you can get.So far, there are some issues regarding balance. Some battles are far too easy and aliens will flee pretty quickly but it's always being addressed. Play it on the harder difficulty and it's quite fun already and we just saw it enter beta.The UI and graphics have been upgraded multiple time and are still being worked on. It is already extremely playable.Xenonauts has the best micromanagement of the original with the suppression and new weapons of EU. It is the best of both worlds and, at 20 bucks, there's no reason not to own this fantastic game.XCOM for life.			"

												Xenonauts is basically a modern remake of the original Xcom, and it retains most of its original features. -Uses TU(time units) which allows for a large diversity of actions to be taken during a turn, instead of the simplified scoot n shoot action system from Xcom:EU-Destructible Terrain: you can destroy light cover, such as haybales and low barricades, to larger things such as entire walls-Can have more than one base to operate from on the globe, and it can be placed in any exact location down to a pixel-Base building: a 6 by 6 grid that can be outfitted with a variety of structures to win the war-Base assault and defense: You can assault alien strongholds on earth and vice versa-Medium size combat teams: You get to start off with 8 units, and you can increase that amount to 10 later on.-No class restricting roles: You can equip any soldier with any item, and designate their roles as you deem fit. -Soldier Inventory system: though slightly streamlined, (no more leg or shoulder slots, just hands, belt, and backpack.) you   can equip soldiers with as much as they can carry weight/space wise. For those uninitiated into the wonder of the Xcom universe, the game basically plays as a world defense simulator. The earth gets attacked by aliens, and all of the worlds super powers are left bent over a table with their pants down. You, and your organization, the Xenonauts, are effectively the last defense we have left. You start out by placing a base on the globe, and then monitor alien activity around you via radar dishes. While things are dark, you can research alien artifacts and technology,  build new military toys, and invest in both your base and its employees. Once a Ufo is spotted, you can choose to launch a fighter or interceptor to its location to try and shoot it down. If you succeed, you'll most likely be given the option to send a mop up crew to kill off any survivors and acquire whatever the ship had aboard it. Alternatively, you can also send in an airstrike in to obliterate the crash site, netting you a small amount of cast from the pieces left. Once a crew of soldiers arrives at a crashsite or other battlefield, the game plays out in a turn based fashion. You move your soldiers around a battlefield, using various cover, weapons, and equipment to out position and destroy your foe. Whether that be by blowing a hole in the side of a building and running inside to flank an enemy, tossing a flash bang or smoke grenade to disorient and charge the enemy head on, or laying down supressive fire while a sniper gets into position and guns down an enemy. The choice is up to you. While Xenonauts does however, have its own share of faults, (Playing the same levels over and over in combat missions, predictable enemies inside downed ufos, graphics ocassionally bugging out, etc.) they are few and far between, and the game can be modded to the point where most of these things are not an issue. If you liked the original Xcom, I can almost assure you that you will love this game, and if you've never played one before, you should give it a shot.			"

												If you loved the original X-Com, you will like this game a lot.This game can be rather unforgiving if you're not well versed in the old games. The X-Com reboot is but a pale shadow of what this game is. (That's not to say X-Com wasn't fun. It totally was).Xenonauts will test your patience in the battlefield as well as your tactical senses. If you're impatient and charge in, you'll be replacing soldiers more often than not. If you decide to make a beeline to the UFO, you could get blindsided by aliens you didn't see.Outside of the actual battlefield and into the Global Map, there are a fair few choices as well. Research is all important so that you begin to level the playing field between you an the aliens. You will also need to decide whether or not to expand quickly or build up your current base and its forces. There are bonuses but also negative points to this. A new base means more coverage, happier nations, more UFOs to tag, etc, but then you have to juggle this with the costs involved with running a new base. Because of the depth this game offers, this game is a welcome sight to strategy veterans.			"

I originally bought the game 3 years ago and looked forward to this day checking the website frequently to know when the final experience was ready.Firaxis' latest Xcom is the candy coated, visually impressive but lacking substance of what this game actually is.It may have taken 5 years to make, but it was well worth it, after all it's the first game which I will claim to be a true spiritual successor 20 years later.

												Great remake of the legendary UFO Defense. Not a re-interpretation of it (as the quite excellent but much different XCOM Ennemy unknown), but litterally a remake with the same principles, recreated with a lovingly accurate and painstaking details. The 1970's cold war touch is also very welcome. New monsters, new tech, beautiful artwork, and, after 20 hours of play, still no bugs and no crash. Wonderful!			"

												This started out hard, but fun. And then psionics happened to it. For a supposedly tactical game, half your success on missions comes down to ""not failing your save against psionic enemies with unlimited range and no line of sight required"". You don't get psionics to throw back at them, you don't get any counters to it, and you have no idea where the attacks are coming from. Usually it's some enemy on the far end of the map, so you can't even try and rush them to remove the threat.It's not a challenge, it's just random rolls that occasionally mean half your team freezes and you waste a round. This game would have been better off without it, or limiting psionics to line of sight so you can do crazy OP tactics like ""scouting"" and ""planning"". Get XCom-Enemy Within, it uses actual game difficulty rather than arbitrarily zapping you.			"

												Xenonauts brings back some pretty fond, decades old memories of the original XCom games. While it doesn't have the polish and the level of detail you see in Enemy Within it does do a few things better. The most obvious one is the geoscape. Multiple bases, alien crafts everywhere, invasions, bombings, etc etc.+ The game feels both classic and modern at the same time.+ A vastly improved geoscape over Enemy Within.- Those reaction shots. There have been so many times where my soldiers shoot their own guys in the back.Playtime: 33h8/10			"

												I have played for six hours now and find the game to be a refreshing remake of the x-com series. With the exception of X-com Enemy Unknown (which is a whole new concept and is a fantastic leap forward in stradegy and story line linked games) Xenonauts is by far the best playing and most satisfying game of its type to date in my opinion and I have played all the x-com games extensively. It does need some more depth in the research and manufacturing areas but once its been refined I can see this game being one of the best of its kind for years to come.			"

												I can't say how close this is to the original XCOM game because i haven't played it, but I did play Enemy Unknown. While Enemy Unknown is a great game. I enjoy Xenonauts a whole lot more compared to Enemy Unknown, simply because it is a lot more complex and requires more thought. Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of turn based games and especially those who played Enemy Unknown but were left wanting something more challenging and complex.Another thing worth mentioning is that the game is very moddable and according to the developers the game will get Workshop support in the near future so things can only go up from here.

												Not played any of the XCom games, either originalso I can say without nostalgia that this game is awesome! Bing nitpicky I'd've liked a tutorial, as a complete newcommer I had no idea where anything was, what I was ment to be doing etc and info screens only go so far to help and I'd like to see some sort of tech tree, either full in the manual or progressive ingame, showing what you've researched and what it leads to, form that you can often guess what might be coming next. What I do love is the simplicity of the ideas but the increadable complexity of everything that goes into them. It's nice as a noob to see a % chance to hit and mostly through trial and error I started figuring some things out to improve it and then I turned to the manual and found the long extensive maths that goes into calculating it.The graphics, although simplistic, suit the game remarkably and allow it to run on a brick like my laptop without any real problems.All told, this is a really great, addictive game that's slowly eating my life away :D			"

												This is one of the best turn based strategy games I have ever played. It is very well made; I have seen no glitchs or bugs, and the controls make miss-clicks a rare occurence. The difficulty scale is great as well. At the lower levels, it is more forgiving for new players yet still really fun. At the higher difficulties, it requires a high level of both stategic and tactical knowledge to survive, providing a very satisfiying challenge that I have not seen since Civ V.The only problems I have with the game is that it does not tell how long some things may take to do, like researching tech and hiring new personel. This is a minor issue however, because after several playthroughs you have a general idea of how long these things may take to do.Overall, Xenonauts is a great strategy game (9 of 10) and is well worth playing.

												I am not going to review the mechanics of this game. There are far better game reviews out there for this. Instead this couple of paragraphs are mostly for those of you that are on the fence about purchasing this game. I purchased this game right before it came out of beta but I would have happly bought it even at its full price. The original X-Com: UFO Defense (1994 MicroProse) was a truly remarkable game and but for the graphics stands up well to games released today. Xenonauts recreates the original game (with a few extra suprises) very well. The developers have updated the graphics and improved the AI. The game is challanging even on the average setting. I have yet to try the higher settings. If you have never played the original X-Com, this game is a must. If you have played X-Com, you owe it to yourself to get this game. It will bring back memories of sitting in front of your computer for hours on end trying to destroy the alien base and save the world.So, if you are on the fence, don't be. Click the buy button. If you enjoy turn based squad action, you are going to love this game.			"

												Amazing x-com remake. If your a big fan of the original x-com you'll love this game. Don't expect anything new, its just a clone, but its extremely well done. Everything you want is there, things you wish were in x-com. For example it shows % chance to hit, travel path, etc. The graphics are very well drawn, and 2D as it should be. The writing and story are fantastic. Effort was obviously put in to make it as strategic as possible.On the down side it has a few bugs. Nothing game breaking but defiantly annoying. It has not crashed even once on me in 50 hours of play. Mostly minor issue such as if you have a unit behind a building, the building will become translucent so you can see your unit, but then when you swap to a different unit, its still translucent even though you might want to fly onto that buildings roof. You just have to eyeball where the room might be, and once he gets there it will reappear for you.			"

												I  only have a few hours of gameplay under my belt at this point, but at this moment I am willing to call this game incredible!  I have played and liked the Xcom remake, Silent Storm, and some of the UFO series; I consider this game to be a peer of that group, and it has qualities that make it extraordinary in it's own right.  I was worried about the graphics, if it would present barriers to imersion.  They didn't.I was worried it would be simple, a series of milk-runs.  It is not.  It presented a deep tatical chalange that I am still not equal to.  I remember the first mission where no one died.  That left me with a good feeling and a real sense of achivment.Note: I sometimes need to open Task Manager after launching the game, and end the application, if the launcher does open.  Upon retrying, the game launches without issue, and I have had no crashes.   This bug does not affect my enjoyment of the game, it is an inconvience, nothing more.			"

												This game is a quality revitalization of the original X-COM.  It not only met the high standards set by the 90s classic but also exceeded the benchmark in many ways.  - This is a global war fought by many nations that join in the fight.  Militaries around the world as well as farmers with shotguns will aid the multi-national force in its fight against the alien invasion.  Occassionally they bring down alien crafts (at terrible losses),   Allied units are represented as cops on the street, farmers blasting aliens on the other side of the farm as your troops hunt aliens around haystacks, or national militaries desperately defending the city during terror missions  - Interception missions are extremely fun - take personal control of your interceptors to bait and flank enemy crafts once your squadron catches up to an enemy flight (it could be a battleshield escorted by two fighters, or just a lone scout) - this minigame is many times more fun than X-COM's interception mission.  - Your soldiers earn medals for performing extraordinary tasks - the medals in turn boost their stats- Many weapons to choose from - riot shields (wield one with a pistol), shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, RPGs, HMGs, researched alien technologies, even a TANK that will eventually look like a real tank (upon further research).  Who doesn't want to use a tank to blow away aliens?  In X-COM games, the tank is always a tiny robo-craft that look gimpy... here we have a real tank!  - Addressed many short-comings in the original X-COM game.  You can now fly the troop transport to multiple crash sites, direct interceptors to target one group of enemy after another (assuming enough ammo and fuel left).  - It is a challenging but highly rewarding game.  It is fair (none of that enemy ""spawning"" behavior in X-COM Enemy Unknown), but it is tough.  I would rather have a tough game that is fair than an easy game with funky game logics. I am an avid X-COM player: 5 playthroughs in the original X-COM, 1 playthrough of TFTD (ok that was torture), 1 playthrough for Apocalypse, 1 playthrough in X-COM EU.  I am proud to say that Xenonaut has won me over as the quality spiritual successor that I have always been looking for.			"

For now this is the only true downside to this game, the hitchance% and how it is calculated seem totally random and erratic.

												A great recreation of the original X-Com, with some much appreciated improvements to air combat and simplification of the base management UI and so forth. Some drawbacks as expected - the shiny new tilesets mean you can't breach a UFO like you can all the other buildings - and money can be hard to come by if you are not dominating the air battle (which in turn means you can't produce the planes you need to dominate the air battle....). However I have sunk about 13 hours into this over the weekend and still keep wanting to see one more mission, wipe out one more alien base, save Budapest from the alien terror attacks....Big recommendation from me!

												Look at the title of the game, It's not XCOM, get that through your head. It has very similar mechanics, and fictional setting, but is not XCOM, so if you are a bored XCOM fan who beat all of the new installments; this may not be a good purchase for you. Secondly, if you choose to continue and buy the game, know that it is beyond realisticly hard, in which you need to keep up with the fast pace of the game or you will fail and basically need to make a new game. Two, understand you are fighting a space faring race, fighting as a non-space faring race and are at a critical disadvantage. What am I trying to say? This game is hard, you need to learn fast, make good decisions, have a plan, always save the game, and keep your airfleet either in strong numbers or advanced. Welcome to Xenonauts.			"

You can feel its hot breath against your skin, you think it is the end, and put your rifle's muzzle against your neck. But your luck changes, and you realize the reaper has exhausted their time unit supply. You lower the gun and point it at the reaper, ""95% it will hit."" you think to yourself. You point your rifle at the reaper's head, and close your eyes. ""A 95% chance I will live."" You smile and pull the trigger. You hear the gun fire and feel the recoil of the bullet leaving the chamber, you open your eyes and hope to see a headless reaper corpse in front of you. Unfortunate as it is, you missed the shot and the reaper in front of you still has a head and still wants to kill you and use your body as a vessel for its parasitic spawn.10/10 would lose ""Pvt. John Mctiggles"" exactly like that again.			"

												This game is wonderful in all the ways that the classic xcom is. It is improved in everyway, the graphics are great. the game mechanics are wonderful and lots of micro managment style features that are a game in and of themselves. Aaaand then there is the BS. Like xcom you will miss impossible easy shots. drop grenades  and have collateral damage. This game magnifys thats by five times and thats being conservative. I am a veteran of the xcom franshise and have played hundreds of hours of both of these games. I am playing on easy (ironman mode) but still easy and I cannot even play the game because it feels like i am playing against a eight year old with god powers. ""nah you miss and hit a civilian, ohh is your friend throwing a grenade at me woops you dropped it and exploded half your squad"" ok now you panic and your friend goes bonkers and shoot into the rest of your squad. ok now my turn"".   I do love this game but it is not for the faint of heart and i wish they would just make it fair Ps. the doors on the ship always auto close at the end of the aliens turns. so you end up getting shot and to return fire you have to blast through doors. Makes it so much harder			"

												It is nearly the same like the old DOX XCOM. With better sounds and music the game would be perfect.			"

												I like the strategy aspects of the geoscape and the turn based battle style of the ground battles. this game is definitley worth the time that you put into it, and if you are an x-com fan, then you should also enjoy this.			"

												Honestly better than the new xcom games. Too bad I blow at Xenonauts! Luckly for me my classes end a 12:00 so I have time to try again!			"

												I'm not sure how I ended up putting 82 hours into a single round, but this is a classic and authentic tribute to X-com. The aerial combat is much better, and the cover based system feels better, and right. If you're looking for that fix that only turn based, gritty survival combat can bring, this is worth asking - and even better on sale.			"

												Pretty much a newer remake of the REALLY old xcom.  Same gameplay, mechanics, really haven't seen any differences (but maybe that's just because I haven't played REALLY old xcom in years).			"

												Much closer to the older style tatical game much more indept then the new X-com. If you enjoy this style of game then you already have it if not the dpeth and slow pace of the game can be tediouse			"

												This game is a true homage to the original Xcom. It can get a bit grindy which is an issue that the original Xcom had as well.			"

												A great idea and a perfect atmosphere of the old UFO.Yet implementation is very buggy :(First of all, crazy effects appear on display sometimes.After trying 1.07, I have purchased and downloaded the recent update offered by Steam today, and now my starting level interceptors are unable to win an air combat agains the lightest UFO (UFO always outruns missiles and then destroys planes) while auto-resolve gives 100% success.Hope, once all the bugs will be fixed, but currently they spoil the impression.

												XCOM:UFO Defense was released the year I graduated. Let me clarify that I do not remember the release date because it is the same as my graduation. I remember my graduation date because of the release date. I first saw this played on a 486DX and then had to hack and upgrade my Tandy 1000EX to be able to run it. I spent $700 in 1993 money to upgrade my RAM to a whopping 768kb. In the end I upgraded machines to play this, Mechwarrior and AOE.I have also played numerous attempts at sequels, upgrades and fan made remakes. There is NOTHING that come even close to this one. This game is solid, true to it's roots and adds, answers all the things you wanted in the original without ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the things that made it unique. True the last update wiped the scalable destruction but it is a small price to pay. I would spend twice the price for this.			"

												EDIT:Last I reviewed this game it was a crashy, pile of mess, but now I have a better opinion of the company.The list of problems include:1. Start-up crash (Fixed)2. In-game crash (Still happens sometimes, but not as frequent)3. Buggy gameplay (Still few, but they've improved a lot)4. Buggy Iron Man mode (Occurs when you Alt+F4 out of IronMan during Alien's Turn)5. Graphic bugs (Fixed)6. Saving gets corrupt and unplayable. (Hasn't occured since the latest patches)7. The ONLY resolution that can be played on is 1600x900 in windowed mode (fixed)I love the game, reminds me of X-COM and UFO, but it's really buggy (Now I just love the game :) )			"

												Really well done, one of the kickstarter games that turned out well. In particular, I recommend this to fans of Enemy Unknown whoa re looking for a similar experience but with a greater amount of depth. I look forward to seeing more from this studio, and will definitely keep an eye out for any projects they work on in future.			"

												This is a great game if you're a fan of XCOM or turn based strategy games in general.  It's easily moddable too, which makes it even better.  Wish more developers would make games like this. (maybe something in a genre other than sci-fi or fantasy please?)  Anyway, not going to waste your time writing an essay here. So here's the important stuff:1.  I like it, and I'm having fun.2.  I can run the game with no issues. (unless a mod breaks something)3.  No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t additional DRM or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practices.4. Highly recommend it.			"
