												A short review.The graphics could be so much better. It's like two different artstyles decided to come together and argued about custody for the game and got joint custody. It's not good.The gameplay itself is rather straight forward. In the beginning there's some puzzle elements which draws you in. I do wish there were more of them though as they are fairly easy to complete. The upgrading to the house can be made within a couple of generations and once that is done, what is left is achievements and collections. Some achievements will take forever and the collections are a game of chance. (after 35 hours of playtime I'm still missing a lot of bugs)But despite the game lacking so many things, and the poor art style I keep going back to keep playing it. The pace is nice, the people don't live on forever but you can start up the next generation after about 3 days. It's a casual game where you end up caring for your family and it's lines in a very short amount of time.I would recommend this game to someone who doesn't have a lot of time on their hands every day to play and who likes the more casual sides of things. It left me wanting more, but at the same time, it's good enough.			"

												8-bit sims with less freedom, but good for killing time or pretending to take notes in class.			"

												Virtual Families is like Tamagotchi evolved. Think of it like sims, only that the game continues even when you're asleep. The music is terrific, you can bond with your virtual family really good, and keep them on their toes, to guide them to prosperity. Its simple yet addicting.			"

												Nice and super casual game to play.+ A nice and managable pace and you can pause as well+ Progresses nicely+ Gives you activities and little quests so you always have something to do+ Some subtle puzzling- The art could be a little better- Takes forever for all of the collectibles to be found- Wished there were more featuresOverall, its a fun little pet game without being far too complicated.

												Cute, simple, and entertaining. Not bad if you're looking for something casual or laid back with a small amount of management. I recommend buying it during a sale or just playing the app for free through Googleplay. At the current price, I would say you're probably overpaying. It could use some improvement, but overall I like it and find it mildy amusing; enough to keep revisiting it in my library.			"

												Now this is a casual game.  You can play it for 5 minutes, not even, and then shut it off to come back hours later to find them only a few ""years"" older or you can leave it for a day and it's the same thing really.  I'm on the second generation and I still haven't purchased all upgrades.  O_o			"

												Sure the graphics arent great and it might be a con for most people but this game is great give it a chance. Its kind of like The Sims but you stay in the house and do all of your stuff there. The first hour night be housekeeping but after that it gets better! Maybe I just have a biest because I played this game as a kid and have good memories of it but its really good, I swear			"

												No. Just no. You can make food, make the people shower or make them pick up socks and wrappers. There have been NO UPDATES, no new content, no improvements. This game was thrown together for the devs to make a quick 10$. Get the Sims.. at least its an actual game.			"

												Was great for 9 generations until the game would not offer a spouse until I was 51, and then they couldn't conceive.  The game is over if you don't have any children to pass on to.All the hours I spent getting to 98% completed on ""trophies"" was wiped out.  I wish I had never played this game.			"

												I remember playing this game when I was young on the PC. It was really fun and nostalgic. Enjoyed it but I found it to be very limited and short lived, yet overall fun.			"
