												I really enjoyed this, i Do recommend playing this or checking it out if you really do love fireworks because i had a Blast messing around and it passes the time if you get bored or have nothing else to do, But i do feel limited and wish there could be more stuff to it instead of having a rinse and repeat feeling, But i still enjoyed it when the Fireworks go off.

												It took me forever to set up my show and it still wasn't synced properly but that's ok. I love, love, love fireworks and this program is great. Any fan of fireworks will love this. Once you get the hang of it, it's easy to work with.PROSEasy to use drag and drop featureGraphics and water reflectionsDifferent angle camera POVsCustom Fireworks creatingYour own music importCONSInvisible fireworksLimited type of firework colors/setsLimited areas/scenery to create your show inAnnoying built-in music looping when creatingNo option to view from a certain point in your trackNo snap-to feature on the boat/docks for perfect alignmentAll saves vanishing if you delete an older save and no save overrideExtreme swapping lag from sequence to placement when you have a lot of fireworks on the sequence linesOverall, I really enjoy this simulator, even with it's many flaws. I can see myself putting tons of hours into it, just for the pure enjoyment of watching the entire finished fireworks show that I've created.As a side note, the Devs have abandoned this simulator. You will get no help from them, no updates, no bug fixes. Only the community can help you, but we are all having the same problems. Buying this game now is just paying the ones who don't care about their game or their community.			"

												Overall great game if you WANT to create your own firework simulation in sync with music.Minor issues that could be fixed/improved:There should be mouse wheel scrolling in sequence editor,The firework when selected in placement should indicate which one you have selected,When playing the simulation you should be allowed to skip to a section you want to see,When creating a firework, it should allow you to clear the firework placed instead of clearing the whole rack,If the above were fixed it would be even better than it already is. The above are just minor problems that I noticed while playing. Click here to see my video:

Note: if thinking about using the ingame recorder, dont. Use Fraps instead since it doesnt cause the game to lag as much.			"

												For some reason I rushed into buying this game simply because I've always wanted a fireworks simulator, and this looked really good from the screenshots and videos. But unfortunately it's just not as good as it makes it out to be. On the simple side, there are overused sounds, quite a limited set of fireworks and it's just simply overall quite a poor design for a simulator - it's more of a worktop or, do I call it a sandbox? On the technical side, it's even worse sadly, it takes up far much more GPU power than it needs to and the way it has been coded makes it hard to edit or even try open back something you've made without it causing errors, even for someone as tech-savy as me who understands the Windows Registry can't seem to even get it fixed. I had really high hopes for this game when I saw it released on Steam, but disappointed with the outcome even for a $10 game - overall I've spent less and received much better developed games.			"

												I don't normally write reviews on Steam games, but this game, really deserves it.Wow, what can I say? Fireworks Simulator is brand new into the market released only two days ago and come to think about it I'm sure your'e all thinking ""well here's ANOTHER simulator game...""But let me stop you there, Fireworks Simulator is unlike anything I have ever played on Steam before and in a good way.Welcome to this crazy, psychedelic world of bright lights and explosions.I booted this up to try it and found myself 2 hours later in awe of a pretty awesome firework show I had built from scratch to music from my computer I had previously imported.If you buy this game be prepared to have your imagination captured, skills put to the test and most importantly have a lot of fun regardless of your age.I can assure you this is way more than placing pretty lights and watching them go bang.Unlike other ""flop"" simulator games I think this might just become a hit and the developers deserve every credit for it.The question is, can you top the London New Year Fireworks? You can certainly try!!			"

												Great potential.  Effects are beautifull.  But there is a lot of settings that is missing that would have improved the game a lot.  It is hard and unfriendly to use.The possibility of starting the ""play"" anywhere would let creator testing some effects instead of restarting the video everytime we need to see how it goes.  At les in the sequencer, instead of the pic of the place you are shooting, put a simulation of your show.Having the possibility to call effects directly in the sequencer and place it after would have been a great thing to have too.The is absolutely not enough effects to play with.  These effect should have more descriptions like time of the effect (I like the prefire time showed in sequencer by the way)  And shooting places is limited to 2, it is fastly becoming boring to make shows in these conditions.  I cant believe WECO put their name on that.  Experienced people should have seen the lack of possibilities of that game.			"

												First Impressions:The sequencer reminded me of ""Roller Coaster Tycoon 3"" a bit in that you can drop various fireworks onto a timeline.  ""Fireworks Simulator"" takes that a step further and adds the ability to adjust music and camera angles.  I would have really liked a freeform camera that let you zoom around to any position you wanted...instead you're limited to about six preset angles.  It's a solid simulator and it works once you figure it out, but I didn't see a whole lot of content.  For ten bucks, I'd have to give this a partial recommend...I think five would have been a bit more realistic.

												Love it hands down it takes a few minutes to get the hang of it but that’s like anything new.But I do have to say this game needs work it’s a bit of a bug fest at the moment think Starship Troopers although it is still very playable. But it is heading in the right direction, though bugs make it interesting to say the least. ""Hail to the king"" and ""Come get some"" to say the most, Get it on sale if you can but if not get it anyway.When you live in a country with out fireworks this is the next best thing, and it gets the creative juices flowing.I am even thinking of a NYE display until the save buggered up and lost 7 hours of work			"

												i love fireworks and i really enjoyed this game. If i save a custom effect it glitches once in a while but i don't have problems with that because the next time i press save it does work. What i really dislike is that it won't show the effect of the high mortarshells anymore. I tried reïnstalling 3 times but that still doesn't work. You can see the shell going off because of the glow on the landscape. I tried different resolutions and qualitysettings. (ps my PC runs ARMA3 on ultra settings so it's strong enought for a fireworksim...). Gameplay is awesome and i love tha fact that you can upload your own music. I only recommend games that are properly fixed so a no for me (when the game is stable i will recommend it).			"

												This is a great simulator. It has lots of shells to work with. The display graphics are great if you have a 2Gb video card or better. The only limitations are as follow: You can't use artists mp3 as background music then post it to certain social media due to copyright laws and You only have two locations for launching fireworks. You launch from either bardges or a golf course. If you forget and create a display with an artists music some social media will remove it and warn you about breaking copyright laws.			"

Once you figure out the sequencer and fiddle with making custom fireworks it can be a lot of fun making displays for your own music. I do wish the Devs would add some tools to help with symmetry. Also a way to fill a firework with one type of effect rather than pulling the same one down 95 times.			"

												This game seemed great at first, the menu screens worked at a solid frame-rate. Right as soon as I pulled up one of the demo shows, the frame-rate dropped from 60fps to 10fps. Not a good sign when you turn down all of the game graphics and still get a poor frame-rate. I didn't let that get me down until the game caused my computer to blue screen. I haven't even started making a show and with the horrible frame-rate and potential crashing of your system, I would not recommend this game. Waste of money. Also, the preview video shows a solid 60 fps, where's that in the game?			"

												After mere minutes of playing this game, I feel that it in all honesty cannot be classified as a game. The term ""masterpiece"" comes to mind. I immediately closed this""masterpiece"" in fears that I would become blinded with the sheer brilliance of this title. To the developers of this exquisite title I feel that I can only say one thing, congratulations. I received this game from a friend as what he classified as a ""joke"". The next day I saw him I hugged him and thanked him with tears in my eyes for blessing me this the experience that was playing 20 minutes of this game. To anyone hovering with their fingers poised over the ""add to cart"" button do not hesitate anymore. I cannot recommend this game highly enough to my friends, coworkers, complete strangers and the odd pyrotechnician that I encounter in my travels. Again thanks to the developers for enlightening me and the best of luck to any future title, and know that you have touched and influenced someone to see the beauty in this world.			"

												i like this game its a good bit of fun, although i think we need bigger fireworks !! and longer display time. and the big ones you always have a very long delay 2 seconds plus between the effect and the the bang. because there always firther away. But all in all this is great fun and its different !!  "

												Waste of money, The whole consept and how its set up makes it Incredibly hard to grasp. The menus are poorly designed, the User interface is confusing and quite frankly look like they were designed in 5 minutes by a 13 year old on his first computing project. I really looked forward to this game but was a total let down. TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY!			"

												Worthwhile - if you know what you're letting yourself in for.This is a sim with many problems. The graphics are about as badly optimised as most of these sims, so it can get quite chuggy even with its relatively simple graphics; saving is very wobbly indeed and has a habit of wiping one's setups; the extremely repetitive background music can't be switched off without also muting the show soundtrack; user-configured racks don't have a simultaneous ignition option, and so on.But what works works fairly well, and there are some good ideas there. I like the fact that it shows an audio waveform to help line up the effects (though a slow option and step keys would be useful), and allows you to line up airbursts both by launch time and by detonation time. The graphics are rudimentary but look quite pretty within their limitations.It's not perfect. In many ways it's barefly functional. It's certainly not worth full price. And the devs seem to have abandoned it, so there's a big caveat emptor hanging over it. But I've had some fun with it, and if you catch it on sale you might too.			"

												It's not the best fireworks simulator out there. But it's good when you are bored.It is lacking in graphics because it focuses more on the water then the actual fireworks.The controls are getting there.Maps.  NEED MORE OF IT . You only Get  2  in the whole entire game!!I can't wait until they figure this out.I would give it... 7 out of 10 baa's  "

Overall: 4,5/10Positive sides:+ Realistic physics of fireworks+ Breathtaking views+ Good way to relax in short time+ You can create your own fireworks and upload your musicNegative sides:- Saved games are empty after restarting game- Problems when placing fireworks- Only 2 locations- Lack of possibility to do show without music- No Workshop- Huge amount of different BUGS- It does not offer many modes- Game seems unfinished			"
