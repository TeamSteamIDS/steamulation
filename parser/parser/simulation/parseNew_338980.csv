												MOAI is another Time Management game from the guys over at Alawar. This time your character is stranded on an uncharted island and must work with a tribe of natives to restore their island and make your way back home.  It's a fun premise which is enhanced by storytelling sequences between each level and a simple narrative that adds some meat to an already enjoyable game.As with other titles in the genre, the gameplay is pretty standard and consists of multi-tasking activites as efficiently as possible while managing resources to complete specific tasks (build, gather, etc.).  Coming up with the best strategy to complete the objectives in record time can be quite challenging, but not impossible once you determine your strategy and execute it well. If Gold (3 coins) is a little too stressful for you and you're wanting to go more casual, Silver is easily doable on most levels, and snagging Bronze a cinch.  I don't think you can fail a level without actively trying to fail it, so there's not a ton of pressure if you just want to play through for the story and artwork.And the artwork is indeed a reason to play through the game.  MOAI's presentation is REALLY well done.  The art has a nice hand painted look to it with high quality story CG's that are both colorful and creative.  The story narration is also full English voiced and the narrator nicely acted.  While the story itself seems a bit random at times, often being just enough to link each stage together, the writing is polished and even quite humorous.  Music-wise, I found the Disney-esque orchestral soundtrack a highlight, enough so that I wish there were a DLC or music tracks included as an extras, but I'll just have to live with listening to it while I play. With full Steam integration including 53 Steam achievements, Trading Cards and Cloud Support, if you're a fan of the genre you really can't go wrong here. These things add a ton of value to any game on the platform, but for casual titles they're almost a must and are a very welcome addition.  MOAI is definitely one of the better Time Management games I've played and has handily exceeded my expectations. I will be sure to 100% this gem and enjoy every moment of it.Bottom Line: Recommended for those who enjoy strategic, time-based gameplay, but will also appeal to more casual players with its storytelling and high level of polish.Note - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review.

												MOAI: Build Your Dream is an easy little time-management simulation with cute, colorful graphics and a fun little island theme. Through the game, you build up little island villages and defend them from ghosts and bandits, all while collecting and trading resources to fulfil the goals of each level. Completing the levels is easy, completing them in the fastest time is a bit more difficult.It's a fun casual-style game with a cute theme that tests your multi-tasking and planning skills. The gameplay is easy to grasp and completing levels is easy enough to introduce the game to young kids or people new to gaming. However, getting all the gold-level times and achievements should provide a challenge to more seasoned gamers as well.Steam integration is strong, with trading cards and lots of achievements.			"

												Build your village and manage resources game-- casual.In a world of same old same old casual building resource management games- this game does offer fresh ideas and is a lot of fun and it can be addictive,   It  has that ""must get expert/gold"" appeal- BUT -  it is very clicky when it comes to the ghost catching part, so if you are not so good with reflexes or have arthritis this game can be hard on you- sayiing that- good news, the game does not require you to pass levels on time to advance so it is also a great game for those that just want to play without worrying about gold/expert and achievements.9/10  "

												A charming time management game with a simple storyline. You play as a westerner who is stuck on a tropical island, and have to guide them through building huts, gathering resources etc..The game is narrated by a relaxed male voice who guides you through the simple story. As you proceed the challenge becomes higher, starting with simple tasks like 'gather 200 food' but later on introducing obstacles like bandits and ghosts. The story makes it all fit in the world though.MOAI has a nice art style with vibrant colours that make each level nice to look at, without hiding the various clickable spots from view. The soundtrack is relaxing and never gets in the way.Alawar has a lot of time management games out and it's obvious they've mastered the genre by now. MOAI is another example, design-wise it is perfectly balanced.It has Steam achievements, trading cards, and Steam cloud support for saves.The only real negative remark I have, and it's a tiny one, is that I can't get it to run maximized on a single 1920x1080 window, instead I either have to play it full-screen with other monitors blanked; or windowed at what seems to be 1440x900.Definitely earns a positive recommendation.

												Nice time management / casual building and strategy game. It follows a formula along the lines of other such game but does a bit better job at mixing things up and constantly adding new game play elements than some other similar games.There are 64 levels that have three different time goals to meet each giving progressively lower score, which in turn will effect how quickly you can meet several of the achievements.Speaking of which, there 53 achievements in this game fully integrated into Steam which is more than most casual games tend to have. Achievement hunts will definitely appreciate that. I found that the achievements motivated me to keep going and to replay levels with different play styles that I might not have otherwise done.Though it's not required, meeting the quickest time goal and getting all three coins for a level can be quite challenging and required a bit of planning and strategy. You'll probably have to replay a level multiple times to do that as you really need to run through each level at least once to get a feel for what works and what doesn't, particularly once you've dived in past some of the earlier levels.Visuals are all really well done and look great in 1080p on a monitor. There's a story that's told between levels with narrated still cut scenes and also in text boxes by various island companions who are helping you on your journey. It's a nice touch be really the main thrust of the game is resource management and building and then optionally managing your time should you choose to challenge yourself or want to go for the achievements.Overall I was pleased with MOAI and found good entry in the casual time management and building genre. If that's your cup of tea or you're looking for a lighter, low stress game to take a break MOAI would be a good choice.			"

												You're an explorer but your last journey ends up on a island, where a local tribe helps you. But the chief has several problems: not only wood is rare but his daughter has been kidnapped!MOAI: Build Your Dream is a casual time management game, where objectives must be met in order to advance. But you have to respect the timer if you want to win the maximum of stars (achievements, achievements). In each level, you sent workers to remove obstacles (down trees, rocks or holes), to build/upgrade/repair buildings (fields, quarries, houses, temples, markets, bridges, trees, statues), to trade with bandits or hindus, to open chests, to fish or even to cut down trees.Indeed, you have five types of resources - all of them can be traded with hindus or found in chest): food (obtained by fishing or by building fields), stones (obtained by removing rocks or by building quarries), sandalwood (obtained by building trees), wood (obtained by cutting trees or by trading other resources at the market) and mana (obtained by praying at the temple by giving sandalwood).However, the game includes also bonus: a wealth scales to have more wood at the market, a horn to have more produced  resources, sandals to make your workers work faster, a shield to repel ghost.Indeed, many levels has waves of ghosts attacking your buildings: you can whip them by clicking on them or build statues (Moai Statues) that will destroy them. The ghosts are of three types: blue (easy to kill and giving 5 mana), red (fast and giving 10 mana) and purple (slow but hard to kill and giving 20 mana).The game is easy but if you want to earn the three stars, you need to be efficient and fast. At least, play once the level and then replay it. However, achievements can be quite hard or buggy, especially those with levels in a row.The graphics are nice and exotic. I also liked the evolution of the Hero. Beginning as a Westerner, he transforms into a local by adopting their lifestyle. The soundtrack is also nicely fitting.MOAI is a very nice game, as fun as 12 Labours of Hercules. If you like the genre, go for it. Besides, as it's currently the Steam Winter Sale and as it's at -75%, you should really get it (and the rest of the series too).			"

Game StorylineThere's actual story plus with banter between characters in-between game levels. The story itself is okay even though it isn't one of those stories that tends stick with you.Game Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're well done. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.GameplayThere are no actual difficulty choice selection but each of the levels has their own difficulty.This is a time/resource management game. So there's a timer presence throughout the entire game. The time on game's timer is generous for the most parts. The levels can be finished before the time has completely run out on the timer. It's advisable to plan ahead before starting the level.The character's rank is updated after earning certain amount of points from playing the game.There are five statues in the valley. Four statues are connected to four tribes and the center statue is connected to the four statues. All levels must be completed in gold in order to full upgrade the four statues. Completing each of the four statues will upgrade the statue in the center. The process of upgrading the statues is a long one.The minor setback is that all levels must be completed within gold time. This is a long process to fully complete. Multiple replays for some of the levels maybe required.There are sixteen different locations with sixty-four levels in total. Each of these levels has certain objective that's needed to be carried out.The resources that building structures generates has to be manually collected by the players themselves.There a few different temporarily power ups to help producing more resources and completing task much quicker. These power ups are available later in the game for most of the levels.There are fifty-three different achievement to be earned from the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be obtained.MiscellaneousThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, I felt that this game is good, even though the story would've been better. As for the game's replay value it's low. If you're into time management game then I would recommend this game but not at the full price.Reviews for the games in this series:MOAI: Build Your DreamMOAI 2: Path to Another World "

												This is a casual strategy game.  Resource and time management.  It's a fun game, the dialogue is sometimes funny, the gameplay is easy to learn but hard to get 3 stars on every level.Each level you have a goal to meet.  If you do so in a certain amount of time you get either a 1, 2, or 3 gold circle thingys (the equivalent of 3 stars in other games, so that's what I'm gonna call them).  You start out with 2 or 3 villagers to run around doing your bidding.  They build a field which produces food.  Or a stone quarry to produce stone.  Later on there is a sandalwood tree grove to build, and a statue to protect you from ghost attacks.  There is also a merchant which will convert any of your goods into wood (sandalwood and regular wood are different, which can be confusing at first).  And you build a temple where a priest will convert sandalwood into purple blob things (mana).There are also special people you need to talk to and exchange stuff like 100 wood for 200 mana or something like that.  Sometimes they are a bandit guarding a villager that you need to rescue.  I found it difficult, at first, to distinguish those people from my regular worker dudes because if you're waiting for stuff to be produced and  the workers aren;t doing anything they just sit or laying around.  So I thought they were them until I moused over one of them and saw that they will exchange stuff.   So if you want to get the best time you have to plan ahead what you need and what to build.  Later on your buildings can get upgrades to 3 level to produce more stuff.  Sometimes ghosts will attack and destroy your farms and other buildings.  You can attack them yourself with a spear (just put your mouse over a ghost and it changes into a spear) or build giant statues that zap the ghosts with lightning.   The ghosts can really get annoying, especially later on when they get faster and stronger.About halfway through is a neat concept that I haven't seen before: a mist that covers most of the screen so that you don't know what's there until you get enough mana to light a fire pole to burn away the mist.  I really like the music, it sets a good tone for the game.  And the voices when they are exchanging stuff is nice.  It's just nonsense sounds and grunts but it adds a nice verisimilitude to the game. (there's your word for the day, look it up!)There are achievements but don't think this will be an easy one for 100%.  I don't think I will be able to myself, since you have to get 3 stars on every level and some of them just seem really difficult to do that.			"

												MOAI: Build your dream is a strategy/puzzle game that takes you through about 60 levels having you manage various resources to accomplish various goals.  I became interested in this game because I've played a couple of other Alawar/Buka titles (The Promised Land and The Happy Hereafter), this game had a very similar look and what I thought was going to be somewhat similar gameplay.  However after the first level/stage it becomes clear that although the art is similar, the actual gameplay is quite different.  So if you like The Promised Land or The Happy Hereafter and you want more the same, this may not be what you are looking for, however there is some similarity so it still might be worth checking out.This game is level driven.  You move from area to area with each area having a dozen or so levels and each of those areas have a theme attached to them.  Some of theses themes, are drought, fog or freezing and those have to be managed in order to clear the stage.  Levels start off with you having a certain number of resources and those resources are used to create buildings, clear debris or trade with NPCs.  After building/clearing/trading you collect more resources to achieve the various goals that you are tasked with completing.  I was impressed with the depth and amount of story in the game.  I didn't follow the story to closely so I don't remember how good the story was, but after each level/stage/area there was a good deal of dialogue and story progression.  I was impressed, in a smaller puzzle type game there usually isn't near this much dialogue or story elements throughout.Graphics are not the greatest but they are passable and are clear enough that it's pretty easy to discern what is going on in the levels.  There is some nice art during some of the dialogue/conversations.The game isn't overly long, but you can go back to challenge yourself to get 3 stars in each level which will make the experience longer.  But the 14 hours I put in is about the time it will take to move through all the puzzles at least once, though if you pay a little more attention to the story it will add an hour or so.The game is not overly challenging for a puzzle game.  I only went through each level once and was playing pretty casually and I was pretty close to three staring most levels.  If I got a two star level I would have only missed three stars by 10-20 seconds usually.Overall, this wasn't the game I was looking for from Alawar/Buka as I wanted more gameplay like The Promised Land.  But this game was still fun overall and I would recommend it as a short and easy but fun puzzle game.  If you are looking for a lot more challenge this may not be the game you are looking for, it is a lot more of a casual puzzler.			"

												If you've played 12 Labours of Hercules, you'll fall right into the rhythm of this one. MOAI: Build Your Dream (first in the series) features the same kind of resource/time juggling, with similarly fluid gameplay and 'cute' graphics, but it's far more strategically challenging. In a good way. It also introduces some classic tower defense levels to mix things up. 12 Labours is an absolute breeze in comparison, since they give ample time to get gold even on Expert.MOAI makes you really think and plan in order to get 3 stars on a level. But even if the timer reaches all the way to zero, you're not penalized for taking as much time as you need. The only thing that takes a hit is your score (and any achievements requiring gold times). There's no 'fail' message or a way to screw up a level unless you waste starting resources. So if you don't care about score or achievements, this is very easy to approach as a slower casual game. If you've just got to get 3 stars on every level however, you're gonna have to break out your micromanagement skills.Getting GoldWhen it comes to the more intensive gameplay needed for 3-stars, tight strategy is key. The order in which you collect/build is important of course, since as mentioned you're sometimes given a very limited amount of starting resources and can build yourself into a corner early on. But mid-game is important too, and how you spend collected resources can be a make-or-break situation, such as choosing whether to upgrade something with a limited/low amount of stones, or build a bridge with them to gain access to the temple. Both options have pluses and minuses depending on level layout and threats (more on that later), but there's usually one ""best"" way to go about it. Sometimes you'll need to make quick decisions on what to build for resource collection then demolish to complete objectives. For example, a requirement could be huts on all available plots, but you need farms/quarries/etc to gather materials to build them in the first place. Building and demolishing eat seconds off the clock though, so even just one unneeded building can throw off your goal.Note that quarries, farms, etc will not continue to produce that resource unless you mouse over to collect stuff they just produced. Forgetting to collect anything mid-game can leave you short when you really need it later. Many levels require very precise clicking in that respect, or remembering to trade ASAFP for mats like wood/mana, to just barely make the cutoff time for gold/silver. In other words, gold is essentially a level's speedrun time.A handful of scenarios can get rather frustrating if you don't hit on the proper order of things right away, but overall it's pretty satisfying when you figure out how to handle a tough or demanding level. I admit I had to watch a playthrough for a few levels because I just couldn't get my timing down or juggle ghost attacks effectively, but others may not need to. Tower DefenseThe tower defense aspect of gameplay was surprisingly less stressful than I expected. About 1/4 or 1/3 of levels feature attacks by ghosts of varying strength. All buildings have health bars, and will revert to their 'ruined' state if ghosts deplete that bar with attacks. You can either dispatch them manually by clicking them repeatedly (I think it's 5 clicks for regular ghosts, 10 for red, and 20-30 or something for purple), or build Moai statues that defend with lighting strikes. 3 or 4 levels are true tower defense ones, where you have to build and max out the Moai statues while a conga line of ghosts snakes its way around a path to your base. Building/upgrading them all at once leaves you at risk for carpal tunnel, so there's strategy there too, for which statue to build first and in what order to upgrade them.TipsIt's possible to figure out workarounds for some of the trickier levels. Here are a few things I learned from trial and error: 1) You may not need to build a certain type of building, because opening chests or trading will give you that resource.2) Not every ruined building needs to be fixed (including the statues). Some are better off being demolished ASAP to build something else, especially in levels where you need X amount of a particular resource and a limited number of plots.3) Not every plot needs to be occupied right away. It may be better to leave it empty (till you have enough for huts, for instance) instead of setting yourself up to waste time demolishing things later on.4) Unless the goal is to stock up resources, always try to have a worker trading for mana or wood. It's easy to forget about, but it makes a huge difference.5) If you always seem to come up short with resources, focus early game on upgrading everything as fast as possible. Ignore bridges/bandits unless they're blocking something needed to complete an upgrade.6) Designating a building for an upgrade will completely halt production. It's better to hover over the upgrade button (to eke out another round of stone/food/etc) and wait till your workers finish the last thing they're working on.7) On the flip side, ghost attacks will slow or stop temporarily if every resource building is in that ""halted"" mode. In some levels it's in your best interest to watch your mana and wood levels and simply keep every building in a cycle of upgrading until you have everything maxed out. Then you can focus just on clicking ghosts and collecting resources till you meet the objective.8) Use power-ups wisely. Some levels offer more than one of a particular bonus, and if you waste them both at once (or use one too early) you'll kick yourself for it later. Save the Horn of Plenty (2x resource payouts) for when you have buildings maxed out (or at least upgraded once). Save the Scales (2x wood payout) for when you actually have enough to trade for wood.ConclusionAnyway, this is getting long enough. As someone who doesn't like timers and stressy games, I still managed to 100% on this in about 20 hours without having an aneurysm. Interpret that how you will. :p I also found it satisfying to complete, even if I had to replay a few levels to grind the collection achievements. By contrast, the 12 Labours games are lots of fun, but they plateau in difficulty and just *end*, like the entire series is one long game with no cap-off.If you're new to time/resource management games and looking to try your hand at the genre, I highly recommend starting with the 12 Labours series and ""graduating"" to this one.

												MOAI: Build Your Dream in the moment I'm writing this review, is the best time management game I've ever played. It has totally fresh approach to the genre, combines old solutions with some strategy games elements. So on every map you have some fields and on every of them you may build several types of buildings, which every of them gives you another benefits. Skilful selection of those buildings is the key to good score on every level.Also graphics is different than in such games, in my opinion is better.Summarizing: excellent piece of code, especially for such low price.VERDICT:If you're a fan of time management games, this is absolutely must have for you.If you're not familiar with the genre, you should try this one, there is a big chance, you will enjoy it.If you're a fan of strategy games, you may try it if you're in the mood to play something more casual.Like this review?

												If you've clicked on this game, you are probably expecting a Tropico style game. I can assure you, you will be disappointed. This little gem of a game has a lot in common with the big builder titles, but its main feature is what makes this game so very different: levels. As the player you are stranded and meet the inhabitants who quickly ask you for help, defending their island and freeing the princess. At the beginning of each level, you have time to look at your setting - what you have to achieve (i.e.: trade 500 pieces of wood, talk to a foreigner,...) and how many resources you have. After your first click, the clock starts ticking and you have a few minutes to achieve your goal. I personally like this system because there are several possibilities for each level, and it sometimes takes me 4 tries to finish just one level with the highest amount of points. You are probably thinking that this game has still a lot in common with other games, and yes, that's true, with the very big exception that there's no free mode. You are not supposed to build your own island and live happily ever after, you are supposed to fight your way through all the levels, get a grade A for each one and save the entire island by defeating the very last level. In addition, players are asked to perform multiple tasks at once and organising is a big issue: harvesting crops, gathering stones, and trying to get the very best out of your little workers. If that sounds good to you, go ahead. If you have some free time at hand and don't know what to do, buy this little game. It's nice to play every day, maybe 2 levels, and you'll have a lot of fun for the next weeks.			"

												Not sure what the deal is as the overall reviews seem positive, but this game was completely and irredeemably broken for me, and judging by the forums I'm not the only one. Bugs such as enemies not appearing make certain levels impossible to beat.  If only I hadn't sat on it in my backlog for over a year I'd be getting a refund on this one.  What a shame.			"

												I was VERY pleasantly surprised with this game. It definitely does have the feel of a mobile game brought to PC/MAC, but that doesn't take away from very relaxed vibes I got playing this game. It's equal parts resource management, timing, strategy, and speed clicker. I thouroughly enjoyed this game after having some herb. The only down side to this game, is that there are a couple of levels where the ammount of clicks neccesary to kill ghosts is quite exessive.I would still pay for it at full price, but full disclosure I got this game for $1.39.

												This game may look strange,but in reality the it has the most goodish aspects of time managment games:While gameplay is normal for those type of games,it has unique artwork and diffilcuty: You have to complete various objectives ranging from collect x of resources,build x buildings e.t.c. And if you going for gold medals,you have to do it quickly and efficently. If its too hard,choose casual mode: That means it appeals to both casuals and tactical players.It has Steam intergation,which means you can earn achivements,Steam Cloud for remote saves and Trading cards for your puporses.Do you like strategy/time managment games? Then yes,buy it for sure.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game. The first playthrough is great as every few levels new strategic element is added, all encapsulated in  a story narrated in short cutscenes. Prepare for your workers to build bigger and better, to get sick and to be attacked by ghosts, all while you are guiding them to get all the work finished on time. The second playthrough is different, but still great. Foor me this meant getting full points for every level in order to get all my achievements. There is nothing more satisfying than finally getting that one level right the tenth time. I would recommend anyone to buy this game as it is a nice time killer which can be played for ten minutes or a few hours without getting boring.			"

												Moai is a fairly standard time management game with a reasonably well down storyline keeping it together. It keeps a good balance of introducing new mechanics, buildings and resources as you progress to keep things interesting without going too over the top.You can play through the game without worrying about the time if you like, but if you want to challenge yourself there are some very strict limits to get the gold rank on each level, some maybe overly so, but most of them just require you to work out a route to avoid having workers idle (and to recruit more workers as soon as feasible where there are more slots available), so you may have to experiment a bit to find the right route of what to build and what resources to harvest from where.Overall if you like time management games you are probably going to like this, if not it might be best to try a more forgiving title if you want to try out the genre, unless you are willing to ignore the more challenging objectives.

												to be fair it does look like a casual facebook port but it's really not; it's a resource manger with a strong puzzle aspect.as for the gameplay, it's actually challenging and that's what makes it enjoyable. i don't think having to gather the materials is a negative, rather, having to manually click each material is what makes the game harder as it takes away time (and the timer is not generous). completing with 3 stars usually means you're finishing with seconds to spare so it's rewarding to do so. the game is constantly adding more/different buildings/aspects, but does it on a level-to-level basis, rather than every couple of levels. while it does seem daunting at first it works very well and keeps the level engaging, because there are a♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne of levels to get through. other than that, the artwork is cute and the storyline is kinda generic, but works well enough to tie all the different locations together.

												Moai: Build Your Dream (from Buka entertainment who also publish Promised Land, Rescue 1 and a slew of other family friendly games) is yet another delightful casual game featuring this publisher's trademark cutesy art style and family friendly content.  Moai is very similar in game play to Promised Land, but is slightly less complex but more demanding on reflexes and quick puzzle solving.The game runs in 1920 x 1080p full HD in full screen mode.  The art style is cute and would be at home in any children's story book.  The sounds are cute and atmospheric and the music is pleasant easy listening and unobtrusive.Game play is smooth and intuitive with helpful tool tips and a quest status tracker on the lower right of the screen.The interface is well laid out and uncluttered.  Stages are well designed and start out simple progressing in complexity as the player gets deeper into the game.Before each stage there is a scenario-setting dialogue providing a story driven element.  Between stages there are storyboard pictures with good quality voice reading out the story text.Moai sets the scene with your hero having an unfortunate hot air disaster at sea and washing up on the island.  The chief rescues your hero and tasks him with solving the myriads of problems plaguing the island community in return for a promise to help the hero find his way back home.Completing quests before the timer runs out will earn the player gold ranging from 3 gold for perfect score down to no gold for late completion.  Fortunately players can select to re-play any previously completed level via an easy to use map which tracks game progress.  Games are automatically saved for each registered player and can be resumed at any time.Moai: Build Your Dream is only 100Mb in size and will not hog valuable hard drive space.  The game is fun to play and will provide several hours of enjoyment.  Moai will appeal to casual gamers of all ages and is especially suitable as a family game for younger children.  Children unable to read will need adult assistance as there is a need to read mission text.Overall this is a great budget game offering family friendly casual gaming and will provide lots of fun and enjoyment.  Looking for something similar with more complexity look at Promised Land.Rating 8 / 10			"

												A true joy to play! The graphics are cute and colorful. The story dialogue is great and fun to read. The challenge of each map is to beat the map in a alloted time to get gold. That can be a challenge but it is a great challenge to complete. This is a great story and game for casual players. It keeps you going and makes you want to help out the villagers and rebuild it all. I highly recommend this game to anyone wanting a challenge and for the casual game that wants a nice story.			"

												I played and enjoyed the Promised Land. This is similar but this is more time-management heavy. You are against the clock on every level here, whereas in the Promised Land it was pretty laid back and you could progress at your own pace, and just enjoy watching the little town tick over.I thought I'd not like this when I discovered the ever-present clock, I typically hate time-pressured levels in game. However to my surprise, I really like this...more than the Promised Land! Repeating a level till you get 3 stars (by doing it quickly) is unexpectedly fun and addictive. At first you will simply figure out how to do the level, then you will repeat it, fine tuning your build order every attempt, etc till victory (3 star rating).The only thing that's a little annoying is the game has a slight arcadey aspect in that some levels include ghosts which attack stuff you build and can destroy it, causing a major setback. You need to zap these ghost with your cursor as they wander about, and they serve as an on-going distraction to your build efforts. I *think* I'd prefer the game did not have those as they add a fair bit of stress to procedings, as if the pressure of the clock was not enough. It certainly makes for a far more edge-of-the-seat game than the Promised Land, as you always feel under pressure and distracted by ghosts. So in that respect, despite several similarities, it has a very different *VIBE* to the first game. The Promised Land is a chill out and watch your beautiful little town expand kind of experience, where this game is one short level after another (each only a screen in size and unrelated to the previous), time attack centric, tests your strategy and reactions, rather hectic puzzle game kind of buzz. The other main difference is in this game you have no direct control or interaction with your workers. You just click on the thing you want built, collected, fixed or otherwise interacted with (eg one building is a shop and you can trade reasource types at it), and your little guys rush around independently, getting to your queued tasks in in the order you clicked them. In that regard it controls a lot more simply and quickly than the Promised Land, which allows it to stress the player out more and makes for a more exciting game.I find - unexpectedly - I prefer this game.

												A game more focused on time and task management, MOAI is a pretty solid simulation that tries to shift genre and objectives regularly as you play to keep from growing repetitive. Bust ghosts, grow crops, trade cannily, and drive off raiders to save the people on the island you've crashed upon in an attempt to get things stable enough you can safely survive. It's silly but it's creatively designed, and worth a look.			"

												Really very little story, no real options or choices to make. It's a linear game that tells you what to do. Half the time I didn't even know I had done the last thing and poof I'm off to the next chapter/act/event/whatever.This is neither a time management nor a building game. Lots of clicking & no thinking. Just click where it tells you to and keep doing that and you win. If you can click you can play. If you get weary of clicking, sigh oh well.What did I expect? Well the title is Moai: Build Your Dream! so I expected to be able to build stuff. You can & do build stuff, what you are told where you are told and when you are told to, then you can build. Time management, if you don't click fast enough you run out of time, after 2-3 times you know what order to click what to win.1.4 hours and I'm done. Very happy I got it for $1.67 almost worth it.

												A Review from my side, I do not review a lot of games, but some indies do deserve it;Pro's:- Entertaining- Time killing- Nice storyCon's:- It's a bit montome at a certain point.Reason for review: Creattors/developers of this game deserve a medal, I got this game with a discount for buying cards... Totally worth it.. it kills the ""inbetween"" time. I Do not review a lot of games, especially not the ""big"" ones, since they all got the same value. This one tho' deserves a review, it's worth the money... I'm currently at level 50, and will buy the 2nd part of the game, if it's only to support the developers of this game. It has this ""something"". This something that is unable review, it could be just personal taste. It takes time, but feels satisfying.Conclusion;if you have a couple of hours to spend, maybe just a couple of minutes each day ( a level only takes 10 minutes). It's worth the money... Support the developers, among all the indie developers, it's worth it! "

												MOAI isn't quite what I thought it'd be. It's one of those games where you advance along a path and each point offers a new challenge. So you're not building an empire and adding to it. Rather, you're aiming for specific goals at each new point on the map.I'd still recommend MOAI, but on a scale of 1-10 I'd give it a 7 b/c of the restrictive gameplay. I like a bit more freedom than MOAI has to offer, and longer-lasting 'accomplishments.'			"

												MOAI: Build Your Dream is the first in a series of casual time and resource management games but ""casual"" doesn't mean ""easy"" or ""relaxing,"" at least if you are going for gold stars on every level.You are stranded on a tropical island and help various tribes you encounter resolve their problems and differences until they assist you in building a boat to return home. There's a basic story, the graphics are good for the genre and the sound track and effects suit the theme.At first, it seemed that the game didn't offer anything new, (I prefered the Rescue Team series), but the further into the game you get, you are introduced to tower defense elements, and also levels that require a high click rate to complete. There is a lot of content to get through with just under 30 hours of gameplay to gold every level.Overall, the game is a solid effort if you like the genre and is priced well.			"

												Love this game! the gameplay is pretty standard. I got this game on sale during the holidays so it came in a bundle with all the Alawar Adventure bundle. so for the money I got a lot of game play out of it, especially going back anf trying to get all the achievements and beat every level with a 3 coin rating.The Storyline is more thoughtout than you'd normally expect from a standard time management game and the art work is beautiful. My personal fav is when you're on the world map you can see the details that completing the levels does to change little aspects of the landscape, and similarliy when you;re in a level its like a zoomed in version of that area on the map.Overall fantastic game and I will definiatly be buying the rest in the series :)			"
