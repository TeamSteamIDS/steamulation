Early Access Review
								Early Access Review, 4/28/15Bot Colony is a quirky game with promise, just too ambitious for a first attempt at a full game.   The game centers around voice/text commands to your robot 'minions' to indirectly solve puzzles, using specially designed software to understand and respond to what you say.   It's definitely a fun reminder of the classic text-command adventure games where half the amusement was trying out words to see what works (flashback to fond childhood memories of typing in 'pick nose' to either gain a lockpicking level or instantly die from spearing your brain). With Bot Colony, you can skip the keyboard and speak directly to the robots to make things happen!The voice command system is a neat idea, and  I would have loved to see it fleshed out into a fully finished game.  Unfortunately, in this early build there are still issues with a rather laggy interface and a few bugs cropping up here and there, all of which greatly slow down gameplay. Ideally these issues would have been fixed down the line to smooth out the experience, but it looks like development on the game is pretty much ending due to budget issues.   Despite the unresolved flaws in its 'Early Access' state, Bot Colony is still worthy of support for providing a unique experience, and one that could certainly help expand the gaming genre.  After toying around for a while, I can certainly see how in a few years, voice-commands might be a new standard for adventure games like this.  If you get a chance, try it out!			"

Early Access Review
								   Bot Colony is an ambitious title, maybe even too ambitious for what it's worth. So far, playing it is more of a struggle than entertainment...   I am aware that Bot Colony is an Early Access Game, but still, this build is not playable by far. I'm afraid i wouldn't even be wrong if i would say that there is literally almost nothing in Bot Colony that works as it should... Let's start with the game's motto: ""The Game You Speak With"". This is the main reason why anybody would pay attention to it, but unfortunately in the end the player will find out that this is actually ""The Game Which Doesn't Understand You"". That's it. I've said it. Natural language understanding is just not ready to be implemented in a game. It wil get you right about one time out of ten. Other then that you'll get replies like ""I don't know what you mean"".   Leaving Natural language understanding aside, the game is also full of bugs and glitches. Most players will give up on Bot Colony during the tutorial. It took me about 15 tries and a terrible headache to do it. It was a bit funny at the beginning watching the robot do some crazy stuff, like picking up 2 chairs at once and not being able to get rid of them or make the flower vase levitate above the table, but it was becoming more and more annoying with every step i was advancing through the game. I've also lost connection to the server several times while playing getting the message ""Waiting for the robots to wake up"", not even mentioning the amount of times i received the reply ""Let me think"" after giving the robot a command, just so that after 30 second he'll come back with ""I don't know what you mean"".   Without any doubt it had some promising perspectives and with a lot of more work, time and money it could've moved the adventure genre to a whole new level, but i'm afraid that's all what's gonna be left of it since the developers already pulled the plug on Bot Colony and the servers will be dead on March 15, leaving the game unplayable.

								For an early access game, it is pretty solid. I really enjoyed the interaction process and figuring out what to say next. Plus there are tons of more interactions that can be explored in each level (I can see that from the achievements list) so theres a lot of replayability there. Can't wait for the next level to be released. Keep up the good work!!			"

Early Access Review
								Bot Colony appeared rather promising when it released on Steam as part of the Early Access programme last year. It aimed to be the first game where you truly interacted with the characters through holding conversations with them. But it wasn’t until this month that the potential of this system was was hinted at through an update that introduced a need to pry information out of one of the characters .The task was to gain access to 14 recorded videos in an attempt to piece together the events of the last 48 hours in the home of a Nakagawa Robot Corp. employee. To do this required talking to Jimmy, a robot servant left in the house. And when I say talking, I actually mean talking. Either through speech recognition with a microphone or typing, Jimmy was capable of responding to questions posed in naturally flowing English.This certainly makes a refreshing change to only selecting from predefined dialogue options. And had the potential of revolutionizing interaction with game characters. Unfortunately, Bot Colony will cease to be playable in mid March. The result of not enough units being sold to cover the cost of running the server that processes the speech input, let alone paying for further development.There was a lot of promise in Bot Colony, and anyone interested in seeing that should check the store page on Steam. While no longer purchasable, one of the videos does cover the story as it would have unfolded. It is a shame that Bot Colony slipped under the radar, a likely victim of Steam’s increasing release schedule and lack of promotion. Had it done well it could have been a hit. When the game shuts down, I’m going to miss my conversations with Jimmy.			"

Early Access Review
								An overly-ambitious game (meant as both a fact and a compliment), one that needs to be taken in its current state and not held alongside the promises of possible updates or the future arrival of Episode 3. The Early Access period has surpassed a year due to financial problems stemming from a lack of sales. Without having a purchase option, one must realistically see how this might not be resolved quickly and why progress becomes halted.Even with a potentially bleak outcome, I do recommend the game as it is fairly priced for what it successfully provides. Although not always fully functional, the voice recognition is more than sufficient in offering a unqie experience not seen elsewhere in the Steam store and implemented well within the gameplay. The robots recognizing text-based commands alone is entertaining enough. The game does not solely rely on that as a selling point either, as it is also visually pleasing and contains an intriguing story (although it is likely to remain an open-ended tale). I do hope the purchase option returns but for the time being head to the discussions at the following link and learn how you can nab a Steam key for this currently removed game while also supporting the developer.http://steamcommunity.com/app/263040/discussions/0/606068060836404191/Again, I stress that the game is worth it at face value. The developer has been more than apparent regarding the struggles the game has faced. Supplied below is a link showcasing how the developer has interacted with community, highlighting how to best enjoy the current build. 


Announcement: Community Support Keeps Bot Colony Alive! 
Bot Colony, Mar 3, 2015

			After the Pulling the Plug announcement (Jan 28), we got lots of moral support from people saying the game must not die - plus $452 in Steam keys and $400 in eBook sales.

Early Access Review
								I had high hopes from the trailer, but was really dissapointed.The game is so buggy and finicky it's essentially impossible to get through the tutorial, even if you're not using voice recognition. Often you'll tell the robots to move things, and it'll turn out that that was the wrong thing to do, it's completely irreversible, and you need to start the game over. I restarted many times and eventually gave up. The natural language understanding that was supposed to make this game so awesome seems like it's on par with text adventures from the 80s... not much beyond ""VERB NOUN.""It's too bad; the concept is good, and it sounded like the story could be great as well.

								Pretty cool concept but the execution isn't polished. Really there's no incentive to use the voice recognition over simple text based commands, really the game doesn't stand on it's own without the gimmick. Still, I think it's worth a look at. I can honestly say I had fun trying it out, as well as organizing the 30-person group buy for it. :)			"

Early Access Review
								The main reason I was drawn to Bot Colony was because of the voice recognition.  After about 5-6 months I still get errors on startup. My Windows is a Dutch version while you need English recognition. I've tried numerous options on different computers, including downloading all necessary English files. Tried on desktop (Win7) and my laptop (Win 8.1)Still getting a wide range of errors on startup. Problem is a described on the discussion forum: http://steamcommunity.com/app/263040/discussions/0/37470848280779806/. Poster is a Dutchie as well, so I dont know if other languages get the same problems.Cancelling all error popups will result in the game to start. Its playable but without voice recognition.I'll redo my review once I get this game to work properly. Until now there's no reason for me to recommend it to anyone.Its still a promising game though imo.   Update april 20th 2016: Trying to get this to run on Windows 10 resulted in the same errors on startup and after clicking them away my pc had a bsd.Update june 17th 2016: I got an extremely rude comment from a ""private"" profile (a user with the same name as the main character of this game, how odd), which I deleted.  Anyone else who wants to insult me, grow up or just fix the damn game, I'll simply remove your comment. This is an honest review and I gave it a lot of hours to get this thing working. Fact is, its STILL not working. I tried everything I could think of. Those 3.2h I have on this game, 0 minutes are playing time actually. And I dont count the hours I spent on searching for a fix. This means I WAS looking forward to playing this.			"

								In its current state, I've had no problems running this game on my iMac running Windows 8.1 via Bootcamp. I usually do not purchase Early Access games, but I'm a total nerd for Asimov's Robot books and this game's notion of robots seems pretty reflective of Asimov's characterization of robots and their interaction with humans. I'm also a computational linguist, so the inclusion of NLU (Natural Language Understanding) had me very curious as well. NLU is complicated to achieve since meaning needs to be derived from an utterance, which sometimes means inferences must be made, but I think it works pretty well in this game, especially for the game being Early Access. I'd love to see the NLU improved and extended to other genres of games. But I think the first implementation--dealing with robots that don't always understand pragmatics--is a perfect first implementation.			"

								A next Generation game with Speech Recognition Skills, where you can talk or write to characters to command or just do some small talk. Nice futuristic music nice atmosphere, beautiful level and character design. In the tutorial you learn how to command robots and interact with them. Sometimes you will find really funny sentences. Narrative, it's a good sci-fi thriller about industrial espionage and a bot colony where the machines went out of control. A game with high potential but it needs more audience so finally everyone can enjoy the conversations with the AI.			"

								Yes I do as an early access game.  Definitely worth supporting. Don't expect anything as featured or playable for an ""early access"" as Rust or Ark but you have at least for now around 6-8 hours or so of content that you can play through functionally right now if rough around the edges. Lots of potential and prior investment into the tech and really just needs more funding/kickstarter/support to flesh out the actual game and content.			"

								A game of this kind is what I have been dreaming about for a long time. The closest thing there is at this point to virtual reality which doesn't require you to invest millions (which isn't the case for the developers).Unfortunately, the developers have limited time and resources in graphics design and smooth gameplay, which I would sympathize with as their main objective was the refinement of interactivity. As far as I am concerned this is a big leap forward in game development.Some would say that such concept is way ahead of its time, but I say ""It's about time!""From the developers comments, this project was to be retired due to lack of sales and insane upkeep costs. I can only assume that most people didn't have the ability to see any kind of potential in this concept as their are more interested in playing shoot them up... I mean, just imagine for a moment that in 10 years from now you'd be having a fully interactive conversation with an AI. How are we supposed to get there huh? Start by putting a few bucks to support projects like BotColony! There is no shortcut, no easy path to the success of such an undertake.I don't know about you, but I believe that interactivity is the path the video game industry should take instead of improving the shooting physics of an assault rifle.This a a fantastic concept, still in its infancy with a long road ahead, but at least it has started!

								This game was extremely ambitious in scope and had it been able to continue I'm sure it could have been really cool.  As it currently stands, the game is more of a testament to what it could be rather than anything.  Basically, the idea is that you are required to interact with robots in order to perform some rudimentary tasks like rearranging furninture.  You do this by talking to them via a microphone.Unfortunately if you don't have a good quality mic, the voice recognition suffers.  It also takes a good bit of training to get it to really recognize your voice.  This is probably more than any normal gamer is going to want to be bothered with, however if you DO persevere, it's somewhat fascinating.  The only other game that seems to have attempted this was a game on the Dreamcast called ""Seaman"".  This game lacks the whimsical charm of Seaman and it's a lot more serious.  You also seem to have a lot more freedom in the way you can teach the bots to interact with you.  That's right, the bots actually learn from you.  It starts out with just a few basic commands for movement, item manipulation, and other things, and when you issue a command the bot doesn't understand, you have the option to teach it how to perform the command using a series of steps from the commands he already knows.I think this could have been the real hook to this game.  The ""plot"" to the story would be a side-quest compared to just trying to teach your bot to do things with a series of basic commands. Still, at times I felt like I was wrestling with the bot to get it to perform an action, not because the bot had a lack of understanding but because the voice recognition was stubbornly refusing to hear a certain word.   For example, I'd say cushion, the game would hear ""question"". As with most forms of voice recognition, it works best with the commands it expects to hear.  If you say ""what is this"" and click on something it invariably works.  If you have to be more detailed in your command, expect a word or two to be misheard.  Thankfully if you can't get it to understand at all, you can always type the command in directly.  Still, if this game had a ton of people talking to it and teaching it, who knows?  It could have become Skynet...and then when Valve decided to pull the plug on it, it would unleash terminators to rearrange all our furniture.  My toes ache just thinking about it.			"

 Bot Colony  A a revolutionary game which will provide you a unique expirience. The game is based on the novel, Bot Colony.  9/10   Story You control a male or female character, which you name by yourself and you have all access given to command the robots as you wish.In addition of only giving commands or interrogating the robots, the game includes two episodes at the moment while the third is currently in development. Full exploration on a pretty big enviroment which you interact with it in whichever way you want! Pros about the game  +Amazing story!  (Haven't finished it yet on my playthrough but it's promising and will not keep you bored)+Many  commands and dialogues. From ""Go To"" to The game of 20 questions with Charlie! +OUTSTANDING voice acting in the trailer and videos!  Enough said.+No bugs! In my 7 hours of gameplay, I have not noticed any bugs or failures in coding or physic errors. Cons about the game -Some random FPS drops on low-end pcs. I have tested this in two rigs both low spec and they have some random FPS drops, could be cause of the engine. Personal Opinion  Listen, to me this game is a revolution to gaming. I would recommend this to EVERYONE who wants to feel like he's got the power to command robots, and literally the game gives you this power! Also, if you want to see the full command and in-game heads up, you can follow this link:  Commands If you want to see what kind of interrogation is includes in the game, you can follow this link:  Interrogation  "

								A seriously fun game with an interesting overall story to keep you intrigued. The main thing going for this game is the fact that you can communicate with AI that understand what you say, and interact with the environment depending on what you tell them.Although the voice recognition has a hard time understanding you sometimes at the beginning (Most of the time it's great), your system will adapt to your voice and learn the way you talk. You have a chance to correct what you said through typing before commanding a robot anyway.Solving puzzles becomes even more rewarding when you start to uncover stories behind characters through Robot Visual Memories. Sometimes you can ask robots to show you a recorded video of something that happened in order to uncover certain clues.I love the music and art style too. The game really is fantastic in general and I would urge everyone to support this game either through purchasing it, or just spreading the word as innovation like this deserves to be rewarded!			"

Early Access Review
								Quick Review:  Bot Colony, while still a bit buggy, does some pretty amazing things with natural speech recognition, and even when the robots don't understand your commands it's generally more entertaining than frustrating.  Although you currently can't purchase the game from the Steam page, the dev is still selling Steam keys to anyone who understands that the game will probably be shut down and unplayable after this month (March).  If you don't mind this caveat, I wholeheartedly recommend that you try out this game before it's gone forever.  Long Review:  I first played Bot Colony about a year ago before it was released on Steam.  At that time, the robots didn't understand enough commands to make the game interesting.  Solving puzzles was more about trying to guess which commands the robots recognized than it was about trying to deal with the robot's unique understanding of the world.  Fast forward a year, and I find out that not only has the game been released on Steam, but it is shutting down in a month for lack of funding!  You see, every time you ask one of the robots a question, it sends that question to some language-parsing servers to analyze and reply to your question.  Apparently the sales for Bot Colony have been so low that they could no longer afford this extra step, which would render the game unplayable as soon as the servers are shut down.I was pretty disappointed because I really wanted to try the game one more time, but luckily the dev was still selling keys to those interested.  I got the game, and the improvements over the last year were everything I had hoped for.  While the robots still rarely do what you want them to, it's no longer due to the fact that they don't recognize certain commands so much as they take everything you say literally.  For example, when I ask the robot to ""pick up the cup"", he asks ""which one?"" and then proceeds to list every cup in the house.  Or, when I tell the robot to ""put the block on the dresser above the blue drawer"", he balances the block precariously on the very edge of the drawer.  As a result, Bot Colony has changed from a rather boring ""guess the right word"" game, into a game where you really have to consider the inner logic of the robot's mind.  At its core it's an adventure game, but the language element adds a really unique puzzle element that I've never seen in another game before.Of course, the game is still an early access game, so there are a few rough edges as well.  The walk speed seems a bit too slow for me, so I was constantly running everywhere in the game.  There was also one bug that required me to restart the level (outlined below), but it was so funny that it's hard not to forgive it.All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game even though it will likely be shut down next month.  As long as you understand that the gameplay is about trying to get a somewhat overly-logical robot to follow your commands you should be able to get a lot of enjoyment out of the game within the next few weeks.  Check the forums on the Steam hub if you are interested in buying one of the remaining Steam keys from the dev!And because I like to have my cake and eat it too, here's the joke review that I originally wanted to post:In the very first mission of the game you must complete an objective by giving commands to your prospective boss' house robot.  I told the robot to pick up what I thought was a pepper shaker, but instead of going for the object I was looking at the robot went over to open a cupboard.  Realizing that the robot was going to pick up the wrong object, I quickly said, ""Stop!"" and the robot froze in mid-action with the cupboard door half-open.""Ok, now go back""...""Go backwards""...""Turn left""...""Go""...""Continue moving""...""I just froze you, didn't I?""...10/10 Would crash a multi-millionaire's robot butler again.

The robot in the intro will insist objects are already closed when they are open, etc.  If I could order the robot to step in the shower and turn it on, I would have.  Save your money.			"

								I've only had the chance to get ankle-deep into the story so far, but Bot Colony offers a fairly rich and developed game world with interesting characters, plot, and mechanics.  It's both a third and first-person adventure (different scenarios feature different perspectives depending on who or what you're controlling at the time) which makes things interesting. I've had the opportunity to try out both text and speech commands and I'm highly impressed by how responsive and easy it is to communicate in the game.  A bit of trial and error is necessary to figure out certain procedures (and indeed figure out what to do) but I found that part of the fun.  In a way, the errors and breakdown of communication are part of what makes the game more immersive.I'm also extremely pleased that the game has at least another month's lease on life and that there's the real possibility of it coming back to availability on wide release.  This is a fairly ambitious game with innovative mechanics that needs time for you to experience how rich the game world is, in addition to teaching both yourself and the game how to interpret your commands.

BackstoryIn this game you, the player, can converse in English with robot characters you can do this by typing or by speaking which will then be converted to text for the robots to understand.InformationBot Colony is an episodic adventure game which is very unique. it is the one of the only games where you can you can talk to robots and they will be able to understand what you are saying and they will talk back to you or follow your instructions, you can only speak to them in English for them to understand you. The game is not limited to commanding robots, you can actually investigate by using your own words and discover the back story. Pros:- Awesome art style- Cool looking robots- Simple menu, easy to navigate- Narration for cut-scenes, subtitles included- Nice musicCons: - Lack of Graphics options- Not optimized for the lower-end PC'sWant my opinion in numbers? - 5/10I hope this review helped you, Game on & Stay AwesomeReview written for Trump Giveaway's Curator.

Early Access Review
								This game man, wow(Noted: this is a Early Access Game just giving the run down on its current state.)Going into this game people talked this thing up like it was a legit game that worked as shown in the video but guess what spoiler alert it doesnt. when you first start the game you must read a long list of scripts to ""train your account"" which inturn doesnt fully comprehind you in plain, monotoned, english. this might take you 30 mins to a hour depending on what you use to speek through; me, i used a high def mic and that took me close to a hour. then when you get started thats when things go south even more. after all that i do the tatorial and at first it didnt seem that bad, pretty cut forward and dry. well then you try to use voice recigniontion to get stuff done. well thats when you realize you sound like a inbred to the game and the robot you talk to is just the same. when i bought this game it looked like it had alot to offer and now i realized its a game that cannot even stand on its own two feet. aside from all the problems, here are the few things i liked: telling the robot that shut up means the same as stop talking, every once and a while getting the robot to do excatly what i want, and most of all reading the interesting story at the voice training (at the very beginning). sorry all who believed this to be an amazing game where you interact with the game by talking to the game but, you would have better luck trying to talk to relitives from the other side.if you want this game for other reasons you may have more fun with it than me but for me i seem to have felt a little cheated in my thoughts on the game. when my group asks if they should buy the game I will tell them and show them excatly what the game is like.

								Game doesn't work.  Period.   After speech training, I start the first tutorial.  It asks me to thell the robot my name... but it never works.  Even if I type it in.Speech/typing... doesn't matter.  No response.  I'm not in conversation.   Also, the assistant robot is not helping me as I've seen in lets play videos... she's totally silent.  never heard her.Seems the game is hozed.			"

								Hugely interesting and hilarious game that I recommend to everyone. I have had some problems with the game on my side but Eugene from the Bot Colony team has been super nice to me and tried as hard as he could to help me so that I could play the game properly. I have been able to play the game despite my problems and the game has a very interesting concept of being able to talk to robots. And like any ""text-to-speech"" software or game, it can lead to some absolutely hilarious situations.So, despite the clunkiness of the game, the concept of it alone has been enough to charm me and make me play though the first scene. I am not finished with it, far from it, but I will play again and again with my wife until we go through it :)			"

								In the first time i posted this i was a bit agitated and so i apologise for this.I changed this post with a different perspective.The idea of using voice commands and/or type commands, has a lot of potential.To me the game still feels unfinished as it was a long time ago.Mind that the game is still in early access so give it a chance.(I was hoping it would have been finished by now)I was missing the options to be able to change the graphics further.The I.A. learning ability is a great factor.Sometimes the bot doesn't understand what i ment, but that has a funny side aswell.Sometimes it feels like im lost on what to do or how to do so. (i was waiting for a popup bar of sorts to help me out a bit).As it stands right now, (Mind the time of date that i posted this please).I dont say ""dont buy it"", but i do say:If you are interested in a game where you are able to use voice commands or type commands, Then try it out! its still in early access so there are flaws ofcouse. Will try again in six months or so.As i do i will chance the review from time to time.I hope this helps out for the person/person's that develop this game.			"

								Bot Colony is certainly a unique experience. You can use your voice to control the game. You don't have to use your voice, but I would suggest taking the time to train the voice software. It makes the game basically hand free and I feel you get the desired effect.  It brings me back to the Dreamcast days when I used to play Seaman and talk to my fish for hours. Fortunately, time has had a positive effect on voice software and Jimmy ( the robot in-game that you talk to) can understand me far better than my virtual Dreamcast fish could ever dream to. It's pretty casual but it is a good time. If you have ever seen Irobot, you know that sometimes it is the way you word your question to a robot that decides how it will respond. There is an element to the game where you have to question Jimmy to find out what happened before you got there. I really enjoyed that. Like I was Will Smith in Irobot. Either way, it was fun and in my opinion worth my time.			"

								When I see a project with lots of potentials, I recognize it.This game is the first of its kind.There are already games that support voice commands (E.G. Binary Domain) but, this isn't about just simple commands, we are talking about interactions with in-game characters. I am the first to admit that I stayed a long time in the first part of the game talking to a small robot just to know what it can do and it was absolutely amazing.I followed this project since when it was on Greenlight and Indie DB and I know how many efforts and sacrifices have been put on it.I recommend this game, not only because it's amazing, but because you can help the developers make it even better and this is what this game deserve.
