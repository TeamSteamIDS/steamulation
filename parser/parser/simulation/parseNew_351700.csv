												I have been playing UnReal World since 2004. If the game clocked hours before it came to Steam I would be in the thousands. So let's talk about URW.URW is a roguelike survival game set in Iron Age Finland. It has been made (mostly) by one person and has been in development since 1992. That's 24 years. Talk about dedication. You survive through the four seasons by hunting, gathering, fishing, trading, trapping and farming. You can make a huge variety of items ranging from wooden pots to your very own house and sauna. You will learn the importance of shelter, fire and the advantages of a ranged weapon. Will you be a fisherman hermit? A travelling merchant? Or maybe a proud warrior? You can play the game however you want.There's a steep learning curve to the game since there is simply so much to do. The number of hotkeys on the keyboard rivals Microsoft Flight Simulator. The game does have a good manual and plenty of flavor text for history geeks. And let's not forget the lovely LARP pictures for all the characters.Venture into the Far North. And don't forget to tan your hides.			"

												I've been playing Unreal World for a few years now, and for as impenetrable as it might look in some of the screenshots, it is actually one of the most understandable and playable roguelikes I've experienced.  It provides a real sense of accomplishment as well.  The first time I finally killed a large animal was as exciting as anything I've experienced in a game.  I had to sit back and just enjoy the accomplishment for several minutes.  When I made the mistake of building a fire too close to my log cabin that I had spent months (in game) and hours (in real life) building, and watched it burn down, I felt a real sense of loss, but also that I had learned something, and was ready to jump back in and try again.  The game's depth and pacing are, in my opinion, what set up these moments.  If you enjoy the survival genre, you owe it to yourself to give this a try.An additional note: the development cycle for this game has been great over the years.  The developers (all two of them) keep the community informed and are constantly making improvements to the game.			"

												Before I start, I just need to add: you can download this game for free from the official UnReal World website! The free version is practically (if not entirely) identical to the Steam version. Even if you're totally enamoured with this game by the looks of the descriptions and reviews, I still urge people to play the free version before grabbing the Steam one. Once you've given it a shot, you can make a much better decision on if you want to drop money on it. I told myself that if I played the free version for longer than eight hours, I'd buy the Steam version even if I never boot it up again. I clocked about ten hours, bought it on Steam, then continued to play it for however long it says I have at the top of this review.I really love this game. It's deep, but I've never felt truly lost; when you make a character, you can pick to have a goal-orientated quest system that teaches you how to play. This ranges from 'This is how you drink water, you gigantic idiot' to building your own house and trading for animals. Once you've grasped the basics, the game opens up as the survival roguelike it aims to be. If you want to know all the cool mechanics that come with the game, the other positive reviews go into passionate detail about what makes the game great. To avoid clashing with people who have literally hundreds of hours of gametime over me, I'll instead relay something that's unique to me; an in-game story.Fur is really important in UnReal World. It's valuable, it's useful, and it'll stop you from freezing to death when Snow Hell decides to pay a visit. Unfortunately, being a total newbie at the game, the only hides I can get are from squirrels, hares, and ermines. Not very prestigious. The only big hides I had managed to score was one of a bear and an elk, and that's because they fell into a pit trap I set up and became a sitting duck for my volley of arrows. Basically, I'm a bad hunter.One day I'm out in the snow in my bear fur clothes, checking my pit traps to see if any more suckers have taken pity on my awful hunting skills. The traps are on the border between a mire and a forest, set up to channel and capture any animals walking from one area to another. This time, I noticed a wolf on the world map standing in the mire, so I zoom in on the action to see what's going on.Turns out, it's not a wolf. It's a pack of them.At this point of the game, the most dangerous thing I've successfully managed to hunt (that wasn't sitting in a pit and woefully awaiting death) is a fox. All the animals I've come across are basically 'let's see how close I can get before it runs away at the speed of light'. The wolves didn't do that. They decided that I'm up for dinner. They charge at me (""What? Animals attack you in this game?!"") and suddenly I'm reaching for my bow. I thought I was a goner, but it turns out that shooting an arrow into the shoulder of a charging wolf is a good deterrent (who knew?). It became a game of scoring a single wound on each attacking wolf to scare them and make them flee. I scored a particularly good hit on one wolf, and I chased down its limping self and attacked its head for a kill. Skinned its fur and butchered its meat and fat. Good stuff.That's when I discovered why wolves were even here in the first place; lying in the middle of the field was a wolf-torn elk. I approached it and checked the hide, and was surprised to see the wolves hadn't mangled it beyond recognition. It was about a quarter of the way through skinning it that I realised the wolves were still around -- just keeping their distance. I decided to grab the skin and forget the butchering, get out while I still could. I didn't need the meat, the fur was the real gold here.So I walk home with some wolf and elk fur under my arms. The total sum of the furs I had back home came to something like 8lbs; the fur I was carring totalled 30lbs. A good catch! I set the wolf fur down and use its fat from the butchering to tan it. I then set the elk fur down and -- wait! I didn't butcher the elk! I don't have any fat to tan it with! 20lbs of fur was threaning to go rotten on me if I didn't find a solution, and fast.I dumped the fur in my cold, 'please don't rot on me' cellar and made a return to the elk. Turns out, so had the wolves, and they had regained their courage. Some nasty nips later, I decided my life wasn't worth some fat and fled.I looked up about the tanning process to try to find alternatives for my elk fur. Turns out, you don't have to use fat. The skinned barks of alder and rowan trees work just as well. Big problem; I lived in a gigantic forest of pine and birch. So begins the race against time to find an alder or rowan tree before my goldmine attracts flies rather than merchants.So I'm darting around the world map, cursing every pine and birch that I see. That's when I find a herd of reindeer milling around. I decided to try my luck, so I zoomed in and took a less-than-hopeful shot at the nearest one, expecting a total miss and all the reindeer to flee. It hits. Fire off a second arrow before the victim has a chance to run. Second one hits.Oh crap. So this is what hunting feels like.The reindeer has been so badly hit, it's practically crawling its way across the floor. I catch up with it and start trying to unload arrows into its head. My aim is so bad that it ends up hitting the shoulder, body, and even one hit on the knee, at which point I reprimanded UnReal World for its poor choice of meme references. It was around the time I decided to equip a javelin and start poking its head that my character falls asleep. Turns out, fighting wolves and lugging fur across a continent really tires a man out. Who knew?I awoke with the reindeer nowhere in sight. I followed its tracks and found it only a short run away, still desperately trying to crawl its way to freedom. I started poking at its head with the javelin until it dies, skinned it, made sure to grab the fat this time, and recovered the arrows I had fired. The fat of the reindeer was enough to tan its own hide, but not enough to tan the elk's. The hunt for the tree was still on.I read up on alder and rowan trees, and found out that they mostly grow in and around villages. So I poked my head into the local village and -- sure enough -- sitting in the middle of the field all proud of itself was an alder tree. The villagers were probably weirded out to see a man walk into their village, cry 'YES!' and then begin frantically carving the bark off of one of their trees. I didn't care. Elk fur was back in fashion, baby.So that's how I went from Small Game Extraordinaire to sleeping in the furs of a wolf, elk, and reindeer, all because I decided to go check my traps for a bit. My bear fur clothes had some nasty wolf bites in them and I had sufffered a few nasty scratches myself, but I could probably line the entirety of my house in fur now. It was about this time I realised that maybe, just maybe, UnReal World is an awesome game and that I'm glad I got it.Stay safe in the cold North, folks!			"

												What to say about this amazing game?Just play it!Okay, no, that's not fair... you probably want more info than that, right?TL;DRGod-tier survival/crafting roguelike. Considerable learning curve. Awesome community & devs. Unlike anything else you're likely to find. Try it for free: http://unrealworld.fi/General InfoIt's certainly not for everyone... but it's also one of the most unique and fun games I've ever had the pleasure of playing (that's coming from someone who's been playing video games for over 20 years, and with over 1000 games on Steam alone).Roguelikes, as a genre, seem to have had a resurgence in popularity in recent years; ever since Minecraft rocked the gaming world, the whole survival-crafting-building genre has only increased in popularity.UnReal World mixes all of this and gives you a peerless roguelike survival crafting experience. There are no zombies to find here, only bears and Njerpez (not to mention the hunger and cold), but they're more than trouble enough. You'll wish you had something as easy as zombies to deal with! (except, no, hopefully not... no more zombies... too many zombies everywhere)Despite its name, UnReal World also provides one of the most realistic survival experiences I've seen in a game to date (probably the most realistic, really).Do you want to hang out in the highly-populated Driik lands for access to their large villages and have an easy life of crafting and trading? Or perhaps you'd prefer living out in the middle of nowhere to see if you can survive completely on your own, without help from anyone? Maybe you want to see a lot of combat and one day hope to eradicate all the Njerpez?Any of this is possible, and so much more. It's up to you.GameplayUnReal World won't hold your hand; iron-age pseudo-Finland is a brutal place in which to try and survive, no doubt.A lot of modern gamers might be turned off by the initial time investment required to learn how to play the game (not to mention the oldschool graphics; no fancy 3D & particle effects here), but for those that bother, they'll be rewarded with incredibly deep survival gameplay and an experience like no other.The keyboard-based nature of the game might seem unwieldly at first (and yes, there are a lot of keys to memorize) but it offers very smooth gameplay once you get used to it. You can use the mouse for most/a lot of things, but I'd suggest gtting used to the hotkeys; they can drastically improve your experience.UnReal World is a sandbox. There are no set goals beyond ""survive"". How you go about doing that is up to you.The map is huge, and mostly wilderness. The game's ten different playable cultures (and one non-playable; the Njerpez) all have their own ""area"" of the map, which determines where you can find settlements. The most interesting of these for a new player would be the Driikiläiset, which can be found in the south-west, as they are the most ""urban"" and have the biggest villages (which means more trading, which can make one's life much easier).When you create a new character, you choose which culture you come from; each has their strengths and weaknesses in terms of min/max stats, which affects a variety of things. You can also choose which general area of the map you want to start in, and a few other things.Once you begin your game, what you do is entirely up to you. There are no set goals; this is a free-form sandbox game (though quests are coming in a future update!).You can hunt, fish, explore, craft, trade, build yourself a house. Try to settle down, or live as a nomad. Summertime, and the livin' is easy... but you best be prepared for when winter comes around...Combat[coming soon]Crafting[coming soon]Pricing[coming soon]Parting ThoughtsDon't dive into this game expecting to know how to play right away. There are semi-tutorials which will help you along with the basics (start with ""Living in the Wild""), but this is a game with a lot of intricacies that you'll learn over time, with experience and trial & error. Easy to learn, hard to master, as they say. Patience is well-rewarded.UnReal World may be new to Steam, but it's been around for a very long time. Its first iteration dates all the way back to 1992! Of course, the game has changed a lot over the years, and will continue to do so for a long time still.Some useful resources, if you need help, are the official forum[z3.invisionfree.com] and the wiki[unrealworld.wikia.com]. Of course, there's also the Steam forum and no doubt some enterprising players will write Steam guides (though none are yet available at the time of this writing).The UnReal World is a great game with a great community: if you have any questions, ask, someone will be happy to help!

												I've played various versions of UnReal World over the past 12+ years, including dozens of hours on this latest version which is being released on Steam. It's got a lot of attributes of a rogue-like: turn-based movement, permanent death, lots of stuff to discover, lots of stuff to craft. Somewhere in its development, more than 10 years ago, it strayed from the path of being a fantasy game to being a simulation of iron-age Finland.The combat system is straight-forward, but unforgiving. The character has skills for various weapons; combat results are based on attacker and defender results; damage is allocated to hit locations after accounting for armor. Positioning matters: getting behind an opponent allows unblocked attacks. Injuries matter: serious blows to the legs can lame or cripple a creature, a hard blow to the head or even torso can stun. Combat can be drawn out or over quickly, depending on the hidden rng and positioning, so new players are advised to tread carefully at first. Or, you can accept that it's a rogue-like, and just get killed and restart.If your character can survive or avoid combats, time will pass. You'll have to keep your character fed or starvation penalties will mount. You'll have to think about water, and warmth, and shelter. And eventually, maybe before your character is fully prepared, winter will arrive. In the UnReal World, winter changes the game. For about five game-months you need to stay warm and stay fed. Every day will be short. Every night will be long. The leading cause of death in winter might be boredom; the cabin fever and the routine of safe survival becomes too much and the player takes a character out to adventure in the great white north, into the teeth of a blizzard. Some of them make it back to their cabins. Having said that, with good fur clothes and ski equipment, a character can do a lot of hunting and trapping through the winter, or timberwork, or any number of other tasks.I think my characters have died every way possible in this game. I'll let you discover the various ways, and head off myself for further adventures. Enjoy!			"

 Unreal World: Vimba's Review   I don't make many reviews here on steam, but this game deserves one so much. I've also played the game a lot longer before it came to steam and still do.Edit: My low hours is from offline play from the non-steam executable. I don't know why I don't use steam. I guess I'm just used to the other way around. I bought it on steam because I wanted to support the devs. :)There is so much to say about Unreal World, but first I want to start off by saying that this is not a game that everyone will enjoy. Go check out the game on their website for free: http://www.unrealworld.fi/  You have to put in some effort to learn the controls (which don't take long, depending on how custom you are with roguelikes and basic keyboard layout) You also need to be able to use your imagination (which is our greatest gift for video games) to immerse yourself in your own world. Once you feel comfortable with that, you are set.Unreal World sets the player close to the iron age of human history ( 800 - 1200 A.D.) located in Finland. You can see from the start as soon as you launch the game that the traditional and folklore of the finnish culture is in place by listening to the music. The Kantele is being used which is part of the Finnish culture and it immediately tries to immerse the player in its rich world. You choose a culture and then roll some stats. The world is then randomly generated and you get to choose a beginning ""story"" or setup to how you will play the first moments of the game. Each scenario has some sort of interesting background to help you be ready and immersed in the world. They are all interesting and some provide tools to help you get started.If you survive your initial scenario (depending if you chose a violent one) you are then free to do what you wish. Ultimately Unreal World is a simulator of sorts to show the player how our world is a dangerous one without the need of zombies and Rust like 24/7 violence. Like the Finnish Proverb says ""The world will surely teach one; if nothing else, than to walk slowly."" It's very true! I won't go into details of what you can do because basically there are SO many things you can do and everything necessary is there to survive. If you were someone that read this because you thought you wouldn't be able to learn this or hate it for the graphics; well good for you b/c there are mods, in-game tutorials, encylopedia, and online guides. Pros + Very Immersive+ A game that allows players to use their imagination+ Awesome Developers (Thanks Sami and Erkka)+ In Depth Combat System+ In Depth Injury System from cuts/bruises, to diseases and so much more+ Accurate Historical Items and Folklore+ Easily Moddable+ High Replayability Cons -Roguelike Graphics: This is a con for some players used to modern graphics (Latest Update Improved them and mods help)-Slight learning curve with keys (but is easily fluid once you get used to it)-Could use more sounds IMO but overall very well done-Pictures are somewhat corny but overall they do well (personal taste and easily moddable and mods help)Overall, this is the TRUE survival game. I have over 400 hours of Rust and have played just about every survival game out there, but Unreal World just keeps pulling me back in for its in depth system of how we humans are adapted to survive in the impossible. This game allows me to use my imagination and do what I cannot do in my daily life. Final Score: 95/100 Thank you so much for reading!			"

The Premier Finnish Starvation SimulatorHey bud, I know you've been thinking to yourself, ""Dang, I wish I was starving to death and/or being eaten by a bear in the harshest winter of unbridled and unfathomable intensity."" You really need to lighten up, Champ. Dad says you've been bumming Mom out something fierce. Well Debby-Downer, you're in luck! You can now channel that real world ""inner"" (watch those finger quotes) masochist into something more productive. Namely, The UnReal World.Here's what you do, roll an Owl-tribe bowsman and start in winter as a runaway slave because you're a BAD*SS. Then, promptly get kicked in the head to death by a Njerpez Housewive--(insert heavy Russian accent) In iron-age Finland, red shirts kill you!. Next, make a Seal-tribe trapper, spend 4 real life days setting up traps only to blunder into one of them and die miserably. Finally, create Driikilainen fisherman, amass immeasurable wealth, build a house, start a family, enter your sheep pen to butcher up some dinner for said family and get hooved to death by terrified sheep. Rage quit.Sh*t just got UnReal. BOOM.UnReal World is special in the way it combines unparalleled player agency, deep simulation and a unique, low-fantasy mythos to produce original narratives derived through emergent gameplay. It's not a game I'd recommend to anybody but, it's a game I'd recommend to you, the person who yearns for immersive complexity and depth, the person who understands that Losing Is Fun™. Be warned though, once you venture into the far north--there is no coming back.Okay, the rest of you ""survival"" (mentally visualize those finger quotes) crafting games can go home now, UnReal World has come to Steam--and it is good.

												I was woefully ignorant of this game for many years, which is sad, because this is THE game I always imagined being able to play one day.This is a game with such depth that it could only be an ""indie"" game. 3D rendering, fancy production, developer time-tables... all of that Big Name Developer stuff would make creating a game like this completely impossible.UnReal World is a procedurally generated (yet large and persistent) world, inhabited by incredible A.I. There are numerous tasks always available for you to do, and the objective is simply to survive. But almost inevitably: you won't.Your character struggles mostly against nature (and the occasional bandit or warrior). The weather, the ice, the BEARS. Go fishing, go hunting, go trading. Make tools and weapons and traps. Whatever you think you could do in an Iron-Age Scandinavian forest, you can do it in this game, with astonishing attention to detail and realism.The animal A.I. is amazing. Wolves split and converge over long-distances with their packs, howling for communication. Kill the biggest reindeer in a pack (the leader) and the other reindeer will become aimless until they're picked off by other prey. Combat, while not action-based, has a cold realism to it unlike anything I've seen. Your life isn't measured in ""Hit points""... Rather your body, your limbs, your blood, your senses: they can all be attacked and taken away from you -- or you can take them away from your enemy. One hit in the right spot will debilitate you. Game over. But its a death that will make you smile. Dying is a part of nature, and a part of this game. Fight against it, but realize that its what makes your character's adventure... complete.Hunting in this game is a challenge and never a guaranteed success. You, the player, as a person, need to learn the value of patience and deligence. But when you finally manage to track down your first elk or stag through vast reaches of forest, until at last the animal is too fatigued to run anymore... there is NO ""kill"" in a videogame I've found as satisfying as this. Yesterday I got really lucky, and chased a panicked reindeer that injured itself trying to scale down a cliff -- but when I finally caught up to it, a wolf had half-eaten its corpse, ruining the precious fur and making off with some of the meat.Smoke/Dry the meat, tan the skin, feed your dog, and donate a cut of meat to the ""gods"" for letting you live another day. Work on building your cabin, or preparing the cold soil for future agriculture. There is so much to do, and it is all vital, well-designed, brilliant. This is a brilliant one-of-a-kind game that throws you into a real world like no other game I've ever played. There is no game I would more enthusiastically urge people to try. I am so happy this game has come to Steam, thus coming to my attention, and I have never been more happy to give a developer my money (thank you, Sami). Try this game.			"

												(Please ignore the small amount of play-time I have. I've had this game for around a decade, and the developer has kindly supplied me with a key for the Steam version.)See the bottom of the review for TL;DR.I rarely write positive reviews, but to me, the devotion that Sami shows to his supporters and fans is nothing short of remarkable. He went through the trouble of walking me through the steps of getting my key re-sent and updated despite me having very little of the original information I had when originally purchasing the game, and also has made a point of giving Steam keys to those who own lifetime registration keys.Though, this is a review about URW, not about the developer.URW takes a somewhat different approach to things than a lot of roguelikes, especially the ones usually seen on Steam. Rather than abstracting concepts like HP, satiation, exhaustion, deities, combat, and so on, URW tries as well as it is able to approach things more realistically. Fans of Dwarf Fortress Adventurer Mode shouldn't be too out of their element here.Rather than being about killing dragons and getting amulets, URW is more generally about surviving in the wilderness. Trying to, anyway. Combat poses a very real threat. One missed blow could get you a concussion, or swept off of your feet and getting a spear through your chest, or teeth at your throat. This is made all the more painful, because your characters and the worlds they live in are indeed very permanent. You might build a house and make a type of farm, trading regularly with a nearby village. Make a smokehouse to cure your meats, make a sauna, get drunk, do what people from Finland do.But the combat itself isn't the only problem. You also have to worry about things like your wounds getting infected, illnesses, starvation, dehydration, hypothermia, sleep deprivation. Of course, when you're injured, it becomes even harder to care for yourself... but that might be skipping ahead a little too far. Depending on whatever choice of background and scenario you pick, your first priority might be making a temporary shelter out of sticks and leaves, fending off a wolf, or escaping from captivity.After you make yourself marginally more comfortable, you need to start working on feeding yourself, and making (or trading for, or looting, or stealing) tools as a means to accomplish this. Whether that means hunting for food, fishing, foraging, robbing other people, stealing from them, or just plain killing them and eating them. (The gods won't mind. Really.) But while eating raw food might be okay sometimes, you should probably consider cooking it, making a dish of it, or maybe a bit later on, working on a means of preparing it for long-term storage, like digging a cold-storage cellar, or curing it with salt, or in a smokehouse.Once you have a somewhat reliable means of feeding yourself and living comfortably in the trees, and have a nice axe, hopefully without too many people's blood on it, you could think about building a house for yourself! Or you could live like a nomad. Your choice, really. Either way, once you're on your feet, you can get niceties by trading things like cured furs and pelts to village traders and other wanderers possibly like yourself.Although there are arbitrary goals that can reward you with things, ultimately they are optional and there is no endgame or final goal of URW besides what you dictate.URW is definitely not for everyone, and I do recommend trying the free version first. Don't let my review make the game sound more hypeworthy than it is. See for yourself if you like it or not. Even if you think you like roguelikes, this one might not sit well with you.tl;dr Mostly-realistic wilderness survival roguelike that eventually turns into a violent Harvest Moon with permadeath.TRY THE FREE VERSION FIRST.

												I've been playing this game for years, and I'm so glad it's finally on Steam. (Back when I started, my main enemy was falling out of trees, and if you slept out in the open, you'd wake up to a lynx ripping your face off. I'm fairly sure that latter one can still happen. Don't mess with lynxes. Their silent meows are a premonition of terror and violence.)I'm not very good at getting myself set up, so here's how I usually end up playing:- Making a primitive bow and arrows, then hunting while I gradually starve to death.- Fishing (maybe with a fishing pole, maybe by stabbing the water repeatedly with a stick)... while I gradually starve to death.- Setting a bunch of traps in apparently unfavorable areas. Getting frostbite (or just really frustrated) as I try to check them over and over, even though they haven't brought in any game. - Finally making enough headway to build a cabin. Playing an awkward, hilarious, terrifying game of cat and mouse with a lynx that wanders onto my property, until I can manage to get a fence and traps up.My last game, I started out trying to hunt with a bow/arrow. I brought down a bunch of birds with it, but I was gradually starving. I found a grouse that had been partially eaten by a goshawk. Fine, I'm not picky. That's a pound of grouse meat. I ate it. I was tracking a herd of reindeer for days, and when I went up to the mountain to scout out where they'd gotten to, I saw that there were wolves chasing them. I weighed the options, decided I was starving and I'd try to avoid the wolves. Came within a screen of wolves twice, but managed to avoid them, and found a reindeer that the wolves had taken down and started eating. Fine. I'm not picky. I skinned it, butchered it, and brought the meat home.Finally, my trap pits started bringing in big game. Too much big game, in fact -- something like 4-5 reindeer and stags within the period of a week or so. I lost one of the hides when it rotted while I was scrambling to butcher everything, tan the hides, reset the traps, and haul meat up to the closest village before it went bad. So I got sloppy and left a bunch of meat next to one of the traps, where I'd butchered a reindeer but couldn't carry everything back. When I came back for the rest, a wolf was there, attracted by the meat. He lunged at me and took me down in two attacks.Anyway, if you like roguelikes or sandbox games, especially wilderness survival, get this. I always come back to it, that's how good it is, and it's constantly being improved (dynamic weather, predator-prey interaction, and more realistic animal spawning are all very new, and they're amazing, and I'm sure we can expect more of the same quality changes in the future). It's got a heck of a learning curve, but it basically defined sandbox games for me, way back before Minecraft was even a thing.			"

												I've been playing this game for years and it just keeps getting better and better with every iteration.  It's nice to see it up on steam where it will get more exposure and bring a great deal of enjoyment to many others who discover it.It is a rich single-player world where you will have to survive.  No, not one wave after another of enemies, but the harsh realities of living in a land where even the weather can be your enemy.  Yes, there are some (NPC) people whom you might have to fight with, but many more whom you will trade with and develop a relationship for mutual survival.  You pick a spot to make your cabin.  Cut the trees to make the logs.  Fish.  Hunt.  Plant.  Make your tools or trade for them with nearby villagers.  Stock up on foods, make warm clothing and much, much more... and maybe,  just maybe, you'll survive the cold, dark winter.I enjoy the turn-based aspect of this game, allowing me to go at my own pace.  Graphics are tiled top-down and not spectacular, but with each iteration of the game, they get better and better.  This latest version the graphics (particularly the lighting) add a lot to immersion.   It doesn't really matter though, because you soon get lost in the details and become immersed in the world no matter what.  How much snow fell while you were sleeping, do I need to use my skis?  Has it been cold enough to go out on the ice?  The edges of the lake are solid, but is the middle safe enough to walk on?  Did I hear a Elk in the distance to my left?  I better check my trap lines.  I wonder if the village I discovered earlier last week has some better spears to trade for.  There were  rumors of a bear in the area and it's hide would make nice warm clothing for cold winter days.... and on it goes.Modding is easy and enjoyable, especially with this new version, allowing you to tweak many things or make completely new ones.  The creators of the game are also responsive to the community and very friendly.I don't really have anything negative to say. It might take a little time to get used to the key commands, but the help file is easily accessible after hitting the ESC key.  The game does what it's suppose to and just gets better and more detailed with every iteration.  It's turn-based, survival, wilderness simulation that makes for a great afternoon or evening of play.  I'd say try it out, the price is very reasonable.			"

												""What the hell is this crap?"" My first impressions of the game; looking at the trailer and screenshots. I decided to randomly look at a video of this game being explained. Before I knew it I was slightly interested. My slight interest and curiosity got me to download the free version of this game and give it a good college try. After about an hour I knew this was something special. Something I could play for years if not for once in a while. You are in control of a tribesmen or women of sorts set to survive in the great iron north. You can customize your starting story which impacts your starting gear and situation respectively. You can also customize where you start and whether the tutorial is active or not. From there is up to you create a marvelous adventure filled with peril, exhaustion, starvation, infection, and whatever else might kill you. The game mechanics make sense and feel realistic. Chopping a tree down with a knife takes hours unlike using an axe, chasing down a reindeer or badger is unlikely, etc. It’s not perfect but it works. This game kind of reminds me of a ‘create your own adventure book/board game’. Time progresses as you perform actions and move around the world. This gives you time to think about your next action. Do you try and sneak up on that wild pig or do you chunk this rock on the ground at it? Knowing that if you miss it’s probably going to get away. Should I eat this spoiled food knowing it might make me sick? Death is permanent so make every choice count! Every action performed is checked against multiple stats. Reminds me of the old DnD days. Makes the world feel more immersive and the combat feel richer. You want to throw that spear? How fatigued are you? What’s you skill in spears? Are you injured? How far away is the target? I don’t know all the exact stats but I know there is a lot going on in the background for everything you do. I recommend that you just watch a couple video and try it out for yourself. Download the free version at their website. If this sounds good to you then you owe it to yourself to give it a good college try like I did. I will leave you with a brief adventure that I had in the Unreal World… Alone, cold, and starving I come across a lonely reindeer in the middle of a vast frozen forest. He doesn’t notice me so make a slow approach. As I approach I snap a small branch beneath my foot like an idiot which alerts the reindeer to jump to attention. It’s now or never. I draw and shoot my bow. The shot is steady and accurate but the reindeer is already in motion. The arrow penetrates just below the reindeer’s shoulder. It takes off into the dense woods. I follow. After a short while I start to lose sight of it and I am relying on my tracking ability alone. Tracks and blood keep focused. As night beings to fall I start to loose site of its trail. It’s getting dark and I am starting to lose hope. My stomach growls and I begin to shiver. The cold is taking a hold of me I am beginning to fail. Then I hear something to my south. A yell of an animal. Do I continue on or follow the sound? I hear the yell again. After losing complete site of the reindeer tracks I decide to follow the sound. After about 10 minutes of travelling south I see it… It’s the reindeer I shot earlier. It nearly doubled backed on me. It’s injured, crippled and fatigued. “You’re mine now!” I draw and fire my bow. I am so fatigued the arrow hits the tree next to it. Again! I draw and shot my bow. The arrow flies true and I hit it straight in the neck; blood rushes out. It slows and after a few steps staggers then passes out. I approach and finish the job.I take a moment to rest but I am too cold to stay still for too long. Night has fallen and I need to rest. I quickly gather some branches and firewood and make a fire. The warmth of the fire gives me a second wind an I decide to skin the animal and butcher some of its meat. I am so hungry I feast on it raw like a ravenous dog. Its late, taking satisfaction of a good kill I decide to sleep for the night. Unfortunately the fire goes out in the middle of the night and I awake in the early hours of the morning chilled yet again. I hear something approaching... I take a moment to scan my surroundings and notice my reindeer has been feasted upon. What could of done this? A dog? No... A bear. As I turn I see the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ himself. I take a step back and it approaches. I draw my bow and take the shot. My shot is steady and true puncturing the bear in the front of his chest. It’s not enough. It becomes enraged and begins to charge. Before I can react It swipes its massive claw and gashes my arm and chest wide open. I fall back… I reach for my knife... It finishes me off with a mighty blow. Hugh Glass would of been disappointed... This is just one of my wonderful adventures. Many more await you in the Unreal World. 10 bear tracks out of 10.			"

												I'm just going to start this review by letting potential buyers know that I've put several hundred hours into the free version of this game. I'm twenty-four years old so this game has been ""In-Dev"" my entire existence and it shows through in some good and bad ways*. When I saw UnReal World on Steam my jaw dropped, I loaded $25 onto my wallet, and bought it immediately. No regrets.I'm going to do a light Pros & Cons to sum the why of it up.Pros: + Deep game mechanics.+ Actually a survival game. (Unlike Rust/The Forest/ and others that make the claim)+ High Replayability.+ Immersive Lore.+ Progressive skills.+ Massive crafting system.+ Extensive Medical system.+ Many mods made by the community and refined over time.+ Easy to create your own mods. Google the resources you need and the system is easy to learn.Cons:-- Mixture of Traditional & Digitized sprites for graphics.-- Complex context menus required for maneveuring through the game.- Basic/dated sound effects.Neutral (Because this could be a plus for some, a negative for others.)* +/- Overall a dated old-school look and feel.  +/- A slight lack of ""end-game"" content, but reaching the end-game takes plenty of time and new updates are planned to rectify this.  A few of the planned updates are: family management, village ceremonies, and more. This is all detailed on the development page.  +/- End game content  by 3rd party developers. I think that a game's merit shouldn't be based off the content created by the community, but while you're waiting on new updates things like the Shaman mod can give you your fix of additional content. It adds many ""rituals"" that feel lore-friendly and allow you to delve into spiritual magic and ultimately align yourself with light or darkness.+/- It is lacking in music overall, but the new title screen music is promising.Due to the time when the project was initially started the game has been stuck in the past as far as graphics, sound, and the general presentation goes.The skin isn't beautiful, but the meat is sturdy and supple. [It must be a Kaumo.]For those who aren't deterred by the time investment it takes to learn this game it is worthwhile and has more to come.You can check out the developer's plans over on the website under the Development tab. http://www.unrealworld.fi/urw_development.htmlProtips for those who intend to buy it/already have:(I'll update this as I think of more.)! Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out. This is very useful for hunting.! The help menu is your friend. Even for seasoned veterans.! Dogs are man's best friends for a reason. They make hunting much easier.! Humans used to use a method called ""Persistence Hunting"" to hunt down big game. The short of it is you use your incredible endurance to run an animal down and track it until it collapses from exhaustion then shower it with arrows or beat it to death in its sleep. How metal is that?! Try to spawn close to the Driikiläiset people (Cyan on the map, toggle culture colors on) so that you can trade with their massive amounts of shops if you find a village. You'll do quite well for yourself by peddling your crafts to them for various supplies.! Trap fences can be difficult to get the hang of, but making a house relatively near one can help guarantee your cellar stays stocked throughout the winter.! When starving and tracking down an animal have ranged weaponry. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take -Lebron James on hunting, maybe.!!! Don't give up. Every death is a chance to learn or try something different although it is frustrating to lose your progress. If you really don't want to lose out on it (and this is often frowned upon, but your own choice) then you pull up task manager (Control + Alt + Delete) and end the URW.exe process before going through the menu that deletes your character/progress. Everything that happened up to your death will be the same when you reload the game. You lose out on the experience, but it is your purchase and decision.EDIT:  Actually, since I was born in 1992 and the game was released then it has been in-dev all my life. Wow.			"

UnReal World is a unique and remarkable addition to the roguelike genre. I played this for many hours with the free version before it came to Steam. At times I feel like this is a slightly more 'zen-like' experience than many of its dungeon-crawling brothers, simply because there does not always have to be a clear-cut goal of getting to the bottom of a dungeon or escaping something. In exchange for dungeons, you get the great Finland outdoors. Sometimes you just chill out and exist. But don't get me wrong, the learning curve is still quite steep and you will 100% always die on a long enough timeline. This is Don't Starve for the hardcore (I write that with a loving nod to Don't Starve). The flavor of this title is potent, and very much its own thing. This does not play or feel like anything else out there, as far as I'm concerned. It can't accurately be described as just some sort of 'different angle' or 'take' on another game. The obscure mixture of old-school artwork with, well, old-school real life images is weird, but after a while it becomes alluring. The text is well written. I like the 'online' in-game encyclopedia and deep lore. You could get lost in this universe for a life-time and probably still not experience everything.Overall, I really have no ""con's"" to list. This is a classic roguelike that is a pillar of the community, and deserves recognition as such. The controls are awkward at first, for sure, but quickly you get used to them and actually like them (plus there are options for traditional roguelike controls). Like any roguelike worth its weight, you will explore, die, learn why you died - and repeat to hopefully make it further. You will have a good time.So go ahead - pick this up and get lost for an afternoon... Or a weekend... Or a lifetime. You won't regret it.			"

												Extreamly addictive. You've been warned. At the very beginning you will likely struggle with the mecanics and controlls of this game. You will rediscover your keyboard and start using keys you forgot you had. But after a few hours the gameplay will become breezy. When that happens, that's when you start to realize how stimulating this survival simulator really is. You have comeplete freedome as you wander the open wilderness  getting to know your greatest foe, hunger. There are many ways to survive in the wild. Hunt'n, trap'n, fish'n, forag'n...... murderen.... If times are tuff and you have no other ""convienent"" choice, you can easily presuade a happless viliger to come away with you to a secluded spot in the woods and mercilessly slaugter him with a hatchet while his back is turned. After he has breathed his last, take his stuff, his clothes and even his body if you're desperate enough cause in this game you can eat people! I have a small habbit of making people dissapear during """"hunting trips"""". Make no mistake, this game has some dark moments. Children are no exception and are given no advantage against the cold breath of death in this world. Un-real world is about as real as it gets. 10/10			"

												Wow this game is hardcore. I was so happy when I finally after few hours of playing had made a simple shelter to get some sleep when raining. Then I hunted a squirrel and some birds to get meat, but jackpot was near by lake where I got fish after getting fishing rod. After that I started getting steady roasted food with fire and my starvation went away. Making stone axe, javelins and food to backpak I got confident and wanted to go hunting get meat and leather. After few miles of walking I saw human and was so happy. I wanted to trade javelin and other stuff, but those were robbers, ""Give your weapons to us or die."" ""No!"", but I couldn't run away and I died. Those were my first 5 hours of the game, and I liked it. Now new character, maybe I this time I could made better tools, weapons and proper house.			"

												Installed Steam release to make sure it worked as flawlessly as the previous windows releases on the unreal world site. Make trap pit to pass the time as I'm a bit earlier in spring than I planned to be.Fall into own trap pit despite having played this game off and on for years.Barely make it out only to see an animal watching me from the tree line.Bleed out knowing at least the trap pit worked.10/10 would kill self again.On a serious note, this game is a fantastic survival simulation with incredible depth. I have played it for many years and am super happy to see it on Steam. If you are on my friends list you are probably tired of hearing about this game by now but it really is worth a look if you are into wilderness games.November 2016 Update: The Steam Awards are a perfect opportunity to nominate this gem for the Test of Time award as I cannot count the number of times I've come back to this wonderful game over the years.

												Best game I've ever played. I would have gladly paid three to four times the cost for buying it. It's brutal and unforgiving. I started my character in the ""hurt and alone"" scenario and I had to take drastic measures to survive.   I went from being left wounded and hungry with nothing but the clothes on my back and a simple knive, to coming SO close to starving to death in the bitter northern coast. I carved a handful of crude javlins and tried spear fishing. It barely delayed my death for a few days, then I decided to leave the shores and try a more aggressive approach. It did more harm than good at first, but then I ran into a lone, friendly adventurer.   Having nothing of value to trade for food, I just started desperately hurling my primitive javlins at him the instant he turned his back. By the time he managed to get a weapon drawn to defend himself, it was too late. He was crippled and bleeding from his hips, arms and abdomen. He fell unconcious before he even reached me.  After kicking his neck four times in order to break it, I realized HE HAD NO FOOD. I needed to eat, or my body would eat itself. I butchered his corpse.   With 152 lbs of freshly cut human meat, I returned to my shelter on the nothern coastline and started to recuperate my strenth. Months later, I now have an arsenal of armor and equipement, and an established cottage on a lone island where I maintain relations between myself and the lake spirits that guard the area. And I have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battleaxe.			"

												I have always been a big fan of open world games, as well as games that include random generation. Unreal World is both of these, along with many other themes that are so incredibly rare to find bundled into a single game. I know anything I say in this review will not come close to doing the game justice, but I hope I can sway any readers into trying this wonderful gem if they are a fan of this kind of game.Unreal World is based on Finland during the late iron age, roughly 800 - 1200 AD. While there a few fantasy themes in Unreal World, I consider this game to be pretty realistic. The fantasy themes I mentioned are mostly your character's religous beliefs, which are modeled after Finnish beliefs during the time period. If you have to swim across a river for example, it is a good idea to perform a ritual to ""banish the evil water guardian"" so that you will be less likely to drown in the process.The game is a huge world to explore, randomly generated for every character you make. When you create your character, after selecting what tribe you are from, picking a character portrait, and other things, you will be able to pick a starting scenario if you wish. The scenario doesn't affect the gameplay, only the circumstances you begin the game with. Will you be an aspiring farmer, starting the game with a shovel and some seeds to start your very own farm? Or perhaps you have come across an abandoned campsite, with its creator nowhere to be found? There are many ways to start your game, and as many ways to play the game as you can imagine. There are no restrictions of what you can and can not do. Will you build a cabin far off into the woods, trapping animals and selling their fur to a nearby village? Or maybe you prefer the life of a hermit, living off the land, avoiding human contact completely.I can ramble all day about this game, but like I said, anything I say in this review is not going to even come close to how great this game is. If you are a fan of wilderness survival games, this game is for you. Some people may be turned away because of the old school graphics, but I can tell you without any doubt in my mind that this game more than makes up for that with the incredible amount of realism it contains, along with a refreshing break from the modern world to a time so long ago, it seems totally unreal.

												It has been days since I last ate anything but a few handfuls of berries, I am starving. I escaped from slavery, my Njerpez captors far behind me. Lost in the wilderness with nothing but the clothes on my back and a knife, with which I have crafted a javelin, I am desperately searching for a village. My search brings me across an open marshland, a place where I spot wild sow tracks! I follow the tracks until I spot her, and I try to sneak closer. The injuries I sustained from my escape and not eating for a few days have weakend my skills, and the sow spots me - she squeals in fright and takes off! I give chase across the marshland until I see she has trapped herself in a spit of land surrounded by deeper water. I think about throwing my javelin at her, but don't want to risk losing it in the water if I miss, so I take position on the strip of land she must cross by to escape. She doesn't have much of a choice and tries to bolt past me. Using my javelin like a spear I thrust at her as she goes past, and it lands! The sow falls to the ground and I stab again and again as she tries to get away. My belly will be full tonight.That was my first game of Unreal World half a decade ago. If you need the latest graphics and a modern day interface, then you won't like this game. If you care that basically one man has made this game for over 25 years and will continue to do so, or how deep a game is, then give this a shot. This game is similar to games such as Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode or Catacylsm: DDA.			"

												I have been playing URW since 2001, version 2.60.  After 15 years it's awesome to finally see it come to the mainstream public attention, and I have nothing but praise for the game.At its core, it's your basic roguelike game: perma-death, turn-based, keyboard-heavy and with 2d pixel tiles instead of fancy graphics. Actually, it started out way back (it's in development since 1992) as a fairly standard fantasy game, but then slowly transformed into a realistic life simulator in the setting of iron age Finland.You will have to survive by crafting needed stuff, hunting/gathering/fishing/putting out traps and get food, wood and pelts to make items and/or to trade for things you can't craft like axes or pots, and get better armor and weapons to fight off wild beasts and nasty humans (they come in the form of either bloodthirsty Njerpez warriors that will only settle for your death, or simple robbers that will try to get your stuff either by talking or by bludgeoning you over the head). Also of course you'll get tired and need to sleep, eat, and drink.The game has a day-night cycle, full-on weather and seasons system: in summer the temperatures are bearable even without being covered head to toe in furs, berries and plants to eat are readily available, there's plenty of game to hunt and life is generally easier (you will get mauled by a bear nonetheless, don't worry)At the other end of the spectrum, winter is harsh: days are short and nights are long, it gets freezing cold and you WILL die from hypothermia so you have to build shelter, possibly an elaborate log cabin complete with fireplace, table and bed, make enough firewood to keep warm and get a decent source of food or a good plan for having enough in those long, boring months. Ice will cover the rivers and lakes so to fish you'll have to poke holes in it, and if you're not careful you can walk on thin ice that will break and drop you into freezing water. Also snow accumulates on the ground and unless you have skis, you won't be able to walk very long without getting incredibly tired so you better have everything you need not too far away. On the upside it also allows you to spot tracks much easier. Too bad there are few animals around in winter...I could speak about the game all day but this would become too long, so I'll just say one last thing, and it's the thing that impressed me most:This game is a labor of love. Over the many years I've been playing this, a LOT of things have changed, and always for the better. Just since last year or so, there's a totally new trading / reputation system with villages, most exploits have been squashed and replaced with sensible mechanics, you can command your pet dog and it's even more of a killing machine, new animal AI especially for predators that will actively hunt their prey (have sheeps in a pen? be careful of wolves!), addition of more birds and seals you can club, and the list goes on and on. It's a truly well supported game that is worth at least double what they're asking, so if you're interested in this kind of game and don't mind that it's keyboard-heavy and has 2d graphics, it is a MUST BUY.

Realise, longer range means harder to find the arrows.I love this game.			"

Both wounded, he started bleeding. Njeperz flees. Long chase through the woods, he runs I only walk to reduce fatigue, following his blood trail. When coming near him some arrows are fired at me, missing me luckily. Again brutal melee fight.  He flees again. This time I'm right behind him, stabbing my spear in his back. He loses consciousness and gets my spear to his neck. Got some fine equipment from him.Glad I rediscovered this gem (didn't play for a year or so, and before only the free version, feels good to support dev now)LOVE THIS GAME !(and fighting is only a very small part among all the things you can do)			"

												So I just want to relay the experience I have had in the game thusfar:So I have had this game for a few days, but up until recently haven't really tried playing it as it seems super complicated to control, so I wanted to watch some videos and what not.So today I played for a but and had a crazy experience. I have read that water is the first priorty so I went looking for some and found a frozen lake. Of course stupid me I walked out onto the lake and fell through! I got back to shore and my character was prone and freezing to death.So, I decided f*** it I cut a hole in the ice and had my drink. Then I spotted a fallen log so I crawled to it to make a fire, no luck, needed more timber. So I went to a tree and cut 11 pieces of branches off of it. It took me a while but I figured out how to pick it up. Crawled back to falled log, dropped the timber on it and tried several times to make a fire...finally success and I was able to warm right back up and get it.It seems trivival but really it was very exciting to figure out the controls and save myself from freezing to death! Keep in mind playing this on steam is the first time I have ever played this game. my character is still alive. Though he came very very very close to dying of dehydration. I found water, and I had to tear up some of my clothes to make cords but I have successfully made a stone axe, and also I have also successfully crafted a primative bow.Now I need feathers. I found a bird and hit it with a rock, which I believe wounded it but did not kill it, then I chased it down and threw my spear and missed, kept going after it and collected my spear. Got next to the bird, attacked and killed it, my first kill. I need to collect the feathers from the bird and clean it so I can cook it. How do I collect the feathers from the bird? (I think I can figure out cleaning and cooking it.)These are the types of experiences you will have with this game, it is complicated to control at first but the game has a lot of tutorials and also a helpful community, so if you are looking for a hardcore survival experience, look no further, you have found it, and even though I do believe you can get the game for free, I highly suggest buying it and supporting this developer, special games like this do not come around very often.

												UnReal World is a roguelike survival game set in Iron Age Finland.The first version of the game was released in 1992, making it an astonishing 24 years old.UnReal World uses a mix of time acceleration and turn based elements to simulate survival in the Finnish wilderness.Unlike many other games of the survival genre, UnReal World focuses on the player's struggle against the wild itself...(Take my words with a grain of salt, I'm involved as a community mod for the game)Few games have made me feel as much emotion as UnReal World has.The difficult of surviving makes it all the more satisfying when you end up surviving, and flourishing!The community is great, and is constantly thriving with new players and stories to tell.

												I have owned this game for a number of years now, and paid for a lifetime subscription to updates a while back. At first glance, the graphics may not grab you if you're used to the more flashier titles available today, but what Unreal World will do is show you what it really takes to survive in an unforgiving environment.Rolling up your character's stats and selecting a starting position can be very important, and the season you start in even more so (hint: don't start in winter unless you fancy a challenge). The controls can take a little getting used to (the game is mainly keyboard based) and it can be difficult to get into at first. You need the right tools for the job, so there's no point trying to fish with a knife, for example. You will need a javelin or a spear as a minimum.And as you begin to build your house, possibly expand your fishing operations with nets, grow crops, hunt and make traps for meat and furs, watch as your skills improve the more you use them, and start to prepare for the winter by making your own clothes or bartering for the things you need from nearby villages, you'll begin to really appreciate the progression you are starting to make.All in all, a great game which eschews graphics and sound for greater depth and what many games forget about nowadays: gameplay.

												Just activated it on Steam. So do not think I played only a couple of minutes. ; )Around 2010 I was in dire need of a more complex survival game because the Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode could not scratch that itch. I looked everywhere and could not find anything. Then I read about UnReal World, I downloaded it and played for a day. It was glorious. I froze to death, I drowned, died of hunger and walked into a cave.... I bought a lifetime license that evening.Now to the important parts... It is a  survival simulator, your biggest threat will be hunger and the elements. It has an in-depth wound system and temperature/clothing system. You can hunt, fish, farm, build houses and tents, go hunting people, trade with villages, milk animals. Pretty much do everything that is important to model a life in the wilds.  It has a broad selection of skills and stats, you can be a boy or a girl, you can even decide how you want to start. Inside a village for example, if you are a new player. Or if you want an even bigger challenge, try starting wounded in the wilds, with your father dead somewhere and the dangerous animal still around! If you always wanted to play a normal guy or girl in the woods, hunting boars with a spear or defending your turf from bad people, this is the game for you. Oh and if you want to live as a cannibal in the woods, burning down villages and eating people you killed while they were asleep...yeah, you can do that, too. TL;DR    URW is the Dwarf Fortress of survival games.			"

												I've played this game since before it was on Steam, and I've always found it fun to play. Now, however, I can leave a review!So, this game won't be for everyone. I can gush about it for hours, but it's important that you understand that if I like it, that doesn't have to mean you will. That's why I will start outlining the things that may make this game not fit for everyone.Cons:The graphics are simple and have little merit to them. They're merely there to make the game accessible. If you have a problem with simple graphics, this game is not for you.The controls are not very good. Once again, they're just there in order to be able to control the game, and to play this you'll have to remember or look up a bunch of key combinations. Luckily, you can do this in-game. This'll become muscle memory after a while, but if you're starting out it can be quite difficult.The game has no difficulty curve. There is one difficulty, and while you have the merit of starting out with some useful stuff and you can delay winter by starting early in the year, you're going to have to learn how to deal with the game's challenges. And this game can be hard, especially if you're not sure what to do.The game can be a grind. You have to focus on both the long term and the short term, which often means you'll have to do the same thing for weeks on end in an effort to reach some long term goal, and especially early on you'll be restricted when you're just beginning to make a living for yourself.Pros:This game has great depth. While it's certainly possible to understand the game mechanics, there are always things that will surprise you are possible. As an example, I once got knocked in the eye while climbing a tree, and I was astounded that my field of vision was actually decreased by this.The game world is huge. It's not endless, but there is plenty of room to do anything you wish.There are a lot of interesting skills, and they're not trivial to master. From weatherlore to timbercraft to tracking, there's plenty of skills to spend your time refining and reap the benefits from.There's a lot of things you can build and do. You could become a carpenter who sells their crafts for food, or a hunter, who is self-sustaining but has to travel a lot. Each option is interesting and provides you with a new style of play, needing to focus on different things to be successful.Realism. Harsh realism. This game is not forgiving, and a single mistake can lead to a series of events that ends with you dying alone in a pit surrounded by wolves. There are of course limits to this, but a few of the things you will need to keep an eye on during your travels are temperature, thirst, nutrition, carrying capacity, wounds, disposition with the locals, time of year, state of your clothes, and quality of your tools and items.In the end, there's just a lot you can do in this game, and it's great to see your plans come together as you slowly build up resources, self-sufficiency, and social contacts among the locals.The price of 10,99 is great, and the amount of content you'll get is certainly worth that price.This game sets out to place you, on your own, in a harsh, wild land in the ancient North, and it captures that feel well. You'll often be struggling to survive, cold, undernourished, or low on supplies, with no traces of civilization for miles around.This game is not for everyone, but if you've made it this far into the review and you're still considering buying it, this game certainly is for you.

												Unreal World is an incredible example of what Roguelikes can be. In solid, continuous development since 1992, URW has no end in sight, with Enormous Elk (developers Sami and Erkka) continuing their work in bringing Iron Age Totally-Not-Finland to life.URW is the epitome of survival games, yet predates the current craze by literally decades. It's realistic, it's tough, it's unforgiving, and extremely rewarding to play. There is a lot of depth and complexity to explore, and you can live your (probably short) life as a fisherman, hunter, trader, hermit, cannibal, raider... whatever strikes your fancy.Roguelike mechanics, charming tileset graphics, and harsh survival interweaved with a touch of mysticism and the spirit of nature (which is simulated in great detail, from plants to animals to weather and seasons). Playing URW is simultaneously zen, and at times stressful (when you fall from a tree and break all your limbs and freeze to death, or almost anything to do with bears). Highly recommended, and sold for a pittance. If you have doubts, check out the developers' website for the free version. If you find yourself enjoying the game, pitch in on Steam to support it years to come. This is a true labour of love, and with all things going well, will see years and years of improvements ahead.

												Don't let my low in game hours fool you, I've been playing this game long before it ever came to steam. This is without doubt the most in depth survival simulator there is. If you want a game that really makes you fight to stay alive then this is the one you're looking for. Starvation is a very real threat, along with temperature. On top of the survival aspects, there are also hostile npcs who will easily kill you unless you get hold of some good equipment. The game uses text to describe what is happening, and does so very very well, combat is espescially savage, with the wounds inflicted described in immense detail. The only game I can think of that compares to UnReal World in terms of depth and replayability is NetHack. Truthfully an excellent game and well worth the price.			"

												So, back in 2006 I bought this crappy sandboxy roguelike from a finnish indie developer for the outrageous sum of $49. After a week of having my characters die in days from tree falling, bear mauling, and poorly planned attacks on way better armed enemies, I upgraded my computer and for the life of me could never figure out how to get a link to another copy.Fast forward to 2016 and I found out that this game is still being developed (with way better graphics) AND a fully free version to try out.As far as the game:Brutal survival, a lucky hit from an enemy can down you and getting surrounded is an easy death. Every action is a risk/reward calculation.Good health modeling and healing is slooooooooow. My current character is a few weeks into his life after a day one fight with 5 slavers and the wounds aren't even half healed (he's lucky to be alive, though.)Being a turn based game, the wound penalties aren't bad gameplay wise. You get heavy percent based penalties to your actions, but the player isn't burdened with horribly slow walk/run animations or real time sleep due to frequent exhaustion.World building and seasons are fantastic.It still plays like a DOS roguelike with hotkey commands, but there is some mouse support that improves quality of life a bit.Best $60 I ever spent on a game.

												It is the most poetic and one the most violent games. Just like the nature it brilliantly attempts to describe.The game is built on anecdotes, but I will spare you mine and just suggest you experience your own. Blessed days! you may play the game freely without being charged first, from the developer's website[unrealworld.fi]. Thereafter, you won't help but feel the need to throw those coins the developers' way. And a smile.			"

												 So I bought this, it sounded cool. Survival, hunting, gathering, crafting, My kinda stuff. First time I played it I noted that the graphics are pretty old-school. Not a problem for me if its got some depth to it. Well this baby does. I quit the first try though, played maybe an hour. I didnt understand what I was doing, didnt know how anything worked. I forgot about it for awhile. Then sitting here bored one day I decided to try it again. The first real attempt I made was also pretty pitiful. I learned a few things. I think maybe I starved to death or just plain quit. Tried out different skills and races. Read the wiki. I've been playing it for almost a week straight now. Ive had some epic fails and learned how just about everything works. I'm still trying to survive my first winter. I've managed to survive summer through fall, when the cold comes though I have yet to be fully prepared to deal with it. The only thin I can say bad about it so far is the keyboard. I hate having to use the keyboard. You can click on most of the menus but to get into the menus requires hitting a hotkey. I just wish it had a better clickable UI. Either way Im looking forward to seeing how long I can manage to survive. If they keep updating and working on this game it will be epic and its already worth the money to me!			"

												Far from a game that is for everyone, UnReal World is a gritty and realistic game of death versus survival, with your actions and luck dictating the outcome. I have played this many times over the years, and the improvements have been great. It is rare that you will find a game that has had so much love and effort poured into it, which is why it has such depth.The only thing I recommend for new potential players is to try the free version available online. You should figure out quickly as to whether this game is for you. The game is definitely amazing, but fun is something only you can decide.On that note, buying it here exists only to support the developer and give it some recognition. You can after all go and donate directly to the developer if you would prefer (and get it free while you are at it...). I personally believe in supporting both developers and platforms of they support & access to games like this. My call obviously.To the brave few who will try: Onnea, sitä tarvitaan. (Good luck, you will need it.)			"

												(dont get irritated by my play time, i have been playing URW since long before it was on steam)Finally i can spend my time again in the far north, hunting Elk, drying their meat, tanning their skin to craft some warm winter clothes. I tried farming once, but in early summer an elk ravaged my fields and ate everything. The spirits seem to prefer me living a hunters life instead.The AI is especially remarkable with realistic animal behaviour. They roam through the land, depending on the season, the terrain, spirits' favour and chance. The world is much more complex and dynamic than in other survival games such as the Long Dark. There are loads and loads of plants. Dont know a mushroom because your herblore skill is too low? better dont eat it, you might get sick and die. Thank the spirits, there are also plants that help your body in a variaty of ways, some ease fever and help you getting rid of toxins. Or ease that flu you got after sleeping in the rain. Better know some. winter time? no plants for you then, except maybe some cloudberries that ripen extremely late in the year.coolest crafting system i know. Want to smoke your meat because you cant eat the whole elk before it spoils? Well, you need a smoking hut. fell some trees, big ones. Make logs from the trunks, build walls. split some trunks into boards, make a door. get smaller trees and boards for the roof. a window, if you are fancy. For each step you need an axe. while it is possible to fell trees with a flimsy stone-axe, you better have some nice big axe (different axes are ideal for different work) or this will take a while... collect a whole bunch of stones to build a stove. get firewood and smoke it up. dont forget some tying equipment to hang the meat from the roof (craftable from clothes or hides). And then the meat will taste terrible because your cooking skill is too low =) A Bear mauled you? well this game has the most complex system of injuries i have ever seen in a game. if he just broke some ribs, lucky you. Maybe your legs are total waste and you cant stand up. good luck hunting now, you better have some emergency food stache to last you until everything is healed. Got a nice warm bear fur coat? good for you, but without gloves you'll get frostbite on your hands in winter. Better make a fire and warm yourself up regularly. You met a raider with a cuirass and your weapon is rather flimsy? aim for the legs and run! more than a dozen different zones of your body can get injured with different effects an armor parts realistically cover different parts. Different materials protect differently against point (e.g. spear, arrows), blade(sword), impact (club, reindeer hooves) damage and cold. bleeding is seperately discounted for. better have a bandage or you will bleed out, good if you know the blood staunching prayer.awesome game and great support, too! for example there used to be a rare issue with the game not starting up on ubuntu. posted on the forum, the developer replied quickly and fixed it. The fix is coming in the next update and in the meantime he even provided beta access to the fix.The community has a forum, a wiki and lots of friendly, helpful people you can ask if you like spearfishing but keep starving or if you are wondering where to find herbs to help dresssing wounds. Or just go and explore the unrealWorld yourself!			"

												 I usually don't go in for this type of game. This market lost me to Wolfenstien 3D and wing commander fairly early on. Then several years ago, in a nastalgic period, I came across this game again. The dungeon themes were replaced with a more historic and reality based theme, It was far more fun than I remembered it being. Either something else came along or the dogs continuous barking made me stop playing again. When the game released v3.19, my now grown son said ""Hey I found this game that you're gonna love"". I laughed when he told me, he had childhood memories of it. Since Sami offers it up for free, I'll give it a go again. The dedication, helpfullness and great nature of the developer(s) of this game show not only in this new gem but in the community that rallies to support it. As for me, I became a lifetime supporter of this game within weeks of downloading v3.19 and try to send in a little something extra when I can. I hope steam allows many people to appreciate how compex, exciting and addicting this game is NOW!			"

												I'm not much of a writer, so I apologize for not being very eloquent.I've never written a steam review before, but I have enjoyed this game so much for so long before it came to steam, that I felt like I had to add to any positive press it was receiving here.  I've never seen a developer who worked closer with his community and with greater humility than Sami does.  This is a true labor of love that you'll also really enjoy playing.  It's built to be what we all want it to be, and I have no doubt that it will continue moving closer to a perfect version of itself going forward, as it has since I started playing it.  This is not a game that will stop seeing updates now that it's released.  If you play Unreal World and really dive into what it has to offer, you'll get to come along on a ride that lasts for years.I'm an RPG nerd, and I currently play in a tabletop game where my character has somehow survived many brushes with death in a harsh wilderness.  I built my character's background by remembering every death i've had in Unreal World as 'Another time I almost died'.  This game builds real stories that you remember and cherish when they have ended.I sincerely believe there isn't a more valuable 10 dollar purchase on Steam.			"

												I am a lifetime supporter and was provided a Steam key. I've played this more off Steam in the past. There really isn't any other game out there like this, it's the best survival simulator I've played. That being said, don't take my word for it, try it yourself! Download the game on their website first (which is free), give it a shot and see if it's really what you like. If you do like it as much as I do, give it a buy here on Steam and support the developer! The reason I suggest this is because one of the negative reviews does mention that they believed the game was very good on reviews alone, and they ended up not liking it. So please, give it a spin for free first, and if you like it, support the developer by buying it here on Steam! http://unrealworld.fi/urw_winmirror.html "

												Have you ever wondered what being a Finn was like before the invention of alcoholism, anime, severe depression and murdering Russians? Well now, through the magic of computer roleplaying, you can at last find out!This game is a pretty innovative blend of roguelike and survival simulator that dates back to several decades before the current survival game craze. The presentation and interface are true to that era, and so really shouldn't be a hindrance unless you're a millenial casual babby, in which case I congratulate you on managing to read this far without losing interest and playing with your smartphone, you little♥♥♥♥♥♥ The only area where this doesn't really hold is with certain repeated commands - putting down several fishing nets in succession involves a number of awkward key combinations, and the process of chopping down trees and hauling them to a location (which you WILL need to do if you want a house) will inevitably strain your fingers to the point where you will certainly come to sympathize with your likewise strained and fatigued character.Besides that, the graphics are charming and effective - the sprites stand out, look good and tell you what you need to know, and the menus are decorated with quaint images of Finnish cosplayers in their natural habitat.But enough about that nonsense! You want to hear about gameplay! The areas where this game really excels are its depth, realism and immersiveness. You begin play at a season of your choice, either in the wilderness or in a friendly, desolate or hostile settlement, depending on the starting scenario of your choice, equipped with either very little or nothing at all to help you weather the oncoming trials. From that point on, you have just one overarching goal: survive.This isn't nearly as easy as you might think - not because everything is trying to kill you (in fact, the opposite is more likely to be true), but rather because getting the necessities of life is hard. Hunting, for example, requires that you first find prey - which involves a great deal of fruitless wandering and scouring the land for tracks. You might follow a fresh and promising trail to the point where you're only a hair's breadth away from your quarry, only to have it suddenly go cold, prompting profound disappointment. If you do find prey, your problems only multiply, as you then have to make a decision - do you close the distance and risk spooking the game in order to get a better shot? Or take the one you have, and risk missing to the same effect?Managing risks and resources is in many ways the core of the gameplay. You have to choose not only how to conduct your activities, but which activities to embark on, as each have their associated risks and rewards. A hunt is likely to fail, can be dangerous, and is wont to leave you far from home and exhausted come night time. Fishing is safe, but consumes large amounts of your time and might return nothing at all, or an insufficient catch. There are no sure bets, however, and you'll inevitably have to go all in at some point. Sometimes you'll fail. That's just life.Likewise, every activity has its associated costs. Not necessarily in resources, but always in your character's time and energy. Building a house will give you a leg up, but chopping down trees and hewing logs is hard work that's sure to leave you with an appetite, and to make it worse, all that time you spent doing that was time you didn't spend acquiring food. Consequently, much of the earlier game is an exercise in building a big enough stockpile to be able to do more time-intensive work without worrying about what you'll eat tomorrow. This is difficult, as the most easily acquired foods (fish and meat) spoil rapidly without some means to preserve them, and even if you do get lucky enough to kill an elk early on, there's no way you can eat all the resultant meat all by yourself before it will spoil.Still, though, overcoming all of those challenges as they come at you brings on a sense of elation like little else in video games. Sure, half of it might just be dying in the cold and worrying about tomorrow's meals, and sure, the Njerpez will kill your favourite dog, and sure, you might acidentally give your pants away for a handful of peas, but everything becomes worth it when you can sit down and look with pride upon your big house, blooming fields and cellarful of dried meats. It's an extremely immersive game, equal parts harsh and rewarding, and frighteningly easy to get lost in. There's far less cannibalism involved than I remember from the last time I played it, but I would still highly recommend it if you're into deep and immersive sandbox RPGs.			"

												The game is about making good choices to survive. It is in an early iron age setting though you can choose to start needing to make a stone axe. Unlike flashy graphic games it has an easier to work with modding allowing you to insert objects you think a survivor could make without having to learn 3d graphics. The combat is far more realistic than many with it being quite dangerous so plan, equip and stalk not go in as a fantasy magic warrior. Healing is likewise based on more realistic needs of days to heal, impaired skills and the possibility of infections leading to death a week after the battle.First got the game years ago. At times I do play the other 3d games yet they never seem to have the inner core of survival any where as good as this one. It is a game you can play through then come back. The dollar vs playtime is extremely good. With the choice for 2d and easy modding there is already big changes to the game possible through the work of modders. I made my own to add a handful of things.I will also add if you are planning major real life trips this is much better to teach the mindset and needs than other games. Of course study from books and so forth but the investment of time and yields are far more realistic in this.In terms of the gaming industry this is one of the games showing that a cottage industry for game developers is possible. Literally. He lives in near-wilds of Finland and himself uses a bow, builds fires and so forth.For anthropology (study of human cultures) the basis on the early iron age Finland gives you a chance to see a presentation of another side of humanity. It does include a ritual magic system that I look on as a ""slow magic"" where you don't get fireballs or wizz-bangs but improvements like to increased chances of a trap working. Never quite sure if the ritual made the difference or if you just got lucky. Those rituals though often have a basis in the oral traditionds that did show skill, like the chant for fire building describes a good arrangement of the woods.			"

The camp has pretty much everything I need except water so I take off looking for water. I must have been wandering snowblind and dehydrated because when I snap out of my stupor I'm standing in the middle of a frozen lake. I learn this just in time to fall through the ice. I am finally able to get out of the water and back on to the ice, so I then start crawling for the shore. I get to the shore and I realize ""hey, I can make a hole in the ice and drink the water"". As I am raising my axe to punch the hole, some tribesman I do not know walks up and politely informs me that I will donate all my stuff to him. I tell him to go to hell and as bad as I just wanted a drink of that cool water, I turn the axe on the interloper who then whistles for his friend (up to this point I though that his use of the words ""us"" and ""we"" was just an eccentricity...like the royal ""We""). With an axe in one hand and a knife in the other I am getting the better of this upstart worm of a thief, but I can see his friend has come out of the treeline with a huge - what I can only describe as a ""pole"". I guess it was supposed to be a staff but no normal man would wield this giant piece of wood as a staff. I get back to the business at hand and I have finally killed the thief who started this whole affair.  When I look up again the other thief has closed the distance and brains me with this monstrous tree that he has carried with him. I black out.The next thing I know, I am waking up in an unfamiliar part of the forest (sans axe and knife) and twice as thirsty as before. I crawl for what seems like days when I see a village...

												Where do I start? UnReal World has been around and in active development a long time. The very first version was in 1992, which was vastly different from the game we have now. I personally have owned it for 10 years now, and in that time it has just kept getting better and better. I can't even begin to guess how many thousands of hours I've played this game over the years. I come back after every major update to find fresh new features to explore, with the basic meat of the game just as fun as I have always found it.It's an amazing iron age survival simulation, the best I have played.You create a character, choosing a tribe - each with their own genetics (affects attributes, height, build), knowledge (skills, auto-identification of certain plants, which rituals you might start with), and starting gear. Then you can select from a variety of starts to get things rolling - like being an escaping slave (good luck getting away from the camp full of your former masters) or an unfortunate hunting trip (will you kill the animal that killed your father, or flee?). You also pick which season to start in - each with their own challenges. From there you can either do the basic missions, which are there to get you acquainted with the game and give you attainable early goals; do the advanced missions, which are a bit more difficult and require more time; or just strike off and do your own thing.Like any good survival game, you need to provide the basics for your character. You'll need a steady source of food - from hunting, fishing, trapping, foraging, farming, or trading. Just make sure you don't misidentify that mushroom and eat a poisoned one, and don't fall in your own trap pit - especially if you filled it with spikes. You will also need shelter. Options here are a very basic lean to made from spruce branches, a kota (Finnish tent) made from hides that you can pack up and move with you, or a permanent log cabin. Having a smoke house with a fireplace comes in handy for smoking meat, which is one of the easiest ways to preserve your meat. Cellars are also handy to keep your food fresher longer. Need some help building your cabin? Hire a woodsman to cut some trees down for you, some good food may be all he wants.And warm clothes are a must for when the temperature drops, so don't forget to skin that stag and tan its fur for a nice warm set of clothes. Or just for trading, a good fur is valuable. Maybe you'll use it to buy a dog to come along as your companion, helping to keep you safe from robbers and dangerous animals - just don't forget to feed it. The hunting in this game is challenging and fun. Most animals are faster than you, but you have more endurance and you can sneak. Hounding an elk and running it down until it tires out is possible if your character's speed and endurance are decent, as long as you can track it well enough through the woods as it flees to keep on it. Especially if you manage to put an arrow or javelin in it when you first spot it, as a wounded animal runs slower. If you don't have luck actively hunting, you can set traps. From small loop snares all the way up to large lever traps and spiked trap pits, you can set a trap for whatever animal you're trying to hunt. Don't forget to bait them with meat if you're after carnivores. If hunting isn't your style, you can fish. Fishing rods, clubs, or spears round out the active fishing options. Or get yourself a punt or raft and some nets for passive fishing. Or be a farmer and supplement your diet with a variety of grown crops - peas, turnips, rye, beans, hemp, and more.Or you could go straight up vegetarian, eating berries and bread and porridge and farmed vegetables. Just don't expect a vegetarian life to be easy in Iron Age Finland - meat and fish are the best sources of protein around. A balanced diet is easier to manage.The animal AI in the game makes for some fun scenarios. Here is an example of a hunt I had recently:I saw an Elk in the distance from the mountain near where I was building my homestead, and decide it's time to stock up on meat before the weather gets too hot for drying (started in Spring, still early enough).I go hunting for it, and put an arrow in it when I find it - giving it a bleeding wound in the thorax. It runs and I begin the chase, relying on my good tracking skill and endurance to make up for its speed advantage. Soon I notice new tracks intermingled with the Elk. Bear tracks! I continue following the Elk, and the Bear tracks are right there with it all the way.After a while of tracking I finally find my prey, still carrying my arrow... on the ground partially eaten! Bear tracks lead away to the west. As I already have plenty of meat right in front of me, I left my fellow hunter to his own devices and skinned and butchered the gift he left for me instead of going off after him. It's little details like this that make this game amazing.			"

												I have been playing this game since 2010 and it keeps getting better and better. There are frequent updates that keep the game freshs and fun. No matter what I do, I can never find another game that scratches all the itches Unreal world does. There are just no survival games out there like it. It is raw and real and when you get your neck slashed by a bear because you thought you could take it down by yourself you will know what I mean..			"

												Are you ready to lose entire days of your life preparing for a late iron age Finland winter?  If so, this is the game for you.  An incredibly rich world full of danger and also opportunity awaits.   You can do whatever you'd like as long as you can survive.Just an amazing game that deserves more publicity.  In an alternate universe this game is more popular than Minecraft.  The intitial few hours can seem overwhelming but thanks to a great online community and built in tutorials you'll soon master the basics -- at that point, your future is up to you.  Just stay fed and warm.  And don't mess with bears, usually.			"

												This is such a great game. I've clocked hundreds of hours in it before it was on steam. It's the king of survival games. If all the Day Z and Minecraft clones don't scratch that itch, this will for sure.Bonus cool stuff I've found/done: 1. Named my character Käärme (Snake in Finnish) because I just finished MGS5. I fell while climbing a tree and bruised my eye. I had to wear an eyepatch while it was healing. I became Big Boss in the Unreal World! Also found out that wearing a bandage on your eye makes you have less vision on the side with the injured eye. 2. Found mushrooms growing near my shelter which will allow me to ""journey into the spirit realm"".			"

												Summary - the best survival simulator, and without zombies!Pros:1. Amazing depth - food can give you food poisoning, wounds can kill you slowly if not treated properly, you can freeze, and the bear can kill you with one hit. It is as unforgiving as it is deep.2. Really immersive - I love the setting, with all those lovely forests and lakes, wise sages, a touch of magic, and never knowing what might hide behind the corner and kill you, if you're careless.3. Crafting - you can craft many items, build your own home, and given how long it takes, it really feels like a reward.4. Great developers who keep adding new things and make the game even greater. 5. Very detailed system of clothing and how it shields you not only from the enemy, but also from cold. 6. Hunting is really challenging and rewarding.7. Trapping is fun.8. Mushrooms that can kill you slowly. Seriously. This game is that unforgiving. Cons:1. Interaction with NPCs is not great.2. You can't have a family yet.			"

												I bought URW on a floppy disk like 15 years ago and really loved it. Now I bought it again.First game in five years:I start as a Kaumolainen, I have a dog, I name the dog - ""Musti"", I find a village, I get some arrows and a bow, I go out in the woods to hunt, I see a lone Njerpez warrior, I sneak close to him, shoot him with my bow - miss, shoot him again - miss, he rushes at me, Musti attacks him, he stabs Musti, i wield a knife and try to stab him - I fumble and drop my knife, he stabs me a couple of times and I lose my consciousness..... I wake up - amazed I'm still alive, I'm bleeding badly, and i leave a trail of blood when i try to walk, I stop the bleeding and pick up my knife, I look at Musti - Musti has bled to death - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ killed my dog, I follow the Njerpez warrior's tracks and find him sleeping under a tree, I shoot an arrow at him - hit, he rushes me, shoot again - hit, I take the knife and stab him, he falls down. I stomp and stab him untill he stops moving... He's dead, loot sweet loot. I go back to Musti and butcher him for meat - Musti tastes bittersweet. I go back to the village to lick my wounds and eat roasted Musti for a couple of days. I'm running out of Musti meat, I go back to the woods to find something to hunt, I find a stag, i shoot an arrow at it - hit, it escapes, i start following it's tracks and find it again, shoot again - hit, keep following, shoot - hit, it's slowing down, rush it, I hit the stag with a knife, it falls down, I kick it and stab it, it dies and I skin and butcher it, I go back to the village and trade stag meat for more arrows. Hmmm I better build a sauna. 5/5			"

												Warning. This is a game that has been in development since the 1990's. Its graphic appearance and mechanics also draw their lineage to this hazy age of nostalgia, gameplay experimentation and one-man development operations.Now that this warning is out of the way, listen closely. UnReal World is as close as you can get to a realistic depiction of a sparsely populated iron age sandbox game. You will grow hungry as your fishing nets stay empty, game eludes your arrows and spears and trap fences stay empty. You will become desperate in your pleas for the forest spirits so they'd take pity on your starving and cold form that struggles to hang onto life in the cold forest. You will curse that handaxe you lost in the mire and think of the piles of as direly needed equipment you'll have to give away, so the village tradesman will grant you a new axe. This game is a roguelike, but you'll only find cold and dark in the pitiful caves in this game. It will punish you, until you learn how to play it. Then, when you sauna is lit, the walls are filled with drying meat, the fur and leather piles grow in your hut and the cellar is full of potatoes and salt, you will sit back and enjoy rewards of your hard-learned and earned labours, some pissy Njerpez will stumble on your farm and score a lucky hit on your forehead with an axe he probably found where you lost it, sending your head and save game flying into the horizon.Such is life, as the Finnish proverb goes. Enough life-like that it was used as educational tool in 1999.			"

												I found UnReal world a few years ago while browsing Home of the Underdogs, a website highlighting all but totally overlooked games. I saw this gem there and read the discription about how it was an Iron Age Simulation of Finnland. I thought to myself, ""Okay I love survival simulation games, and it seems to be rougelike which I also enjoy, and the reviews say it's pretty hard and complex, let's give it a go!""First, the controls take some getting used to.  Also if graphics are a deal breaker for you then don't bother. I however find the elegant simplicity of the game charming and it allows for the imagination to really immerse yourself in the world the developers are trying to create.The developers are both amazingly awesome individuals and I highly recommend checking out their webiste and blog.I'll share with you my first experience of this game.                                                                           ~~~After making some javelines, getting a basecamps set up and being largely unsuccesful at gaining much food I found myself slowly starving to death with very poor nutrition. I had tried climbing up nearby trees to see if I could spot game anywhere near my vicenity with largly no luck, and then I slipped on one of the branches and banged my head.  It wasn't life threatening but it shook me up enough to not try climbing again, as wounds take a fairly realistic number of in game days to heal.Suddenly while walking back to my camp as the sun was setting, I spy a caraboo herd.  Not only that it looks like they were looking for a place to bed down for the night!Perfect!  I can just follow them, and then sneak in close and try to kill one of the caraboo before I die myself!As they lay sleeping I edged closer, javilen in hand with a tip hardened by the fire I created with the local spruce trees. My target in sight I steady my javilin.Throw and a hit!  The whole herd wakes up!  It's chaos!  The caraboo I hit was only injured in it's hind leg but it was bleeding so by following the blood and it's tracks it was fairly easy to keep up! It looks like I was saved!Hours pass and it's now night.  The caraboo stopped bleeding and I can only hope that the tracks that I'm currently following belong to the caraboo that I did indeed injure.One full day passes and into the night again.  I make a stop by a stream for water and try to hit a nearby squirrel with my javilen in a tree.  I miss and it taunts me, jeering and chittering at me as my head throbs and my stomach grows ever more empty while I retreive my javilen from its resting place in a tree trunk.I continue following the trail one more full day.  My health is low and I can barely keep the tracks focused.  Suddenly I hear a grunt of a caraboo.This is it!  I'll finally get that animal! I start to sneak.  I creep closer, and closer, I see the animal and it's injured.  It's the same one!  The gods smile on me!One, step. Two step, three step.  TWIGSNAP!The caraboo's head jerks up! I hold my breath hoping it doesn't see me.Two heartbeats pass and the caraboo bolts!  I must have been upwind!My heart sinks.My javilen loose in my hand as I stare at the ground where I""m likely to die.  This place isn't so bad.  It's got a nice breeze, fir trees, a stream...Wait a minute... it's got a stream!I take off running in the direction the caraboo bolted!Sqeezing past ancient firs and by long forgotten boulders I run!  My last ounces of strength leaving me with each step!I'm able to catch up with the caraboo as it's calmed down and then run at it full speed with the wind at my back!I may not be faster than this animal.  But I'm smarter.  I am a human.  I'm one of the people.Expectedly the caraboo bolts!  It's more tired than me and injured worse.My plan is working.  It's headed straight for the stream!Once it gets to the banks of the water it dives in trying to evade it's persuer.  I walk up to the bank as the fatigued animal vainly tries to splash around in the water using the last of it's energy.  I then take my aim gripping my javilen with all my might and throw aiming for the neck of the magestic beast!A hit! Hot blood pours into the water around the caraboo.  It staggers back onto shore, falters, and falls.  It's breathing labored I stand over it.  This animal who is no different than me, whom I have tracked for three days lies at my feet.  The same place I would be had I not caught it.  There is no good or evil here.  There is just life.Later after a fire is made, roasted caraboo in my belly, and a hide tanning on a nearby fallen log.  I pack the remaining several dozen pounds of roasted meat into my pack.  There was a village not a few days from here that would be willing to trade some useful supplies for this meat.  There my journey will continue.  For I am one of the people. "

												I don't always review games I play on Steam, but when I do it's something I've consistently enjoyed and kept coming back to for more than a decade.URW is a survival roguelike set in fictional iron age Finland. The emphasis is strongly on realism, with a few light magical elements in the form of rituals and animism. The pace is slow, and unless you get ambushed by the occasional roving bandit or the game's faux-Novgorodian Njerpez warriors, fighting can generally be avoided. Trouble is easy enough to find if you go expressly looking for it, but combat can be brutal and strong armor and weapons are not easy to come by. Death is permanent, as tends to be the genre standard, and the world is not persistent. There's nothing permanent to unlock across playthroughs either, so unless you're cool with manual ""save scumming"" it's straight back to square one when you kick the bucket.Technically the game ticks a lot of the usual roguelike check boxes. There are quite a few keystrokes and commands to learn for various actions, as well as menus and stat screens to master. Graphics are a mix of simple but decent-looking pixel art and photos, and apart from small objects (such as arrows from missed shots) sometimes being difficult to spot in the middle of a thicket, they get the job done. The soundscape consists mainly of birds chirping, wind rustling through the trees, water splashing and other wilderness ambience.In summary, if you enjoy epic questlines, clear objectives and lots of mysteries to discover, URW might not be for you, but if roguelikes are close to your heart and you're ready for a more down-to-earth survival experience, you should give it a whirl. If you're unsure, you can even download an older version for free from the game's website (http://www.unrealworld.fi/).			"

												Don't let the graphics and outdated controls set you off. The creators of this game reached the epitome of wilderness survival.You are allowed to start off as a member of several northern european tribes, excluding the raiders that are situated far to the east. From there, you are pick one of a dozen or so scenarios to start from, ranging from starting in a half-built house with tons of lumber and building supplies, to waking up on the ground injured, hungry, with only your knife to help you.From there, you can do whatever you want. You can live as a hermit, fishing and trapping game and crafting supplies. You can be a wanderer and travel between the numerous villages on the continent, where you can buy skins, food, supplies, tools, or even livestock and dogs. You can spend days at a time tracking and hunting animals, hoping that you'll manage to get a new pelt by the end of the day.I have never felt more free in a survival game. There is no lack of things to do, and due to its difficulty, you are always working, trying to get enough firewood for the winter, or getting enough pelts to make that new overcoat after you had to turn the last one into bandages.The game runs entirely on keyboard commands, which can take several hours to get used to, but once you get through that, you are bound to have a gritty, stressful, frozen, and wonderful time in the far north.

												I bought URW on Steam just to support it (Like I did with NeoScavenger, another awesome game) - Ive actually been playing it for years, probably have 80+ hours in it. Its a complicated Roguelike/simulation set in a pseudo prehistoric North Europe. The learning curve can be kind of steep as its very much a traditional keyboard Roguelike with a LOT of different commands, but once you get the hang of it - oh my god. You see, it really is open world and open ended, a Roguelike sandbox. Build stuff, slaughter, start wars with entire towns (and try and survive), set random goals, do quests, randomly wander about and explore. Pretty much whatever. Its one of those games where if you expect the game to lead you from objective to objective youre going to be sorely disappointed - its for people who love immersing themselves in imagination and setting their own goals. They will love this one.I'm wondering if the devs planning on fleshing it out a bit now thats its released here?			"

												I've been following this game for the past 5 years. It is the best survival game out there, and does a great job of keeping the game playable while still trying to follow realism.One of my favorite experiences is starting at the tail end of winter, freezing temperatures and all. And spending the first few days of my adventure suffering terribly because my character started without any caps or gloves. I had a nice big fur coat, leggings, and shirt, but my hands and ears were going fall off from frostbite eventually because they were still exposed.But then. I figured out that I can actually take scraps out of my current clothing to make something new. So I took chunks from my cloak to make a hood and fur mittens, which saved me from the weather.Being able to dynamically take something you started with and then improvising to survive in hellish conditions felt surreal. Whereas in other games once you crafted something, you were stuck with it forever and could not use it for anything but its sole purpose.			"

												Lying in bed with my girlfriend, she was watching TV, I was chasing a stag with my dog and shortbow. She mocked the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, and kept asking if I caught the stag yet. After a 45 minute chase through thick woods, I finally landed the killing blow. She cheered, and I could finally put the game down.I love the hunting in this game, the animals are surprisingly realistic and hard to kill, but killing a big animal gives you a realistically huge amount of food. All around, the game is a lot of fun and challenging.			"

I've been following this game for years and I can tell you three things about it you need to know.First, the developers are great guys: super friendly, polite, attentive and eager to interact with the players.Second, there have been constant improvements. The update cycle is a bit long compared to the industry, but they never give up, they never declare ""It's done"" and move on to something else. Expect a major update that adds something big about once a year, minor updates a little more often, and a burst of hotfixes at every major interval to squash bugs.Last, and most importantly, the simulation is realistic. It isn't watered down with artificial difficulty like swarms of monsters at night or gamey magic potions that fix all your boo-boos. So what is Unreal World?Unreal world is roguelike survival simulation in a procedural world inspired by iron age Finland. Your primary goal in the game is to survive as long as you can. Sort of imagine if Don't Starve had a love child with Robinson's Requiem.It uses a skill based system, with improvement by use. Equipment is varied by both type and quality. Armor and clothing is by location with overlap across more than a dozen body locations. The seasons are fully realized with weather, effects on plants and wildlife and hazards such as heat exhaustion or frostbite. The health system is detailed; tracking individual injuries, pain and infection all with realistic treatment options. Wounds take time to heal and affect your fuctioning.It includes multiple survival strategies to utilize, each modeled to reflect the actual nature of that activity. Hunting, for instance, involves lots of tracking followed by frantic quick shots and pursuit of prey. It's easy to lose your quarry but a successful kill will keep you fed for a long while. Trapping involves a lot of work up front but gives sporadic gains. Farming is a nearly guaranteed result assuming you can live until harvest.You can hunt, fish, farm, trap, raid or trade with villages, raft down rivers or across lakes, capture or buy and then raise animals, build shelters and cabins, fence in areas, gather seasonal plants mushrooms and medicinal herbs, fight with a variety of weapons, craft or trade for and wear a variety of tools clothing and armor.The game is mod friendly. I had the good fortune to be one of the first modders (I added ironworking and clothmaking). Want to change your starting skills? You can mod it. You can alter the item recipes or even add ones the developer didn't include. Heck, you can even add in new plants and mushrooms!If you like roguelikes or survival games, this is a 'must try'. "

												If Dwarf Fortress interested you but your bounced off the complexity and the learning curve of that game then this game might interest you. There is a free version the creators website, but it is an older version. The latest version on steam has a revamped graphics and new features. The new graphical upgrade does look better. You can zoom out and see much further or zoom in close to your character. This game may not have eye candy graphics but its gameplay pulls you in. Its a survivalist game where the details can kill you. You have to think about what you are going to do next, based on your characters condition and the environment, how much food you have, fatigue and sleep etc. Merely eating any food wont in the long run do you any good if you stick to fish for example because your nutrition will suffer, which means you get fatigued faster. You can trap, track and hunt game. But its not easy, often they get away, but some game are easier to catch than others like squirrels for example. One time i was nearly straving and came back to my camp before it got dark and discovered one of my small deadfall traps had my dinner. There are aspects of the game i havent delved into yet, such as owning a dog which can help out with hunting. The game is turn based, but you can still get into trouble with burning your food if you go off and do a long consuming task or sleep, or you can have your food spoil if you do not eat it in a reasonable time or preserve it. There are NPC in the game whom you can trade with to get better quality gear which makes doing tasks much faster eg. chopping down trees with an iron axe instead of a stone axe. There is many skills you can invest into and level up. Some other features in the pipeline sound interesting, such as being able to marry and have offsrping which when your character dies you can resume as one of your offspring.  This game has more potential to come in the future. The game does lack music and sfx, there is some but could be more. But that really isnt important with the depth this game has under the hood.			"

												This game is easily among the top ten games I ever played, and definitely one I come back to the most. Behind it's simple graphics hides a very efficient destroyer of free time, but in return it sends you on a journey of human life at it's most basic form. Gone are the tools of modern life, and you have to survive in a world where you are just as likely of finding your prey as your predator. Could you really live in this UnReal World?			"

												Having been a lifetime supporter and playing this game for what feels like more than forever before it's Steam release, I can tell you with out a doubt that this is the best survival simulation game on the market today pound for pound (so to speak).I have spent possibiliy more hours playing this game than any other game I have ever owned, and the progress the game has had from it's early days is amazing.  Add in the fact that the devs treat this game like a dev should, that is to say with absolute love and care, and you've got something that's one of a kind.It will take a lot of effort to get use to the control scheme, but most really good games from a pure gameplay stand point are that way.  I can not recommend this game enough.  What's more, if you can't afford to play it on steam, feel free to check out the dev's site and get the entire game for free.  Then, once you've realized how amazing this game is, throw them some money for their effort (or come back and buy it here so you don't have to bother with updating your game yourself.) "

												I was a bit sceptical when I bought Unreal World considering the graphics and since I had never even heard of the game before but the sceptisicm was replaced by awe and wonder how I had never heard of the game before. It's brilliant, realistic and the longest still supported game in history. The graphics is probably one thing that hold people back from buying it. But don't let the simple graphics fool you. Underneath it's a very advanced simulator and you quickly forget about it and you might even think the graphics are good after a while.The sound is what's happening in the game world, you hear an owl? There is an owl close by which you can hunt. You hear a wolf? Make sure your sheep is brought inside for the night or you could wake up by the sound of grawls and bleats. No music that disturb the sounds of wilderness.The gameplay is what you make of it, you could be a trapper, hunter, a fisherman  or a farmer and build your own settlement and much of the gameplay is ordinary chores of the day. You need to cook your food, check your traps, fish and so on. To build a house takes a fair amount of time and is nothing you simply errect over a day. I can't recommend this title enough for people that enjoy a true survivalist simulator.			"

												This game is the most interesting thing ive played since my slovak cousins showed me HOMM3 as a kid. And its the most fun ive had since dwarf fortress. The way the game works in ""runs"" where you choose your goals and what you want to do (Similar to grand strategy or Mount and blade) Is extremely appealing, especially since the sheer amount of things you can do is amazing.Playing this also gets you geared up to go /out/, the same way EU4 gets you geared up to read books about what the colored blobs mean. I would reccomend this 100%			"

												After playing it for free a while ago, I was sure I would buy this game whenever the occasion will occur. And there it was, Winter Sale. I could still play it for free, but the enormous work that devs put into this title deserve to be bought, in other words, I bought it to say ""this game is so great I would love to give you my money for my time spent on playing it"".Each time I start the game I suddenly fall into this world and I'm gone. Few weeks or months in-game passes so quickly I cannot see the real time going on. 8 hours passed like in few minutes, that's incredible. Magical *_*There is something in these retro graphics - the simplicity. A possibility to imagine. I could not believe I would spend so much time playing game like this, but here I am - and now I will track my time on Steam Library to notice how my life is disappearing in UnReal World.Keep up the good work.Seriously, try this game people.

												For those briefly reading this review, if you like hardcore survival games, GET THIS ASAP.Now for the long and drawn out, probably needless, babble. *inhales deeply* Ever since I was a little boy I liked the idea of living in the wilderness. I live in a country town surrounded by Australian bushland and so my imagination was sparked very early on. To cut a long story short after getting a small taste of survival gaming with minecraft and watching probably too much Bear Grylls to be healthy I started looking formore hardcore experiences that would get me closer to living my dream.  So one fateful day I stumble upon this masterpeice of a game. I fell in love with the hardships I faced and the small victories I could claw from the grasp of mother nature. But I admit I got frustrated when I got so far and lost it all due to a silly mistake, then I learned the incredible art of BACKUP SAVES! So now this game is by far my favourite survival game and most certainly one of my top 10 favourites of all time.			"

												Played this for several years now off and on. Not really going to bother with a full blown review, but I'll simply add that the stories you will have to tell from playing this will be amazing. The immersion factor is intense. So many times I would tell a friend about something that happened, he would be all interested and then finally I showed him a screenshot and he was totally confused on how a top down 2D game based on grid movement could ever be this detailed. Something you just have to experience for yourself before you truly understand. If you are already into roguelikes then it is a no brainer. If not, this is a great game to test your curiousity on. You can even play it for free if you aren't sure about buying yet, just go on over to <www.unrealworld.fi>. Try it out, you are sure to love it, but if not, you have nothing to lose!			"

												If you're into hardcore rougelikes, survival games and sandbox environments, this is a fantastic game for you. It's charming graphics, compliments it's serious depth and the game will have you returning to play it day after day, month after month.The dev is passionate about the game and keeps things transparent as possible. It is a one of a kind game.A tiny bit of advice from this player, is that you should NEVER give up, not matter how hopeless! So you've been ravaged by a bear you were hunting, you're starving, it's the middle of winter and you're getting frosbite all over. You collapse, and continue crawling on, for your hunger and wounds make you weak and slow. Suddenly as if the Gods have spared your life, you come across a village, the village houses you and gives you food. You slowly recover, track down that bear that savaged you and seek your revenge. If you can make it passed Winter the first time you play, I will take my hat off to you.A very nice game, that I've owned since before steam. A++ 10/10 would recommend again.			"

For beginners, there is a steep learning curve, but will eventually reward you with one of the most immersive adventure game ever made. This one was far ahead of its time and definitely worth playing. It's constantly being updated with features that seem so integrated with the system that it feels so natural.			"

SummaryIt is a realistic survival simulator. It is a rogue-like. Starting from sticks & stones, build and trade whatever you need to survive the unforgiving Northern Europe. There are no classes, levels, hitpoints... just you, your survival skills, knowledge and pure nature as far as eye can see, and quite a bit more after that.Gameplay Highlights  It is turn based, it is played by mostly keyboard, but some actions are simplified with a mouse.  You can choose tribes for various initial bonusses to skills, and starting items, then use skills to train and develop them.  There are no limitations based on skills or item quality (although tasks require specific types of items). The end result, and how long it takes to get there varies by skills and item quality.  Damage modelled as wounds inflicted on specific body parts, and blood loss.   Hunger and thirst are fairly realistic, in fact this game has the most realistic hunger and thirst simulation I've ever seen.  Objects and actions behave as expected. Recipes make sense. There are no mysterious crafting recipes like ""wood + rock = hand gun""  The game is difficult. It will take a while to survive beyond the first week, it may even take a few tries to get to that point. Oh, and there are no guard rails. You can die within the first day.  Some items, including some common items, cannot be crafted, and must be traded for. This may initially be irritating. Have you played roguelikes with keyboard before? Are tired of classic RPG elements like hit points and levelling and classes? Are you looking for a wilderness survival simulation? 3 Yes= Buy this game. 1-2 Yes = Download the free version from http://www.unrealworld.fi, see if you like it. If you do, consider buying it here to support the development.  3 No = Probably not for you, but who am I to say?			"

YouTube™ Video: UnReal World on Steam - 2nd Try Ends in Bloodshed & Revenge! Recorded Livestream! 

			Views: 671		

			Enjoy my recorded livestream of this 24 year in the making Wilderness Survival Game! This was my 2nd livestream experience, still learning this deep and expansive survival game!		

Wow!  if you are looking for a deep, engaging, procedural survival game that will offer you a complete sandbox and tons of game choices, options, and endless possible games (no two games will be the same, guaranteed)... then LOOK NO FURTHER.  This game is vast.  This game is mind-boggling at all of its choices, options, and different scenarios.Truly amazing.  This score might change as I play the game more, and ain't such a darn 'noob' at all its vast possibilties...  But after 2 hours... I think I can give this game a pretty accurate first impressions score based on my own scoring system...VALUE:  40 out of 40  -  Yes you can play it for free on the games website, but why not get the best and most up-to-date version of this game, and help support the developer who has made this masterfully done game and been working on it since 1992!  Value is through the roof even at the regular price of $10.99 USD.  No brainer, max value here people.FUN:  26 out of 30  -  This part of the game is the part that will likely vary the most and be more subjective depending on who you are and what kind of games personally enjoy.  But to me, this game offers a very rich and deep game, the kind of game that can only be accessed by using the power of your imagination to truly immerse you in its world.CONTROLS & BUGS: 20 out of 20 - The controls are many in this game, and the UI (user interface) takes a bit of learning, but there is plenty of in-game help and features to help you learn.  Beautifully done with more options that you can throw a stick at! GRAPHICS & SOUND: 6 out of 10 - This is going to be the lowest score for this game and again, it's a bit subjective.  I'm giving this game a ""6"" based on the TYPE of game it is, and thinking its very clear what is a rock, what is water, what is a tree, etc.  Other people may give this game a 1 or a 2 score here out of 10, but again, this is a different type of game and in my opinion needs to be scored as the type of game it is, so it gets a 6 out of 10 from me.-------------------------------------------------MY TOTAL LAUNCH DAY ON STEAM FIRST IMPRESSIONS (2 HOURS) SCORE:  92%Easily a MUST BUY for any person who likes good RPG games like this and isn't concerned about not having 3D next gen graphics to enjoy it!  Fantastic job to the developer!			"

												I've played the non-steam version for years - there is perhaps no game quite as immersive as UnrealWorld. Explore a vast iron-age Finland, hunt or trap, fish or farm. Engage in robbery, get brutally robbed by roaming gangs. Buy a cow to carry your equipment, smoke the meat when it dies. Start keeping hunting dogs to chase your game to exhaustion - or keep them leashed only to unleash them on unsuspecting robbers. In the east, an even greater challenge - masses of hostile tribesmen, well-equipped red-shirted steppe folks seeking to enslave anyone they capture. Sneak onto their encampments in the dead of winter, silent as death. Skin them, and wear their hides as clothing. But perhaps, start with not starving. I'm getting ahead of myself.			"

												Hands down one of the best roguelikes I've ever played. Played the free version on and off in the past before buying it on Steam to show my modest support and appreciation for the Devs.Being developed and consistently updated for over 20 years, Unreal World is set in a world resembling ancient Finland in the Iron Age. The gameplay has a ton of freedom and depth, and the setting is rich in its historical atmosphere and lore. There are many ways to play, you could be a farmer, hunter, a gatherer, a fisherman, a adventurer or trader as you find your path in this harsh, gritty world. There are no set rules, you decide where to go and what to do. Despite the simple graphics the gameplay is very realistic. It takes creativity and experience to accomplish some of the harder tasks like hunting. You really feel like you're part of the world as you make your way through the four seasons every year.The game has its roots as a ASCII-based roguelike. If you've never played one of those before it might seem daunting to learn the controls, since for these games there're a lot of commands, akin to playing a flight simulator on the keyboard. It honestly isn't too hard to learn, and the in-game help browser and beginner game course is actually very helpful. If you don't mind learning the controls or if you're already a roguelike enthusiast like me, I highly recommend giving it a try. "

												This is a one of the best all time survival, hunting, fishing, building, fighting, exploring, bartering, crafting, pretty much everything sims. Don't let the hours here fool you, I've put hundreds (maybe thousands) of hours into this game long before it got onto Steam. The game is fantastically replayable, which is good as you will be replaying it a lot when your characters die, over and over. I would not describe the game as brutal, since there are some starting scenarios that actually set you up quite well if you just want to get to a point where you're stable and can focus on building a house, crafting, and trading. But the game IS unforgiving. No matter how well equipped you are, you'll need to think twice about taking on a Njerpez warrior (even alone) or going after that bear you see across the marsh. One missed swing or shot by you and one solid hit from your opponent (especially if that opponent is a bear) can end you all at once. Or maybe just give you a little scratch that you can tend to while you're sorting through loot or tanning a bear hide to make yourself a nice winter coat. That unpredictability that faces all violent interactions within the game can put some players off, but is a huge draw to others like myself. And if you're looking at a game like this, you're probably one of those kinda of players anyway!While the game has tons of content and an absolutely enormous, randomly generated world to play in, the one downside is that it suffers from something of a ""late game"" drag. I hate late game in the context of Unreal World since you can play for as long as you can keep your character alive, but when you've survived one full year and you're comfortable enough to sit for days on end at your homestead crafting or resting and not have to worry about feeding or clothing yourself, you'll know you've arrived at the ""late game"". However, once better interaction mechanics are implemented with NPC communities (something that is in the pipeline), this period will be vastly improved. In the meantime, what most players seem to do is pick harder scenarios, pack up and move, go on a really long expedition, or start taking on riskier endeavors (such as aforementioned bear hunting and Njerpez fighting. If you're worried your character has become to comfortable, remember there are always ""fun"" ways to live on the edge in Unreal World.			"

												Been playing URW for about 15 real life years. Or was it even more? Was the first game I ever bought. If you can get into it, it's a vast and unique world you never get tired of.  A massive archipelago. Go anywhere, survive adversity, hoard provisions and steal tools from villagers. Hunt reindeer and elk, tan their skins, smoke the meat, huddle by the campfire all night with your small dog hoping those howling wolves will not dare close in if you keep the fire bright...  Build your own wood house, start an animal pen, milk cows, learn how to hunt with self-made animal traps...My most recent adventure involved hunting seals with bow and arrow, while paddling on a raft in the western seas.  Got so much blubber it will hopefully last the whole winter after being salted.  This world is beautiful and natural in its own way, like no other. There is no special focus on the player usually seen in most roam-anywhere games, no big milestones pre-placed for him. You're just in the wilderness, and you're on your own, tet-a-tet with the whole world. The world in URW does not care if the player lives or dies, but if he lives, there is an unspoken expectation by the unseen spirits of the land that you will show them proper ritual gratitude for this favour.It is the most hardcore game:  complex keyboard-based controls, no hand holding. Also the gameplay is UNFORGIVINGLY realistic. If you've not been preparing well, the very first winter in URW will kill you. Your first couple characters, I'd be well impressed if they survive for more than a week in the wilderness.  ""Ohh delicious-looking unknown mushrooms, let me nourish myself with those... welp, dead by morning after exruciating poisoning agony."" Slowly you the player gather important Knowledge on what to do (""always boil unknown mushrooms first""), creating your own strategies and best practices. And your survival times increase in proportion, from being measured in hours, to days, to months, to years...On that cheery note, this game is highly recommended to the dedicated and thoughtful players. Absoutely one of my favorite games of all time, and it constantly keeps getting better with each patch. Good luck understanding and loving the Unreal World!			"

												UnReal World is one of the deepest survival simulators you'll ever come across.  I've been playing it now for around 6 years outside of Steam and it's one of those games you keep coming back to.  It's got a tremendous amount of complexity, which can be very daunting for new players.  Once you make it past the substantial learning curve, you'll find a deeply rewarding survival simulator with a unique setting: medieval Finland.I would term this game a ""rogue-like life simulator"" if anything.  With the majority of the ongoing game development being focused on adding real-life depth, this means the graphical end of things is more along the lines of the traditional rogue-like games, being more minimalistic.  That also means there's a staggering amount of things you can do in the game.  First timers will more than likely be completely overwhelmed by the different abilities and skills available.  You may want to watch a video or two of someone playing the game to get an idea of things you can do and how to survive in general as you are likely to die rather quickly in the beginning of the most basic of things, like not finding water.This game won't be for everyone.  The high amount of focus on real-life features means you'll be spending a lot of time doing basic survival things like gathering just enough food and water to live off of at the moment.  You also need to be concerned about the variety of your diet the same as in real life.  There's no true in game goal other than to survive as long as possible.  Again, these are things you should be able to tell pretty quickly if they're for you or not by finding a couple of videos of the game being played.If you're into survival games and living off the land in the wilderness sounds like fun to you, this is the game to get.

												One of the best if not best roguelike ever made. Also probably most realistic survival game ever made. There is incredible amount of detail to everything. Its simulating your life in middle of wilderness. You can build simple shelter, house, more houses and even sauna. Your character gets tired, hungry, thirsty, injuries (that might get infected if not treated), cold, hot.You can trade with tribes for stuff like axe which is needed to treat logs for usage for your home. Track animal footprints. Trap them for food. You can also fish your food. Food might spoil so its recommended to build cellar where you can store them in cold. It's almost impossible to describe this game because there is so much into it. If you think you can do something, you probably can. You might want to read other more detailed reviews to get better info on the game aspects. Also try the free version and don't give up on your first 10 tries. Try few more times and different scenarios the game offers.Highly recommended for people who like roguelikes or survival games. And even if the genres are not familiar. Try it at least.			"

The developers are passionate, highly dedicated, and responsive to the community and players, and plan to develop the game further, making it even more complex and enjoyable.PROS - Immersive and realistic gameplay taking place in Finland during the late iron age- Pleasant, relaxing atmosphere and environment- An open-ended world, easy to roleplay and choose your own roles in- Complex and well thought out gameplay without being difficult - Multiple starting scenarios- Dedicated, passionate, and responsive dev team- Updates vigorously worked upon and worthwhile- Unique and visually appealing art styleCONS - Keyboard commands can be difficult to learn and become used to, and I find that I have to relearn them if I don't play for a while			"

												Really good game, you can try the older free version on the Unreal World website, but this version adds some really nice quality-of-life improvements that make it worth the money in my opinion. It's the deepest survival simulator I've seen and has really good AI.Pros:-Great, comprehensive survival simulation from the hunting to the weather and seasonal lighting-Loads of replayability-Deep RPG mechanics-The developer is passionate about his work-Great AINeutral:-Very difficult-Will take some time to learn, it's more of a strict simulator than an easy survival crafting game that you can pick up and playCons:-The controls take some getting used toIf you're interested in the idea of this game and the graphics don't put you off, buy it. You can't go wrong.			"

												First, the positives:1)  Original and historical setting2)  Excellent atmosphere3)  Interesting and deep combat mechanicsThat's about it, really.  There's a lot of negatives when compared to similar games.  But I have to give it a positive review for being so original, especially considering the time in which it was conceived.  My biggest gripe is that for a game that's been in development for about 30 years, there's surprisingly little content when compared to other survival titles that are flashier and prettier to look at.  The development is absolutely glacial in pace (puns, heh...).  Released to Steam in Feb 2016 and it's received only 1 sizeable update if I remember correctly.  While this isn't exactly a roguelike, one of the strengths of the genre is it's ability to do so much with so little.  I feel like UnReal World doesn't capitalize on this asset.  With that said, the game still feels complete and worthy of a purchase, but there may be better survival games out there.  At the rate this thing is being made, I wouldn't be shocked if the developer dies before he ever realizes his ultimate vision for it.			"

												I've been playing this game for years, and if you can get past the outdated graphics and controls, you're in for a treat. This game can be hard as hell. I like to take stupid risks, so I've never made it through the first winter. I've been killed by a bear, fallen into my own traps, burnt the house I worked all summer on to the ground, starved to death, broken my legs falling from trees, angered the gods,been beaten to death by angry villagers, cut down by traveling merchants I was trying to rob, and drowned in huge lakes. The game has tons of depth and is a blast to play. The developer is also awesome. He has personally helped me with issues a few times. Anyway, two thumbs up!			"

												Unreal World is an amazing survival game in an interesting (and brutal) setting.  The learning curve is a bit steep, simply because of the massive amount of things to do, including fishing, farming, hunting/trapping, and building.  Character creation involved choosing your name, gender, cultures, and bonuses for several skills.  In addition, you can choose your starting scenario, ensuring that even starting over doesn't get boring.I can't recommend it for everyone, because of the large learning curve and non-standard controls (I made sure the last laptop I bought had a number pad specifically for this game). The mouse is rarely, if ever, used; instead, nearly every action has a hotkey or two.  However, If you are willing to put time and effort into learning about the game and don't mind playing through trial and error, Unreal World provides a unique survival game experience.			"

												Great survival game! The graphics are not great but they are fine for this kind of game. Theres a lot of option and the gamme is deep. Map is huge. The game is hard to get into so you should watch some turorial on youtube before starting to know how thing works. Once you know every key on the keyboard and you know your way around the game becomes incredibly fun!			"

												UnReal World is an engaging survival roguelike with an amazing amount of depth. You're alone in the wilderness set in the iron age of finland. You create a character from scratch with tons of skills at your disposal. The player is given a lot of freedom and tools which grants a lot of variety. You can play vastly different and try various survival tactics in order to overcome nature and it's threats. Be a fisherman, farmer, hunter, gatherer or a bandit. You're given the choice.The world itself is vast and filled with tons of items, creatures, immersion, lore and danger. It's very intricate and engaging with a great amount of detail. Every task that action that you perform has consequences and keeping your characters alive is really a challenge, furthermore the entire game is designed in a realistic way which only enhances the immersion. From fishing to hideworking or combat, everything is rough and has detail. It's a engrossing and hostile world.A great aspect is the interactive story, despite not having a full blown campaign. You can chose from a variety of character backgrounds which vastly changes the start of your adventure. Start as a well equipped hunter or fisherman but if you're up for the challenge you can play as a runaway slave that is being hunted. You make your own story and it's done with such detail that you feel really immersed. Even though the minimalistic graphics aren't that advanced, the presentation is solid. The small amount of songs and sound effect will still grab your attention, as for the rest the text provides enough flavor to really make you feel like this lonesome adventurer. This is pretty much standard for most roguelike though but this theme really resonates with me compared to other dungeon crawlers.The interface and controls are somewhat unintuitive but once you get used to it, it's really not that much of a deal. It might be a hassle at first to browse through the various menus but it's all set up in a reasonable fashion. That might be the biggest issue about this game, also there aren't many sound effects but it's still solid enough.Overall this is a very lovely game and crafted with such dedication, if this type of game doesn't appeal to you. You will probably get frustrated and not really enjoy it. But if you do, you will be rewarded with a great survival game that actually makes you think about provide a good challenge, while having a strong theme with a realistic tone.Definitely worth the price. Even if you're not sure about this game, you can still download it for free on the official website.			"

												This is one of the best games that i have ever purchased. Why?Because reality has a magic of its own and this is a reality, survival, stone-age simulation.The devs have invested a lot of time and passion in this game and it really shows in the complexity! They also show a great knowledge about outdoors survival. In all fairness, if you are stuck in nature and have some basic crafting skills (like how to make a fire, a basic shelter etc), this game can provide you with a logical what to do list which is awesome.. this is how realistic this game is.Challenges? Many ones, survive the first winter, survive for 3 years, protect the villages from Njerpezit warriors, become a shaman, make a big house, get some crops going just to name a few. A real challenge would be to survive the so called impossible custom starts (pick the culture that has the least points in attributes like Koivulainen, get your skills to a bare minimum and pump others like weatherlore and daggers, start in winter with the hurt and afraid scenario, no trading allowed with villagers). Quests are incoming as well so that is another big thing to do.What else can i say.. By buying this game you not only support the indie developers behind it but also the artists (check out some of their videos) and the teachers.Some variants are up on the developers site to download and play (and test) for free, so don't believe me.Try for yourself!Godspeed on your journeys!

												Finland simulator Ca. 1000 ADBut in all seriousness, this game is simply amazing. The amount of detail, intricacy, love and care that has been put into this game continues to shake my very core. As someone (from Finland indeed) who enjoys outdoorsy life and camping in the wild, I have never found a more brutally honest representation of how simply awful life could be for people in past eras.That's not to say it's 100% realistic, but it's damn well close enough for my taste and really gives you a feeling of accomplishment when you know that you are doing something farely realistic to have survived in that period.  This game has transformed what I thought would be a light intrest when I bought it to a full-blown obsession.It has a steep learning curve, and it ain't pretty to look at (at first, this changes once you get used to it, and by that point the graphics become very comfy indeed), but my god(s) has this game recieved my attention since I bought it. It's become one of those games that I just can't stop wanting to play. I constantly want to pick it up, and once I have I can't put it down again before I fall asleep at my keyboard. I absolutely recommend this game, in all it's brutal beauty, and it absolutely deserves DOUBLE of the asking price in my humble opinion.So buy this game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and make sure to have a handy book of finnish swears and insults ready for all those absolutely thrilling and chilling experiences!

												Only after I bought this game through Steam did I learn that it had actually been made aviable for free-to-play, just days before... but I don't fret about that, not for a minute, as it's worth every penny. Instead I spend each minute fretting about what I do next in game, even when I'm not actually playing! In harsh enviroments every calorie you expend better be a wise investment to attain future calories... this game nails that survival aspect. Will chase a badger through the woods as night approaches and the rain starts to fall, while cold and near starving, again and again if needs must... just to live a little longer.			"

												If there is one user tag I would like this game to trend, it is 'Labour of Love'. One guy in Finland has been making this game since I first found it following a rabbit-hole of roguelikes in the 90s.  Back then it was unique, an ironman survival game where you could build and alter the terrain, with hunger, disease and fatigue, and crafting to combat all these challenges.  Now I return to it and find that it is still a pleasure to play, both calming and gentle and pleasingly challenging: don't walk on the ice in the springtime, be aware that malnutrition is a dangerous spiral, even minor injuries can lead to much bigger problems if untreated.I would recommend for fans of Rimworld, classic roguelikes (e.g ADOM), Minecraft survival maps, and anyone with even a passing curiosity or interest in Finnish culture.10/10, would die in my sleep next to a half-finished hut again.

												I bought this game around 5-6 years ago, when I was still lived in China. Congrats for releasing on steam, hope it helps the developer to continue their works.I spent 3 days in it, barly sleep. This amazing game is very good for someone who like to survive in the cruel wild.I still remember my first death (starving to death), first prey (Squirrel, knocked down randomly, and desperately from a tree, fur ruined because I have f*king no idea how to do it XD) and first home (a small, nice Shelter near a lake).Yes, life is hard in this game, at least in the very beginning.This game strenghtened my will to come to the Northern world, and now here I am.This game is hard to learn, you have to remember a lot of hotkey in order to play smoothly , but with love and imagination (ofc hunting spirit as well) you will easily fall into this unreal world.非常感谢!!

												A true indie game from back before there was Kickstarter or Steamgarbagelight. It's been a labour of love for 24 years and it shows in the detail and nuance. If you can overlook the graphics and the outdated controls you will find a brutal survival game where starvation and hypothermia are every bit as dangerous as bears and bandits. It punishes lazy and careless play and rewards effort and exploration. If you are the type of player that looks at failure as a challenge and a chance to re-roll a character this is the game for you. If constant failure makes you punch a hole in the wall look elsewhere or at least stock up on some sheets of drywall.			"

												Oh what? I can't write a review without playing the game? That makes a lot of sense actually.As I write this, the game is installing. Yes, thats a very short playtime for a game before writing a review. Is it though? I've been playing this game off and on since 2006. I was excited when I heard it was coming to steam. Back in the day, they had different sort of payment plans where you could buy a liscense for the game. I bought 3 of them. They got rid of that system though, thats fine. they needed the cash. UnReal World wasn't always the best financed game at the time after all.In short, this game is the base, the very core of what I am now. I would not be playing the games I play if it were not for UnReal World. I would not know the people I know or be the person I am without UnReal World. It is a turning point in my character. This game shaped my hobbies and the way I look at games.As a side note, when I first played this game back in 2006, I got so hype over surviving in the wilderness that I went out into my back yard and built a leanto, made a stone axe, and cut several small trees down with it. Of course, you shouldn't do that, but I was just so damn excited about the whole thing.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough!Though I've only got a short logged playtime on Steam, I've been playin this game for about three years now from its pre-Steam releases.To put into perspective the ungodly amount of effort that has gone into this game, I'll piont out that it has been in development since 1992. I *think* that makes it the game with the longest development time - at least more so than either Dwarf Frotress or the Duke Nukem. 24 years of work, as of the time of this review in 2016.So what can you do in this game? Good question. You might recall how Todd Howard likes to say of Bethesda's releases that you can 'climb any mountain' or 'do anything' - well, you couldn't. In UrW you can come a whole lot closer to doing anything, though!Every aspect of life (bar taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥and ♥♥♥♥ing someone, which is probably for the best) is covered. A massive amount of attention to detail has been made, and there are absolutely shedloads of historically accurate items, foods and activites you can access. What's more, the game (despite being a roguelike and keyboard-based, which may initially pout a lot of people off) is very accessible due to its fantastic in-game wiki.What I've always loved in particular is that you set your own goals, something that no other RPG I've ever seen has done so well:* Want to hunt a bear? Sure, get tracking! But first you need to make sure you're well prepared. Should you take the spear, the bow or both? Is it worth buying a hunting dog to help you out? Maybe you'll need a companion from a local village to cover your back? How much food will you need for the journey? There are so many things to consider.* Exploration is crazy in this game! I mean, the gameworld is literally Finland. The very size. It's enormous.* Perhaps it's time to settle down; building a settlement in UrW is incredibly rewarding, but by no means easy work! I've never found anything as satisfying in a game as having completed a gleaming wooden longhall, complete with mead benches and a roaring hearth. It took me several in-game months to achieve and arrived just in time for winter. Winter is brutal in this game!* If you somehow feel your options aren't already wide enough, the game is incredibly easy to mod! Making and adding mods are both simple processes and widely expand the gameplay; what's more, since modding for the most aprt relies on adding .txt and .png files, there's practically a 0% chance that you could damage your game with mods (unlike certain other franchises), so go crazy!A final note is that the UrW forums having been running for years and in that time the developers Sami and Erkka have been amazing; they have listened to every player suggestion, answered every question they could and are highly aware of what can make the game better. There never has been, and never will be, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update. It's been getting better for 24 continuous years, and can only improve in the future! Make sure to visit the game's website and check the future development goals.Thanks for reading this far!			"

												""Only when the last tree is cut;only when the last river is polluted;only when the last fish is caught;only then will they realise that you cannot eat money.""-Cree Indian proverbThis game is clever in ways most modern 3D survival games can only dream of. Sure, the graphics are dated and controls might feel overwhelming in the beginning, but behind the first impressions hides a truly spectacular survival experience in the forests of Iron Age Finland.Unreal World utilises the mechanics that 2D world offers over 3D to give the player more realistic survival setting. 2D world can speed up the world around you when you perform tasks much more naturally than any game done in 3D could, and the game takes full advantage of this. The days in UrW are 24h, the year is 365 days. When you plant crops they aren't full grown in the next morning. There's also full 4 seasons in a Finnish year. During summer it's warm and the nature is blooming, but after a few months of sunshine it starts to get cold. And it gets really cold. If you are not prepared the winter can freeze you to death in a day and roaming in waist deep snow is exhausting. But even winter has its benefits. Animal tracks are easier to spot in the snow and food lasts for months before it spoils when it's -20c outside 24/7.Animals in the Unreal World are dangerous, but not like in many other games where you'll be beating them off multiple times a day with your fancy swords. In Unreal World even the most dangerous animals, the bears will flee when they spot you 90% of the time, perhaps even more often. They might get curious, smelling your roasting food and stay nearby. Come night they might try to sneak in and steal your food. Specially foxes like to do that. Or they might eat your livestock if you have any. But most of the time they will attack you only after you have provoked them by chasing them, cornering them or by surprising them, sneaking too close. Almost any animal will attack you when cornered, an elk might kick you to the head if you give it no chance to escape.Combat is terrifying. Any time you are attacked there's always a real chance your game will end there. This might sound like a bad game design choice. But in my opinion it makes much more sense this way. The player is not a super-human who could beat of 10 other people with ease. And if you lose in combat you will not wake up in your bed the next morning or something like that. You will be staring at the summary screen of your characters life, that has ended. Some special cases might leave you alive after you lose a battle, the robbers and friendly villagers. Robbers will take all your valuables and villagers will take away stolen property by force if you try to steal from them.Unreal World is the most complete survival experience I have come across, ever. And the best thing is that the author still has ideas of what to add, even if the pace might not be the fastest.Here's a few ways to end your life sooner rather than later in Unreal World, try to avoid:-Throwing a rock at a bear when you are not prepared for battle.-Walking on thin ice in the spring.-Swimming with all your stuff-Fishing with poor skill or poor tools-Eating funny looking mushrooms or plants.

What I hope to see added to the Steam version - Trading Cards- Workshop support (Since I hear this game is moddable)- Features that differ from the Free version, as great as supporting this dev is for all his hard work, as of currently there is nothing you really get from buying this game on steam besides the Overlay.I HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED YOU BUY THIS GAME AND SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPER!

												The depth is on a purely otherwise unheard of scale. Well, realistically on like a Dwarf Fortress scale but quite the scale indeed. You need to like gameplay over graphics. I just needed to let it be known that this is a great game, beyond that I havent played it enough to feel entirely qualified to review this because there is a lot to it. The control scheme (much like DF) can also take a bit of getting used to. The constant battle is Hunger, that and the Cold. Both of which are nothing really in comparison to what I consider, one of the most in-depth combat systems ever (involving individual fatigue, strength, skills, equipment (durability)). Everything about the game feels original and ""real"" somehow despite the graphical shortcomings.			"

Had to tear up my clothes to make bandages. Finally heals, Stumbles into some wolves. Gets eaten by wolves.Second character finished his log cabin again. Spent the majority of his time fishing and smoking fish for oncoming winter. 100 days he lived. A lynx had past my camp 30-40 times without incident. Lynx snuck up behind me and hamstrung me. Bit my neck. Dead.Character three is happily still with us. This time around learning the importance of the trap fence for long term food storage, while still utilizing nets to passively fish for everyday cooking, perhaps if an abundance would drop (over 10lbs) i would smoke it. Haven't reached 100 lbs of food yet. Am now terrified to leave the cabin everyday bc i am doing so good. My next project will probably be a fence around my camp for security from said lynx like critters.9/10 : This is really the best wilderness survival game i've come across. -1 point for it being keyboard commands and sometimes it gets old.

												I don't have a ton of time on steam and still not as much as many people have on the version before steam, however this has to be one of the best rougelikes I've ever played and I still can't believe it isn't more popular. You can do almost anything in the game that you want and the sheer size of the simulation and procedural generation is crazy. Every map is full randomly generated, although certain factions will always inhabit particular areas as that is part of the game's history. (Thereis a full in-game encyclopedia to tell you about just about everything, from were each of the 9 dominant tribes live, how they live, and what tools and skills the use in their daily life) The creators have updated the game for a very very long time and are consistent, I remember stumbling on this accidentally like 10 years ago on their webpage and thought it was awesome. They mix in real pictures to simulate many of the events in the game and locations and if you look past the basic spriting, its a game that shines. The soundtrack is great and the theme song is played on a Kantele, which is apparently a finnish instrument. They use a lot of their heritage in the game as it is based in the real world with mythological stuff thrown on top (but mostly in the form of rituals). You can hunt, fish, trade, fight, build, go bear grylls in Iron Age Finland, basically whatever you choose. Although it is not a super easy game in the beginning, it is rewarding once you figure out the controls and your basics. There are guides available online too that make it easier to start, or just figure it out by trial and error and look through your list of ancestors. It's not that expensive and you'll get more time out of it than AAA titles, except maybe Witcher 3, because damn that is a good, solid game. But this is cheaper, so get this.			"

												""Only when the last tree is cut;only when the last river is polluted;only when the last fish is caught;only then will they realise that you cannot eat money.""-Cree Indian proverbThis game is clever in ways most modern 3D survival games can only dream of. Sure, the graphics are dated and controls might feel overwhelming in the beginning, but behind the first impressions hides a truly spectacular survival experience in the forests of Iron Age Finland.Unreal World utilises the mechanics that 2D world offers over 3D to give the player more realistic survival setting. 2D world can speed up the world around you when you perform tasks much more naturally than any game done in 3D could, and the game takes full advantage of this. The days in UrW are 24h, the year is 365 days. When you plant crops they aren't full grown in the next morning. There's also full 4 seasons in a Finnish year. During summer it's warm and the nature is blooming, but after a few months of sunshine it starts to get cold. And it gets really cold. If you are not prepared the winter can freeze you to death in a day and roaming in waist deep snow is exhausting. But even winter has its benefits. Animal tracks are easier to spot in the snow and food lasts for months before it spoils when it's -20c outside 24/7.Animals in the Unreal World are dangerous, but not like in many other games where you'll be beating them off multiple times a day with your fancy swords. In Unreal World even the most dangerous animals, the bears will flee when they spot you 90% of the time, perhaps even more often. They might get curious, smelling your roasting food and stay nearby. Come night they might try to sneak in and steal your food. Specially foxes like to do that. Or they might eat your livestock if you have any. But most of the time they will attack you only after you have provoked them by chasing them, cornering them or by surprising them, sneaking too close. Almost any animal will attack you when cornered, an elk might kick you to the head if you give it no chance to escape.Combat is terrifying. Any time you are attacked there's always a real chance your game will end there. This might sound like a bad game design choice. But in my opinion it makes much more sense this way. The player is not a super-human who could beat of 10 other people with ease. And if you lose in combat you will not wake up in your bed the next morning or something like that. You will be staring at the summary screen of your characters life, that has ended. Some special cases might leave you alive after you lose a battle, the robbers and friendly villagers. Robbers will take all your valuables and villagers will take away stolen property by force if you try to steal from them.Unreal World is the most complete survival experience I have come across, ever. And the best thing is that the author still has ideas of what to add, even if the pace might not be the fastest.Here's a few ways to end your life sooner rather than later in Unreal World, try to avoid:-Throwing a rock at a bear when you are not prepared for battle.-Walking on thin ice in the spring.-Swimming with all your stuff-Fishing with poor skill or poor tools-Eating funny looking mushrooms or plants.

												""Into the far north we shall take you"", It's a great and a true line from the game and it's creators. It's hard and harsh like life in the Iron Age up North. Also there's nothing will help you if you're starving, no one will help when you crawl bleeding to death, and truly no one will help when you're freezing. It's survive and thrive in this game, eat or be eaten. This World will eat you up and spit you out when you go in blind, and that's fun. There's barely no hand holding at all, no easier modes, just you and nature, and those warriors that kill you everytime. As a person who love RougeLikes and Survival games this hits me with love. So here's pros and cons of this game.(Pros)Vast World to ExploreCulture and ways of life of each culture. (Even those people of the ""other"" side of the map)Hard weatherSomewhat moddable (New Items, Buildings, Flora and can replace texutures -that's it but later will be improved)-3.4- Quests, that'll be growing stone of later stuff ;) -Family, etcWorking and trying to increase skills for survivalHard Combat to Real Injuries that might, might be deadly for you later onHunting...It's hard but forgiving later on when you ""kill"" the animal5 Realistic Food sources, -Hunting, Passive Hunting, Farm/Gathering, Fishing, and TradingHarder Trading -No price tagsSpirutal Effects -Keeps the guardians pleased!!Replay valueGreat Devs, -if you're not a evil or disrespectful person to them(CONS)No cons, really but here's things people might say by **Controls*Graphics*Just how game is looked at by other people*Too hard(Final Thought)It's a truly a great game and I hope the devs of this game will keep this game great as always, and keep it a great place in my heart. Just Buy it, for a great experience and Hunger! It's a great price for $10.99. "

												Amazing and enjoyable game, even more impressive as it seems only two or three people are involved in creating it. Gives a wonderful feel of being amongst nature and the natural world, unlike a lot of survival games which feel very 'gamey' about survival.Battles can be extremely tough, but I like it that way and do not want it to change. I like all the folklore and spiritual thingies in the game. The graphics are charmingly retro.The only annoying thing is the burping sound after you eat. After hearing it 1000 times I just want my character to please stop burping.10/10 would spear Njerpez again.			"

												Finally URW is available on Steam! I've been playing this game well over a decade. I love it!URW is the most detailed and accurate roguelike survival game I've ever played. The historical and all in all very realistic setting is enchanting. The game is open ended, but there are various challenges and game modes you can try out. URW teaches you the basics of survival, weatherlore, trapping, crafting and so on, but it does not hold your hand. There are plenty of things you need to explore and figure out yourself. There is a learning curve, but as you get familiar with the game, you easily get carried away with all the possibilities. And I must say, there's nothing quite as rewarding as bathing in the sauna you built yourself, eating meat that you dried yourself, and seeing the season change after having survived another few months despite illnesses and setbacks.

The Unreal World is a game with incredible depth and difficulty without ever feeling unfair. The thrill of going off on a hunt and successfully coming back to your camp with fresh meat or the fear of being caught in the snow with little food and limited firewood is something other games can't match.Highly recommended if survival games are your thing.

												Are you looking for a game with great graphics, immeaditely understandable UI, and steadily progressing storyline? Then this probably isn't the game for you. I'm going to be going through a couple of the points why I think someone wouldn't like this game, and then get to why I love it.When they say open-ended, they mean it. You are literally dropped in the middle of the forest, with only the tools given to you. From here, you create your own story. Several background scenarios do add background, create added and varied challenges, and guide in the gameplay but at the end of the day, It's all up to you.This is a game that has been in development for much of my life, and it shows. Check out the pictures of the game, the trailer, and the free version. If what you see UI and graphics wise is not your cup of tea, then you know what you are getting into.Despite what I've mentioned above, this game is absolutely amazing once you do get into it. The multitude of positive reviews should hint to that fact. The mechanics and depth of gameplay implemented is quite amazing, the theme is very powerful and well developed, and the game simply has a way of making me long for getting back to nature.Most importantly, it's the only game that I've been playing on and off for the past decade (well over, actually). It's a game I've been surprised by every time I play, finding new ways to survive and thrive (and, admittedly, die). It's a game I know I'll be checking out for the next decade as well.Give it a couple of lives, read a survival guide, and then decide if it's a game for you. It's an investment that's well worth the effort.			"

												#Note: The game has been free for a long time, and is still free, over at the official website unrealworld.fi .UnReal World is a procedurally generated top down rogue-like survival game set in a low-fantasy yet realistic version of iron age Finland, and because of this, the game is HARD, especially for new players. if you don't survive more than a week, remember that ""losing is fun"".Luckily, for new players, the developers (A two-man group) have added two tutorials in order to help new players (one simpler, more focused on survival, one on more advanced mechanics).As a rogue-like, the game has a skill system for rating your abilities in everything from timbercraft and construction to fishing and swimming. The base of these stats are dependent on your characters chosen tribe and their physical scores, randomly generated as you create your character. Your skills are then improved as you practice using them.The game was first released in 1992, and it shows, in some ways. The UI can definitely be improved in some areas, among other things, but the devs are constantly improving the game and it is possible these issues are fixed later on. As an example of the overall attention to detail from the developer, The latest update (the first version released on Steam) added improved winter mechanics, making snow and ice thicker and thinner as winter comes and goes and adding the possibility of breaking the ice, adding another highly plausible way of dying during winter. Something else that has been in the game for some time is one of (if not THE most) advanced animal AI that isn't just randomly walking around, like other games.In summary, it's a highly competent survival game, and the Steam version is currently just a way to pay the devs for the amazing amount of work they have done. If you feel like playing the game, go to their website and try the free non-Steam version first before buying it here.			"

												I was looking for a ""as real as it gets"" survival-game. About two years ago I stumble over this gem. Its not an easy to pick up game, but if you play the tutorial, and read a litte in the wiki it will take you away to the very far north an not let you go. No other game has ever triggered my imanigation better than this one. Try it out for free from the website and then buy it, or spend the guys some money, they deserve it.-----------------------------------------------------Ich habe lange nach einem wirklichen survival Spiel gesucht. Vor etwa zwei Jahre habe ich durch Zufall dieses Spiel entdeckt. Der Einstieg ist nicht leicht, aber wenn man das Tutorial spielt und nebenher etwas im wiki liest erfüllt das Spiel sein versprechen: ""Into the far north, we shall take you..."" und lässt, mich jedenfalls, nicht mehr los. Kein Spiel hat meine Fantasie bisher besser angeregt. Man drückt Tasten auf der Tastatur und ist trotzdem mitten im finnischen Wald und kämpft um sein Leben :)Probiert es kostenlos auf der Website aus und spendet den Entwicklern Geld, die Jungs haben das wirklich verdient.

												The game might not look like much but believe me. This game has so much potential and as of right now even it's so much fun to play. I love the difficulty of it all as every day is a struggle to survive and you have to just hope you don't get killed while in your sleep. I sometimes like to play a ""darker"" kind of character. I like to go to villages, ask men there if they will like to come hunting with me. I take them to my cabin (which i stole from an islander btw) and tell them to stay put, i walk a few steps over and blast them with my crossbow. I then proceed to take their clothes and weapons and barter them for the good stuff are other villages ;D			"

Wandering, vomiting, feeling better, freezing, catching the flu, feeling better, but all the time starving. A village on the horizon. Stole a fox fur and some venison. Ran away, got chased. He tried to take it from me. I stabbed at him with my sharpened stick. His lunch is my life. Not worth it, he stepped back, stepped away. His friend in the distance. An arrow in my side. I passed out.Wake up. Cold, food gone, bleeding. Tore my shirt to bandage the wound.  Another village across a frozen lake. Can't go round. So cold. So hungry. So hurt. Walk on ice. Crack.

												UnReal World to me is the survival equivalent of Dwarf Fortress. With a somewhat steep learning curve and a world that won't hold your hand at any point UnReal World will provide the player a lot of replayability and new challanges to conquer. In the beginning just surviving the first whole year can be a challange, but once you learn the ropes you can start settings your own challanges or try to complete the games basic and advanced ""missions"".The development is constant and with the new quests and spells update there is even more to do than before. Honestly the only cons for this game that I can think of would be the limited graphics and memorizing different keystrokes to use different skills, but weighing this against the massive scale, endless replayability and fun gameplay makes it a minor complaint.This is the game that I've played for over ten years now and I still come back to it every now and then, thus this has to be my ""I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS COOL BEFORE IT WON AN AWARD"" nominee.

												I must admit that I like roguelikes and survival games and I like to try out many of them, I also frequently buy roguelikes on steam, but usually I play them for a couple of hours and then don't return to them. They might be interesting and fun, but only in few cases I really get hooked. I have played the steam version of URW for only 10 realtime hours (44 ingame days), but they flew by like nothing and I feel like I will  keep returning to this game.Like with all games, I would only recommend the game if the setting appeals to you, which is based on stone age Finnland with all its harshness and mythology. Just watch the steam launch trailer, if it seems interesting to you, it might be worth buying this game. You have to be prepared to do some reading, there is a lot of ingame lore and many things you need to know in order to survive. The use of the online wiki is not required, there is a tutorial and an ingame encyclopedia, but still the wiki can be really helpful at times. Also, you will need to learn many keybindings and how to operate the game by keyboard. That is certainly not a game for the totally impatient, they won't survive long.But that does not mean that the game is boring, there is a huge world waiting for you to be explored. And there is always something to do, there are different ways to keep your belly filled, as a hunter, fisher, farmer, trader and so on, but no matter which career(s) you choose, you won't be able to lean back. I haven't played a survival game yet which felt so realistic. I felt so happy when after few days of unsuccesful hunting, after many animals escaped me (despite following their track), and near starvation, for the first time I finally managed to kill a stag. I butchered it and cooked the pieces, which fed me for several days, until they got spoiled. I wasn't wise enough to smoke/dry them or to build a cellar for storage. I learned from it and my character became really promising, until I made the mistake to fight a couple of robbers, which led to an early death when I failed to treat my wounds. The game tells its own stories and even though the graphics seem horrible, the immersion is greater than in any other game I have played so far. I am looking forward to my next character and if he will be able to survive his first winter.Tldr: In no other game I felt so happy and thankful to the gods of nature for being able to live another day.

												An Aged fine wine of a Survival Game :)  Love it!First off I didn't know anything of this game until I read a Twitter post recently from Rock, Paper, Shotgun and how they talked up the game. I further did research online, and though the developer doesn't have a FB or Twitter account I was able to pull up very high reviews of this game and fans hashtags on twitter. I own and play games like Radiation Island, SurvivalCraft (over Minecraft), KoDP and few other survival/RPG type games, so I had to check this out. To cut right to the chase this URW is awesome! For this game to be 20 something y/o and still going strong with devouted fans and newbies (like myself) is amazing! After purchase, I actually didn't start playing till maybe 5 days later for I was reading up on the URW wiki on my tablet due to work and being on the go. But when downtime came I loaded it up and must say at first the whole key command took a little getting use to but afterwhile I slowly got the hang of it. Whenever I was in doubt, I would always refer to wiki via my tablet to free up space on my monitor, or hit (SHIFT + ?) for the layout of the key commands. I'm playing on a Mac so I think the key layout might be a just a little different from PC, but no big deal.  Still have a ways to go by getting full grasp of this game, but overall I love it and have no regrets spending $ for I didn't know the game was free till after purchase. Plus I love to support game developers who create games and take there work seriously.  In closing I just want to say when URW came out as well as other favorite gems (KoDP, Avernum/Avadon), computers weren't affordable as they are now so I missed out. But now with companies submitting games to Steam as well as porting games to Tablets, it's a privellage to get a chance to play those games that I may have missed out on. Would love to see URW on iPad one day if possible.			"

												I have been playing this game since 1995, I have installed it on every computer I have ever owned.  I have always found it addictive and great fun. I was pleasantly surprised to see it on Steam. The game has grown so much over the years and I hope Sami will continue to develop it further.Make no mistake it is difficult, it is complex. You will die (a lot). BUT you will or rather should learn from your mistakes. You will need patience and with patience will come great reward.  Set a goal, such as survive a week; move onto survive a month etc.I cannot recommend this game enough. It is educational. It is fun.Go Play. Enjoy.			"

												Probably the most realistic survival roguelike out there. Actual methods of survival apply here. Hunt, fish, trade, and survive iron-age finland. Light mystical elements like incantations. Brutal hunger, thirst and fatigue mechanics.Ever wondered if you could survive in the wild? Well, here's your chance. Be warned, the UI is 'OLD SCHOOL' at its finest. Press s to bring up your crafting menu. From there its all fairly simple. Do the tutorial, it helps immensly. Youtube videos would not go amiss either.After that, have fun living as early humanity did. By the seat of your freaking pants. This game has been around since 1992, and is STILL receiving regular updates. Bonus points for a dev who actually knows what he's talking about. Dude can skin a squirrel and lives right in the midldle of Finnish woods. Seriously, man up, and get this wonderful survival sim.			"

												I've been playing this game for over twenty years. The number of updates and the dedication of Sami and Erkka is nothing short of astounding. This is, truly, a free-form survival RPG, started WELL before build/craft was a borderline game mechanic. Hunt, fish (and not that crap ""wait for the fishing pole to move fishing, either), cut trees, build houses, commune with the spirits. I would recommend this to anyone interested in going back a few centuries, or anyone looking for a low, LOW fantasy setting. It is truly an experience that will stay with you.			"

												This is truly THE survival game! I play it for ~9 years now and hell, I haven't scratched the surface of true surviving yet. Once you got through the steep learning curve you certainly get to enjoy a masterpiece that easily makes you realize the dedication of the creator(s)! Being a hunter, farmer, fisherman or gatherer or whatever you want you are pretty much completely free to do whatever you want and you'll certainly die trying! Climb a tree and break your legs or mug a wanderer and loot his inventory to make it through the winter... There is a very granular level of detail in regards to the skills to apply and ways to play the game and you will most likely have to forget all those gather-wood-to-build-a-workbench-then-place-a-furnace-games' concepts as here you have to think about your next steps very carefully so you don't freeze to death, drown in a pond, starve or poison yourself or become prey...there is no comparison to that feeling when you finally manage to find and kill that big game you pursued for days after you hit it with your spear, following trails of its blood while hoping it will fall into one of your tediously setup traps! Build a tent or a house and settle down at the riverside or try to befriend a nearby village and trade with the people...not just some specific NPC, no, anyone. The sheer amount of possibilities in this game will make you question all those ""realistic"" RPGs and survival games out there for sure. Take your time to read into the manual, though!!If you're willing to dive into this game you probably aren't the ""but the graphics"" type of person. Buckle up as every single key on your keyboard will be used and you will read a lot! Do I recommend this game? Oh yes, I keep a copy* around to gift it for you just to make sure you experience that magic yourself.(* might be gone once you read this, ha)			"

												Ignore what it says about my hours, I've put countless thousands into this game before it came to steam.UnReal World (UrW) is quite simply the richest rogue-like survival in existence, unique in its depth and nuance. Create a character and determine your path to thriving (or dying) in dark ages Finland. Become a settled trapper, an itinerant fisher, a barbaric warmonger, a hunter, a farmer, a trader... many potential paths lie before you, and you may well find yourself taking all of them over the course of a character's life. Foremost, UrW is both brutal and beautiful, crafting a deep narrative through your struggle to survive in a harsh world, where the environment itself can be as deadly as those that dwell in it. I could tell you a hundred stories from my times playing, of cunning victories, cozy campfires, and unexpected demises, but you'd be far better served spending that time creating your own.In Brief:Generate a unique world and roll a character to embark in it. You may also select a starting scenario (take the runaway slave in winter for hardcore mode or one of the training tutorials for a little early boost). From there, you must seek out a source of food, drink, and shelter. How you do so is truly in your hands. Craft items to aid in your endeavor. Collect berries and cook wonderful meals. Tire of lovely vegetarian fare. Set a fence trap and slaughter some wild beasts. Trade hides with foreign merchants for some coveted metal arms. Capture and tame a wild bear, then hire some fellow adventurers and raid a Njeperz camp. Cut their clothes into bandages and roast their bodies over open flames. And most important, establish a base camp to survive the coming cold, for WINTER _IS_ COMING. If you die, it is permanent, which makes every encounter tense and rewarding. I really can't say enough how amazing this game is.Finally, the developer Sami Maaranen is incredible in his dedication to his game and its playerbase. He is always responsive and friendly, and has been continually working on improving the UrW experience for over two decades. If there's anyone in the indie industry that deserves your money, it's him. I first bought UrW after saving for weeks at my minimum wage job in high school over a decade ago. What I got was worth ten times that.BUY THIS GAME! DON'T WAIT! And then play it, and share your stories wide and far.			"

												UnReal World is an open world wilderness survival game that I have been playing for about 14 years. Back when I got my first computer I could run next to nothing in terms of games, I used to love playing Rougelike games like Nethack and POWDER on my PC, they were easy to run and they provided hours and hours of fun. Then while browsing a board for POWDER I saw a thread about a wilderness survival rougelike called UnReal World and I was intrigued by the idea of a wilderness rougelike so I checked it out. 14 years later I still find myself playing this game and I have still enjoy playing this game. Im glad this game has finally made itself onto steam so it can be part of my library, This game will definatly be at the top of my favorite section in my library for many years to come.			"

												Well... UnReal World... Where do I start? I started playing  it back in december of 2014 and since then, I am hooked! the graffics may not be the best (the new ones look great, dont get me wrong) but who needs graphics when you have such an emersive, rich game that can take you to places you always wished you could go! For me, what got me into this game at first was curiosity, but I had a feeling I would like it, and oh boy do I! You start off with a multitude of scenarios, wich can greatly challenge you or make life easier for your character. And if you're into challenges, make up your own! with a multitude of skills to learn and master. But skills in UnReal World aren't like skyrim or Unturned, its a pore realistic approach where the more you practice, the better you get IE, you want to raise your cooking skill, cook stuff! But what you can cook doesnt depend on your cooking skill, the taste depends on your skill. For crafting skills, there's obviously no taste, quality is the factor. All and all, the game itself is HUGE, not in size itself, but in its potential for your mind to create more of the game. right now, I've started a new character for the steam release, but before that, I played with a character for a WHOLE 9 MONTHS... IRL. and I didn't get bored once. I have to admit I got my fair share of near death experiences, which is scary since the game is PERMADEATH. Oh and by the way, if you haven't already deducted, I LOVE this game and I would like to say thanks to SAMI MAARANEN.			"

												Yes, my hours played on the game are pretty much non-existant. I've been playing this game like crazy for the past few days though. I saw the game in my discovery queue and thought it looked interesting. I'm a bit of a cheapskate though and I've been burned by so many games in the past that I didn't want to jump right on it. As I'm reading through the comments, I see mention that you can download and play the game from the developer's website. So I gave it a shot. At first I was a bit overwhelmed but after looking over a couple guides, I started figuring it out a bit.So I've been playing a bunch for the last couple days and I'm really loving the game. At this point, I decided that I was going to buy this game and support the developer. This isn't some big company. It's a small indie thing and this guy has a huge set of cojones making his game available for free while also selling it on Stream. That shows confidence in your work. It IS that good. It's worth buying even though I could play it for free. I've already talked it up to a couple friends and they're going to try it out as well. Get the word of mouth going on this one.So actually talking about the game itself. The graphics aren't anything to speak of but they don't need to be. This isn't a splashing graphical game for the Xbox crowd. This is an old school game but it's got depth that the old school games couldn't pull off. You start the world as a Nordic person back in the Iron Age. In most of the scenarios (there are many you can choose from) you start off alone. Usually you've got some basic supplies and a day or two worth of food. From here you've got to find food, build shelter, and stay alive! I've been starting in the summer. My goal has been to build a cabin before the winter hits. That's not an easy task. It's not like other survival games where it's simplified. Building takes lots of time and effort. Fishing, hunting, and trapping are difficult! It's easy to get lost in this game for hours. Highly reccommended!			"

												I really like the idea behind this game, and it's a good atmosphere, good approach to survival games. But there are some minor things that is just bad game design and it takes away a bit of enjoyment from the game. For example tracking. Normally when you walk through the woods you notice tracks of animals here and there. Some pine cones eaten by a bird, or a squirrel, or a mouse. Some droppings of a hare, or a fox. Now and then some tracks. Even an idiot can clearly see these signs of animals moving about a forest, even though an idiot may not recognize what animal left that tracks. In this game, I'm playing a max intelligence character with 40% tracking skill and after walking over half the map he didn't spot a single track anywhere. What's more, walking through the woods is not enough, I have to activate a skill EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. Come on. It's just tedious and not the least bit of fun. Just make it a toggle to track, which means pay more attention to the ground, and let movement cost slightly more or something. The crafting interface is also a bit clunky. I have a pile of timber and planks and twigs on the ground, but if it's not in my inventory I can't build anything, and I can't pick it up because I'm not strong enough. Like, wait, that's not how you build a house... Builders don't carry EVERYTHING THEY NEED for the house, they just go get one plank at a time. If it's in the adjacent squares, that should be enough.And so on. But it is an enjoyable game. Just a bit surprising that it was developed for decades and still simple things to fix like what I mentioned are still in the game.			"

												Although I have only just got the game on steam, I purchased the game back in 2003 and have played the game on and off for many years. URW is one of the original freeform survival games. It is set in dark age Finland approx 800AD and features an incredible amount of finnish culture and atmosphere. It has more RPG elements than your typical survival game, and features a complete character system including skills, attributes and the ability to level skills up by using them. The game features an extremely detailed turn based combat system based on locational damage. Combat is always a dangerous option just like in real life. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Roguelikes or Survival Games. The game contains elements of both and is truly excellent.			"

												While Unreal World is a pretty hardcore roguelike, it's also very enjoyable once you understand how it works.  The game is set in Iron Age Finland, and you must face the hardships that living in such an environment entails.  Your character has a variety of skills such as hunting, fishing, farming, foraging, running, swimming, woodcraft and firemaking as well as skills in various weapon types.  You'll need to use them well if you want to survive as long as you can as it's all too easy to find yourself running out of food because you didn't catch enough fish or you let that elk escape.  You can also trade with the numerous villages in the game world, but as there is no currency, you can only barter, so you'd better hope you have something they want.  Building a log cabin which will become your base of operations is something else you can, and should, do.  As this game is meant to be as realistic as possible, you'll find building it to be a time-intensive grind as you fall trees and haul them to the construction site, all the while keeping an eye on your hunger bar.  You'll be grateful for it once winter rolls in though.Unreal World is a game that requires a little patience, though there is a reasonably detailed tutorial.  If you enjoy survivial games that reflect the gritty grind of primitive life, you will enjoy this.  The game is still in development, although updates are not very frequent.			"

The interface is incredibly simple, but the game is very complex and engaging, which makes it great for someone who might not have a high end gaming computer that might not be able to run other survival games with high graphics.The other thing is, that in most games where there is no save to go back to if you die, I get really frustrated, but this game doesn't do that to me... every time I've died has been because I did something incredibly dumb that got me killed (walking on icy lakes, going on hunts for wolves that I wasn't really ready to tackle, etc.).

												If you enjoy inmersive roleplaying within a game, and making up your own story, and letting your imagination take over in place of visuals then this game is for you.  However, if you need animations on screen, rigid questlines, and giant battles then you will not enjoy Unreal World.  It plays very close to the adventure mode in dwarf fortress (just not with ascii graphics) and Im sure some inspiration definately came from dwarf fortress.  When starting the game you create a character through stats and choosing a tribe/ cultural group.  If you explore the help manual with the f1 key then you can find some more information about each tribe.  One thing I really enjoyed was that most of the native tribes (the northern tribes) aren't especially fond of warfare, but are very much in touch with the land and the spirits.After creating your character you get to pick your starting ""story"" which is thr scenario your character will start in.  Most of the time I end up using the unfortunate hunting trip scenario, very revenant like, but I did not survive being mauled by the bear.What Unreal World lacks visually it makes up for in depth.  The survival mechanics are managable, but it is too possible to not realize that you hadn't packed enough food to last a migration south to warmer climates for the winter.  Also, combat is much more unforgiving (just as it is in dwarf fortress (can you see a theme yet?)) And what seemed like an easy fight can go wrong with a lucky blow to the leg.  The hunting system is my favorite by far!  Tracking, stalking, mix and repeat.  Very realistic, and Im speaking from experience as a hunter myself.  In other games you go look for an animal, you shoot it, and you have enough food for a little while.  Unreal World makes you earn it.  So you found an elk, got close enough for a shot with your bow?  Great, you have mortally wounded it, but it still ran away.  So you will spend the rest of the in game day following blood trails and tracks, and hopefully you find it again.If you do not enjoy creating your own experience in a game then Unreal World is not for you!  End of story.  If you like dwarf fortress, or other survival sims than you will get many hours of enjoyment from yhis game.			"

The interface is incredibly simple, but the game is very complex and engaging, which makes it great for someone who might not have a high end gaming computer that might not be able to run other survival games with high graphics.The other thing is, that in most games where there is no save to go back to if you die, I get really frustrated, but this game doesn't do that to me... every time I've died has been because I did something incredibly dumb that got me killed (walking on icy lakes, going on hunts for wolves that I wasn't really ready to tackle, etc.).

												I've been playing Unreal World for well over three years now. It is one of the few games that I will return to again and again. One of the best things about this game is the continued attention it gets from the developers. The game is constantly being expanded and improved upon, which only adds to the replayability. Another great aspect of the game is the community that has developed around it. The gameplay is immersive, challenging and just plain fun. The game world has its own life, with random interactions between both human and animal npcs effecting the world. A great example can be seen in this video, which also gives a preview of the gameplay in general: {LINK REMOVED}http://bit.ly/1qZSJSJ "

												This is my first review ever. I felt compelled to write one for this game. My steam hours show very little at the moment, but I assure you I have put in many hours into unreal world before it was made available on steam. I enjoyed it so much, I payed the money to become a lifetime member and I have also donated money for the developers hard work. If you are looking for a true survival game, unreal world is the game for you. There is a great amount of depth and attention to detail in this game. Unlike other ""survival"" games, when you finally trap or hunt your first big animal there really is a sense of accomplishment to it. Come to think of it, there is a sense of accomplishment in anything you do because it's just one step closer to being able to survive better. This is a really great game, you should get it and help support Sami Maaranen and his awesomeness. "

												Although I have only just got the game on steam, I purchased the game back in 2003 and have played the game on and off for many years. URW is one of the original freeform survival games. It is set in dark age Finland approx 800AD and features an incredible amount of finnish culture and atmosphere. It has more RPG elements than your typical survival game, and features a complete character system including skills, attributes and the ability to level skills up by using them. The game features an extremely detailed turn based combat system based on locational damage. Combat is always a dangerous option just like in real life. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Roguelikes or Survival Games. The game contains elements of both and is truly excellent.			"

												I have seen this game over the years and never put forth the effort to even play it.  but steam shoved it in my face so I gave it a go.  What to compare it to?  Adventure mode in Dwarf Fortress is about the only thing close.  While DF is soo Deep with physics and minutia controls that the interface and commands keep 90% of the potential players away, URW has much lighter controls, but that is compared to DF, compared to pretty much any other game it still has alot of commands... but they are structured much better than DF, and only take about an hour to get a good handle on them (watch wildfirefly12's let play (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_JW9Zr0Yxs&list=PLUGuQn97METNsvmaro7R1qH5IFxHMXUFX) she gives a pleasant play through of a few characters, and ends the lets play with a massive attack on the hostile tribe (Njerps).  The letsplay will give you pointers to some good mods she uses and also a good walk through of the commands as she uses them, and certain things to watch out for while playing.As to my handful of play throughs, most have ended by falling through the ice while trying to cross rivers or lakes, either too early in the winter or too late in the spring... listen for the ice cracking.  I do recommend starting a few characters that are purely combat and just go on a killing spree of people to get used to the combat and how to fight, it isn't difficult to issue commands, but it does take some practice/experience to plan each strike, and which weapons are better to defend with (let them attack at you while you counterstike their attacks)  Also your cumulative penalties need to be carefully monitored, rest when you need to and reduce your weight burden else you will just think the game is too hard, it isn't you are just literally stacking too much on your character.  it helps with making better quality goods.  Also start a a good quality cook.  you food will go further as each meal will be satisfying.  best starts for newbies are failed hunting trip and lonely settler as both will start you with a real ax, not a stone ax or no ax at all.Last hint, don't build a fire next to your cellar, the heat from the fire will warm your cellar and make all the food in it go bad, LOL and 10/10 for that level of detail.

												edit: I initially gave this game a negative rating, but as you can see, I'm now 40+ hours into the game, so I've now changed it to positive.The reason for the initial negative rating is the rather-unfriendly UI. There are a myriad of keyboard commands you need to remember by heart. Using a mouse as input is not an option, everything is done strictly by keyboard. I'm the kind of gamer who likes to sit back and relax in my chair while clicking on my mouse, rather than hunch over the keyboard in an upright position, so I wasn't pleased in the beginning. The dozens of keyboard commands are difficult to remember and will force you to consult the ""help"" page every so often.However, if you can tolerate this, Unreal World becomes a beautiful sandbox game. You can do whatever you want, whether it be to become a farmer, hunter, lumberjack, fisherman, bandit, serial killer etc. The main ""goal"" is to survive winter, which is harsh and deadly, so most of your time will be devoted to hunting and gathering food, and building a suitable shelter for the cold season. How you approach this is up to you. My main complaint (besides the unfriendly UI) is that the game world can feel lonely at times. At present, you're not able to marry anyone or have kids. You do have the option of hiring adventurers and workers, but they will only stay with you for a short time and then leave. You can't move into a village or improve it. The game makes you feel like you're an outcast with no friends or something. You can almost call it a hermit simulator. Overall, though, I find the game enjoyable. If you're into survival or roguelikes, UW is a very good choice.			"

												If you're into fancy graphics and easy 4 button controls, don't enter the far north and spend your money some place else!If you're into story-driven games this game might not be what you are looking for, at least not at the moment, quests are coming and who knows what the modding community might do with that.If you like open worlds, rogue-likes, survival games and bushcraft this game is for you!Endless possibilities await you and some good mods for the game are also out there already. Even though this game has been around for a very long time it has some very active developers and a very nice community. The graphics are not for everbody and surviving especially in winter can be very challenging.. prepare to die alot :) But it is one of the few games that delivers a pretty good feeling for bushcraft and realism when it comes to living out in the woods. Most other survival games just define realism as realistic looking 3d graphics - this is definitly not the case here. The in-game encyclopedia alone can cost you quite some time just reading articles... The game itself is turn-based and requires some learning as well as a bit of planning ahead. The constant updates and the very nice community always give you a reason to return to this game even after some month of absence just to find a whole lot of new features or game mechanics.			"

												It's neat to dabble with owing to its rich history and depth, but ultimately treads a fine line between too realistic/punishing and boring/repetitive. Though the details differ -- most of us don't set traps or drink directly from lakes -- that's basically real life, not a game. Still, I think that's more a criticism of survival sims than this particular game. There is no doubt that URW is very well made. And even if you decide that it's not for you, you'll get your money's worth -- if you persist long enough to learn the controls, that is. Note: the fans are rather, er, zealous.			"

												When I first saw the reviews for this game, I was really repulsed. People only have 10-100 hours logged in this game. It didn't make sense to me; the normal amount of time investment in roguelikes is entire years. I assumed they were casuals who collect Steam games and don't actually play any.Now after 70 hours of playing myself, I understand why.The game is too damn easy. With the character I'm currently playing, I killed a bear in my first ten minutes of starting the scenario, and now, only a month in in-game time, I'm powerful enough to slaughter the residents of two villages a day. And I ♥♥♥♥ing shouldn't be! I by no means have any plate armour or super weapons. I am a peasant just like them, yet they walk into me like I'm a meat grinder somehow and I leave each village with ""shallow cut in right forearm"" at best.So, I guess with that being said, this is one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games for children that ""can be hard if you deliberately cripple your character, ignore numerous game mechanics entirely, and always restrict yourself to♥♥♥♥♥♥gear"" AKA Pokemon. And I ask people who do that sort of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Why? Why play games like Pokemon or UnReal World only to avoid a majority of the content--lest you make it too easy for yourself--instead of just playing a game that's inherently difficult? There's other RPG's out there where you'll actually be challenged just by playing the game normally and utilizing all materials and tactics. Play those and stop pretending this game is hard just because you purposefully break your character's legs to the point where you can't even cut a tree down. That's YOUR actions inciting challenge, not the game's.The first fifteen-thirty hours make the game appear impossible. But honestly in retrospect, I really only struggled with it due to my not knowing how to distribute my time spent on various tasks. You'll lose characters to this confusion. Do not misinterpret this as challenge, it is only the overwhelming amount of skills and ways to gather food that are leading you to death. You'll grasp it all soon and realize it's mathematical boredom. Nothing will intimidate you. You'll have so much food you'll have to throw it away to make room for more food. I had one character with 400 pounds of food in a cellar and I didn't even bother removing it when it all spoiled. If in future updates they change it so that I'm no longer a walking meat grinder who sucks the life out of anything that moves as soon as it enters range, I would very much enjoy playing. One suggestion I have is to make there be 500% less settlements spawning. If there were only one or two within reasonable walking distance of the player, maybe I'd value them enough to not slaughter their sages and steal their livestock. This would probably be easier to implement than tampering with damage multipliers and everything else it takes to nerf or boost characters. I still recmmend the game despite writing nothing but complaints because it took me 70 hours to realize how depthless it all really is. The game maintained this facade that kept me fearful and thinking I was some chess master when I'd succeed in kills. It wasn't till I decimiated my 50th village that I realized ""wait a minute. absolutely nothing is a threat to me, even when i'm practically naked and using only a handaxe"".Also, I respect the developer despite my major disagreements with some of his methods. You are living the dream, and I think you're a swell guy.So, yeah. 10 bucks for 70 hours of fun? I don't regret this purchase in the slightest, though clearly I had expected this to be years of fun like other, better roguelikes (...that are all free. Ouch).			"

												Antiquated piece of feces. Screen caps make this game look a LOT better than it actually is. Gameplay is almost entirely by keyboard. So if you like old games with horrible graphics and even worse controls then this is your game. Who cares if its been in production for 15+ years. Horrible ""tutorial"" and I use that word loosely. Learning curve is ridiculous. -10/10 wouldn't play this if it was the ONLY game on my computer.			"

												I wanted to like it, seemed like something that would interest me. Unfortunately the low resolution made it visually unappealing, and the UI and keyboard commands were nonintuitive and dated. If you havent played NEO Scavenger, I highly recommend it. It's harsh, survivalism, turn based, and has a much better UI.			"

												This game has a high learning curve mostly due to its awkward and numerous keybindings. I have to admit that I was not drawn into this game and was turned off from the combination of poor graphics and photos used for the few people as playable characters. Something about that was weird to me.  I'm sure that this game has something going  for it if you put in enough time, but it just failed to grab me and was not fun. The price of this game is also too high for what seems like a quickly thrown together game.Edit:Apparently this game is free on the website which was kindly provided by one of the game's fanboys that was offended by my negative review which reinforces my negative review on steam.  I also urge those that don't like the game to not write any negative reviews due to constant nagging from fanboys that will tell you that you're wrong for your opinion.  Do some research on this game and be prepared to invest a lot of time learning basic mechanics that still fall short of being fun.  If you do like this game, I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings.			"

												 First of all, congratulations Sami and Erkka, you guys made a true survival game. I'm a big fan of survival games but i could never find one that was about surviving in the wildness, without monsters or guns, i was searching for something more ""rustic"" and them i foud UrW... but by the time i was not a big fan of roguelike games and gave up trying to learn the basics. A few years later i came across UrW again and this time i was decided to play, and i played, for many months, and i could not find a end to the game, it was just infinite... till i die. Just like the life! and i continued playing and playing, and now, after 6 months that i play this game, it came out on steam, with tons of new stuff, etc. If you want a trully survival experience, UrW is for you, its not a simple game, its another way of life.

The game will teach you the necessary basics as you go along, and the rest can be found in the built-in help. Everything else is up to you though, there's no handholding or NPCs with exclamation marks over their heads telling you what you need to do.			"

												I have been looking for the ultimate survival game for a long time, and while this may not be pretty it sure is deep and fun as hell. I would say my only complaint is the graphics, but the way the game plays, looks, and feels kind of adds its own kind of atmospher that you don't really find in other games. While I wouldnt call it immersive it is something very intriguing that I think deservers more recognition that it has.			"

												I love this game. It has a depth only rivaled by such games as Dwarf Fortress and Aurora. Just like the other games I mentioned, it is extremely unforgiving. That makes it so much more rewarding when you are successful for a time. It isn't for everyone. You will have to learn, think, plan, and even get a little lucky to survive.In my most memorable game, I made it to my second winter (no small feat), had some supplies laid in, and a successful trap line going, with a frozen river nearby so I could fish. A pack of starving wolves happened upon me at my cabin and prowled around the place for weeks while I slowly starved. I eventually had no choice but to come out swinging. I had waited long enough. The fight was brutal and I killed three of them, while the fourth and fifth ran off. I was badly mauled and died a few days later.			"

												... I bought this game a few days ago? But somehow I have 70 hours played? ... something doesn't seem right... what day is this?...In all honesty though this game has been developed for 20 years, and it comes through so strongly in the details. Beneath the pixilated surface, this is the deepest, most vibrant, living, breathing, natural world I've ever seen in a game. And if you don't want to buy it here, you can download it for free off their website and leave them a donation.It's roguelike nature, yo. It's coded in all of our DNA to love and get a huge thrill out of this game. I'd say the downside is the UI is a bit obtuse, but once you get the hang of it, it's a pretty effective way to play without ever using a mouse.			"

												UnReal World is a wilderness survival game set in iron age Finland. It's tile-based and turn-based, and has been in development for decades. The pixel art is great, as is the immersion. The mechanics are on point--incredibly deep gameplay. If you enjoy 2D and survival games, you will enjoy this.			"

												After downloading and playing it I've re-purchased.When not concerned about the time and using out of the game resources and tutorials and just treating the in game tutorial as something that gives random bonuses instead of something to focus on it's been a much better experience.-=-=-=-  Original review -=-=-=-The game seemed to have promise and I want to like it but the 'tutorial' is terrible.  It introduces tasks in the wrong sequence and doesn't let you work on the relevant task until you finish the preceding task.For example to build a fire you need to chop down a tree but you can't do the task for chopping down a tree until you build a fire.  Once you build the fire you need to chop down another tree to complete the chopping down a tree tutorial.It eventually tells you to catch a fish but every body of water I can find says that there are no fish available.  I can't sleep because it's constantly raining so I'm crawling around trying to find somewhere I can catch a fish so I can move on to how to build a shelter.Tutorials should not be an exercise in frustration like the tutorial for this game is.  If the developers don't want to fix the sequence of events for the tutorial at the minimum they should allow the player to view all tutorial options and give credit as they are completed.It appears that fish is a poor choice of first food types because it is so dependent on finding somewhere that the game will allow you to fish that you end up starving to death trying to find somewhere to get food.While the game might get better as you get more familiar with how it works (my second game was less frustrating then my first game) there is a limited refund window on Steam and as poorly as the game is currently playing I don't want to exceed that window it in hopes that the game gets better.
