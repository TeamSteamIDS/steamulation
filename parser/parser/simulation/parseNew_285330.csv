												A few tips for newer players...1.Merry-go-round by the entrance. It is law.2.Crank up prices of umbrellas when it rains. They will buy no matter what.3.Guests who like the ride will go back on if the entrance queue is close to the exit.4.If you put a first aid station by the exit ofthrill rides and coasters, it will prevent a lotof vomit.

												Ahh Steam I see what you did here. Your trying to take all my free time away from me! Dont worry you can have it. Ahh my childhood. Well over 1000+ hours on this baby and still kicking strong. When I found out they had it for steam and it worked on my new desktop instead of those funky colors, I was stoked! Now I am continuing my saves that are on my backup drives from years ago! Its a blast still to this day. Heck I first got this game in elementary school at a Scholastic book sale. It was THE LAST DISK avalible. Man, to thinkthat if there was one more class before us, I may have never found out about this gem. Not a fan of the new 3D versions, wish they would go back to the old way and just update everything again. RCT2....forever and ever. 10/10 would go back to elementary and get disk again.			"

												Selling Points- You can get parkgoers to wander the outskirts of the map like they're Tom Hanks in Cast Away- Pirate Ship ride breaks down more than an emo middle-schooler- You can build queue lines the length of a small highway- Everybody loves the go-karts- Guests can spend several months in line for the go-karts- By the time some kids reach the front of the line for the go-karts they will be old enough to drive an actual car- Guest populations rivaling that of some small countries will show up if your park contains nothing but go-karts- you can build go-karts- you can also build roller coasters10/10			"

												Welcome back to Roller Coaster Tycoon. If you remember anything about the first game, then you'll know everything about this version. Right off the bat, the only big difference is larger parks to put your fiendish death coasters into. Other than that, there are minor difference here and there such as now your patrons will take photos of cool stuff like coasters. They can now seek out a first aide station if they feel very sick and if they run out of cash, there's always an automatic teller machine! You'll also find a coaster designer out of game. Other than that, the difficulty seems to have gotten ramped up from the previous game. There are no easy victories here, but its not about the victory, since all 58 scenarios are unlocked from the start. Because this is Triple Thrill Pack, its not just RCT2, but its got all three expansion packs in one dirt cheap price.For anyone that doesn't know, Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 and 2 are theme park management games that let you build roller coasters and plop down attractions in an isometric view. What really makes RCT stand out more than any other management game is the fact that you indeed design your own roller coasters! Its fun and easy, first select the type of attraction, then put down a platform and you can make it as long or short as you want. Then in most cases make a lift hill, then some turns, drops, ups and downs, spirals, loops, a helix, a cobra roll and so on. Every type of coaster has different trains, tracks, and specifics.After you're done with your coaster, make an entrance and an exit. Don't forget a line cue to your entrance. This is for everyone waiting in line. A long line cue means boredom sets in and you might need to hire a mascot to entertain them as they wait. Having beautiful decorations also helps keep people entertained. There are many different themes to enable. Even more with the three expansion packs! Perhaps too many, but having so much lets you create something you want.Rides get broken down into three ratings. Excitement, intensity and nausea. To boost excitement, add more decorations, set it next to another ride if not through another ride. Every visitor has their own preference. some can tolerate high nausea, others want low intensity and so on. The tighter the turns, the higher the nausea rating. When someone comes out of your ride they can be sick. So from there have benches waiting for them to rest and regain their composure otherwise they'll heave on the ground and then you'll need handymen tot clean it up.You can hire an array of staff, handymen, mechanics, entertainers and security. Then assign them each to have a patrol. Its a nice system to cover a lot of ground. Handymen and other staff have check boxes to determine what you want them to do, stuff like water gardens, clear out trash and mow lawns. Its all your choice.If you don't want to build coasters, there are pre-built designs that you can plop down, but you can reap the benefits by making your own custom coaster. You can make it dip down into the ground for a tunnel, hang over water and contour it to the hills and valleys of your land to save money.There's even a new feature in RCT2 that will let you design your own coaster without needing to build it right there on the fly in a theme park. This is a money saving feature, because building one in your theme park still costs you money and you might run out. The only problem with using the design editor is that if you need to use the tool, you'll need to save your game, drop out of it, go back into the menu, select the design tool, open it up, make a coaster, save it, get out of the editor, jump back into your save game and then plop down your custom coaster as a pre-built. Some people just want to design coasters, they don't want all the frills of managing an entire park and the coaster designer lets  you do that. RCT2 cares about those people.I mentioned the 58 scenarios, each one puts you into a pre-existing area, such as a castle, an airfield, and yes even the moon itself. It definitely adds a lot of flair and character that the original game lacked without expansion packs. While these environments are big, detailed and beautiful on their own, I feel like its too much to just start out in. You've got dozens of paths going everywhere when all you need to start is a quarter of a gigantic park. So then to keep from having your visitors walk all over the place, you'll put down barricades over your paths that don't let them cross.Each one of these scenarios has different conditions to win. Everything from get X amount of dollars in Y amount of years to having X amount of patrons in your park by year Y. There's a lot of variety and between the conditions and the environments, it keeps the game interesting and fresh from park to park. It gives me a reason to keep playing, because one year in the game is an hour in real life. These scenarios often last 3+ years, making for what could be a 175 hour game and that's assuming you stop playing a scenario when you complete it! You can keep going on and on to your heart's content.The longer you go, the more your rides will break down. A new ride draws more people while an old ride, just feels stale and familiar. That's why you can save the ride, bulldoze it for some money and rebuild it again at full price! Its not just fictional parks in Africa or medieval times, there's a section of real life parks from the late 90s. Six real life parks including Magic Mountain and others owned by Six Flags.Outside of roller coasters, log rides and anything else with a track, there are lesser rides that you can just plop down and make an entrance and an exit to. You can customize the entrances with themes and customize the paths, ground height, water, plants and so on. It all costs a price of course, but you can make exactly what you want to. Speaking of that, if you want to turn your roller coasters into death traps go for it! Its one of the fun things about the game. Make a power launch roller coaster shoot people off the rails sending them to their demise! Don't expect anyone to ever ride the coaster ever again, even after you fix it! Cowards.Your guests will need to eat, drink and go to the bathroom, so don't forget to place vendors in strategic locations. They'll need places to sit and garbage cans too. There is a wide array of shops too, sunglasses, T-shirts, caps and balloons to sell. Place them where people are happiest and they'll spend for sure.You'll get to manage the park's finances, but you won't get lost or overwhelmed. Its all pretty easy. You can quickly take out a cheap loan from the bank if you need money. You can spend money on advertising for the park, specific rides or other such things and they have a great impact on your visitors. To unlock new attractions, you'll need to put money into research. The more money per month, the quicker rides will be enabled in the scenario.With everything said, RCT2 like its predecessor is a relaxing time sink that you can enjoy for decades like I did. I was still playing RCT2 on CD-ROM before it came to Steam! There's something here for management fans, coaster buffs and creation enthusiasts. While I feel like the vanilla version of RCT2 didn't have that many parks for the original price tag, the three included expansion packs make it a much better game.			"

												RCT2 will always be a part of my life. It is part of a select few that I can play at any point in my life and still enjoy it as much as the first time. All nostalgia aside, the game holds up extraordinarily well. It's an absolute blast to play and it will keep you wanting to come back for more. The mechanics in the game are sound and fun. Speaking of sound, the soundtrack is one of a kind (looking at you Merry-go-Round). You can make realistic parks, to something straight out of your imagination for the possibilities are endless. The controls are straight forward, as well as the concept and goals so there is little to no difficulty curve. PLEASE give this gem a try if you haven't already. You deserve to experience this PC gaming classic! "

												This game. Oh man, this game. I got my first disk copy out of a box of Cheerios, and I played the absolute hell out of it. I easily poured about three thousand hours into that disk, and I loved every second of it. By the end of it I had well over 200 save files, some of which were actual serious parks and the rest simple sandbox parks where I had no objective and just ♥♥♥♥ed around with the patrons.Then, the unthinkable happened. A virus destroyed the family computer, and when we got a new one, I found that the disk refused to install on it.Fast forward ten or so years later. I was browsing steam out of boredom when I stumbled across Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 again, bundled together with its two expansion packs for a humble price of $11 CAN. Childhood memories came rushing back in a blur and I nearly fell off my bed in sheer excitement. A week later I got my hands on a copy of the game (Thank you, Jordy!!) and I was soon on my way to a serious nostalgia trip.The Pros!It is a legitimate challenge while still being fun! The game, yes, does get quite frustrating at times but there is never any disappointment in starting over. It just leaves you with a feeling of knowing you can do better in your next try. Plus there is nothing more satisfying than building a successful park and watching the money pour in.Truly a game for all ages. Considering how far I managed to get as a kid, and how I still love it as an adult years later shows how easy it is to grasp and master by younger audiences, while still being challenging and entertaining enough to hold the attention spans of older gamers. It is because RCT2 can be as easy or as difficult as you want it to be, solely with the help of;The scenario editor. It is a separate game mode accessed through the main menu screen, and it offers up a near endless stream of custom parks long after you have beaten the rest of the ones included in the game. You can customize things such as the guests' preference to less or more intense rides, the rules on the park property itself (IE; ride height and land modifying restrictions), hell, even the climate of the area itself. There is so much there that can be tweaked to your liking, so you are left with a park that is catered to your own unique sense of challenge.Building Roller Coasters is awesome. There is a huge selection of ride types to work with, giving a lot of opportunity for creativity. Building the rides is strangely relaxing, too.Honourable Mentions:- Graphics and animations are awesome for a game from 2002- UI is simple and easy to navigate- Very minimal bugs and glitchesThe Cons!Patron and Staff AI is simple, and not in a good way. It is quite stupid and can get frustrating at times. (Guests don't know how to use First Aid centres, or how to find the bathrooms/food stalls. They're like tiny, ant sized cattle, all aimlessly wandering around in circles.)Game has some compatibility issues. Particularly with newer computers (Win 7 and on), but all of those problems can be easily fixed with these guides.Game can get a little boring sometimes. especially during periods where you have no money to work with, and end up waiting for funds from rides and shops to stock you up again. It's a problem that veterans of the Sim City games will be familiar with. If you have a consistent stream of money coming in from those sources however, it won't be much of a problem.The Final Verdict!Despite its flaws, Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 is a solid theme park simulator that has aged well. And for under fifteen dollars, you really can't go wrong. I recommend it wholeheartedly with a 9/10. "

												It's pretty hard not to do a joke review about this game with all of the top-tier memes it gives you.However, this is a game I hold dearly. It has a place in my heart no other game can fill, and it will always be the first computer game I ever had that gave me something to show off to friends with.You see, if you got this game from a cereal box (like most of us did), you are part of the best generation to experience PC gaming.Or, who knows. Maybe you played the crap out of text-based adventures back in the day and just happened to love sugary cereal at the tender age of adulthood.It truly was a good time to get into the idea of gaming on your computer. Not because legendary, classic titles came in cereal boxes, but because everyone of the ""common genres"" of game weren't set in stone yet and plenty of new companies were making PC games that were always probing an aspect of the video game that hasn't been looked into before. Nowadays the market of new games can be separated into ""niche indie titles"", ""AAA games with PC ports"" and the rare ""well-rounded good game"". Back then... you had the Tycoon series.Ladies and gentlemen, the Tycoon series of games was probably what saved me from adolescent boredom and actually gave me something fun to do on Windows 98.Bored after school? Boot up ""Extreme Heights"" and build another coaster that manages to do 10 loops in a row.You could basically build whatever park you wanted and force dumb, oblivious NPCs to eat up whatever crap you make. The system was intricate. It was always giving you feedback for how reasonable your setup is, as well as fine-tuning over even the most menial tasks.The slow nature of the game gave the players a lot of choice and challenge. Do you spend all of your money at once for something that can either make or break the park, or build a bunch of safe, small rides that will only gradually build me money?It feels a little weird writing this review because of the fact that I never really stopped with RollerCoaster Tycoon games. It's a game I will always respect and my one hope is that it is never lost and forgotten.The nostalgia value in this game is equivalent to Sock 'Em Boppers and Lincoln Logs.			"

It will work with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 (I've tried ALL as I have owned the game since 2002 as a disk, but recently bought it on Steam) It is a fantastic theme park building game! It may seem a little complicated at first for absolute newcomers, but to RCT major fans like myself, it's a fantastic, superb game!			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is likely my favorite game of all time.I've put much more than 500 hours into it spanning my entire life and continued to play it as a non-steam game whilest it was not available on Steam. When I saw that it was, my wallet got sad, because in just a few moments my money was gone.This is in my opinion THE best RollerCoaster video game in existance, and well for that matter in my opinion the best Tycoon game of any developer. Everything is made to a precise definity and managing your park is easy, but at the same time heavily difficult! The more you know about how to play this game, the more fun it becomes.There is no game out there like this one, and at first glance it might seem like a learning curve but it's actually quite straight forward, and I don't think anybody who could understand this game could play it and not enjoy it.Manage parks, build sweet rides, customize e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g to your desire and get creative with coaster designs! There is literally not much that this game does NOT have to offer in regards to a coaster park simulator, and even more is here with the thrills from the Triple Thrill Pack.Endless entertainment, thousands of ways to keep you entertained, and it's publicity proves that this game has a great reputation. I give it a 10/10, and it's not easy to get that from me. Let's just hope it stays that way for the upcoming RollerCoaster Tycoon 4!...and enough of this 4mobile bull****.			"

												Part of my childhood is now in my Steam Library.Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is a fun addictive sim game, where the goal is to create a park and achieve a specific objective. Whether it be get so many people to your park, have a high park rating by year 3, etc. You can achieve this by creating rides, adding decorations, hiring staff members to keep the park in shape, adding food stands, the list goes on and on. While Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 was the original, this game feels like it takes it one step further. Cleaning up the UI, adding new decorations, fixing some AI and adding completely new rides. Now you may be thinking, ""why by this version when I can buy RCT3 which is in 3d?"" Thats where I think they went wrong by making the game 3d. It doesnt have the charm that this game has. I did have a problem where the game was crashing on me whenever I saved or loaded game. I managed to fix it by running the game in Windows XP (SP2) and admin. I'm running Win. 8.1, so this fix might not work for all of you.  All in all I recommend this game to people who like casual games, sim games, fun games (not really a category but the game is fun), heck even a hardcore gamer might like this (Im a hardcore gamer so hopefully you share this opinion) For a great value of $10 you can have hours, upon hours of entertainment, which includes everything RCT2 has to offer! I had the basic version of the game when I was a kid, so to see the new stuff they added that I never got to experience makes the game even more worth it. Overall I give this game a 8.5/10. Get this game, its completely worth it!			"

												Rollercoaster Tycoon is still one of the best, if not the best, Parksimulators out there (beating RTC World isnt really hard at all though). I have it since 2005, but had to rebuy it on Steam again just for the sake of it. The base principle of how to play it is kinda simple, but can still entertain one for hours.But even though its a simple principle theres a lot of different things to do and to build. Especially if youre building all your Attractions yourself with decoration and stuff. If you want to, you can even make your own Campaign with an inbuilt editor, which i think is pretty nice.What you shouldnt expect is 1080p graphics or such stuff, but who would even? The game is over 12years old by now and still one that wont get boring "

												Ignore the hours played, I've been playing this game ever since it came out in 2002.This game is probably my all-time favourite game. Ever. The amount of charm and replayability this game has is just amazing. The beautifully crafted sprites aged extremely well, making this still a beautiful game even in [current year]. The game mechanics are rock solid, same goes for the performance. If my toaster would run Windows, it would run this game.The only  problem with this version is that it's missing support for modern day resolutions. That's why I'd recommend using  Open Roller Coaster Tycoon [openrct2.org]for the maximum amout of joy. It brings support for all resolutions imaginable, and some nifty new features to make this amazing game even better.			"

												Where I grew up, in rural eastern Ukraine, in the early 2000's, there was no internet, no smartphones, no kfc and NO FREE PORN! There was however intel pentium...and Roller Coaster Tycoon!!. I remember spending hours, meticulously building my park from scratch, earning milions on big rides and food, attracting 6k+ guests into my park...and then torturing them, by cutting off the escape routes, flooding paths and charging $15 for toilet. And it was magical, pure joy. Even now, with the graphics definitely looking tired, it will bring you hours of very simple fun, build a ride and see how much you can charge before guests say its enough. Or starve them, then build one burger bar, put a very steep price and watch money flooding in. Or even better, build a coaster that will eventually crash, then comfort all the mourners with free black balloons...and free rides on the coaster that just has crashed! Yes, this game was always my favourite, a safe haven where I could unleash all my sadistic fantasies! And after all these years, nothing has changed, I still love to see the message 'Robert D. has just drowned'.			"

												I once made a beautiful theme park with the most modern rides, and it was incredibly popular. Little did customers know though, how much I hated humanity. So one day I forced a whole park of people to stay inside the park, with only a tiny area for them to stay in with no food or water. This was phase one of the trap. Shortly after I let them suffer, I destroyed the ground from underneath them, watching them plunge into a cleverly placed pool of water for them to all drown. I had achieved the perfect mass murder. Then I went home and played RollerCoaster Tycoon 2.			"

Rank: 8/10Recommendation(s): Don’t expect to play a classic on new systems.Major Theme: Old school means it doesn’t need any schooling.Bought at Price: $5.99 (Steam Sale)I might be one of the select few to have actually played this game with real CDs (yes CDs… Not DVDs). Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 were my go to games before I joined Steam.Maybe it’s the simplicity of the title, or the enjoyment of charging people to go to the bathroom. Whatever the case might be, if you have an older system you are likely to enjoy this title.If you happened to give into Microsoft marketing and upgraded to 8/8.1/10, you should seek OpenRCT2 in addition. RC2 is a game built in assembly (really, just look at the system requirements) it will almost be required for you to use OpenRCT2 to play this title.The game plays out of the box on Windows 7, but beware that it uses a lower color depth, and alt+tab users should not be alarmed by the change in color modes.Resolutions are also minimally supported, the max usable for 16:9 users being 720. Obviously, you aren’t playing this game for the “leading” graphics.All the other later games in the series personally don’t seem to add anything meaningful, so I’d advise you to just grab RC2 and leave it at that.

A sad man that just wished to see his family after waiting in line for ""Walk alot to get here and die"" which was a fine atraction built apon the park named ""Why do you want to die"". After waiting for so long the ride shut down and he was forced to walk through the exit, at this point he did'nt realise what had happened... He quickley realised the path he was on led to no where and he was doomed to walk this path until the day he dies. He continues walking the path as he spouts depressed phrases such as, ""I want to go home."" and ""I cant find the exit to the park."" and even once ""I have the strangest feeling someone is watching me.""

You keep your guests happy while managing your eceonmy to be able to afford larger and more impressive attractions like huge rollercoasters. You can design your own, or take pre-made designs.Pro: Addicting (in a good way), great gameplay and tons of stuff to do.Con: Very dated graphics			"

												Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, a classical themepark building game which I grew up with. Best one out there for sure, since, what is there not to love?Create the park of your dreams, with loads of rides, theming and so forth. Create extreme rollercoasters and watch your guest ride it (and crash it, I mean, hey, thats fun time to time ;) ), create flat rides like a Merry-Go-Round (and eventually getting Controle Failure, freaking you out should it be the first time of you experiencing it as the music speeds up), create thrill rides (potentially crashing this as well), water rides, stalls and so forth in your park. Besides building (and just screwing around), you also need to take care of your guests needs; example of this is put enough toilets in your park, drink stalls, food stalls and so forth, while also hiring staff whom clean your paths, maintain the rides, entertain guests, and even get rid of vandals.Though, admittedly, the guest AI can be dumb at times. Make a double path, and your guests can get lost at times. Your path is close to the exit, but it doesnt connect to it, so they have to walk around? They'll get lost. Pathfinding of them isn't too well at times. But, let this not break the game for you!Besides the issue described above, there is much to do in this game. But BE WARNED. This game will suck up a lot of time, when you have fun. Time can fly, as you make your own parks, and do things you want.After all these years, it still holds up. So.. why are you still reading this? Shoo, throw money at your screen in a desperate attempt, buy it, and have fun drowning people- eh, I mean building rollercoasters!It's a definite 10/10.			"

												When I was looking for a flash drive in my desk, I happened upon a disk that I had nearly forgotten about. My old copy of Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 had survived through 3 different operating systems, 4 computers and much more, but I hadn’t used it since 2010. I popped it in my computer and started to install, but to my dismay the years had caught up with it and the installation had failed.It then occurred to me that Steam may have a copy, and indeed it does. I haven’t played this game for so long, but starting it up to hear the old theme brought me back immediately. While I do assume that most buyers here on steam are gamers looking for nostalgia, I would like to talk about the game for possible newcomers as well.While RCT 2 may not be too big of a change compared to the original, there is no doubt that there is much more for you to do. More rides, stalls, park options and more are available, along with plenty of rides inspired by Six Flag rides. Customization within the game can feel endless, building everything from log plumes to corkscrew rollercoasters, but you can always just take pre-built rides if you’re in a rush as well. While customization is the main idea of RCT 2, management is also important. If you want to build more, you’re going to need more mechanics to keep your rides running. If your rides are intense people will puke and that will mean more handymen. You have to juggle expenses with customer happiness to make sure you don’t go out of business, and make sure you hit the park’s goal in time too.This is not to say that the game is perfect—there are plenty of little glitches that are infuriating at times. There are two types of parks: those you pay to enter, and those that are free but are charged for individual rides. When playing a pay-to-enter, you set your admission. When your park has a lot of great rides you can charge more, but that doesn’t mean your guests know that. I’ve built huge, sprawling parks and charged admission at $80+, still winning “best value park” awards, but people only carrying $20, $40 or $68 may still come up to my gates, only to be denied entry. This means that all these potential guests (and revenue) just doesn’t come into my park.Along with this are little other bugs. Wide-screen is all but impossible without modification to the game, and guests can complain about “over-crowding” when there are too many people on one path, even get stuck on paths if there are too many people on it, creating an endless loop. The simple solution would be to have a double-wide path, but the AI continues on, ignoring the extra space and complaining the entire time. In the end this won’t do too much to hurt your score, but the fact remains that if you look at your guests aggregate thoughts, be prepared for things you can’t fix. Bugs aside, I still see RCT2 is a masterpiece. As I work now to perfect every park, it seems hard to believe this game is almost 12 years old. You can see it in its graphics and mechanics, but it still has plenty of charm. If you love Tycoon games, I definitely recommend this one. Between customization, management and plenty of other options, this game still has plenty of charm, for newcomers and veterans alike.			"

												The exact game that came out of cereal boxes I remember from many years ago, Rollercoaster 2 never ceases to amaze, both for those who are creative and those who simply enjoy tycoon-based games. Even if you're not a rollercoaster afficianado, I would still highly recommend this game for the unique and fun gameplay associated with it.The only qualms I have is it is somewhat glitchy when it comes to graphics, which is expected for a game made many years ago attempting to run on Windows 7 and beyond.10/10			"

I'd name a dude after a bully, and I would drown him, and it would be hilarious cuz nobody else cared. Only the 'ticker' cared.They only care if you kill dudes on the rides, which is fantastic.This game is all charm. Its not irritating in the least, and you can easily go hours building the perfect rollercoaster, and have it kill just....everyone.I love this game.100/10 = 10/1 = 10/10			"

												Blast from the past with RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. The Triple Thrill Pack is worth your money if you're an 80's/ 90's babe who spent day in and day out on your boxy, white, PC. Shorter wait times and better graphics are just an added bonus when you get to feel six years old again. We all knew it was a good game back in the day next to Zoo Tycoon and Freddy Fish but I am so happy to see one of my childhood fav's holding it's own in terms of entertainment in the 21st CE. No word of a lie if you're into building, planning, and variously epic gestations: chuck the Minecraft and give birth to an amuzement park. Lalalove it.			"

												Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is one of the most amazing simulation games to date. The potential for creativity is unlimited in this game, where the world - or in this case, your theme park - is literally your playground. Create to your hearts content, challenge yourself with tough and fun missions, and build breathtaking rollercoasters. It's all up to you!Even though Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is out and is also a very well made game, there's something about the premise and the nostalgia of RCT2 that makes it superior to its sequel. If you have a spare $10 in your pocket and are willing to let your creativity  run wild, buy this game. You will not regret it.(P.S - The best part about this game is that you can drown 2000 guests at once)			"

												This is the first game i have ever played.For me it was everything, and it actually still is.The simple yet so clear concept.The total freedom of choice.You can create your own landscape's, theme park, build unique rollercoasters, treat you customers as you like(even drowning them or performing acts of torture) You can build various attractions, from easy slow going attractions, to exciting attractions and even rollercoasters.Building attractions is not the only thing you need to focus on, your guests will also have needs that you need to satisfy.For instance, plop a few drink and food stalls so your customers can eat, but also plop some benches to sit on, and some garbage cans for your guests to leave their garbage. If not the garbage will be thrown on the ground and give your park a bad reputation.Attractions don't make the park, no. You'll also need to make it pretty. Plant some flowers in your park. Add decor and theme's. There are various theme's to choose from. For instance, candyland or the jungle theme. But it's not all as easy at it seems.You'll also need to hire staff. Staff such as mechanics to inspect attractions and fix them if they break down. But also security guards, to prevent your guests from breaking stuff in your park.This all costs money, money and money. You'll need guests to keep your park operational. You can do whatever you want, if you want to play with money, you play with money. If you don't want to play with money, you play with unlimited funds. Does that make it easy? Still, not. Your guests still rate your park on various aspects such as the beauty, safety, waiting queue's, the overall beauty of the park and lots more.This game is old, but certainly not bad.I favor this game over RollerCoaster Tycoon 3.

												I defo recommend this game to play. I used to play this when i was a kid and it's my favourite one out the other 2, I was happy to see this on steam as i lost my disc years ago, had no choice but to buy it. Only problem i had was it had problems running on Windows 8 but i managed to get it sorted and it works perfectly. Now im riding the rollercoaster down memory lane :)If your having problems with it running on Windows 8, Go to the local files (right click RCT2 on steam, click on properties, then click on local files and select browse local files) and right click RCT2 and selct ""Create Shortcut"". The shortcut should be on the desktop, double click the shortcut and it will launch the game (Thats what I did)			"

												This game is almost the defenition of a ""perfect"" game. Keep in mind I said almost, but that is beside the point. This game lets you create a theme park and watch as hundreds upon THOUSANDS of tiny little guests enter your park, buy your merchandise, and ride your crazy rides. This game is much more linear compared to its sequel (which is not a good game at all) which makes it a much better choice for amusement park management. The amount of insane roller coasters that you can create with all the endless amounts of combinatios of scenery of foliage to surround those roller coasters and rides and transform them into attractions. The only thing that is bad about the game is the guests AI. If they see something in the distance, like a massive to scale model of ""Millenium Force"" from Cedar Point, Ohio, and there is a square of path that doesn't connect to the path ""Millenium Force"" is on, they will just run around in circles and annoy you. But i can't complain that much because this game was created by only A SINGLE PERSON, Chris Sawyer. This man was an absolute wizard creating this game. Very Very great game. 9.8/10			"

												I remember playing the first RCT many years ago, and loving it. I'd call it a timeless classic. This game is basically RCT 2.0, and that's a great thing indeed. Something I want to mention is that I'm playing on Windows 10, and have had absolutely no issues. Can even alt-tab without anything breaking.Gameplay;Fantastic. Addictive. Fun. Almost perfect for what it is. You really do have full control over how you build your park. Lots of customization and fine-tuning, with lots of selections for rides and shops. You oversee every aspect of your park, and making changes to any small detail is usually easy. The one complaint I have is how often visitors puke. It gets frustrating when you're trying to keep up your park rating.Level design/world/visuals;Not gonna lie, it can be a bit annoying trying to expand parks in scenarios. There's gonna be lots of rides and paths already in the park, and working around it can get frustrating. It's not terrible, though. Despite being released in a time when games came in cereal boxes, the visuals are honestly very good. They're pixelated, but full of detail. The animations are also good. Sound;Awesome. Quite a few tracks that can be selected for lots of different rides, all of which are good. The theme song/main menu music is by far the most memorable.Content;Virtually endless. It all depends on how much you enjoy the game, or how long you spend on one park. You can play one park/scenario for hours and be done, or replay every scenario multiple times. Or, make your own scenarios! Verdict;Couldn't be happier with this game. Definitely one of my favorites; one that I see myself playing on and off for quite a few years. As is the first installment, it's a classic. And, in my opinion, still the best after the release of the 3 big rollercoaster-park type games.			"

												A classic staple of the Roller Coaster Tycoon franchise, the 2nd installment is a great game for any theme park fan! The game's selections over rides can be great, though after a while its selection will get a bit boring. There isn't enough flat rides to go, Then again thats why we always have mods! It's design gives us a time of when video games were simpler. It can be fun to build roller coasters... or drown your guests. This game is fun for anyone, and I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Atari, Chris Sawyer, Theme Parks, Roller Coasters, or anything in that mix!			"

												I had bought the original version back in late 2003 when I had realized there is no expansions. Both of them were out when I bought it but didn't care for them at the time. If you like isometric business tycoon games then this is a must have. This is the sequel to the orignal Roller Coaster Tycoon with bunch of improvements here and there. The secenarios that came with this are more challanging and there is placeable scenery which you can theme your attractions in your parks more. The roller coaster can have a block braking technology which will prevent trains from crashing each other if you place them correctly.Since it will not work well in Windows 10 so I would recomend you download this. It's free! https://openrct2.com/BTW I do stream this game on my Twitch channel as one of the games I stream most: www.twitch.tv/neal08ni "

Not only can it help you run this game (and Rollercoaster Tycoon), it adds features that did not exist in the original.Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 took the winning formula of Rollercoaster Tycoon and made a few tweaks, added a few features.  This was probably my favorite of the series, mainly because of the interface improvements over the first game.  More rides, more shops, more coaster options, loads of fun.

												RCT2 is one of the best games ever made. RCT1 was already amazing, and RCT2 has a few quality-of-life improvements to the gameplay that make advanced parkbuilding even easier. All the best scenarios were made for RCT1, but fans have ported them over to RCT2. You can download them from third-party sites and play them in RCT2.I haven't played it much lately, and when I do, it's not via Steam. I use OpenRCT2. But between RCT1 and RCT2 I probably have 500 to 1500 hours of playtime. If you like business sims and/or amusement parks, this is the game to get.			"

												A simple and easy to play game.The user is in charge of running an amusement park, and is allowed to make their own coasters and rides, along with placing foods and drinks, souvineirs and maps around the park, whilst remaining in budget and keeping customers happy.With an endless combination of how you want to run your park and how you want it to look like, you're able to let your imagination go wild.I recommend this game to people who enjoy to make their own creations, and building simulators. However, this game crashes with newer windows OS based computers. This can be fixed by installing OpenRCT, and I highly recommend this extension if you plan on playing this game. Because the crashes are random, you do not know when to save. OpenRCT fixes these crashes.			"

RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 woos you with it's nostalgia merry-go-rounds and joyful screams as people ride the rollercoasters you built. The insane customisation and amazingly vast array of fun things to do and keep your guests busy in return getting more money to build more stuff.The game runs very fast as it is an old game and you can see so much, of course it isn't a PERFECT game as it has some restricted ways on how to get some rides working and everything is on a grid. But even with it's irks it is a really wonderful game.			"

												Revisting the first game I've ever played has been a wonderful experience. It runs just as well on a Windows 7 machine as it does on an old XP (better, actually!). It's simple enough to be easily picked up and played with, but there's still challenging scenarios to play through and have fun with so that it's not too easy. Customization is pretty thorough - there are lots of scenery elements for many different types of aesthetic, plenty of rides (both prefabricated and custom-built track-types), lots of food vendors and trinket shops (balloons are popular!), and you can easily alter the landscape for underground building or filling in ponds and such. Word to the wise: Don't play it without picking up the patch that allows you to put it into windowed mode - it's way too annoying otherwise. If you're a fan of tycoon games, you really ought to pick this one up. I've heard things about the game not running on Windows 8 or 10, but I can't be for certain.			"

												PROS:-It's Rollercoaster Tycoon-It's pretty much the same as the first game except with more stuff, meaning they didn't ruin everything. The ATM and boatload of scenery is especially a nice touch-I've read it's considered the ""best"" Rollercoaster Tycoon, meaning there's likely a healthy supply of fanmade content for the gameCONS:-20 second long crowd noise loop still irritating as hell. ""ROLLER COASTER"" ""BUT WHYYYYY"" ""EHAHAHAHAHA. BWAAAHH. OOOHOOOOHOOOHOOO."" It was cute for nostalgic reasons for about 2 minutes before I wished they made a longer, more varied sound for crowded areas-It's pretty much the same as the first game except with more stuff, meaning they didn't seem to add that much-The scenarios suck my toes. Almost all of the ones I've tried so far make you wonder if they even put any thought into making them. Half the time the existing rides don't even have names. The scenery looks good (or, at least, it probably did back in the day, so I'm trying to judge it on that) but most of the time it just gets in the way. Sometimes guests get lost on the pre-existing paths. You rarely allowed to charge per ride so you're stuck entirely relying on vendors and admission fees. Give me Forest Frontiers or Dynamite Dunes over Alcatraz and Rio anyday-Maybe I haven't figured it out yet but it seems like there's no way to access the Steam community inside the game, which makes playing while you're chatting with someone a pain in the neck.Overall, despite my criticisms, it's cheap and fun and it's in no way worse than the original (aside from the scenarios). If you're asking yourself if you want to pick it up, you probably do.			"

												Hands down the best tycoon game out there. It has aged for sure, but still remains fun and challenging. I'd like to point out you can play the original scenarios from the first game as well -just google RCT 1 scenarios for RCT 2- which, in my opinion, are a lot more fun than the RCT2 ones. Would also like to give a shoutout to OpenRTC2. This project aims to ""translate"" RCT2 into another coding language (simply put) which would allow for actual mods etc. for it to be created. Google it as well- It's still in early development, but looks very promising.			"

												Reminds me that even as a child I was messed up in the head.I actually worked out the statistics for crashes when the ride is red and when its green as a kid. If you really want people to die, make all your rides red. I don't know 100% if it does change anything but its worth a try.Try putting angry guests on a remote island on your map, then sink the ground in and put a info center down there. If you want to go the extra mile then re-name them all the bad guests: Autistic.Make a ride that launches into space, or crashes into another cart. Or one that throws them into other guests on the path.I did all this as a kid, and had a hell of a lot of fun. I can not recommend this enough to sick psychopaths like me.			"

												Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is one of those games you can't hate. Ok maybe you can hate it, but if you do, then you don't know what true fun is. Gameplay: 9/10The building in this game is fluid. The path system is very easy to use, and even has options for elevation. The rollercoaster building is a little sketchy at first but when you get used to it, then you can make some crazy stuff. Not only that the terrain tool is fantastic but with the only downside is no mountain tool like in RCT 1.Music: 10/10It's so catchy and will keep you reeled in. The music is so memorable that it will keep you humming it from days on end.Presentation: 9/10The game looks great. You can't really go wrong with 2d sprites. Everything from the peeps to the rides are so detailed that it makes your eyes bleed. But in all honesty the game looks fantastic with an overall point of ""you don't need fancy 3d graphics to make a game look good"".Overall score: 10/10There is seriously no reason as to why you shouldn't pick this game up. Weither it screams nostalgia from your childhood or even looks remotely awesome, then I would very HIGHLY reccomend this game. It will provide you with hours on end fun and amazing gameplay that you wouldn't wanna stop playing it.			"

I never listened to him, now look at my kingdom.... its full of riches and servants and i own gigantic metalic warriors that protect my people. Besides that its a great game (better than 3 in actually tryingwise in a campaign mode) also it can be a bit buggy with the a.i. having random additudes sometimes being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as (insert something that gets angry easily here) and as happy as (insert something that is always happy here) at the same time. Theres no first person or ride the coaster and ghost testing the track using a  phantom coaster so its a lot harder to make coasters. Anyhow i would definitely recommend this game, especially if its on sale. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												Many years later and still among one of my favorite games and, in my opinion, the best one in the series. Had to get the Steam edition, even though I own a disc copy. I've put probably thousands of hours into the RCT series over the years and I think I'll still be playing for many more years to come. I love the possibilities on designing my rides and parks, from the best money-maker roller coasters, to the scenery and landscape. Definitely recommend for new and returning players to the series.Never had an issue running this game, Steam or disc versions. Works on my Windows 7 64-bit system just fine.			"

												This game is a good chunk of my childhood. When my CD for this game didn't work anymore, I felt like I would never play it again. Low and behold, it's on Steam. Hallelujah. I bought right after I found out.Steam users will be able to see how awesome the RCT fanchise used to be, and how much better the 1st and 2nd games (the 3rd game wasn't too bad) are compared the more recent installments of the series (Rollercoaster tycoon 3D was bad, but 4 Mobile is worse).

Not only does it mark up many of the features that existed in the original game with wonderful new twists and treats, but also added even more brilliant innovations on the tycoon genre and makes this second game in this franchise the boldest and most fun entry since. With many freedoms and endless opportunities available to you right from the very first park you'll make, Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is definitely not only worth the money, but the hours as well.			"

												Oh baby, this game was my childhood. I remember sinking hundreds of hours into this game as a kid without every understanding what the hell I was doing. Now that I'm older, I can fully enjoy the game for what it's worth! ...Which is building giant metal death traps and killing people nonchalantly either through extreme G-forces or sending trains flying off the tracks. Ah, just like old times...I mean, I guess it's a tycoon game, but who cares about that when you can send random people into orbit and watch the train car explode when it eventually crashes into the ground?

												I used to love the 1st one. I don't know why, but the 2nd one despite being almost the same (but with more stuff) rubs me the wrong way. Maybe it's because I don't have the nostalgia feels to it.The game itself is like a big sandbox, with plenty of options to make your own distinct Luna Park. But the biggest downside for me is that you can't build rides with the time paused. And decorating can be very clumsy. And with micromanagment piling up it really frustrates me. I want to build the perfect track and not be bothered (yet) with mundane problems! This duality of building and managment wasn't as apparent to me in the 1st one, I think, because it lacked many decorations, so it was more straightforward.I must point the fact that the game is working with 16:9 aspect ratio, which is realy sweet.

												I recommend this version of the game; it seems to work quite well on windows 7 actually.Oh, and I recommend the game in general as well, of course. It's good, as others will be quick to tell you.Here are some things that are worth knowing:* Unlike my old copy of the game, saving actually DOES work in the steam version!* It is indeed an old game, and the interface may be a bit confusing if you're used to more modern fare.* The AI is incredibly dumb, which can be frustrating. Once you get used to it, it just adds a bit of challenge.* The parks can sometimes get a bit cluttered and visually confusing.* The game isn't gorgeous, but its pixel graphics do the job. The rollercoasters look great. Don't buy it for the graphics.* The game has some weird quirks, like odd sell values and not being able to build while paused.* The gameplay is still very good; designing parks is fun, designing rollercoasters is fun, there's plenty of stuff to do.

												The definitive version of RollerCoaster Tycoon.  It's not very different from the first game, but there are many small improvements here and there.  Fans have also recreated the first game's scenarios with the in-game scenario editor, so you won't be missing out.  A legendarily fun game, though having no unlockables this time is disappointing.This may not run well, or at all, if you have Windows 7 or 8.  Find the demo and see if it works on your computer.

												I recommend this game to anybody who likes amusement parks.This master piece created by Chris Sawyer is just amazing,it improved on so much from the first one (not saying the first one is bad),you get to make your own rollercoasters, workers, stalls and many more things.Some people say this game is also one of the best games to date!You can even use actual rides from the six flags parks!Rides like the great american screaming machine, and many others!So if you have the money for this game i suggest you get it, you won't have ANY regrets of buying it.

												Triple the thrill, triple the fun! This game is one of my best childhood games ever! I'm really glad Steam added it here! Build your own theme park! Build exciting roller coasters! Get a lot of guests in your park and have a full blast experience with your park! This game really brings back memories for me. Personally recommend this game to anyone who loves roller coasters and theme parks as much as I do!			"

												This review is coming from someone who purchased rct3 before purchasing rct2.  Those of you that own rct3 and are considering purchasing rct2, this review should help.  So I will list pros and cons about rct2 compared to rct3PRO'S: - The peeps (AI) form sizeable queue lines for your rides, making you feel like your ride is popular- Lag does not exist in this game- Created by Chris Sawyer- Altogether, it feels like a better game (in my opinion, of course)- Go Karts are overpowered :)- Pre-built Six Flags amusement parks - Awesome Pre-built rides (If you're lazy...)- Unique scenarios (i.e. Great Wall of China scenario where you have unlimited money but have to keep park rating above 700 at all times.)CON'S:- No 3D view like in RCT3- You can't ride your rollercoasters- Park staff are equally as useless as they are in RCT3- No nighttime phase (some would consider that a pro)CONCLUSION: Overall, there is not a significant difference between RCT 2 and 3.  Atari didn't change much for RCT3 other than 3D view.  If you thoroughly enjoyed RCT3, you will thoroughly enjoy this game.  "

												Well over a decade on, and there is not another single game I have ever played for likely even half of the time as I have RCT2.  And that includes some MMOs that have a year+ logged in time.  I nearly cried with happiness when I finally realized this was on Steam.  I bought RCT2 and the two expansions when they each launched, and the triple thrill pack - I used the TTP disc so much It was *taped together*.  I spent hours getting it to line up when it started to crack.  Thats a sign of how amazing this game is. If you find building and sim games fun, you can't go wrong here.  The customization and themes are awesome and can give hours of fun.You can also download all of the maps from the original RCT for this, a large chunk of which were released officially, and hundreds if not thousands of other maps custom designed.  There are some amazing parks out there.Fun tip, there is a .dll mod out there to run it in windowed mode.  For some reason its not default in RCT2, but it was an option in the original..			"

												10/10 One of the GREATEST resource management sims I have ever played. Playing this a kid was always a treat, and now coming back to it as a teen, all good memories come flooding back! With an Isometric view point, it would seem hard to pinpoint things (With scenery placement it is), it is surprisingly accurate with construction and pathing. This game offers many coasters and slightly improved graphics from the first, as well as Handymen NOT mowing grass. You owe it to yourself to buy this game!			"

												Now this is nostalgia!. I don't know how many hours i spent back in the early to mid 00's playing this but it was plenty. Never played the scenarios much, for me it was all about the sandbox. Just build away to your hearts content. I know a few people have had problems getting the game running (unsurprising given it's age), but maybe i got lucky as it installed and ran without issues on my Win 7 64-bit rig. You won't get it running at big resolutions, at least not without patches but it still looks OK at full screen.Recommended, to bring back those great gaming memories!			"

												The definitive version of RollerCoaster Tycoon.  It's not very different from the first game, but there are many small improvements here and there.  Fans have also recreated the first game's scenarios with the in-game scenario editor, so you won't be missing out.  A legendarily fun game, though having no unlockables this time is disappointing.This may not run well, or at all, if you have Windows 7 or 8.  Find the demo and see if it works on your computer.  It did on my version of Windows 7, so there is hope yet.			"

												The first three Roller Coaster Tycoon games are the best theme park simulators there are, from my experience none other compares to the Roller Coaster Tycoon games.Despite the failiure and disappointment brought by the DS and Smart Phone versions of the RCT games (RCT3D for the Nintendo 3DS and RCT4 for mobile) the first 3 of the series remain the best theme park simulators you will ever play. For those of you who love simulator games i would 100% recommend any of the first three RCT games, Except the Fourth PC Installment in the series which is very alienating, very boring, very lacking, and didn't deliver what was promised. Seriously, stick with the first 3 Installments, especially the second one.			"

												This is my least favourite RCT game (not counting the 3DS game and that God-Awful mobile abomination), it's not bad, it just has the most flaws in my opinion. For one, the scenarios are bland and not very memorable. Two, I personally feel the game was a little rushed since almost everything here was reused from the first instalment minus the new rides. Those are my main problems, the game is far from bad but those problems are enough to make it my least favourite of the three main RCT games. If you're looking to get into the series, I'd start with either 1 or 3. I'd give it a 7/10.			"

												This game brings back lots of childhood memories. All that time spent creating parks and in particular, tons of wild roller coasters. This game is still great even after all these years. I've played this for much longer than my Steam time shows. I've played 1, 2, and 3, and I have to say this and 1 are close in which is my favorite. The gameplay is simple yet fun, I'd recommend picking it up if you can, it's a great way to spend a couple of hours at a time trying to beat yet another scenario. There's lots of variety in parks and ride in here. Although honestly the two expansion packs didn't add much original stuff, just rethemed rides and lame scenarios that somewhat force you into a box regarding park design. You can also create your own scenarios or download ones that others have made. I'd also recommend adding the UCES expansion, a community expansion that added tons of scenery, a bunch of scenarios, and a few new rides. It might be a little hard to find now as the official site no longer exists, but there are alternate downloads around for it. Just a word of warning, the first time you run a UCES scenario, it will usually crash the game. This is normal as the first time you run the scenario any custom content used in it must be installed. The next time you select the scenario it should run just fine.If you want to make your own scenarios, you can also pick up some custom rides and themeing that are out there. Amazing Earl and Buggy are two people to look up. There is also a pack that contains almost all the scenarios from RCT1 and its expansions which have been remade for RCT2. Just google ""RCT1 scenarios for RCT2"" and that should get you something.Pros:+Great variety of rides available, including lots of roller coasters+Various scenario objectives and scenarios for lots of variety+Low system requirements will run on pretty much any computer+Lots of extra community content (if you know where to find it)+Fun way to spend a few hoursCons (These are mostly nitpicky):-Scenario editor is fairly limited, making a park that has pre-built rides is a bit round-a-bout and not the best way-Expansions don't offer much in terms of new rides, just a bunch of rethemeing-Scenario selection screen can get cluttered/hard to navigate if you have lots of scenarios installed-No career/progression. All scenarios are available from the start unlike 1 & 3.A final note, some people may have issues running this on newer machines. I have a 64 bit Windows system, and I have no problem running it at all. A demo can probably be found online, install that and run it before buying to check that it will work on your system.Overall 10/10, a classic that still stands the test of time.			"

												This game brings back lots of childhood memories. All that time spent creating parks and in particular, tons of wild roller coasters. This game is still great even after all these years. I've played this for much longer than my Steam time shows. I've played 1, 2, and 3, and I have to say this and 1 are close in which is my favorite. The gameplay is simple yet fun, I'd recommend picking it up if you can, it's a great way to spend a couple of hours at a time trying to beat yet another scenario. There's lots of variety in parks and ride in here. Although honestly the two expansion packs didn't add much original stuff, just rethemed rides and lame scenarios that somewhat force you into a box regarding park design. You can also create your own scenarios or download ones that others have made. I'd also recommend adding the UCES expansion, a community expansion that added tons of scenery, a bunch of scenarios, and a few new rides. It might be a little hard to find now as the official site no longer exists, but there are alternate downloads around for it. Just a word of warning, the first time you run a UCES scenario, it will usually crash the game. This is normal as the first time you run the scenario any custom content used in it must be installed. The next time you select the scenario it should run just fine.If you want to make your own scenarios, you can also pick up some custom rides and themeing that are out there. Amazing Earl and Buggy are two people to look up. There is also a pack that contains almost all the scenarios from RCT1 and its expansions which have been remade for RCT2. Just google ""RCT1 scenarios for RCT2"" and that should get you something.Pros:+Great variety of rides available, including lots of roller coasters+Various scenario objectives and scenarios for lots of variety+Low system requirements will run on pretty much any computer+Lots of extra community content (if you know where to find it)+Fun way to spend a few hoursCons (These are mostly nitpicky):-Scenario editor is fairly limited, making a park that has pre-built rides is a bit round-a-bout and not the best way-Expansions don't offer much in terms of new rides, just a bunch of rethemeing-Scenario selection screen can get cluttered/hard to navigate if you have lots of scenarios installed-No career/progression. All scenarios are available from the start unlike 1 & 3.A final note, some people may have issues running this on newer machines. I have a 64 bit Windows system, and I have no problem running it at all. A demo can probably be found online, install that and run it before buying to check that it will work on your system.Overall 10/10, a classic that still stands the test of time.			"

												Great game that I've been playing since I was 7. I bought it on Steam because my disk stopped working on Windows 8.1, the graphics and sound did not work properly. Everything works great with the Steam version, except sometimes the game crashes when you press exit. This doesn't matter though because the game already saved at this point. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an in-depth simulator that is not too tricky.			"

												If there's one game out there that I spent more hours playing than Skyrim, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Command & Conquer and even Pokemon combined, it would have to be this game. I started playing this back at my cousins house on their computer, addicted to creating new crazy rides and of course drowning unwanted patrons to my park. Of course that would only be as a last resort...Picking this game up again brought me back to that time when I really did enjoy this game, and still enjoy it. Even though the AI can be a bit dumb and don't know when to go to the restroom or First Aid desk if they're feeling sick. Or even when I hire on 30 mechanics and yet not one of them get to a certain ride that's my main attraction.But if you get past that, there's so much creativity that this game has potential for you'll enjoy it for hours, or even days on end. If you like playing games older simulation games like Sim City, you'll enjoy this one hands down. I highly recommend this to any of my friends or those wishing to play some good ol' nostalgia.			"

 General Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is one of the most loved all-time favourite games. A must have game no matter how retro the graphics are. RCT2 is a single player game where you manage finances while building a theme park either from scratch or partly built. Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is actually quite in-depth as the physics can change during a ride due to the weight (how many people are riding the coaster) which can increase or decrease the speed of which the train is going. Weather, hunger & ride intensity are also contributing factor to peeps happiness and some peeps will prefer certain types of rides. There are numerous scenarios to complete ranging from several difficulties, not including custom made scenarios. One of the wonders of this game is that it is moddable so you can add custom roller coaster designs or scenery. One major unofficial update to this game is OpenRCT which adds extra features, rides & scenery. It has now enabled multiplayer mode so you can build the theme park of your dreams with your mates. UI The UI couldn’t be simpler. The block style does look a little old and needs updating although this is what you get for a 2002 year old game. Finding information is very simple and can be found with a few clicks. Graphics The retro looking isometric style gives the game a great look and feel although can sometimes be hard when placing scenery in the correct position. The only downside is that some objects are not able to be placed on the same tile but this can be overcome with some trainer mods applied. I would recommend this game  "

												I picked this up because I spent way too much time playing RCT2 back in the day, but never got to play the expansions. Even though the base game has countless hours of potential, the expansions bring even more to the already expansive base.The best thing about this game is that even after almost two decades have passed, it still holds up as one of the best tycoon games, even surpassing most of the contemporary ones (especially the modern iterations of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series). You can even find ways to kill your guests if you're some kind of sadist or psycopath. In most circles, it's become one of the ""staples"" of PC gaming, standing up there with X-COM, Doom, and Half-Life.It's cheap, it ran great on old computers (and is guaranteed to run silky smooth on any machine from the last 5 years, even laptops), it's endless fun, frankly there's no reason not to get this game.

												IF YOU DOWNLOAD OPENRCT2 ONLINE THE GAME WILL WORK PERFECTLY AND IT ADDS FEATURES LIKE MULTIPLAYER BUT YOU NEED TO BUY THIS FIRST OTHERWISE IT WONT WORK.The game is great and i was really exited to come back and play this game. Like everyone who got it, I was here because of how much i played this in my childhood but when i read the reviews and saw about all the issues with the saving i thought it would be fine for me or fixed but it wasnt and the game also crashes consistently. You cant save the six flag parks and once you get going the game crashes. every time you minimize the game it crashes as well. If you plan to play the normal scenarios it would be fine or play it all in one sitting but with all these errors it isnt worth buying.			"

												The second game in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series adds stackable scenery, more types of said scenery, AND a pretty solid scenario creator. I personally played 1 a whole lot more, but I love most of the games in this series (RCT4 and RCT-3DS excluded).You manage your own theme park, right down to stalls and staff-wages. But the biggest draw is the ability to build your own RollerCoasters and other tracked-rides. You can either build the most basic ride that barely leaves the station, goes up a hill, and returns. Or you can build the most massive coaster you can afford, spanning the entire park from front to back , and left to right. There is a nice collection of pre-made scenarios that present you with a range of different challenges. Unfortunately, there is less variety in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 scenarios than there were in the original. But it makes up for that with a highly-robust scenario creator that you can use to challenge your friends with your own devilish creations.If you like any of the rest of the series, this is a pretty solid addition to your library.

												This game is one of the classics from my past, I loved building rollercoasters and watching people fly off and die as people stayed in line to ride it next, knowing their doom was soon upon them.

												I don't really know what to say about RCT2 except it's fun as hell.... There may be a bit of a learning curve when trying to create the perfect level of intensity in a coaster without scaring the pants off everyone before they ride but it's easy once you get the hang of it.You don't HAVE to build your own coasters, there are hundreds and hundreds of designs you can drag and drop if you're too lazy or not enthused enough...You wanna build a theme park without coasters you say? With only coasters? With no rides at all but only food stands and side-show attractions, such as hall of mirrors and circuses...? You can do any of that and more.RCT2 is the best RCT game out right now, ignore RCT3.BUY THIS NOW.			"

												An old game, but one of my all time favourites. The gameplay still holds up today, but be warned that this is NOT an HD remaster/remake. That means you may run into minor issues when trying to run it on Windows 7/8. That being said, I was able to play it right out of the box with no real issues.EDIT: Installing the mod OpenRCT2 really resolves a lot of these issues, as well as adding many improvements. highly recommended. This would be a bit more relavent if the regular version of RCT2 was on Steam, but the extra expansion content that comes with the Triple Thrill Pack is really not well done. Still, well worth the $10 for a timeless classic.			"

												This was a childhood favorite growing up and I was so thrilled to see it in the store. However the first time I purchased this was on a sub-par running laptop and it wouldnt make it past the loading screen. I figured it was the computer had the game refunded. Over a year later I bought it again on a brand new computer with extremely good requirements and high hopes. Unfortunately it frequently crashes at random, and when you go to save the game it instantly crashes and though I was never able to even save a game, out of hope, when I clicked to attempt to load a save game, the game instantly crashes as well and you have to completely start over. Definitely disappointed and hope these issues get resolved some day.			"

												This game is the best in the series. It has all of the features of the first game with additions and it is not streamlined like the 3rd game. You can build roller coasters, or simply buy preconstructed templates for roller coasters. Both are fun. The only problem is customer and worker AI. They will walk past food and drink stands even though they say they're starving/thirsty, get lost even though they have a map, and they treat transportation as rides, not as transportation in the park, meaning that if you have a train ride leading to an isolated part of the map, they will get stuck there and get angry and not use the train ride to go back. Handymen and Mechanics are absolute necessities, but their pathfinding is terrible. Even if you use guided pathways for mechanics, they will disobey you and inspect other rides. When you have 20+ rides, it is very hard to manage.			"

												I have this on cd rom somewhere (I think my cat ate it) and put hundreds of hours into it. We have come a long way with RollerCoaster Tycoon. It's more improved then the first one, but coming off of the 3rd one I feel lost in this one. The graphics are sooooo bad compared to the 3rd one, it's really hard to get into it again after the 3rd. Ah well, it's still a great game and the owners of this will put tons of hours into like I have. I just had to buy it on steam because my disc ran away and I wanted to revisit the parks. (Tip - Play the first 2 games before you go and get the 3rd or else you will never want to come back to the old ones.)			"

												Builds a roller coaster that goes up 150 ft. and just goes down back to the station.Everybody thinks it's too intense for them.Makes a junior baby-themed version.Makes thousands of dollars.10/10, would use AI again.After the Jr. Was built some people started to occasionally ride the 150 ft. roller coaster.10.1/10, would loose money again.

												If you dislike this game because of the graphics then you are playing it for the wrong reasons. This game has immense replay value because of the custom tracks, endless options for scenery, paths, and buildings.Having a built-in map editor is a perk as well, so you can play flat open areas to create your ultimate dream park with infinte money. Oh and also ""I WANT TO GET OFF MR BONES WILD RIDE""Whether it is nostalgia or you are new to RCT this is a great game to play and you can sink in a lot of hours before you realize you've played 8 hours straight.

												Let's start off that if you do get this game, the graphics are not on par with Planet Coaster or other indie roller coaster titles. But damn, it's god damn addicting to play.I'm using OpenRCT2 in this review since this ""add-on"" makes it playable on Windows 10, it has Twitch integration, more features and of course a tad better/upgraded graphics. And this add-on makes RCT2 even more playable just because of how many great memories this game brought back in the good ol days.Buy it, install the game, install OpenRCT2, and just spend hours building your dream park.

												I dont have RCT1 on steam,  and RCT1 and 2 are largely the same game, so I'm writing this on behalf of both games.Loved them when I was a kid, While Half Life 2 and the Sims were what cemented my interest in PC gaming when I was young, if I had to pick one game that probably got me into it in the first place, it would be Rollercoaster Tycoon.  Saw my father playing it when I was a kid and was drawn in from the start.Even for it's dated isometric style, it's aged considerably well, and I still play the Modded OpenRCT2 on Multiplayer with friends today.Whether you're playing it for nostalgia, or taking the p*ss and just making deathtraps, It's always been a great game.

												I had this game growing up as a kid and was excited to play it again but was very disappointed by this non-function, half-finished seeming game.ERRORS:50% chance of closing/minimizing successfully, the rest of the time when doing this the game will go to a smaller window with no borders and becomes completely unresponsive.YOU CAN NOT SAVE!!!! THE SAVE BUTTON DOES NOTHING!!!!I was very disappointed by this game and it is the first worthless game I have gotten from steam.			"

												I remember LOVING this game as a kid. Unfortunately, like many new games it lacks proper support for windows 10. What you are buying is a broken and unstable game. After messing with the compatability settings you will get it to run however at the cost of being plaigued with game crashes and glitches. I had a wonderful park started and then the game glitched causing me to no longer have the ability to unlock new rides and food stands. When the game does unlock things for you it seems to be in a way that doesnt make sense both in the amount of time taken, as well as which rides you unlock. Long story short is that unless you are running this game on an old OS you probably should avoid it. But if you have old operating systems you will be enjoying the game immensely. Do I reccomend this game? No, most people have windows 8 or 10 at this point and I dont know that it will run much better on 7. If you have xp I highly recommend it!			"

												It's a good game and this is a nice pack but there are some things you should be aware of. If changes have been made to the initial release then they're minimal and don't fix many issues you're likely to have. The biggest one is the resolution. There is no windowed mode so the picture always looks stretched and blurry on larger monitors. An unofficial patch can fix this. Another is a gameplay issue - big parks will always get low satisfaction ratings because stupid guests will walk deep into the park, want to go home but take forever to get out, dragging your ratings down. No entry signs are the best solution here but they're a workaround rather than a fix.			"

That leaves me only able to play the game and just hope that I can finish a level in one go with unable to saving and it not crash. I've finished 4 scenarios out of about 20 tries so 75% chance of it being a wasted effort is enough for me to cease playing until its fixed.All games have some users experiencing  problems, but this game has an unsettling high amount of players having major issues to say I do not recommened getting this game, regardless of cost (even free) until you see  comments about fixes being made.

The game is just as fun as I remember, but this steam version is HORRIBLY buggy. Frequent crashes, only being able to load a saved game about half of the time, and most annoyingly the game freezes when I try to exit, and the only way I can fix it is by restarting my computer. Truly an amazing game, I am sad that just being able to play it normally is such a difficult task. I would definitely recommend this game as soon as the user experience is improved.			"

												STEAM does NOT care about customer service or quality. I HIGHLY DO NOT suggest downloading this game from them, but to try a different online company.This absolutely ridiculous, I was told this was a good company to buy a game off and then this happens and I was refused a refund due to this. After playing this game for about an hour it started freezing and skipping. I thought it would stop so I continued to play but it has now turned into consistent freezing for long periods of time, game crashing, and I've had to fully reboot my computer three times due to this. It's not even letting me exit the game I had to reboot my computer to stop it after it was frozen for over an hour and would not let me quit the game. I then sent a request for a refund  and to inform Steam of the problem and was told due to the 7 hour play time I was refused. However this game was frozen for over an hour at a time, multiple times. I never got to experience this game due to the freezing. And I was still denied a refund after all that.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE A NEWER COMPUTER!!!I bought this game and tried to play it after install.  It just keeps telling me ""unable to initialize graphics system"" and won't start.I looked online for help and found a patch to install, which every review said would fix the problem.  However, after installing the patch, the game starts looking for a CD when I try to start it.  A CD that I of course don't have because I bought this through Steam.What a shame!  This game series is really awesome, but it just won't play for me on my BRAND NEW computer.			"

												This is one of my altime favorite games. I broke my original disk that I got when the game first came out. So when I saw that it was on steam I was very excited and was ready to bring on the nostalgia. Unfortunately, it just simply won't run on windows 7. Even when I've tried every possible option in compatability mode, it just won't start up. Heads up if you don't have Vista or XP			"

												This is one of my favorite sim games from my childhood, as for the game itself, i would give it 5 stars considering its age.  However, there does not appear to have been any updates/fixes before releasing this on steam.  I'm not expecting new graphics or content, but i'm expecting it to be playable without having to download 3rd party hacks.  In my experience, it has been a very buggy game since purchasing on steam, others may have better luck, take note of the fact that windows 7/8 are both not officially supported in the system requirements.Graphics issues abound, don't even think about ever using alt-tab while playing this game, it may still be playable, but frequently the colors will change to what seems like an 8-bit pallette? it is not a good look.  The game frequently takes several tries to start, the music almost always works, but the graphics frequently do not (black screen w/music).  There are numerous workarounds and third party hacks/launchers that help to minimize these issues, but it is a lot of extra work, and none of them quite 'fix' it.  Make sure to save often, the game has quit on me numerous times, frequently the cursor will stop working altogether, or you'll find yourself clicking on one area, but the game recognizing it as you clicking on another area, very frustrating.For the times when you do get to play the game, however, it's glorious.

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is a very fun game when you get into it. You might have a bit of a slow start with it (your attack and speed will be halved for five whole turns!), but soon, you'll be building parks that rival the best real world parks. Manage your finances wisely, though. If you go crazy, you might find yourself in debt. There's a great amount of content for this game, and though it probably won't last forever, it's definitely capable of taking a few hundred hours out of your slowly decreasing lifetime. At least those few hundred hours will be spent having fun.Please, try not to kill people. You can do that in this game, but please don't. It will be detrimental for your park's reputation, and also, it's killing people. I have yet to understand why so many players decide to kill their guests.Windows 10 users, you may experience a problem with the game. It tends to crash very frequently on Windows 10, but there's a way around it. If you go into the steam files for RCT2 and troubleshoot the program's compatabiliy, you should be able to set it to run in Windows 7 mode. If you do that, it should work fine.			"

												RCT 2 expands off the base game of RCT and does it in a fun and creative way. Creating buildings of any size and height was a much needed improvement and necessity although it took many hours to create a massive tower. RCT 2 had a fun circus feel to the game when interacting with the peeps and building roller coasters, Creating rides while enhancing the scenery to theme the ride was as much fun as building roller coasters was. Managing the park was basic and at times could get in the way of building an exciting park. Enhancing the mouse control were a much needed improvement and helped when building a larger park with many roller coasters. Adding the ability to create and add your own objects to the game brought the game play to a new level where gamers could actually get more out of the game by allowing more content options making it a better game overall.The peep interaction was fun, and created a more fun game experience. Having spent hundreds of hours in game play, this is one of those games that could never get boring unlike other simulation builders. The soundtrack to the game was fantastic and added to the pleasure of playing, often at times, wanting to get you to listen to the sound effects more than the music. The humorous feel to the game put the player in a happy mood ready to craft a park just to hear the peeps happy laughter. The interaction was captivating and provided a fun experience for each and every hour you put into the game. 5 stars out of 5 stars. A very time consuming game because of the fact it was just plain fun to play.			"

												RCT2 is strongly recommended for any simulation/management fans. This 2002 game shows that a good design and an eye for quality goes a long way. Hastily made 3D graphics may break what could've been a good game (i.e. RCT3) and will not help if the underlying mechanic is not fun, nor will any amount of advertising, DLCs or graphical bells and whistles.I've been playing this game on and off since it came out. I bought it twice, once as a hard copy and again on steam. This game provides enourmous value per $$$. Time to relax and have some fun.			"

												Some call it an improvement upon the first game, others call it a step back.It's middle ground, it improves in many elements of gameplay, but in terms of how the first game felt like you were progressing to earn new parks to play in, RCT2 gives you every park right off the start. No longer do you need to work on the easier parks to progress upward, you can start easy, or you can start off hard as you like.The addition of additional resolutions in RCT2 was always welcomed, and since the release of OpenRCT, the community will be working on making the game as perfect as possible.

I did use to play this game a ton when I was a little kid, up until I lost the disk and found it years later scratched and broken, unplayable. As for this rerelease, it's exactly as it was twelve years ago. and that's both good and bad, it's good because then not much of the original game was edited, it's bad because I would like support for modern widescreens and an option for a windowed mode.All in all, best entry of the RCT series.

												1 is my favorite but 2 is an absolute blast. The settings and themes of the parks are a lot more varied and crazy. Snowy tundra, lava crag, future city, great wall of freakin china. Its all here for you to build an amusment park to top the charts and records of thrill and ecitement. Forgetting about the cheesy reviewing, the game in all seriousness is wonderful. Anything you want to build or design is probrably in the game. The park building is limited to what you can think of. The only drawback I can think of is that all the parks are unlocked from the get-go. I prefered the unlocking system in 1. Alas, the game is a blast and one of the most addicting games out there.

The only thing wrong with this game is it's misleading title. Serial Killer Tycoon 2 would have been more appropriate.			"

												If you've played the original RCT, than you'll love RCT2. Bear in mind, this game is more than a decade old now and running on an engine even older than that. I've been playing RCT since 1999, and I've been playing RCT2 since its come out. I literally have logged thousands of hours on this title, and its one of the few games I binge play.RCT2 brings a huge collection of roller coasters, rides, shops, and scenery items to the table. If this isn't enough, RCT2 will also support custom flat rides and scenery items; although the online community has flatlined over the years (there are still some good sites to pull content from). You can even skip the whole career/story mode and jump right into a sandbox!One of the reasons this game has survived for so long is because its extremely easy to play and it masterfully blends several things you like in a game... sandbox, simulation, and design. RCT2 is about as user friendly as it gets, with the learning curve set to child. You are literally limited by your own creativity. This is by far one of the most fluid, relaxing, and satisfying game to play.If only Atari would collaborate with Colossal Order, then we could have a game with the impeccable game design of RCT2 and the realism of Cities: Skylines. THAT would be the perfect way to revisit this dusty, old franchise and that would be a MONSTER hit since this whole genre of gaming pretty much ends at RCT2.			"

Creating rollercoasters and trying to sell them off as ""not insane rides""... for some reason those park goers can't handle too much. Finding out your janitor has been wandering everywhere else except the vomit filled path. Into the pond you go! Although I don't remember throwing many in there, in fact I was probably traumatized finding out that all of my park goers were poor swimmers. If you enjoy time management/sim/building games. I think you'll enjoy RCT2!			"

Throw your angry guests into the ocean.This is probably the game I've spent the most time in my life playing.  Only recently added it to steam, but I've likely logged thousands of hours.			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is a very fun game when you get into it. You might have a bit of a slow start with it (your attack and speed will be halved for five whole turns!), but soon, you'll be building parks that rival the best real world parks. Manage your finances wisely, though. If you go crazy, you might find yourself in debt. There's a great amount of content for this game, and though it probably won't last forever, it's definitely capable of taking a few hundred hours out of your slowly decreasing lifetime. At least those few hundred hours will be spent having fun.Please, try not to kill people. You can do that in this game, but please don't. It will be detrimental for your park's reputation, and also, it's killing people. I have yet to understand why so many players decide to kill their guests.Windows 10 users, you may experience a problem with the game. It tends to crash very frequently on Windows 10, but there's a way around it. If you go into the steam files for RCT2 and troubleshoot the program's compatabiliy, you should be able to set it to run in Windows 7 mode. If you do that, it should work fine.			"

First, go to library, and under launch options for RCT2, enter ""-winxp"". That sets it to windows XP compatibility mode. Next, go to your Games folder and you should find the RCT2 .exe file. Run it as an administrator. This seems to have solved the problem for me.""			"

It is the most moddable and active Roller Coaster Tycoon game in the series.  If you are having problems with your settings, I stronly suggest checking out this thread that patches all these problems and in game problems Roller Coaster Tycoon already had.  With these mods, you can have all new rides, scenarios, UI, and most importantly, more video card options and gameplay options than ever before, and even jumpstarting multiplayer servers.http://steamcommunity.com/app/285330/discussions/0/451850849199287710/Multiplayer, classic themed Roller Coaster Tycoon.

I did use to play this game a ton when I was a little kid, up until I lost the disk and found it years later scratched and broken, unplayable. As for this rerelease, it's exactly as it was twelve years ago. and that's both good and bad, it's good because then not much of the original game was edited, it's bad because I would like support for modern widescreens and an option for a windowed mode.All in all, best entry of the RCT series.

												I had this game on CD-rom when I was a kid, and it still works on my old computer, but now that it's on steam, I can play it much easier and have just as much fun as I did when I was younger.The point of the game is to create amusment parks and build rides to complete a specific goal, if you don't your park gets shut down. It's not something you think would be fun to play, but it is. You get to completely customize how your rides are built, you decide where people can walk, whether your guests live or drown in the nearest pool of water, you can even create a park designed to make your guests suffer an untimely demise. All that with the ability to create your own parks with their own objectives, there's plenty to keep you entertained.The game isn't perfect though, removing unneeded footpaths can be slightly annoying due to the isometric camera angle and somewhat picky programming, but it's nothing that makes the game even slightly less fun.If you haven't experienced this game yet, pick it up, you'll surely enjoy yourself. After all, what other game lets you build your own six flags parks, or build parks on volcanoes or prison islands?			"

Coming from someone who played RollerCoaster Tycoon as a kid and still am today, the only limit is your imagination. The game is cheap and fun to play so if you can fork over $5 for this game, DO IT. Plus, you'll get the EP as well, more rides, scenery, and of course, more fun.My only problem is this is an old game, so getting it to work on my Windows 8 PC can be annoying but it's easy to fix. "

I used to leave my park open overnight and wake up in the morning either rich or 100,000,000 dollars in debt. challenging at times, but absolutely wonderful. 10/10Ps: Don't end the coaster mid track, it doesn't go well for the passengers.

												Honestly spent half of my childhood playing this game. I don't know what it is about this game; maybe the fact that you can tortue your guest by drowning them or putting them in a 1 block square path to watch them aimlessly walk around nothing. Or the fact that the music, atmosphere and overall gameplay just makes you want to keep playing forever.Solid 10/10 Anyone who hasn't played this yet. Trust me, its worth every penny.Bonus +5 for being able to make death parks.			"

												Loved this game as a kid. Love it now. All the fun of the original version from blowing up rides, imprisoning guests and drowning tourists to making your guests vomit everywhere. Hell you can even build a theme park if you want (though you're kind of missing the point of the game which is obviously to murder the **** out of everyone). The only thing wrong with this game is it's misleading title. Serial Killer Tycoon 2 would have been more appropriate.			"

												The kids of today have no idea what they're missing, the childhood retro game from the real days of gaming, playing this again just proves that consoles such as the XB1 / PS4 and companies trying to make games with the most realistic graphics are pointless.Hearing the background music on the menu and listening to all the sound effects of the game was like it had only been a blink of an eye since last playing, picked up everything straight away, and started to build my park.If you've never played this game before and wonder what all the fuss is about, it's simply the nostalgia effect, if 2015 or beyond is your first time playing this game then you might not get the enjoyment as much as those who did when this was first released.I must admit the game is probably best played in small doses as opposed to hours because it can become a bit repetitive and the same, there's stalls etc to unlock and rides but nothing in terms of leveling up, the game is designed to be the occasional very layed back trip down memory lane.Around £7-8 at time of writing this review, no brainer.

												Ignoring the bugs, which I managed to fix, this is a pretty solid title. Though it ""sold out"" to Six Flags, this has more content than the first game.Where it faltered was in the quality of this content. Many of the rides just seem like duplicates of each other, reskins with no real variation from the original designs. Also, some of the levels aren't very fun to play. They're either too tedious, too constricting, or too lazily designed.For sandbox theme park simulation, it's not as good as its predecessor, but it's still worth a few hours of time.			"

												Ahhhhh, the nostalgia. The first time i saw this game was while a friend was playing a demo of the first one. I was immediately caught. I was like 12 years old at the time, and i guess it was every boys' dream to be able to build an amusement park.If you ever dreamed about building an amusement park this is the game for you. The interactions of the game are really simple and the sound of the game is one of the things that will make you be hooked on it. Hearing screams from the rollercoasters, the old music of classic merry-go-rounds, it is just good. The graphics are good in a simplistic way, and i like that. Well, no one expected much better at the year that this game was released. There's not much to say, this game is an amusement park management game, that looks exactly like it does on the imagesGraphics 9/10 - Considering the actual release date the graphics are good and simple, just how i like itSound 10/10 - If you love the sound of classic amusement parks you'll be stuck with the sound of the game in your head for a whileGameplay 9/10 - Really simple, just click and drop.Personal Enjoyment 9/10 - I really like the game, but it gets hard at some point in some maps, and might make you kind of bored of the game			"

I played this game for hours and hours on end.Re-downloaded this game about a week back, thirteen years later. Yep, RollerCoaster Tycoon still holds the same sparkle it always did. Sure, the graphics are now outdated--but holy crap, who honestly cares? The game is genius, it's fun, it's addictive in the best of ways.RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is definitely an improvement over 1, but both games are brilliant and deserve to be played. You deserve to play this game.Seriously. If you haven't played it, play it. And if you played it in the past... re-play it. You'll fall in love all over again.			"

The same game I love and remember but with more parks, rides, and neat little features like clearing landscaping! SCREW YOU TREES!!! Yes this game is old but so worth the $10. For people saying issues with Windows 8 : It runs with a few minor hiccups. For anyone having issues, find the RCT2.exe file, right click onto ""properties"", go to ""compatibility"" and change the mode to Windows XP. Tick off run as admin & work with OneDrives.

												My game is not leting me start. I dont know why but ive been reading and saw that if you have windows 7 and up then the graphics page wont come up. I hope they fix it. Also i saw someone play it and it ssems very good. I love that you can build your own amusement parks. If you know the creator pls tell him to fix it. Over all it seems very good.			"

												It's as fun and challenging as I remember. True testament of the good old days. I am impressed I was able to complete some of these scenarios when I was a kid, some of them are damn near impossible! PROS -- It's Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, pretty much a culture icon by now- You can make roller coasters- Very micro manage friendly.- Did I mention you can make roller coasters?CONS -- Dated graphics,- No widescreen support (This game pretty much predates wide screens lol)- [Insert crappy con because you now expect much more of modern games which doesn't apply to this masterpiece]- Misogynistic game. No female sprites. How dare they.NOTE: If you are having problems with the graphics or the game crashing on windows 7/8/8.1, install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86). Just google it.			"

												The apogee of theme park simulation. I've spent countless hours playing this game and its predecessor since I first got RollerCoaster Tycoon back in 2002. The first one was great, but the second one improves upon everything that made the first game excellent, thus creating an unparallelled game. I see many more hours of satisfaction from playing this game in the future. 5 out of 5 stars.			"

												I love this game. While the thought of owning  your own amusement park is awesome, I still faced some glitches. For example, I just got a new laptop, but when I installed it, it says that the graphics were mismatched. I know I have an okay grapchics card, because I can play games like portal and portal 2, but no matter how many times I open RCT, it broadcasts the same message. I still give this a thumbs up, but I think that this should be fixed...			"

It's very easy to build your own park from scratch (I highly recommend using the Crazy Castle option to do this) or add your own tweaks and additional rides to one that's already been started. Overall, it's lots of fun and you can get super creative with it.			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time are the two games that got me into video gaming when I was but a wee lass--we're talking six years old. I played this game for hours and hours on end.Re-downloaded this game about a week back, thirteen years later. Yep, RollerCoaster Tycoon still holds the same sparkle it always did. Sure, the graphics are now outdated--but holy crap, who honestly cares? The game is genius, it's fun, it's addictive in the best of ways.RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is definitely an improvement over 1, but both games are brilliant and deserve to be played. You deserve to play this game.Seriously. If you haven't played it, play it. And if you played it in the past... re-play it. You'll fall in love all over again.			"

First, go to library, and under launch options for RCT2, enter ""-winxp"". That sets it to windows XP compatibility mode. Next, go to your Games folder and you should find the RCT2 .exe file.

												Oh..my..god. This has to be one of the greatest games from the 90's/ early 2000's that lives up to this game. Last one I can think of is Half Life 1, and Doom 1 and 2. It's not the most graphically appealing game, but it still looks pretty, and VERY addictive. And hell, this is RollerCoaster Tycoon 1, but with more..sauce. It's like a steak, but with sauce and damn good sauce on it. You just wanna eat it up and drink that sauced steak.			"

												Please my review on The first title of series. While this game seams like just an update to the fist  one it is not one. While there are a buch of updates there are a buch more of add on features and coasters to build. What changed since the fist one? You may ask.1: Does not close the game to trasfer to a new park.2:Better seenery machaninics.3:Singed deals with Six Flags Parks to include thier rides.4: Better securtiy (not all that noticeable)5:Harder extream parks.Well I guess you could just catorgies this as an update... but a needed one when they couldn't modify the game like they could back when both titles where released.

												One of the very first games I ever got addicted to as a kid, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is still great fun to play even now. Between managing a park, designing rides, and only occasionally making a colossal deathtrap for guests, the game kept me entertained in Elementary School, and keeps me entertained even now. Of course, since I'm running this old♥♥♥♥♥game on Win10, there are a few issues where I had the game crash, including when trying to load my saved game files. It also seems to crash when you hit the exit button, which I guess works out since that exits the game anyway.Still really good fun, and designing a cool rollercoaster is always a great time.			"

												Between RCT and RCT2, definitely go for RCT2, as it's really easy to simply add all the old scenarios back in, in addition to hundreds of custom scenarios the fans have made over the years. Unfortunately many of the RCT2 scenarios feel a bit off. Something I liked about the original and many of the custom scenarios is that they mostly felt like places you actually might build a theme park, like around a giant lake. With a couple exceptions the RCT2 scenarios mostly go for weirdness, like building a park on mars, or for stuff that doesn't feel quite realistic, like building a park around the great wall of china. I know that's quite a dumb complaint, and it obviously doesn't mean you shouldn't get the game, but I never could get into building a park that really felt quite right around the grand canyon. Since there are so many great ones available it doesn't really matter.However RCT2 is an excellently designed sequel in that in almost all ways it is a direct upgrade over the previous game (and it's much better than its successor RCT3 in a lot of ways too.) There are more rides, better decorations, among lots of other improvements. This game is a classic through and through and at the heart of things its just really fun to make an amusement park, and you really owe it to yourself to try it if you haven't already.			"

Second the offered resolutions are absolutely not up to date so if you have a 1920x1080 monitor it's terrible. Without more modifying you can't play it properly ... It's a shame that this game is still sold but not tweaked to meet today's standards. I recommend using OpenRCT2 instead.			"

												This was one of my childhood favorites. I remember when I had my old PC and had this and all of the expansion packs on it. It was just so much fun!FEATURES:- You can create roller coasters (duh).- You can hire staff to entertain your visitors/clean up your park/fix your rides.- You can rename individal people and staff to deliver torture to your worst enemy!- You can build at such places as Alcatraz Prison and the Great Wall of China!- You can also create food stands, souvenier shops, etc.- You can be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and charge people to use the only toilet in your park.There are some downsides to this game however. For example:- It will crash every now and again, but that's just because the game is old.- The isometric view may screw you up a bit when it comes to building your coasters.- Other bugs that I may have forgotten to mention.This game for me only got better when I discovered OpenRCT2, a mod that enhances the game. BIG time.Here's the link:https://openrct2.org/I definitely reccommend getting OpenRCT2 if you truly want to expand your experience with this game.OpenRCT2 Features:- Can make rides go faster than 500 mph! (Caution: this may crash the game if used excessively in one park)- Can change the carts of every ride to something else (I.E: Replacing the regular roller coaster carts with a tram)- Fixes (most) bugs from the original game.- Adds in cheats so you can manipulate your customers/park to your very whim!- Adds in MULTIPLAYER!! That's right, MULTIPLAYER!! (I haven't tried it for myself yet, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that is impressive to convert a game like this into a multiplayer experience)- Fixes (most) crashes, unless you cause the crashes yourself.Do I reccommend this game by itself? Yes.Do I reccommend this game with OpenRCT2? The definitive choice.10/10 for me.As a bonus, here's some tips for both the standalone game and OpenRCT2 (based on the ""Build Your Own Six Flags Park"" Scenario):- Start slow. Don't go right into building coasters. Build food stands and simple rides (Ghost House, for example) until you have enough people in your park. Otherwise, you will have blown all of your money and spent at least $20,000 of your $100,000 loan.- Go easy on the inversions for most rides. You can have a big coaster with a lot of inversions, but don't do it for every ride. Not only does it become confusing after a while, but your guests won't like it.- (OPENRCT2 ONLY) You can go fast, but don't go TOO fast. 200 mph should be fine, but don't do a 50 lap coaster going at 500 mph. This will probably crash the game.- (OPENRCT2 ONLY) Turn on the cheat ""Unlock all prices"". That way, if you feel you're struggling with finances, you can charge people to go on your coasters. You'll thank me later.- (OPENRCT2 ONLY) In multiplayer, don't be that guy that destroys one's park for the hell of it. If you want to get the most fun out of multiplayer, cooperate and come up with unique ideas for rides together.The reason why it says I only have roughly 1.3 hours is because playing OpenRCT2 doesn't show that you're playing RCT2 on Steam. OpenRCT2 is its own executable file that relies on the RCT2 binaries/files.Also, be sure to name your 3D Cinemas ""The Legend of Harambe"" and set the theme to ""Storm Chasers"". You'll thank me later.			"

One park I made was one that was a looooong line of carousels that exit into other carousels. No one ever made it to the end.Just be warned that this game has some compatibility issues with modern PC's. I'd recommend getting OpenRCT2, as it fixes those issues and provides more options for screen resolution and mod support.			"

												I know it says I only have about 11 hours but that is because i play the game with rct open it makes the game so much better and playable on a modern pc I have spent countless hours in this game and plan to continue. I personally think this game is better then rollercoaster tycoon 3, miles better then rct world. Its a simple game that can become so much more depending on how you want to play. I would recomend this to everyone it is the game that has sparked mine and so many others creativity as a child.			"

												First off, the people who are giving this negative reviews for it crashing are complete jackasses. It's not the GAME'S fault whatsoever, it's the problem with newer OS's.Now that that's out of the way, this game is very fun. There's a lot to do and you have to think strategically and listen to what the people at your park want, don't want, or what they like and don't like or what they complain about. This makes it very challenging to make decisions on what you should add or take away, which also plays into the complicated financial part of the game. Also, with tools like ""OpenRct2"" this game has a bit of a ""cult following"" community (or amongst people like me who have seen people play the game on youtube with some humor), which does it a favor because people care about this game still by adding mods and multiplayer and new ideas to it. It's quite a magnificient feat that when a game that's almost two decades old and totally obsolete can have a following still and a community, and it's because it's a good game as well.			"

												I have loved this amazing game for a long time. I have a lot more hours then Steam Shows. I just had to get on here to say that it is one of the best games I have ever played.Pros: You can learn to manage a park and have tons of fun building all kinds of neat rights.Cons: You can become an Evil Park Owner and make rides that kill people. You can dig holes to bury people alive. Oh my gosh, I even had the ability to drown people. Maybe you are confused about Pros and Cons and which one is meant to be which.  I however have morals and choose to look at it this way.Ha, hope you all have a great Tycoon Day.			"

												Please my review on The first title of series. While this game seams like just an update to the fist  one it is not one. While there are a buch of updates there are a buch more of add on features and coasters to build. What changed since the fist one? You may ask.1: Does not close the game to trasfer to a new park.2:Better seenery machaninics.3:Singed deals with Six Flags Parks to include thier rides.4: Better securtiy (not all that noticeable)5:Harder extream parks.Well I guess you could just catorgies this as an update... but a needed one when they couldn't modify the game like they could back when both titles where released.

												Not many older games (pre-2005) that I've played seemed captivating enough to go back to and play more. But the Rollercoaster Tycoon series is an exception (except for RCT4 and RCT World, those dont count), specifically 1 and 2. Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 are very similar. In fact, they have pretty much the exact same graphics and the only thing that differentiates the two is the added rides/scenery/other content that RCT2 has over RCT1. The first two RCT games are timeless. If you play the game once and enjoy it, I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy it the next time you play. There are some people that don't enjoy it, (some of my friends IRL, for example) but usually that is because of judgement based on graphics/age or just a dislike of the management genre. If lacking high-quality graphics or being in the management genre are turn-offs for you, I'd still recommend playing this game at least once in your lifetime. Many people actually consider it a crime to NOT play this game at least once. To be perfectly honest, my best gaming memories come from two games: Pokemon Crystal and Rollercoater Tycoon 1. Whether you are dusting this game off after a long time without playing, or if you've never played this game before, it is a genuinely great game that should be in everybody's Steam library.			"

												Excluding Civ 2, the RCT series was possibly my favourite game from my mid/late teenage years.While the graphics and UI are, by today's standards, outdated, this is still an absolutely incredible game that any simulation fan/theme park fan should pick up.It's not the easiest on new players - it's pretty difficult to work out how to build coasters that don't terrify your peeps, and managing your staff to stop the park being destroyed is, at first, a HR nightmare, but once you get the hang of it, it's brilliant fun.Definitely recommended.

												An absolute classic for all gamers interested in Roller Coaster Management games. This game not only provides players with the ability to create a vast range of coasters, flat and dark rides, but also allows your imagination to shine. A huge range of decoration and scenery items, allows you to create a park of your dreams. This game combines the ability to create wonderful turns and twists of roller coasters, whilst having to manage the park from a staff point of view. Pricing of rides and merchandise, to taking out a loan to fund your new development area. This game has it all. If you manage to complete the huge varied range of levels, all of which focus on different themes and objectives, you can create your own scenarios for others to play, or, design rides to import into your park.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has the most remote interest in theme parks!

												Never ending fun.There is literally no end to this game, even after 14 years it still hold up, and has more replayability than any other game I've ever expirenced. In 3rd grade, I traded some Pokemon cards for the cereal box CD of this game, and it pretty much defined my childhood. But this is in no way just a nostalgia trip, although I do feel like a kid again when I play this. Even if you were not one of the lucky few who grew up on this masterpiece(what other game can handle 6k NPCs and not lag?), I promise you will find enjoyment here. Love detail? Let's sink 5 hours into making the perfect entry way and decorated que. Feeling bad? Launch a car load of people into space, or charge $20 for food and bathrooms on a prison island. Or just Love theme parks? Guess what, here you can make your own, however detailed or physics-defying(wait until you build scenery where the ride supports should be) you want. Even if you don't love theme parks, there is fun to be had in every nook and crany of this game, from the pre set scenarios to the scenario editor to the coaster creator.Of course, I have to mention the awesome software of and commuity at OpenRCT2. The mod enhances the game, introduces multiplayer, and lets this gem run on any PC and OS. Even a toaster could handle this. Prepare to never be able to forget the same 2 scream tracks, and build that music-making merry-go-round right at the entrace, you won't regret it. 9.5/10 The ""ride must be a continuous circuit"" message should die with Jenny S. when it falls off the screen. Just let me launch the looping coaster into a volcano.			"

												I have been playing this game off and on for about 11 years now. Even though this game got a lot of flak at launch for being much the same as the original game, I believe this title added a lot of extra elements that made the challenge mode experience more difficult and fun. It's a shame they made deathcoasters harder to make, but the added challenges and level editor had always drawn me to play this game instead of the original for so long. Buy this game on sale if you're not willing to put a lot of time into it though, there is no fast forward button and it requires you to idle for extended periods of time. Overall, a great game!			"

												Some features now feel very dated, such as the limited camera angles.. but this game is still as fun as ever. Ive been playing it on and off for 10 years, and it\'s still the best one in the series in my opinion (unfortunately ive played RCTW). Definatly worth the small price with the expansions!			"

Now it is made for windows 7 compatibility which most ones use right now.Positive- Drowned!- Crashed!- Bigger and bigger scenery by only walls and roofs- Not really 3D view *I love this very much*- Rewards opposite your ways *People drowned and get ""Safest Park"" reward*Negative- Expansion Packs suck- Frequent error trapper- Not everyone can play in modern Windows OS- Unavailable in MacOSOverall - 99/100- This should be in your game library- Old school yet very very popular- You are the god, guests complain?

												I deleted my old review which was already a recommendation, to say this game isn't great, this game is fantastic.  It is the most moddable and active Roller Coaster Tycoon game in the series.  If you are having problems with your settings, I stronly suggest checking out this thread that patches all these problems and in game problems Roller Coaster Tycoon already had.  With these mods, you can have all new rides, scenarios, UI, and most importantly, more video card options and gameplay options than ever before, and even jumpstarting multiplayer servers.http://steamcommunity.com/app/285330/discussions/0/451850849199287710/Multiplayer, classic themed Roller Coaster Tycoon.

												For me, I love tycoon games, and when I got RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 for the 4th Of July, I was stoked! I had been wondering for a long time what this game would be like, and if would meet my expectations that I had for it. And I am happy to say I enjoyed it alot! For starters, it has a very simple interface, which makes it very easy to navigate through the menus. Also, the rollercoaster building tool is very easy to use. Also, the textures look so realistic, which allows the player to immerse the feeling that he/she is there. And of course, there is the scenario editor, which allow you to make your own scenarios for you to play in and complete. This is a very amazing game and is definitly worth the $9.99.			"

												Excluding Civ 2, the RCT series was possibly my favourite game from my mid/late teenage years.While the graphics and UI are, by today's standards, outdated, this is still an absolutely incredible game that any simulation fan/theme park fan should pick up.It's not the easiest on new players - it's pretty difficult to work out how to build coasters that don't terrify your peeps, and managing your staff to stop the park being destroyed is, at first, a HR nightmare, but once you get the hang of it, it's brilliant fun.Definitely recommended.

												As of this current build. No. I do not recommend this classic. It plays just like normal with all it's amazing glory... But that's the problem. It's an exact CD rip of the orginal game, so running this game on Windows 7 and up will result in bugs and crashes that are caused mostly because of how Windows works compared to how it used to work. It functions as it should, but don't try alt-tabbing, or even trying to window the game to check on anything in the background or you'll soft lock your computer.As in, you won't be able to click anything on your desktop, nor will you be able to interact with your task manager. But you'll still be able to open it. It's a shame, too. Because This game is definately one I'd love to play again.			"

												One of the very first games I ever got addicted to as a kid, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is still great fun to play even now. Between managing a park, designing rides, and only occasionally making a colossal deathtrap for guests, the game kept me entertained in Elementary School, and keeps me entertained even now. Of course, since I'm running this old♥♥♥♥♥game on Win10, there are a few issues where I had the game crash, including when trying to load my saved game files. It also seems to crash when you hit the exit button, which I guess works out since that exits the game anyway.Still really good fun, and designing a cool rollercoaster is always a great time.			"

												I bought the original PC game back in 02' so my play time is not accurate AT ALL.I adore this game. It added so many extra features onto the already great RCT. The kids nowadays are all about building things in Minecraft, but back in my day we built rollercoasters, man. We learned heartless economics to milk people of all their cash so we could keep building more rollercoasters. We also learned that nobody knows how to swim, if more than one path is connected people immediately get lost, ducks quack, balloons pop, and that launching guests into the unknown was strangely satisfying.Funny stuff aside, my only complaint about this port is that it has no window mode without a hack. It's strange because I have the original game, on disc, and in its options there is a window mode that worked quite well. It's not  a big deal, but having it in there would've been nice.			"

Either way this game is a phenomenal park building game with a wide range of features and options along with a brilliant isometric tile set. The only real complaints I have is the wonkey guest path finding and rowing boats getting stuck.I enjoyed this game more than RCT3, but this may just be personal taste as RCT3 Is also a good game.As a final note, definitely buy this over Roller Coaster tycoon world or the other recent cash-grabs, it won't disappoint you.

												This was one of my childhood favorites. I remember when I had my old PC and had this and all of the expansion packs on it. It was just so much fun!FEATURES:- You can create roller coasters (duh).- You can hire staff to entertain your visitors/clean up your park/fix your rides.- You can rename individal people and staff to deliver torture to your worst enemy!- You can build at such places as Alcatraz Prison and the Great Wall of China!- You can also create food stands, souvenier shops, etc.- You can be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and charge people to use the only toilet in your park.There are some downsides to this game however. For example:- It will crash every now and again, but that's just because the game is old.- The isometric view may screw you up a bit when it comes to building your coasters.- Other bugs that I may have forgotten to mention.This game for me only got better when I discovered OpenRCT2, a mod that enhances the game. BIG time.Here's the link:https://openrct2.org/I definitely reccommend getting OpenRCT2 if you truly want to expand your experience with this game.OpenRCT2 Features:- Can make rides go faster than 500 mph! (Caution: this may crash the game if used excessively in one park)- Can change the carts of every ride to something else (I.E: Replacing the regular roller coaster carts with a tram)- Fixes (most) bugs from the original game.- Adds in cheats so you can manipulate your customers/park to your very whim!- Adds in MULTIPLAYER!! That's right, MULTIPLAYER!! (I haven't tried it for myself yet, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that is impressive to convert a game like this into a multiplayer experience)- Fixes (most) crashes, unless you cause the crashes yourself.Do I reccommend this game by itself? Yes.Do I reccommend this game with OpenRCT2? The definitive choice.10/10 for me.As a bonus, here's some tips for both the standalone game and OpenRCT2 (based on the ""Build Your Own Six Flags Park"" Scenario):- Start slow. Don't go right into building coasters. Build food stands and simple rides (Ghost House, for example) until you have enough people in your park. Otherwise, you will have blown all of your money and spent at least $20,000 of your $100,000 loan.- Go easy on the inversions for most rides. You can have a big coaster with a lot of inversions, but don't do it for every ride. Not only does it become confusing after a while, but your guests won't like it.- (OPENRCT2 ONLY) You can go fast, but don't go TOO fast. 200 mph should be fine, but don't do a 50 lap coaster going at 500 mph. This will probably crash the game.- (OPENRCT2 ONLY) Turn on the cheat ""Unlock all prices"". That way, if you feel you're struggling with finances, you can charge people to go on your coasters. You'll thank me later.- (OPENRCT2 ONLY) In multiplayer, don't be that guy that destroys one's park for the hell of it. If you want to get the most fun out of multiplayer, cooperate and come up with unique ideas for rides together.The reason why it says I only have roughly 1.3 hours is because playing OpenRCT2 doesn't show that you're playing RCT2 on Steam. OpenRCT2 is its own executable file that relies on the RCT2 binaries/files.Also, be sure to name your 3D Cinemas ""The Legend of Harambe"" and set the theme to ""Storm Chasers"". You'll thank me later.			"

												This is the quintessential time consumer simulation game. I'd say it plays just as well as I remember, but I've been playing it every since the day the first game was released. It takes everything the first game had, polishes every aspect of it, and throws a ton of new content in that never gets old. The unique visual style has barely aged a day, and the music will burrow its way right back into your brain. And that's just the base game.Possibly the best reason for buying this game digitally was the advent of OpenRCT2, a massive project that overhauls the game from the ground up, reworking it from assembly code to an increasingly easy to modify open-source software. It's created a limitless world for game modifications, from new maps and scenarios, new scenery, new ride and vehicle types, and tons of UI and technical improvements. There are even lovingly recreated versions of the scenarios from the first game - essentially giving you 1 and 2 for the price of just this game. Most importantly. the game can now run at 60 FPS at a 4k resolution; even 1080 was impossible for the base game, making playing on any setup incredibly simple. It even removes all compatibility issues with newer operation systems.RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is a game that can only stand to get better and better with age.			"

												Never ending fun.There is literally no end to this game, even after 14 years it still hold up, and has more replayability than any other game I've ever expirenced. In 3rd grade, I traded some Pokemon cards for the cereal box CD of this game, and it pretty much defined my childhood. But this is in no way just a nostalgia trip, although I do feel like a kid again when I play this. Even if you were not one of the lucky few who grew up on this masterpiece(what other game can handle 6k NPCs and not lag?), I promise you will find enjoyment here. Love detail? Let's sink 5 hours into making the perfect entry way and decorated que. Feeling bad? Launch a car load of people into space, or charge $20 for food and bathrooms on a prison island. Or just Love theme parks? Guess what, here you can make your own, however detailed or physics-defying(wait until you build scenery where the ride supports should be) you want. Even if you don't love theme parks, there is fun to be had in every nook and crany of this game, from the pre set scenarios to the scenario editor to the coaster creator.Of course, I have to mention the awesome software of and commuity at OpenRCT2. The mod enhances the game, introduces multiplayer, and lets this gem run on any PC and OS. Even a toaster could handle this. Prepare to never be able to forget the same 2 scream tracks, and build that music-making merry-go-round right at the entrace, you won't regret it. 9.5/10 The ""ride must be a continuous circuit"" message should die with Jenny S. when it falls off the screen. Just let me launch the looping coaster into a volcano.			"

												This is one of my most played games. let me start by saying this is the most adictive games i have played. it has a great interface to work with and all the coaster models to make make a great experience for the user. this is in my opinion this is the best game in the rollercoaster tycoon game. my only complaint with this game is once i a while it will randomly crash when loading or when trying to save a coaster or park.

Seriously, this game is amazing.There seem to be endless possibilites when it comes to RCT2. Tons of different scenarios, roller coasters, theme park rides, scenery items.....you have no idea.It's hard not to get obsessed with this game. Not only can you play different scenarios and try to make the best theme park out there, but there is also an amazing roller coaster designer, and scenario editor. Although the graphics are not the best, they seem to have a sort of ""charm"" to them.I would definitely recommend this game.			"

												I would say this game is pretty fun. I wish that you can unlock the parks the same was as RCT1 did. It would give me a challenege to unlock all parks. That's the only turndown. Everything else seems perfect, even those weird scenery stuff too xD I love the new rides added into the game, a Six Flags license made it pretty amazing for the game as well. As what made it even better than the first one is that you can make your very own scenerio and use the coaster builder. I love to make my own scenerio parks and see what I can do to make others have a big challenge. I would give this game a 4.5/5. The reason why I gave it that is the game is not really that much as a challenge than the first game. If you would love a challenge, play the first game. But if you want to play just for fun, this game is highly recommened!			"

												An amazing game for anyone interested in business sims, building sims, or just messing around in a theme park environment. The entire game is a blast, but some of my favorite game elements are: 1) designing awesome rollercoasters and other rides like go karts and water rides; 2) getting feedback from visitors and being able to use it to improve your park, 3) the general chatter and noise the people make is endearing, and 4) watching someone exit a ride that they love, and jumping in the air in excitement.I don't have a problem with (well done) games where you are basically just shifting around resources and reviewing spreadsheets, but this goes beyond that type of game, with a great balance between building, financial matters, employee guidance, visitor interactivity, and other matters.There's no major flaws IMO, but certain things might not be everyone's cup of tea. First, it can be a slow and leisurely game to play; Second, while it doesn't require a ton of micromanagement, nonetheless if you aren't willing to do at least *some* in-depth stuff (esp. with your workers) your park can become a mess; Third, the graphics and art are not bright and shiny and cartoonish in the way that a lot of business sims are (though for someone like me, this is a positive rather than a negative); Fourth, it's not in 3d, but like a 2.5d where you can look at things from 4 perspectives, and this can make seeing certain things difficult at times.Anyway, to sum up... if you are at all interested in this genre or theme, it'll almost certainly be worth it to get this. Go!			"

You can dig holes to bury people alive. Oh my gosh, I even had the ability to drown people. Maybe you are confused about Pros and Cons and which one is meant to be which.  I however have morals and choose to look at it this way.Ha, hope you all have a great Tycoon Day.			"

												First off, the people who are giving this negative reviews for it crashing are complete jackasses. It's not the GAME'S fault whatsoever, it's the problem with newer OS's.Now that that's out of the way, this game is very fun. There's a lot to do and you have to think strategically and listen to what the people at your park want, don't want, or what they like and don't like or what they complain about. This makes it very challenging to make decisions on what you should add or take away, which also plays into the complicated financial part of the game. Also, with tools like ""OpenRct2"" this game has a bit of a ""cult following"" community (or amongst people like me who have seen people play the game on youtube with some humor), which does it a favor because people care about this game still by adding mods and multiplayer and new ideas to it. It's quite a magnificient feat that when a game that's almost two decades old and totally obsolete can have a following still and a community, and it's because it's a good game as well.			"

												An absolute classic for all gamers interested in Roller Coaster Management games. This game not only provides players with the ability to create a vast range of coasters, flat and dark rides, but also allows your imagination to shine. A huge range of decoration and scenery items, allows you to create a park of your dreams. This game combines the ability to create wonderful turns and twists of roller coasters, whilst having to manage the park from a staff point of view. Pricing of rides and merchandise, to taking out a loan to fund your new development area. This game has it all. If you manage to complete the huge varied range of levels, all of which focus on different themes and objectives, you can create your own scenarios for others to play, or, design rides to import into your park.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has the most remote interest in theme parks!

												RCT 2 expands off the base game of RCT and does it in a fun and creative way. Creating buildings of any size and height was a much needed improvement and necessity although it took many hours to create a massive tower. RCT 2 had a fun circus feel to the game when interacting with the peeps and building roller coasters, Creating rides while enhancing the scenery to theme the ride was as much fun as building roller coasters was. Managing the park was basic and at times could get in the way of building an exciting park. Enhancing the mouse control were a much needed improvement and helped when building a larger park with many roller coasters. Adding the ability to create and add your own objects to the game brought the game play to a new level where gamers could actually get more out of the game by allowing more content options making it a better game overall.The peep interaction was fun, and created a more fun game experience. Having spent hundreds of hours in game play, this is one of those games that could never get boring unlike other simulation builders. The soundtrack to the game was fantastic and added to the pleasure of playing, often at times, wanting to get you to listen to the sound effects more than the music. The humorous feel to the game put the player in a happy mood ready to craft a park just to hear the peeps happy laughter. The interaction was captivating and provided a fun experience for each and every hour you put into the game. 5 stars out of 5 stars. A very time consuming game because of the fact it was just plain fun to play.			"

												The ultimate RCT experience. While the original RCT was the classic, RCT2 only improves upon it, and adds much needed content. After this installment the series got too involved and trying to hard and the switch to 3d ultimately hurt it. RCT2 is the best version of any Tycoon game. Simple, fun, and with loads of content. You can opt for easy smaller parks or very difficult parks in challenging landscapes. While I don't have too many hours in this game on steam, if my physical copy that I still have tracked hours, I'm sure it would be well over 1000 hours as I have played it consistently for near 15 years.10/10			"

												Ahhhhh, the nostalgia. The first time i saw this game was while a friend was playing a demo of the first one. I was immediately caught. I was like 12 years old at the time, and i guess it was every boys' dream to be able to build an amusement park.If you ever dreamed about building an amusement park this is the game for you. The interactions of the game are really simple and the sound of the game is one of the things that will make you be hooked on it. Hearing screams from the rollercoasters, the old music of classic merry-go-rounds, it is just good. The graphics are good in a simplistic way, and i like that. Well, no one expected much better at the year that this game was released. There's not much to say, this game is an amusement park management game, that looks exactly like it does on the imagesGraphics 9/10 - Considering the actual release date the graphics are good and simple, just how i like itSound 10/10 - If you love the sound of classic amusement parks you'll be stuck with the sound of the game in your head for a whileGameplay 9/10 - Really simple, just click and drop.Personal Enjoyment 9/10 - I really like the game, but it gets hard at some point in some maps, and might make you kind of bored of the game			"

												Between RCT and RCT2, definitely go for RCT2, as it's really easy to simply add all the old scenarios back in, in addition to hundreds of custom scenarios the fans have made over the years. Unfortunately many of the RCT2 scenarios feel a bit off. Something I liked about the original and many of the custom scenarios is that they mostly felt like places you actually might build a theme park, like around a giant lake. With a couple exceptions the RCT2 scenarios mostly go for weirdness, like building a park on mars, or for stuff that doesn't feel quite realistic, like building a park around the great wall of china. I know that's quite a dumb complaint, and it obviously doesn't mean you shouldn't get the game, but I never could get into building a park that really felt quite right around the grand canyon. Since there are so many great ones available it doesn't really matter.However RCT2 is an excellently designed sequel in that in almost all ways it is a direct upgrade over the previous game (and it's much better than its successor RCT3 in a lot of ways too.) There are more rides, better decorations, among lots of other improvements. This game is a classic through and through and at the heart of things its just really fun to make an amusement park, and you really owe it to yourself to try it if you haven't already.			"

												An amazing game for anyone interested in business sims, building sims, or just messing around in a theme park environment. The entire game is a blast, but some of my favorite game elements are: 1) designing awesome rollercoasters and other rides like go karts and water rides; 2) getting feedback from visitors and being able to use it to improve your park, 3) the general chatter and noise the people make is endearing, and 4) watching someone exit a ride that they love, and jumping in the air in excitement.I don't have a problem with (well done) games where you are basically just shifting around resources and reviewing spreadsheets, but this goes beyond that type of game, with a great balance between building, financial matters, employee guidance, visitor interactivity, and other matters.There's no major flaws IMO, but certain things might not be everyone's cup of tea. First, it can be a slow and leisurely game to play; Second, while it doesn't require a ton of micromanagement, nonetheless if you aren't willing to do at least *some* in-depth stuff (esp. with your workers) your park can become a mess; Third, the graphics and art are not bright and shiny and cartoonish in the way that a lot of business sims are (though for someone like me, this is a positive rather than a negative); Fourth, it's not in 3d, but like a 2.5d where you can look at things from 4 perspectives, and this can make seeing certain things difficult at times.Anyway, to sum up... if you are at all interested in this genre or theme, it'll almost certainly be worth it to get this. Go!			"

												RCT has risen and fallen, and while it would seem that its mantle has been faithfully picked up by Planet Coaster, RCT2 will always hold a special place in my heart. The original RCT may as well have invented the ""Tycoon"" genre. Yes, there were competitors and RCT was not the first simulation game, but there's a reason no one remembers its competitors and why it seemed like after RCT every simulation game for the next 5 years had Tycoon in the title.The original RCT gave creative freedom to build whatever your imagination desired along with a set of increasingly challenging scenarios to test your strategy and management skills. RCT 2 perfected this formula. More coasters, more themes, more track options, more modes, more everything. Plus you could play with actual Six Flags and they finally added a straight sandbox.My gaming childhood was built on Smash Bros. and Rollercoaster Tycoon. RCT is the game that started it all. This is the only game in the series that's better in every way.			"

												Wow. This is the worst game release on steam I've ever seen. It crashes instantly when I try and launch it and the original installer is even included. What were they thinking?No, throw away the provided executable and use OpenRCT2 instead. That works flawlessly.Yet, at the same time, this is an excellent game. This is really nothing more than version 2.0 of the original Roller Coaster Tycoon. Same great game, but with some new features. This game could just as easily have been an expansion pack.Building attractions is always fun and there are plenty of scenarios to try. But it does kinda samey rather quickly. Seen one scenario, seen them all. Built one roller coaster, built them all. It is unquestionably still fun, but it gets repetitive rather quickly. This is a game you can fire up for a few hours when you are bored and need a little hobby project to work on for a while.One thing I noticed with the scenarios compared to the original is the overuse of decorative objects. You can easily get several thousand bucks just from removing the unmanageble messes that the scenarios come with. The issue isn't just the overuse, it's the type of unmanageable structures built for you. It is pretty much always hollow shells that are a pain to work with. Trying to edit them or put tracks/roads into them is an exercise in futility. They are built to look nice, not to be worked with.One thing I noticed is that it rarely matters what you build. Just build one of everything and guests will be happy. Maybe it gets more challenging with harder scenarios, but I doubt it. Ultimately the guests are very simple state machines that don't care about your attractions beyond the three key statistics for each one. It works, but it doesn't give a lot of depth.But overall? This is a great game. It's easy to forget the systems it runs on and just have fun working on a little pet project for a few hours.			"

												So if you are here then you most likely played this game when is came out many a year ago. So to answer your questions here you go...""Did it age well?"" - Yes. While blowing 2D sprites up to a 2K monitor does show every pixle, the ""campiness"" of the look keeps it fresh. The gameplay is still intuitive, and you are still given quite a creative sandbox. Combined with custom ride tracks, there is still plenty of originality in this one.""Replayable or just Nostaliga?"" - A little of both. While there is still ginuine original fun in making new rides and parks, the amount of rides seems smaller than I remeber and the isometric graphics can wear on you. Eventually, the game seems small and runs its course.""Worth $10?"" - If you enjoyed it as a kid, then yes. Relive your days and spend $10 to kill a couple weekends.""Addiction 2.0?"" - No. So as a kid, I remeber playing for months and months and having dozens of custom tracks for every roller coaster. For this one, I played several weekends, let my girlfriend play a weekend, enjoyed the game, and put it back on the shelf. It won't suck you back in.""Overall?"" - If you are looking for an ""I'm in between games right now"" Game or are just wanting to relive some childhood memories, then you will enjoy money well spent on this.

												I remember playing this game when I was a kid, and I still love playing it. I prefer it over RCT 3, which is saying a lot since the graphics are a lot worse. Such an amazing game for its time!			"

												Still a great game. Scenarios are super fun to do and most of them take a lot of time.			"

												So if you are here then you most likely played this game when is came out many a year ago. So to answer your questions here you go...""Did it age well?"" - Yes. While blowing 2D sprites up to a 2K monitor does show every pixle, the ""campiness"" of the look keeps it fresh. The gameplay is still intuitive, and you are still given quite a creative sandbox. Combined with custom ride tracks, there is still plenty of originality in this one.""Replayable or just Nostaliga?"" - A little of both. While there is still ginuine original fun in making new rides and parks, the amount of rides seems smaller than I remeber and the isometric graphics can wear on you. Eventually, the game seems small and runs its course.""Worth $10?"" - If you enjoyed it as a kid, then yes. Relive your days and spend $10 to kill a couple weekends.""Addiction 2.0?"" - No. So as a kid, I remeber playing for months and months and having dozens of custom tracks for every roller coaster. For this one, I played several weekends, let my girlfriend play a weekend, enjoyed the game, and put it back on the shelf. It won't suck you back in.""Overall?"" - If you are looking for an ""I'm in between games right now"" Game or are just wanting to relive some childhood memories, then you will enjoy money well spent on this.

												A great game, lots to do and replayability. It is also a very funny game to mess around in.			"

												I played this game all the time as a kid and loved it! When I finally learned how to actually play, I love it a lot more. I only bought the steam version cause my original disc is too scratched up and won't run the game properly			"

												Excellent Sequel to the original roller coaster tycoon. Like the predecssor (and the successor) if you didn't play this game as a kid you had no childhood, and I suggest picking this up along with the original and 3. A bit pricy at $10, seeing as it's basically the original with some new features like a scenario editor, so it may be worth waiting to get this game on sale. Still I'm not going to say you're getting ripped off for paying full price. It's worth it both ways.			"

												Out of all the RollerCoaster Tycoon games, RCT2 is my favorite! The graphics aren't cartoony like RCT3, it features real-life Six Flags coasters (that I have actually ridden), and it has enough content to keep me busy for hours.			"

												The best feeling is setting the price for umbrellas to at least $20, and then it rains ... and everyone suddenly wants to fork over their money. xD I also am obsessed with popping every stray balloon. All ducks must be forced to quack. Scenario Editor is the best thing for making a simple, relaxing level for your building itch. Guests can handle pathways more than a single square wide. The game doesn't beep every time a guest gets lost. Scenery options are adorable. Building a coaster isn't too difficult. The variety in food stalls tickle my fancy. The game itself runs beautifully on my laptop, although there is a weird occasional glitch where the window you use to load ans save games gets blacked out, and you have to ""guess-click"" to find your file. It's not a difficult thing to do, though. Do you like the first classic game? Want a version where you get to basically do whatever the nut sack you want? Here you go. This is it.			"

												This was my childhood, so i'm extremely biased in this review.TRIGGER WARNING.This game is probaly the first game i ever played, at the age of 4. This, together with World of Tanks and Planes got me into gaming. It's maybe not for everyone, but it's a fun time waster.			"
