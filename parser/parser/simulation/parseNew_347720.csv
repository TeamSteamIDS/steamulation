												In this game, you can drink 1 soda per level. There are 258 levels. The average soda costs $1.19. If you were to drink 258 sodas in real life, it would cost you $307.02.So by paying $5 for this game, you save $302.02 on actual soda. The numbers don't lie, this game is an amazing use of your money.			"

												I feel the need to clarify. This game is not art, it's ridiculous. It obviously doesn't appeal to everybody. What you'd be buying is essentially a better version of LSD Dream Emulator, if you don't find that concept interesting already, this isn't for you. I just want readers to understand my position before going into this, I like new ideas and interesting concepts, and I think games should be allowed to be whatever their creators please. People who feel the same way as me will probably get quite a bit out of this game. Soda Drinker Pro was initially released in 2008 after it's short development time of one day. Now I've always thought♥♥♥♥♥♥like this was nonsense and shouldn't even cost money, but over the years it's been worked on and actually has an awful lot of content in it now. I never thought my purchase of digital Soda Drinking Simulation would eventually provide me with an interesting and enjoyable experience. No, I'm not talking about Soda Drinker Pro. For some reason, the dude who made this decided to take his Malware looking joke program and put an actual video game in it, it used to be that you had to stare a rock for about 3 minutes in order to get into the secret game, but I believe the method has changed now. In this game, you play as a raindrop and touch different objects, turning into whatever you touch. If you know LSD dream emulator, imagine it being like that but with continuety, things to do and an awful lot of work put into it. And honestly, as I played more of Vivian clark, the secret game, I started to warm up more to the idea of Soda Drinker Pro itself. A game that looks like another one of those worthless ""simulator"" games that nobody likes, but has a cult following because of Vivian Clark.The most you're gonna get out of Soda Drinker Pro is some laughs with your friends, exploring and listening to all the bizarre nonsense it has. If you want a better version of Soda Drinker Pro, then buy Soda Drinker Pro and play Vivian Clark.Feel me?			"

												This game is terrifying in a primal, gutteral, mind-expanding kind of way. Don't play this before you go to sleep. I'll fully admit I haven't plumbed every depth of this experience, but it goes places I could never have thought. Weird, dark, abject horror places. Places that will make you think about how you approach life.This isn't a funny review. This is legit a mind-bengingly transformative experience.			"

												What a ridiculous game. That pretty much summarizes the reaction I had when I first saw Soda Drinker Pro in action. The game really just serves as a front for the real game, Vivian Clark. I found this to be a strange design decision, but given the absurd nature of this game, I guess it fits well.Soda Drinker Pro is a joke, through and through. There really isn't anything redeeming about it in terms of gameplay, but I was impressed by the fact that seemingly every level has a line recorded about that level when it starts up. That alone probably took a few hours to record.Vivian Clark, on the other hand, is an artsy little game that reminds me of Wario Ware. You go back and forth between goofy minigames that are as fun as they are outrageous. These minigames connect to other ones, usually by bumping into an object or even by failing in a certain way, which creates a maze for the player to navigate through. Vivian Clark is very much a maze of minigames that tests your memory as you try to figure out how to get back to game X to continue exploring new ones you haven't discovered yet.So do I recommend this game? Yeah, I think so. It's a fun little game to show off to friends or stream. I'd wait for a sale to pick it up though, because I think the entertainment it offers is pretty limited.			"

												I can safely say that this is the absolute greatest game I have ever played in the entirety of my life. I have played many games before, but none were as absolutely wonderful, intuitive, and fun as this one. Here is my review of each part of Soda Drinker ProGRAPHICS: 10/10I don't normally care about graphics, but this game's graphics are so realistic, I can't even distinguish it from real life. It's like my computer screen is just a window to another part of the world, where I'm drinking a sodaGAMEPLAY: 10/10The way this game introduces you to the gameplay is incredible; you walk around your envionment on a quest to drink soda. You have to carefully navigate your surroundings to collect bonus soda, and drink your own soda entirely. There are 102 incredible levels that play out this game mechanic perfectlyCONTROLS: 10/10This game reccomends a controller, however I did not have one on hand at the time. Even so, the keyboard controls are perfect! You use WASD to move, mouse to look around, left click to bring the soda to your mouth, and right click at the same time to drink it. It's extremely smooth, and it feels completely naturalSTORY/DIALOG: 10/10It's about a man, travelling the world, and even beyond the world, with the quest to drink a soda at every possible location. It's truly endearing, and I felt like the character was a real person with goals and struggles. The dialog is also absolutely phenomenal, I laughed, I cried, everything. One example of a quote is ""I wish I could eat a soda"". The voice acting is so great along with it, it truly makes you feel for the charactersREPLAYABILITY: 10/10After you complete the 102 main levels, you unlock a ton of bonus levels with various new themes, and the gameplay never gets stale. I could play this game for years on end and still not get boredOVERALL: 11/10I highly recommend you buy this game as soon as humanly possible, it's too good to miss out on(If you want to play the real game, go to level 2, and go into the door on the house on the wall. It's a really good game that's been worked on for 3 years, and is really fun. I'd give the real game hidden inside this one a 7/10) "

Soda Drinking Simulator Mixed with Crazy Minigames

			#sodadrinkerpro http://store.steampowered.com/app/347720/ Add me on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/desolater_iv/ There is actually two complete games here.		

There is actually two complete games here. One is Soda Drinker Pro, and the other is Vivian Clark so I'm going to split this review up a bit.Soda Drinker Pro+ Certainly a unique and a bit surreal experience. You walk around and drink soda, but it's like the more you drink the stranger the game gets while some deranged man whispers in your ear about the greatness of soda. + The levels...are soooo weird... Some of the worst textures and graphics you may ever see, and it seems like all the walls or ""backgrounds"" are childish crayon drawings. Strangely enough, it's actually enjoyable as you only spend about 30seconds or so in each level, and it's quite interesting to see what comes next and to laugh at how bad the environments look.  Each level is also in a unique location, and can never guess where you will end up next. + Oddly addicting, I felt the need to keep going just to see what crazy land I'd end up in next. It has the ""randomness"" factor that depending on your taste may make this a very enjoyable laughable experience.- Not much gameplay, you mainly just look around to admire the outlandish and pretty poorly designed levels- It gets very repetitive after a while as you are mainly just waiting for a meter to drop to get to the next level, and after ~10seconds of looking around, you again just wait for the soda meter to drain.- It's more of an experience and less of a game, I would not recommend this unless you know what you are getting yourself into. Vivian Clark+ I did not expect to find a complete game within Soda Drinker Pro+ The gameplay in this is actually extremely enjoyable. Very wacky platforming / shooting levels, where the game mechanics and characters constantly change between each level. Similar in appeal to games like Wario Ware.+ Colorful surreal levels that don't really make any sense but are all so interesting and there's a ton of them+ Hilarious characters to play as and enemies+ Surprising amount of thought went into it. Some stages I was like ""I'm going to jump off the map and break the game"" but surprisingly there are actually events and odd things to find seemingly all over. + Such a creative and unique game and experience, it's random but in a good way. + Great soundtrack- Somewhat confusing at what or where you are supposed to go. Some stages you will instantly die not knowing what just happened.Overall I would say Vivian Clark is the better game, but both games are great and very unique experiences.			"

												Okay so first off I guess this review contains spoilers.Secondly: SODA DRINKER PRO is not the actual game.I kept playing thinking there was something to be found in the ""soda"" levels, but there is none as far as I can tell. The art, audio, and gameplay is intetionally terrible, It's only purpose is to distract you from the actual game that can be found on level 2.The actual game is something called Vivian Clark, a series of interesting mini-games with great music and great art.I honestly haven't been this charmed by a game in awhile. Maybe it's just the juxtaposition from Soda Drinker, but the moment I got into the main game I was hooked. The games are quick, though a tad difficult to figure out at times, but once you figure them out they are very enjoyable. The art is goofy and colorful, and I believe at least part of it is hand drawn? Everyhting you do has an impact, even death is just a part of the cycle.Hiding the main game within a ""joke"" game was a risky move, and it seems that a lot of people aren't getting the joke, but honestly I really enjoyed it. Good game, and a great gift to prank someone with.			"

												An acid trip meets Wario Ware.Soda Drinker Pro is really two different games - Soda Drinker Pro and Vivian Clark. SDP plays like a relaxing almost ASMR game where you wander hundreds of small 'sets' drinking soda. There is no real goal or mechanics, but every level has unique voice overs and the game has a relaxing feel to it.Vivian Clark is an insane trip through a kelidoscope of hugely varied levels all with wildy different rules, art styles, and mechanics you need to figure out on-the-fly. VC seems to be absolute nonsense when you first encounter it, but after a while you realize there are definite rules to the game, and upon the third run you'll be absorbed into the madness.Best game withing a game award.

												""I wish this beach was made out of soda."" - Probably a quote from this game.SDP is the kind of silly game I would make had I the time and focus. You walk around various locations and drink soda in Microsoft Paint creations while a disembodied voice spouts so-stupid-it's-hilarious statements about their love of soda. The levels range from ""Drink soda on a beach"" to ""Drink soda inside a human mouth."" You finish each level by drinking your soda (LT brings the straw up to your mouth, RT drinks). There are bonus sodas scattered around, but I think they're just there for an achievable, though I love the ""B-b-b-b-bonus soda!"" soundbite.The environments are a combination of LSD trip and a 5 yr olds' daily output in MS Paint. I'm not saying the developer fed his daughter acid or anything, but it should maybe be investigated. I'm just saying. The downfall to exploring the amazing level design is the slow movement speed. You would think a guy jacked up on sugar would move faster than a snail, but he moves about as fast as the static backgrounds. Before the feminists jump all over me for assuming the main character's gender, I'd like to mention that gender isn't specified (though you can maybe view the male disembodied voice as coming from the main character) and since the game is in first-person I have injected myself into the lead role and I am a male. There, crisis averted. So, the non-denominational fluidly gendered main character saunters around slurping up the carbonation, but they can also just fall through the textures (it's a feature) and explore the world outside the world. These areas are mostly just black fill buckets, but it's nice to get outside.Oh, I almost forgot: There's a game hidden within the game that is the actual game where you play as a rain drop (I think?) and go through what can only be described as ""Wario Ware: Nightmare Fuel Edition Pre-Order Edition Powered by MS Paint"". You're thrown from situation to situation and most of the time you figure out what you need to do right as you die. When you die you turn into a rain drop ghost and go to a big room filled with.. uh... books or something. In this room, you can jump into the fire and try another set of mini-mini games and if you manage to be successful (Only the Lord knows how it works) one of the books now has a picture.Once all of the pictures are revealed a giant face appears and the final boss battle begins. You must play a game of ""Guess Who?"" to win. The winner gets to drink soda. Only some of what I have just said it true.10 out of 5			"

												My thoughts on Soda Drinker Pro:Very well done indie game that revolves around exploring an acid trip of a world whilst sipping a carbonated drink. It really does a good job making something as mundane as drinking soda very immersive, cinematic, and easy to become emotionally invested in. I cannot write in words how much joy I feel when I collect a bonus soda and the same goes for how much sorrow I feel when I'm almost out of soda.Pros:-Around 300 levels to drink soda in-Beautiful, realistic graphics and audio-Customizable soda-A narrator with a prepubescent voiceCons:-A majority of the time, your mouse cursor doesn't get hiddenIn conclusion, this is a work of art and I look forward to many hundreds of hours of Soda Drinker Pro.

In this world your goal, nay, your destiny is to drink the soda, like a pro. Explore hundreds of unique and interesting levels, filled to the brim with fascinating lore and story. Experience soda like you never have in stunningly detailed environments. Let the world come to life through the gloriolus, masterpiece of a soundtrack. Now all that may sound too exciting for you, but you have to ask yourself one question: Are you a bad enough dude to drink the soda?			"

I would buy this game ten times if I could so I could drink ten sodas at once.

												Never did I think I would be able to have the experience the joys of soda drinking ever since I gave up drinking soda years ago. That was until this game came into my life. Soda Drinker Pro delivers the most accurate virtual reality experience of soda drinking currently available on the market. I would be lying if I were to say that this game didn't improve my life tenfold within the first few minutes of playing it. I have no idea how I was able to make it through the day before this unprecedented technological wonder graced my life with its bonus sodas.			"

												(CONTEXT: Only saw the trailer before playing the game, so maybe I'm missing some crucial inside jokes)EDIT: Welp, seems I actually missed an inside joke, so this review below only applies for the SDPro part of the game. If you're reading this remember to check out level 2 extensively for the actual, pretty cool, super-secret game!This game is probably one of the more confusing and frustrating experiences I've played ever, not because it's 100%, unsalvagebly bad but because it has some genious elements drowned in a sea of boringness and contradictory gameplay decisions that in the end just don't work.First of all, the positives:-Music: If there's something that shines on this game it's the music. There's over 120 tracks of a guy singing about how he loves soda and it doesn't get stale at all, just the oposite, it became the only reason I played through the whole game, just to see what the next music sounds like. So bravo, sound design guy :D-Some of the levels: There are a few levels that were pretty interesting, like 2 and 69 from the top of my head, and a few more that the concept was pretty funny/bizarre/dissonant with the previous level that really made me burst out laughing.-Soda Drinking: Duh. Probably one of the smartest choices was letting you advance to the next level whenever you want after a short forced period of exploring, kind of like the camera part of Sonic Dreams Collection (which you should probably play), specially considering on how many levels you can fall off the map.-Hugely configurable Soda: Cafeine is not too healthy for me so it's nice that they included caffeine-free soda alternatives :)Negatives:-The walk speed: Uuuuuuuuurgh. The worst part of all is that the dev definitely intentionally screws with the player in this front, as in some levels you can only walk at a decent pace while going sideways or even backwards, like in Big Rigs (which is not too far off from this game, actually :D), and it changes on a per-level basis, so it gets even more anoying by making you check which is the correct way of walking before actually exploring a level.-Slurping makes you unable to hear what the songs are saying: Which can be ""fixed"" with a bug that makes you able to drink soda silently but it's still not a good idea to make the more entretaining part of the game harder to experience.-Generally Bland Levels: And here's the main problem I had, the levels where waaaaaaaay too empty, specially after Level 2 being so jam-packed with awesome secrets which set your expectations waaaaaaaay too high, and with the walk speed being waaaaaaaay too low which forces you to strafe-walk, which in turn ends up with you looking at a wall for 50% of the time you're playing.-The mouse isn't hidden when playing: Ha ha, what a chuckle-worthy amateur ironic inconvenience we did that every other bad game developer also does. Still doesn't make it less annoying though.In conclusion, this could have been a great game, relegated to a one-off, 2-hour long joke and it's kind of tragic in a way :P. My best regards to the developer for trying to make an actually interesting joke game, but the lack of content really makes me not able to recomend this to someone else.Though it's perfect if you're looking for a game to make some Youtube vids for your chanel :D(The secret game was pretty cool too)			"

												Soda drinker pro is a simulator where you drink soda. It may seem stupid, because all you do is walk slow, and then beat the level in about 30 seconds, but there are hundreds of easter eggs, mainly the ones where you customize your soda. I highly suggest looking up soda custumizations, that can do stuff from spitting spagehtti out of your soda, to letting you jump, and finding all the cheat codes you can before playing the game. And also check out the house on level two. This game is something to worship. Worth the $5.			"

												Pros:-Soda.-Accurately represents the euphoria I get from drinking soda and the crippling depression that ensues when I realize I'm out of soda.-Ultra-HD graphics to render all this soda.-Soda.-You can get more sodas if you want.-Successfully hypnotized me into wanting a soda.-Soda.-Did I mention soda?-Oh and there's a hidden game in here too. You have to go into the house in level 2 to find it and it's pretty fun.Cons:-Walking is too slow, but that's probably just because you need to take the time to enjoy your delicious soda.-Not much gameplay variety besides the previously mentioned hidden game. All you really do is slurp down cold, refreshing sodas.Final Verdict: A cold, refreshing, delicious soda / 10.			"

												Well, it's something new I've got to say, you might see those terrible visuals and tell yourself to stay away from this game, while yes, the graphics are absolute crap, the gameplay is fun and broken as hell, a lot of levels enough to give you diabetes in real life because of virtual soda drinking.8/10, I'm addicted to coke....diet coke.

												The hidden surrealist art game within this is not bad, but it's also really not good, either. The product being advertised is pretty lame though, and I feel the best I can say about it is that more effort than I assumed was put into it. The levels go pretty deep and there's different audio (and sometimes music) for every stage.			"

												I got it and knew about Vivian Clark... Once I got Vivian Clark, It unlocks all the achievements for Soda Drinker Pro and that really ruined this game for me. While Petty, Yes. I really wanted to work hard to get those stupid achievement as a bragging right, but OF COURSE this had to be there so I could not win them one by one.Honestly this game isn't worth it for Vivian Clark either...

												I paid $10 for a virtual soda drinking game, and have absolutely no regrets.Now it's clear to see that this game is actually just an abstract interpretation of Dostoevsky's greatest works, and really represents the amount of time and sweat put into his novels. I'll admit though, around the time you start drinking soda by a pool, it gets really political, and maybe even philosophical in nature, as seen when you're drinking soda on top of a rooftop, (WTC anyone? Illuminati? Wake up sheeple!) So basically what I mean to say is,If you like soda, it's a 10/10If you don't like soda, it's a 10/10If your best friend's brother's girlfriend is a cheating ho, he should dump herand then buy soda drinker pro because it's a 10/10.This game is perfection, and paying $10 for this piece of art is a STEAL, all of those original Van Gogh's I bought to help start that fire in california those months back cost me millions, but this game is cheap, flawless, and beautiful.

												I'll probably get downvoted for this but whatever.Honestly..there is nothing to this game,it looks utterly terrible,the fact you cannot even adjust simple things like sound is mind-boggling to me.And the whole ""surreal"" part of the game is just..falling short honestly..You walk excruciatingly slow,the sounds are loud and obnoxious as hell.For instance,you can hear the voice actor's mouse clicking when recording lines..and while i'll be honest and did find the dude singing about soda all the time pretty funny it wears out really quick..The fact people defend this as ""surreal art"" is an insult to the concept of artMaybe i could have recommended this game if it were free and you're in a really silly mindset and surreal stuff like LCD:Dream Emulator intrigues you,but not for 9,99 euroes for what is basicly an very early alpha..

												Never in my life has a game encouraged me so wholeheartedly to enjoy it without even trying.I think that's the beauty with a game like this. On paper, walking around drinking a virtual soda doesn't seem like much, but when you let yourself actually give it a chance you'll find that over 40 levels have already gone by, and you and your friends are anxiously anticipating what weird and interesting levels come next.Video games at its core should always be about having fun, and if you are able to find the fun in drinking a simulated soda in places like the skate park or the moon then you will fall in love with this game.Pros:Huge Soundtrack - Each level has its own unique songOculus Rift SupportVive Support (coming soon)Ultrawide Monitor Supported (tested with 3440 x 1440)60fps achieveable even on low range PCsOver 100+ levels to drink sodas in Hundreds of secrets and levels in hidden separate game inside Soda Drinker ProLevel Select after completing the gameIn-game Soda CustomizationCons:No Leaderboards/Tournament Support currentlyLeaves you wishing there was simulated food to wash the soda down with "

												When I was a child, I had a dream. A dream to one day sip soda in space. Unfortunately for me, I don't have the aptitude to pass the rigorous tests required by NASA astronauts.Then came Soda Drinker Pro.Now I can experience the sensation of the carbonated cosmos as I veeeeery slowly crawl my way across not only space, but over a hundred locations where a person can only dream of drinking soda.Have you even been on top of a skyscraper? You have? Well I'll bet dollars to sodas you weren't sipping something tasty while you were up there. Well now you can!From familiar locations, to the very limit of human soda shenanigans, you, too, can experience what it's like to enjoy caffeinated slurpers the way they were meant to be enjoyed.You can see where it all begins in the soda factory, or experience soda-ception as you drink soda into your mouth... INSIDE a human mouth! It has only just begun! "
