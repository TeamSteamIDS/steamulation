												The Tropico series has always played it safe, never pushing too hard to renovate making sure people know what to expect each time. Tropico 5 is no exception, with the same infrastructure and demands those familiar with the series will know exactly what to expect. With that said, significant changes have been made to the economy, development and elections systems that Tropico 5 holds its own unique identity within the series.One new feature is a redesign of the campaign, while in previous games each mission would start on a new island beginning with the basic building blocks each time. Now players are given the choice between two islands, once the player completes a mission on the choose island the player must then complete the next mission on the second island. Levels are not reset and any development on the islands remains throughout the campaign. This change allows players to watch an island flourish over time, crawling up from its colonial roots to its own independent metropolis. Each choice becomes a much greater decision as it will not only effect the player for that level but for later missions that follow. While it provides a much greater sense of accomplishment it's a system with many drawbacks. The greatest of this being put into an automatic lose situation.After completing a mission I returned to a previously developed island which had a population of 900 before leaving. Once I came back I found my population had been almost cut in half to 500 however my foundations remained and continued to cost upkeep which left me with a drastically understaffed island. There was little I could do as I would almost immediately jump into negative finances and could never pull it back out. Restarting the mission left to the exact same situation every single time, an issue that needs attention. With some missions giving little time for a player to complete objectives, those starting in a bad situation can soon find themselves in impossible to win situations. With the current save system this could take you back numerous missions to repair.While the infrastructure behind the game remains the same the countless economy changes significantly effect how you would approach missions. A major flaw with all previous games was that most players would soon find their own approach that would work in every environment. With your own approach that was guaranteed to succeed there was little reason to break that mold. In tropico 5 however a  much greater dependency on varied trade breaks that mold. Forcing players to constantly adapt to a ever changing economy and political struggles. Finance isn't the only major overhaul, as elections now become significantly more difficult. Factions will be tougher to please, often forcing the player to juggle edicts and votes between each election to keep the majority on his or her side. With most actions having an equally negative response as positive players need to keep a keen eye, balancing the books of finance with the cries of the population.Sadly, with what Tropico 5 makes up in polish it loses in humor, failing to come even close to the witty comments, quality voice acting and wacky scenarios we were given in 4. It's still remains funny at times but fails to reach that unique charm that gives it such a unique identity we remember it by.Pro:+Well balanced economy+Improved Visuals+Increased Difficulty+Islands continue to develop after completed missions+Improved design of elections+New well designed edictsCons:-Less humor then previous game-Generic voice acting replaced funnier voice acting from earlier games-Some balance issues with builds, some produce little profit compared to others-Campaign design can cause some missions harder then intended or even impossible-Missing features, presume coming in as DLC for new buildingsTropico 5 is a drastic improvement to early games but comes with many drawbacks of its own. With this in mind it's difficult to recommend or bash this title. Those who come for the gameplay and love a challenge will be happy with the changes. Those looking for a relaxed campaign with a humorous story may be left disappointed.  While i'm left with mixed feelings i'll still have to recommend it. It's well polished, well designed and exactly what most people asked for in this sequal it's just missing that cherry on the top to make it a memorable game. This is only a short review, the full review will be completed at a later time.			"

												I liked Tropico 3, bought Tropico 4 and LOVE it.   I didn't think Kalypso/Haemimont could screw Tropico 5 up.  They did.  The game has far less content than Tropico 4 did on release day.  This is so you can buy content later as DLC!The economy controls are dumbed down.    Rent, wages, and all other economic factors are frustratingly simplified and broad. Shipping was a bit of an annoyance in Tropico 4,  goods could stack at docks faster than it could be shipped.   In Tropico 5, that has been remedied (sort of) but the new way of shipping goods is an annoying, island clogging, minutiae-filled chore that makes me long for T4's flawed but ultimately less annoying shipping system.T4's troops worked automatically and you had no control over them.  In T5, you do have control.  A good thing, right?  Wrong.  The troops controls are clunky and unresponsive.  Another chore, not fun.Rebels in Tropico 4 would appear if you were doing things wrong or didn't have enough jobs.   There was a reason (and cure) to having rebels on your island.  In Tropico 5,  you have rebels for no reason.  Your island could be a perfect paradise, but huge rebel attacks will still occur.  The Developers have admitted the rebels are arbitrary and for no reason other than some lame excuse about it being an upstart island with political turmoil; it just (and does, often) happens.In Tropico 4, you could be a benevolent ruler, or a brutal Tyrant, which is what Tropico was all about.   In Tropico 5, you are an impotent and weak  governor that can only survive by doing your best in hopes of  pleasing the fickle masses to desperately stay in power.Then there is DLC.  Tropico 4, when it came out, was quickly buried in DLC. BUT!  The first several DLC were handy, useful DLC.  The DLC had VERY useful buildings, cool decorator pieces, a mission, and outfit.   Over time though, the Tropico 4 DLC became cheap, useless cash grabs.   This crappy DLC content continued on into Tropico 5.  All the DLC in Tropico 5 is pointless and adds nothing interesting.  Not only that, but a few skilled gamers actually found large chunks and entirely complete, usuable DLC in the RELEASE DAY game files.  Which the Devs tried to patch out and B.S. away.In Hindsight, you could offer me Tropico 5 for free, and i'd decline the offer.  Tropico 4 is superior in nearly every way.  With Tropico 4 being available on Steam, there is absolutely no point, reason, or need to buy Tropico 5.This really, for me, is a bummer.  This isn't some game I saw, tried, and didn't like.  I LOVE Tropico 4.  I WANTED to see this game succeed.   Kalypso/Haemimont are the little guys in the gaming industry.  But when they got greedy and released a content-weak game and put that content (that isn't that great to begin with) in DLC, they sold their integrity to nickel-and-dime their customers.I was dissapointed when  Kalypso started rushing out several shoddy DLC at the end of Tropico 4's run.  Now, with Tropico 5,  Kalypso/Haemimont are no longer on my radar, I don't care about their games.That's okay.  I still have Tropico 4.EDIT:  Some people have posted below with some very good arguments about where my review may be wrong.  I still feel my review stands, but if you are truly looking into whether you should spend your money on this game or not, it wouldn't hurt in reading the comments below for some very valid responses that may change your mind.

												Okay. This is coming from a big, big Tropico fan. I played Tropico 3, 4 and 5. Let's get into this review.I was very excited about the game before release. Ever since Tropico 4 came out, I've been waiting and waiting for news about the newer one. But sadly, this game disappointed me. First, let me talk about the things I liked.The textures and graphics are amazing. They have been improved alot. I played the old versions on my Xbox 360, and right when I changed to PC and tried this one out, I noticed the differences. The buildings look very nice, and when you zoom in, full in, you see all the details. The interiors of a shack, the faces on the people and sometimes just the trees. The developers went all out on this game and I say that the graphics are a plus.The new online mode is awesome. You can play against three other people in an island, and race to finish quests or even try to invade the other person.But those are really the only things I liked about this game.In Tropico 5, you play alot of missions in the same island. You're basically switching islands and going back to them. I didn't like this move. Alot of times you feel like you're handed the island to you again. I know how this would have worked, but I don't really like it. In the old versions, every single mission is another challenge to you. You go on a different, all new island and building it out of nothing. Alot of times this game just feels repetitive.I feel like the direction Kalypso is moving is not helping the game. The game relies on DLC after DLC to try to keep it fresh again. A game shouldn't fully rely on expansions to make it better. Those DLC's could instead be implemented to the actual game and when you play the old game and the new one, you feel like it's a big step.There have already been four DLC's out that could have instead been in the original game, that would have made it better. I still don't know how there's no offline multiplayer yet. It would be awesome to have people controlling different part of the island.And also, the soundtrack. I loved the older soundtracks, but when you compare Tropico 5's to the older ones, it's just not as good.Tropico 3 and 4 both amazed me. I loved both of those games instantly. I expected the same to happen with Tropico 5, but sadly that was not the case. It feels like this whole series just relies on DLC's to make the game fresh again. I can't see many people buying DLC after DLC after DLC. It's just, not how it should go. I feel like Tropico can be one of the biggest strategy/city-building games out there if it just fills in all the gaps. After just a few hours of playing this game, I was already disappointed. I felt at times I was forcing myself to continue, and that it felt like a chore to keep playing.If you've never played a Tropico game before, or you're just new at city-building games, I recommend you try this out. But if you are a hardcore gamer, or a just experienced at Tropico, chances are you won't like this game - at least not as much as the older ones.And for this, I give the game a 5/10.			"

												STOP.  If you already own Tropico 4 you probably don't need this game and it will likely frustrate you.  I'm writing this review in the days after release so my gameplay time of Tropico 5 has admitedly been limited.  That said, I've played the Tropico series since the original back in the early 2000's.  I get that changes need to be made to keep the game relevant, but in my opinion Tropico 5 changed largely in the wrong direction.  However, if you're new to the series, you'll enjoy this game for what it has to offer.  Here's my initial breakdown.Pros:Beautifully redesigned buildings, everything just seems to fit together nicely when you're trying to cram a lot of buildings into one space.The dynasty member function seems like a possible plus (haven't really fleshed that out yet).I like the concept of having manager's in buildings, but it's not clear how they contribute to the overall expense of the building.I like some of the new edicts like charging for healthcare!  Finally those lazy peasants will pay or die.The addition of tanks adds a layer of badassery and battling rebels/other nations is more engaging.Cons:Can't set the exact wage for a worker anymore (it's done in an overarching budget system, so you set a budget for a building which somehow encompasses a salary for the worker and operating costs for the building).  You want to pay your farmers more than your doctors?  Sorry, can't do that...You also can't set the exact amount for rent anymore.The above two issues make it hard to become an uber-capitalist dictator.  I know it sounds ridiculous but they've dumbed down the economic system so much it's actually complicated.Customizing your character is gone.  I don't care so much about what they look like, but who thought an astronaut suit should be 1 of the 5 outfits you get to choose?  I'm more upset you can't select negative and positive traits to create a more in depth character.  I always liked choosing flatulence even though the palace guards got double pay...Am I missing the plants and shrubbery somwhere?  You basically have a large park and a small park, that's it.  No single palm trees to meticulously line your roadways...  Statues meant to glorify El Presidente's and intimidate your opponents are non-existent.You have to pay to explore your island now which seems pointless.Options like ""paper plates"" and ""cloth napkins"" that used to affect the quality of a restaurant are no longer options.  You adjust the budget of the building now to change service, but that raises the worker's wages.  What if I want to increase quality without raising wages...  El Presidente is pretty much useless.  He can't help rush construction or join in fighting the rebels like in previous games.  No option to sway election with speeches either.Building progression through research/time feels poorly developed and arbitrary.  You earn research points through libraries and observatories which give you tech upgrades for different buildings.  Unfortunately, you can only build tenaments and country houses at the beginning so if you want to upgrade your citizens to apartments to improve housing quaility you have to wait until the Cold War era (and then destroy all your previous housing and try to make the apartments fit into your city layout).  I wasn't a fan of Tropico 4's purchasing blueprints, but I think it works better than this option.You can no longer see who is actually visiting a restaurant, pub, doctor's office, etc.  You're just given a ""number of visitors"".Searching in the almanac is painful.  All I want to do is find the least happy person and execute them, but you can't search by that.  You can find the person with the lowest approval rating, but they're not necessarily the most unhappy.I know this is knit-picking, but I liked when you purchased a building upgrade in previous Tropico's, the physical improvement would appear (i.e. skylights in the cigar factory).  There's no visual changes on the buildings when upgrading now.You can't toggle a dock to accept ""tourists only"" so I keep having my teamsters dropping export resources at the dock in my tourist area.  I don't want stinking peasants mixing with the upper echelons of society. Only a handful of island maps to play.One of the biggest negatives for me is the overall lack of buildings (where's the gourmet restaurant??? or El Presidente's childhood museum?).  I assume this is so we can be sold the inevitable expansion packs.Suggestions:The ability to choose the placement of our palace and dock at the outset of a sandbox game would be nice. Consider reverting back to SOME, not all, of the core game designs from previous versions.  My big ones would be charging specific amount of rent and setting worker's wages (please change this back).True roundabouts would be great for improving traffic flow.Even with all the above, I'll still play it because I absolutely love Tropico, but just a lackluster delivery compared to past game versions.  Overall rating from me would be a 6 out of 10.			"

												Yep, it's another Tropico game...There really isn't much more to say other than that.  It just feels lazy.  All your old favourite buildings return,  very few new ones.  DLC is silly expensive, customization is meh.  Save your money and go play one of the other tropicos.  Either 1,  or if you like roads,  3.To elaborate.  Building Variety - Tropico has never been big on this, but it's 2014.  Would it kill to have 2 models for a Bunhouse/house/etc?Eras - These are esentially mini-goals.  If you fail to achieve them within the time limit,  you lose.  That's about it.  All they do is lock buildings from you,  making it harder to layout a good city -from the start-Ships -  You get to own ships,  that sounds cool, and I really thought it was going to be like Tropico 2 managing pirate fleets.  But it's not.  You couldn't have any less interaction with them, No naming,  no colouring, and with each era, the ship just poofs into the next eras ship and keeps doing what it does.    Huge let down.Mines - Ugly eyesores that just look silly when you upgrade them.   A mini Bagger 288 just sits there, and it's grosly undersized. Tanks - Yep, I'm gonna say this too.  The introduction of Tropico tanks.   They are T-34.  That's it. Every nation be it america,  soviets,  modern armour,, oh and of course Tropico,  all use the same model T-34.      Bring Back TNT radio - I mean the Tropico 3 one, (but 4 is even better than this schlock).   Some of these sound nitpicky,  but this is why the game just feels lazy.  Would it of killed them to make a few differnt tank models?  Woud it of been that much of an effort to make another bunk house?Sure, these are just visuals,  but this game is very difficult to mod.  And there are virtually no new gameplay from say Tropico 3,  or 4.      So if the game play is the same, then the visuals better be amazing......but they aren't.  Hence  a lazy, forgetable, ""next tropico game"".			"

												I'm a pretty big fan of games of this kind. I grew up playing the different versions of Sim City.I'm also a big fan of Tropico 3 and 4, and bought this game on sale. Even on sale, I can't really recommend it and here's why:They haven't fixed the most important problem.If you've played Tropico extensively, like I have, you've run into the problem with road congestion. It has not been fixed. You must plan out very meticulously your road network from the VERY beginning of the game. Each subsequent story mission builds upon the progress you've made in previous missions. You use the same Island and city as before (there's 2 different islands, and thus two different cities). If you're not very careful, you'll end up like I did, 6 or 7 missions in without the means to really go in and rework everything, and it's not until that far in that the problem becomes very large and difficult to solve.If you have a diverse economy, which is actually very easy to achieve in Tropico 5, it's not difficult to make quite a lot of money that can be invested into infrastructure, but the problem for me doesn't lie in having to rework infrastructure, it's that I'm working to circumvent poor coding (the road system I mentioned earlier) that has been in every Tropico game I've ever played.Road management is a part of the game, I'm fully aware, but there is no management options. Tropicans will take the shortest route available. There are no one way street, or high volume highway like options. I can't do anything but build a singular type of road which nearly every building needs to be attached to. The only way to be completely efficient is to have EXTREMELY ugly circle roads that never connect to each other except by adjacent garages. Someone actually developed a circumvention system for Tropico 3 (which has persisted into 4 and 5 out of necessity). If you google ""road congestion tropico"", I'm sure you can find more information (if interested).This Tropico is a little bit more challenging than the last ones in terms of Rebels and their threats. They attack much more often, and your army cannot be controlled beyond telling them which buildings you value the most. Rebels will attack from multiple points and your army sallies out of wherever you built your buildings. Since all you have is men on foot and eventually very slow tanks, the rebels will usually destroy several buildings before your army can even respond.Rebels are also able to target your army squads while you are unable to control and choose targets for your own. What this means is that your army will be running to defend a certain building, and the rebels will follow along and continually fire at them while your army DOES NOT RETURN FIRE, and simply dies. It's EXTREMELY frustrating.There's also a huge problem that persists with housing. As you might remember, people get old and retire and their income falls. There are children, unemployed and students as well. In Tropico 5, Houses now have budgets like employment buildings do. It is essentially the rent charge.NO MATTER WHAT JOB PEOPLE HAVE, most of them will not live in a house because it is too expensive. Even if you've maximized the budget (and thus their pay) at their place of employment. You must lower the rent to a single point (out of a maximum of 5) in order to allow people to live there. YOU MUST turn on social security. Otherwise you will CONSTANTLY be attacked by rebels. YOU MUST do this for every housing building.People will also not live in a building that is too far from where they work. Couples make a decision based upon both their work locations. If not satisfied with how close they live to work, they toss up a shack!It is not uncommon to see shacks right beside housing units that are completely empty.For some ungodly reason, Tenements lose housing value over time. There is no option to remedy this. This only way to circumvent is to completely destroy the building and replace it. It would have taken a few lines of code to add a renovate option, but no, they didn't do that. I wouldn't be surprised if it was in a DLC.The graphics are improved, a lot of the mechanics of the game have been streamlined, but not fixed. There are improvements here, although the dynasty system is tacked on, stupid, and useless.It feels like it's still Tropico. I don't know what it is that provides that feeling, the enjoyment of the game, and the music (I've always really enjoyed it) or the same bloody bugs that have persisted forever without attention.

												Unfortunately I just can't recommend this game as much as I would have loved to. When I first played it, it was a nice refresh and continuation of Tropico 4. As I played it more, I found more and more problems with the game. The fighting, the buildings, the overlays (pre building placement and post placement), rebels, population cap, to name a few. I'll summarise these quickly:The fighting: Essentially, its build a huge military or be wiped out. Once rebels appear, if they break through your military (which they will as they are OP most of the time), they head straight to the palace and game over. Your military doesn't respawn, you cannot rebuild military buildings either. Even if your barracks refill with 8 troopers, they won't go and fight the rebels attacking the palace. Totally ridiculous and to me, its a game breaker.The buildings: Only apartments have 'variations' and even then they look pretty much the same. Throughout the eras, the building all look the same, modern housing in colonial periods. Really? There needs to be much more variation in models. As it stands now, its bland. There are buildings missing too that should really be in there. Since when did a police station act as a fire station? Seems lazy. Modern tanks appearing in the cold war era too.Overlays: When you place buildings that say 'Affects nearby plantations' or 'Generates funds off nearby housing', there is nothing to say how far this radius is. You have no idea what it will affect until its placed and built. These buildings often cost alot to make and many times where you place can be a total waste of resources. For a modern 2014 game, this is not acceptable to me. Kalypso merely say its meant to be this way and is fine, and then point about overlays in the Almanac which are irrelivent to the point raised to them. There is nothing to say what the radius is of any building. This is a poor effort.Rebels - too common, too OP. Doesn't give the feeling of a dictatorship game at all. Even on high happiness (some people have rebel attacks at 100 happiness). There are no real reasons for rebels alot of the time, and to many, its unknown why they are attacking since everyone is happy. The only real way to counter rebels is to have a huge military, which generates more rebels in itself. Lose lose situation ultimately.2000 people population cap. You have often use 1/4 of the island and reach this pop cap. Very poor. Dev excuses for this are poor and obsurd. As of patch 1.08 a population slider has finally been implemented. Only took them 9 months.Last point i'll make is the DLC for this. £3 for most DLC, gives 1 building,  an outfit you never see, 1 short mission and a music track. Most of the DLC was already included in the base game and can be unlocked via mods and working correctly. Your paying to play with what should have been there in the first place really. Considering the base price of the game is £29.99, its really not worth it. Could only recommend the game if game price drops below £15 and all DLC included.			"

												It's probably the first new Tropico game since Tropico 3.  Tropico 3 and 4 were basically exactly the same (4 having different UI and more stuff, but basically the exact same game).Blitzing through Tropico 3 and 4 the past week to re-acclamate myself with the Tropico experience is of no help in Tropico 5.  It's essentially a completely different city-builder game now.  It actually feels difficult to do certain things at the start of a map which I sped through in 3/4 as easily as dressing myself in the morning, like setting down roads, quickly scouring for what metal resources are available, and setting down a patchwork of farms and garages to be connected by roads at a later date.  It's an unknown world to enter now.Combat is somewhat incomprehensible, as there seems to be a severe disconnect between army size and army health, which only makes sense if by ""army health"" they meant ""army morale"" except the army health doesn't recover after winning a battleThe very first mission of the first campaign starts out normal and casual enough, then becomes suddenly brutal as you're faced with a foreign invasion that will completely wipe you out unless you've prepared with more than one military fort.This isn't a particularly bad thing, but just starting off the one major complaint I have is the music choices are a whole lot weaker.  They're all instrumental now, and they all seem to have been chosen to be less spirited and soulful and more as just background noise, and it's an immense disappointment.Another major issue is something that really shouldn't be an issue but somehow the game makes it one: You're doing a map, and finish an objective, and suddenly you get ripped out of your game and dropped into a map select screen.  There is no Victory screen or anything resembling one to let you know you've won the mission and are moving on.  As well, there's no explanation as to why you play the first map, win your independence, then in the very next mission you're back to being a colonial governor on a different map, working your way to independence.The third mission then immediately drops you into a HUGE enemy invasion of your island, necessitating at least 4 or 5 military forts, basically forcing you to have planned ahead from the very start of the game for something you had absolutely no way of knowing was coming.  So if you didn't prepare for a completely unexpected invasion of 4+ infantry units at the very start of the 3rd or 4th mission, then you have to go back and play the game over from the beginning.Another weird issue to have is something about the intensely bold colors and overall dim lighting and color choice of the buildings makes it difficult to actually make out individual buildings on the screen.  They start to mesh together and merge with the trees to a certain degree so it's nearly impossible to tell them apart without zooming in.  Even now I can't tell the difference between Construction offices and three country housesFurther playing experience leaves me realizing this game feels a lot more hands-off than Tropico 4 was.  A lot of the same style still exists, such as being able to track down and interact with citizens, but the difference in UI and game mechanics causes something of a disconnect between you and them, exacerbated by the almost complete lack of any real information in the Almanac.  The Almanac is now almost completely useless.  During elections, there's no option to give a speech and make promises and praises, and for the first time in ANY tropico game, I lost the election even after using fraud.  Somehow, there was just no way to interact with anything to affect the election --- I just somehow lost the vote, as it was somehow tied to the arbitrary Happiness.  There was literally nothing I could do to affect the election. Inexplicably, after my third time re-loading the save, by NOT holding elections I got a boost in happiness.  There are only 4 factions this early in the game and none of them are loyalistAs well, the game keeps asking me to re-make my dynasty at random moments between mission successes/failures, resulting in there being multiple duplicate copies of my dynasty in the game menuOn the positive side, some good changes made include the Construction office is actually efficient now, so you don't need to build 4 in a single mission just so you don't have a backlog of 30+ buildings at a time, and you can actually see what people are protesting about and do something about it instead of just the generic ""raise happiness""The game also seems to think certain things are funny, like having you balance relations between two opposing superpowers.  Just like in previous Tropico games.  But those were about diplomacy.  In Tropico 3/4, when you choose to ally with someone, they reward you with a free army base of theirs which they pay you to keep on your island, as well as protection against potential invasion from the other superpower.In Tropico 5, when you choose to ally with someone, they reward you by having a random HUGE invasion of your island, obliterating much of your buildings when you inevitably lose, unless you run through every single mission as a paranoid militant with dozens of army bases and military forts and virtually no industry.And then you end up losing the game yet again when an election comes up and you lose because all your industry buildings were destroyed in the ""friendly"" invasion and you have not enough money to bribe every faction into voting for you (pretty much the only thing you can do in a Tropico 5 election)On top of that, every other mission seems to have a sudden HUGE invasion of your island with little to no warning.And another thing: the continuous island you return to and build upon instead of starting over every mission idea is a good idea --- it worked great in games like Zeus Master of Olympus and Emperor Rise of the Middle Kingdom.  However, when it's always the same two islands for pretty much the entire campaign, it quickly becomes boring.Adding to this is the ""genius"" idea that despite it being a persistent island, the game thinks it's somehow a great idea to reset all your edicts between missions without you noticing.Another massive ""genius"" move which makes absolutely no sense: there is a complete and total disconnect between Happiness and Unrest and Rebels.  As such, you can have every faction Indifferent or Happy with you, and still have nonstop Coup attempts and/or Rebel attacks in a certain mission.  Sometimes it's intentionally scripted just to be aggravating.  Other times, there's just no reason for there to be so much rebel activity when your society is free, open, and happy.By the time you're near the end of the game, whenever you hear the phrase ""Great giant Tropican spiders"" you will completely explode with murderous rage			"

												If you're going to play a Tropico game, play either 3 or 4, they're superior in almost every way. Tropico 5 is the Michael Bay  of Tropico, big, dumb and colorful. All the systems, variety and control seemed to be streamlined and simplified. The game was rather simple before, but going from 3 to 4 to 5, you notice a trend downwards. The DLC is overpriced and unsatisfactory. If you've beaten every other Tropico game and this one is on sale, i guess get it, you'll beat the main campaign within 20-30 hours. But I wouldn't say its much worth it.			"

												Hello everyone, I'm writing this review as a huge fan of Tropico Serie. My favourite game of the serie is still Tropico 4. Tropico 5  isn't as good as Tropico 4. Because in Tropico 5 you can't even customise your character. There isn't as many as skill for our charackters then Tropico 4.Positive:+Better graphics.+Longer play time.+New dynasty feature.+New trade route feature.+Better wars and riots.+Co-op feature.+Managers for buildings.+New eddicts.Negative:-Unsatissfied character creator.-Colonial era is boring.-There isn't so many new buildings.-The happiness chart of classes are worse then Tropico 4.-New building menu is worse then Tropico 4.(Sorry for my bad English, thanks for reading)			"

												As a fan of the Tropico series, the 5th does not dissapoint. The game is great fun and has not failed to entertain me. The humour aspect of the game is amazing, and it makes me laugh everytime a pop-up appears or whenever I have researched a technology. The different eras are also cool, creating a nice diversity, and I certainly couldnt complain on the graphics. I have not played the game for a substantial amount of time, so I have yet to figure out how to avoid the uprisings at best, because the ""happiness-system"" differs from previous games. But then again, I have tanks for a reason.Whether you're a fan or not, I would recommend it. I am currently playing the sandbox mode, and I have plenty of great hours ahead of me to look forward to.			"

												Tropico 5 is not a worthy successor of the tropico series.My gripes with tropico 5 are especially with 2 points:1. RebellionsIn Tropico 5 you cannot manage to satisfy everyone - and that is great. The problem lies in the fact that even if citizens have a satisfaction rate of above 70%, they will still permanently rebel. Additionally, there really is no adequate option to reduce the number of rebels, be it with the military or socially - in Fact, most options decrease libery, reduce the satisfaction and thereby increase the number of rebels - and when they rebel, they cant be killed of.2. Trying to be funnyWhile in previous editions of Tropico, there was a underlying dry tone of humor that increased immersion in the game, now almost every Radio adress tries to be funny - but just says ""You are no dictator of a banana republic, you are just some stupid gamer""On a personal note, I miss the election speeches from T3			"

												Sadly another franchise in decline..It feels very much unfinished, lacking in detail and polish. This game was released long before it was ready.. which is a shame, as it features some very interesting ideas that given more thought and development time would have made this game really something special. Sadly it appears to have been carved up and rushed out for a rather shameless DLC cash grab. If your looking for a game in the series to buy Pick up Tropico 4 with the DLC in the next sale. Skip this Pros-----Era's - your island now advances through various eras from colonial to modern times each with its own set of available buildings, technologies, politics and edicts You now have family members forming a dynastyMultiplayer Mode - a feature that this game really could have run with.Its still tropicoCons------Many of the building options are gone (some can allready be found in the overpriced DLC shop) the build options for each era are also therefore painfully limited especially the early ones. Often what is available in each era makes little historical sense at all. Also most of the buildngs most notably housing only has one skin per type.Much of the fine tweeking from the previous games is now simplified or simply gone, the new system often leads to seemingly random swings of popularity, unrest, strikes and uprisings with no clear reason why or control over the events that follow, just hit fast forward and hope for the best.The dynasty members dont really do anything interesting; theres a handfull of scripted events that rotate for them. The humour is tired and repetitive very much a one gag pony.The campaign missions are for the most part all very much the same set of scripted events on rotation and the story doesnt really go anywhere it just peters out. It is entirely possible to totally cripple yourself for later on in the campaign with no way short of going back two levels of fixing it (if you happened to save it). The alternative is also true you can set yourself up so well you will just face roll through half of the missions. "

												The ethos of sequels back in the day used to be that they were bigger, better, and with more content. Unfortunatley the modern mindset seems to be that you can push out a minimal product at full price, and charge for ""DLC"" that should have been in the main game.Every step taken by kalypso seems to be a step backwards. There are less buildings, less avenues for economy, less player agency. In tropico 4 you could entirely eschew certain areas of economy and still make it work. Want a industrial complex that sucks the minerals from the land for massive profit? No problem. Want to protect mother earth, build your economy by becoming a tourist trap, or an island vegas? Go for it! Do you want to create an atheist state, a complete theocracy, a communist regime, or a capitalist paradise? All do-able!Not so with tropico 5. Make a single move that the people dont like, and you're done. in some cases there is no way to correct this (sign the wrong thing into your constitution, watch your approval tank. just watch, you can do nothing about it now.) its game over. You -must- build a church if you want to have any hope of making out of colonial era. You -must- build a mine if you want to have any economy at all.  While in tropico 4 you had to keep citizen happiness in mind, now it is the single driving factor of the entire game, and you will have to play it their way, not yours. Now that buildings are tied to eras, the game is completely homogonized. Every game is ""A"" leads to ""B"" leads to ""C"". you -must- start with farming, which -must- lead to industrialization, with no options for tourism or even entertainment until the right era.And the DLC that is planned for this game is beyond insulting. there are so many features from tropico 4 that were taken out so that they could be resold in bits and pieces. Remove jails and make the game activley punish you for trying to deal with criminals. Oh but dont worry, there is a prison DLC coming out that you can buy. It reminds me of a mobile free to play game, only i unfortunatley payed money for it.Tropico 4 was one of my favotire city building games, with many interesting mechanics and conecpts that couldn't be found elsewhere. Tropico 5 is an incredible disappointment, i cant recomend anyone buy this game. To echo many other sentiments, buy tropico 4 if you are interested in it.			"

												Ultimately disappointingI was a big fan of Tropico 3 and 4. This one is still playable, but just doesn't feel like it has the depth of the previous titles. Some of the additions I liked and thought were interesting changes, such as:- You know have a ruling dynasty and you gain new family members as you go, with different abilities and bonuses- You have different eras that you move through and different building available in each era. There is also a constitution with options in each area. This is how you control things like open or closed borders, conscription vs high quality military etc.However, things I didn't like:- It seems much harder to really get a picture of how your society is going. Little things like : previously in a school you could see all the students and click on them, now you just get '5/10 students' and you can't drill down on them. You can't seem to get a list of your whole population by education level, only the unemployed people. You can't see an individual persons needs anymore, just their ratings. It's harder to watch or track a single person. You can see thoughts, but not what they are currently doing, whereas they used to tell you they were going to the doctor, or to get food. You can't see how many people are using a garage or railway station. Lots of small features like this that they have removed make it really hard to diagnose problems, like whether people are able to commute effectively, or have enough services around them.- Because of the above, when things go wrong, you often have no idea why. Why is the happiness rating high but my approval rating low? Why do I have so many of every type of entertainment building but the entertainment happiness is still low? Why do I have lots of teamsters but my factories are full on un picked-up goods? It's often hard to tell if it is something you are doing wrong, inconsistencies in the game or bugs. Why do I have so many homeless people who won't move into the housing I have built that is in a good location and appropriate for their wealth level? Why do I still have people listed as 'broke' when I have the social security edict turned on. Why is there a group protesting against my government, but when I click on them many have 85+ approval rating and happiness? What are they upset about? No idea.All of that being said, the game is still fairly easy to complete, but for those like me that like to not just finish the mission but build the ultimate society in the process, it is so frustrating seeing things like a low approval rating due to homelessness when I have dozens of houses standing empty and other similar things. I ended up giving up because I just wasn't enjoying it any more.For anyone new to the franchise, go and play 3 or 4, they are awesome.			"

												I loved Tropico 4 to an unhealthy degree of obsession. It was the first Tropico game I had played and I couldn't wait for Tropico 5. Like most I've been disappointed with the changes made. They aren't bad, they just don't work too well. Tropico 4 was a waiting game, you had to wait for buildings to be finished. Tropico 5 is a waiting game, you have to advance in era to get to the interesting sections of the game.Tropcio 5 feels like the developers tried to make it more tightly focused while cutting corners from everything to budget manangement to simple buildings. This takes away a large amount of options that you had in Tropico 4 and it makes it feel like an unfinished game. Everything interesting and fun has been removed and we're left with a lifeless and soulless sim city.Coop is pretty pointless because it's just the base game with someone else on the island taking up space and resources. It's still just as boring and waiting around for your citizens to be happy enough to advance to the next era.I played through the campaign once and was left wanting more. I even tried to replay it but it's just so tidious I can't bring myself to dredge through to chapter 2.My final thought is that this game should be good, possibily even really good. But cutting out content for future DLCs and expansions makes me not want to invest any more time with Tropico 5 when the base contains so little.El Presidenté deserves more.			"

												You may see a lot of reviews slamming this game for being ""dumbed down"" or overly simplified compared to previous titles, and to be honest they may not be entirely incorrect. However, what these people don't seem to grasp is that sometimes less is more. I will admit that Tropico 5 is certainly not a perfect game, nor is it even the best game in the series, but it still holds it own and should be considered by anybody who is a fan of the series or the genre.I will start with the good, which there is plenty of. Tropico 5 has the most robust campaign of any Tropico game to date, with persistent islands that carry over from mission to mission and a new dynasty system that allows you to pass your legacy on to your offspring if you choose to. While the dynasty aspect could have been fleshed out a little more, it is still fun and finally gives you something to actually do with your off-shore account money (which is used to upgrade dynasty memebers). As usual the story to the campaign is wacky and goofy, and completely unbelievable, but that is all just part of the charm to Tropico. Tropico 5 also introduces a new era system where instead of always starting during the Cold War, you can now start as early as colonial times and work your way up through 4 eras to modern times. While not game-changing per say, this does add a nice touch to the game and a fresh way to play it. The voice acting throughout is solid and charming, the music is catchy as always, and the visual are superb. The color pallete is bright and cheerful, and the level of detail on some of the buildings is rather impressive when you zoom in. It should also be noted that as with most Kalypso games technically the game is great, it runs wonderfully and I have had zero crashes.As I mentioned though, the game is not perfect I'm afraid. There are a couple of aspects of the game that have been simplified compared to old titles. For example, when setting the salary for a building instead of a slider that allowed you to set whatever dollar amount you wanted, there are just 5 pre-set payrates to choose from. Furthermore, while you can still set the pay from every building of that kind, you can't set it for all workers of that education. A slight annoyance, but still something that may detract from some and it also points to the larger issue with this game I think many have. This game is not City:Skylines, it is not Banished, nor is it even SimCity in terms of complexity. Tropico 5 is a largely streamlined experience that is intended to let you focus on the big picture without getting too caught up in micro-managing. Some people like this, some don't, which I get, but it should be noted Tropico games have always been like this so it really shouldn't be a shock that Tropico 5 continues the pattern. Another annoyance is the lack of content in this game. While the campaign is robust and plenty of maps are included for sandbox mode, it is frustrating to see buildings and concepts introduced in previous games either omitted or held out so that they can be introduced through over-priced DLC. That said, the base game as is still provides plenty to do and can be enjoyed without spending a penny on DLC. It should be noted though that the exact same argument could be made about the last game, as without the Modern Times expansion Tropico 4 was a little lacking in endgame content, so again this really is nothing new for the series.All-in-all Tropico 5 is a really solid game. Not great, but also really not bad, and very much worth the only $40 it costs. I will admit that you may want to start with Tropico 4 (skip 3, 4 is just an upgraded version of it), and if you want a really good game that is completely different from the rest of the series play 2, but if you already have played these and are hungry for more or you just want to play the newest game, you will not regret this purchase. Also please note while my Steam account doesn't reflect it I have played every game in the series extensively, in particular 4 on the XBox 360, and while 2 actually remains my favorite 5 is right up there as well.

												It's the same Tropico we know and love but with a variety of new elements added to the core. Good fun, fantastic soundtrack and gorgeous graphics.But I really do miss the faction leaders that conversed with you in Tropico 4, it let you know what needed fixing on the island and now the only indicator of♥♥♥♥♥♥hitting the fan is your almanac.. which really doesn't explain much. Also, the top left notification box tends to drag down the FPS rate whenever it appears. An option to disable  it and bring back the text notifications would be grand.However this is still a great game and is worth the price of admission. EDIT - Lord Oaksworth can burn in hell.			"

												We pre-ordered our copies. I didn't review this game until now, hoping that after the inital ""shock"" I would change my mind. I haven't.I've been a huge fan of the Tropico series since 2001, but I'm afraid I've lost that lovin' feelin' with Tropico 5. We loved the Tropico games so much that we upgraded ALL our computers so we could run T5 (DX11) to the tune of about $400 (just for new hardware). We had no other reason/need to upgrade (nothing else, to this day, has required us to upgrade). IMHO, that is some pretty serious game love. :)One complaint I have is muti-player: we purchased multiple copies to play TOGETHER, but it doesn't really work that way (read the forums to see why, they explain it better than I can).The reason why I don't play anymore (single player) is because of how they make the scenaries work. It goes back and forth between TWO islands, each time continuing where you left off. That might sound good, but for me it's a total pain. I have a VERY hard time remembering which buildings were upgraded before, how upgraded were they, which ones need managers, etc. etc. etc. For me it was SOOOOO much better starting a new island each time. That way I could build not only for the general needs of my people, but for the needs of the scenario.*As of 5-29-15 -- $112 (so far) for the full game ... are you kidding me? Full price costs - Tropico 5: $40. Available DLCs: $72.*9-20-16 -- HumbleBundle has the Complete collection on sale for $10 (US). I purchased the collection as I hate ""incomplete"" games.  Still very unhappy with 5, but at least it's done (well, that's my understanding, anyway). Reminded my husband this morning, no more paying full price for games.  Period.			"

												A few dollops of new paint has refreshened the series! Or has it...To me as a fan of Tropico since #1, Tropico 5 has seemed to have thrown out all the old stuff that has been in the series since the Original Tropico. The Traits are now gone, alot of buildings from previous games have seemed to disappear, hardly any of the buildings look different from each other (Even Shacks look the same).The concept of the time periods seems like an interesting idea at first but it is really poorly executed, around 80% of the buildings are locked in Colonial times, which is fair enough... Where are you going to get a Space Program in the Colonies? But what annoy's me is the fact that they didn't execute it like they did in the Modern Times DLC where you upgrade the buildings with the time. You can't even get a Medical building in Colonial times, or hardly any Entertainment buildings. And I'm pretty sure they were making Cigars and Rum before ""The Great Wars""The Gameplay can feel very dull and a bit of a drag at times. You feel like you've listened to the same song over and over and over, Done the same objective over and over and over. And you've gotten nowhere.Also the customisation of the characters is appauling comparing to Tropico 4, which had limited options to say the least. The only costumes you can use in Tropico 5 limited to literally 5. And some of those don't even make sense, You can dress as an Astronaut in Colonial Times. This makes me facepalm very much so. They also slimmed down the traits to around 8. Considering Tropico's Useful and Humorous Traits from the past, these really aren't traits. Did I mention you can't have your own name? Nope, You got to have a name from this list. And going through the list is a grueling task as you have to go through each name INDUVIDUALLY by scrolling to the side.The new characters also seem a bit... Bland and uncharacterful comparing to previous games. Even the Caricatures seem a bit lifeless. Also not having the faction figureheads stating what's going on really lets the game down.It also is quite tough on the hardware, I would suggest using a beefy computer. But this could just be the early stages of the game.On the brightside, It's pretty I guess. And Trading is a nice touch. But not much else has changed and had only really taken a step backwards. I think Haemimont and Kalypso really need to get their act together, After that tremendous flop that was Omerta and now This. I don't understand why I thought this may have been better.4ish/10 - Buy when it's cheap.			"

												It's okay. I was much more engrossed in the previous ones. No unique challenges to this one's campaign (Some of my favorite campaign missions in Tropico 4 focused on population restrictions (no immigration, or hundreds of people dropped on you) or extreme financial restrictions, or time restrictions that actually required thought.)The game doesn't feel like they tried. The campaign mode is broken, too short, and I ended up with a dozen save files of the same thing. I can't go back and play a specific mission easliy. The constant flow of DLC is good... the quality of DLC is garbage.Game has potential to be good in the future, but it's not worth it unless it goes on a deep deep sale			"

												In the words of Penultimo: I am so furious!If I wanted to play a military strategy, I wouldn't play Tropico. The allure of the game was, in the first place, being able to develop an economy while ignoring (And profiting! from) world wars and such. and now, i have to siphon the money in military bases, barracks, alliances, and still I get two simultaneous invasion forces on my shores, impossible to defeat unless I have ludicrous ammount of firepower myself. And it's not the firepower I want when I play Tropico. I want humor, sleezy diplomacy and pina coladas.Not to mention the lack of ammount of zoom that existed in previous incarnations of the game,and lack of info about buildings.I'ma lover, not a fighter.

Anyway, you may want to buy it but i can tell you, wait for the complete edition. There are a lot of DLC's and without DLC's the game is not complete. Well, you can buy DLC's or you can buy ""Tropico 5 4-pack"" 2 times*. See?

												I played Tropico 1, 2, 3, 4 and now the newest one. Let me give you some history for basing my opinion.Tropico 1 was fun, innovative for its time, great ambience, nice enough music (a bit repetitive) and the missions were very straight foward, like a game in that era should be.Tropico 2 was more of the same but with some great additions. The pirates theme, i guess, worked out really well. I enjoyed it for a long time before it got sort of pointless.Tropico 3 is the first installment that you can call ""the current generation"" of the Tropico games. The controls and the GUI were terrible compared to T5, but in some ways, it was more rewarding to try and accomplish the side missions.Tropico 4 was a massive improvement over T3. The best music so far, with a varied selection and you can't really get bored with them. The missions were OK, mostly made sense, which is good. Progression was very linear, in a satisfactory kind of way.Now, TROPICO 5: the music has been toned down a little. No such quality or variety as found in the fourth game. The missions are basically life-savers that pop up in just the right time or a simple do-and-get-rewarded sort of scheme. The rewards are usually immigrants, cash or good standing with other nations. The graphics have improved a bit, yes, but it's not like you'll be playing this at the closest possible zoom all the time. Granted, when you do zoom in, the textures don't look washed out too badly and the characters and objects are a little bit higher poly than in T3 and 4.The game is no longer THAT linear. You do end up being thrown back into the past to take revenge on your present-time enemies by sabotaging their past. That surprised me a bit and i liked it.The whole technology progression thing deserves a compliment. This works in much the same way as Endless Space, which, in my view, is the very best technology tree found in a strategy game. It simply works nicely and gives you a good idea of the passage of time.Overall, i would say this is, indeed, more of the same good old tropico, but it cannot be denied that it has been improved substantially. It does feel ""new"".I give it a 8.5 out of 10. You really should try it if you like city builders in the likes of Patrician and Port Royale.			"

												Okay so....If you are new to Tropico series, I'd suggest getting Tropico 4 instead as it's more ""complete"" compared to Tropico 5. Sure Tropico 5 has got interesting features like timeline where you start in Colonial Era and proceed to Modern Times, also more troops (now it's got fighter jets and tanks) so you have more variation in combat.In term of controlling your city, Tropico 4 excels (in my opinion). In Tropico 5, they even remove ministers, so you can just issue any edicts you want. No more Immigration Office so you have to make amendment which once issued, you have to wait for really long time. Your character can visit places to ""enhance"" its efficiency and much more in Tropico 4. However, in Tropico 4, the military stuff is limited. You are only offered infantry and that's it, you can only fight the rebels and if someone wants to declare war on you it's an instant game over which is suck.Player customization is limited as well in Tropico 5, you can't even name your character the way you want, the traits are not as many as Tropico 4. To replace this, Tropico 5 introduces ""Dynasty"". It's just your family, nothing special, you can choose one of the member to become the next president. For me, it's an upgrade, but the question is.... Why remove the freedom to customize your character?What I like Tropico 5 the most is the multiplayer feature, unfortunately the game is not really crowded so you better have some friends playing with you. Because it's a race against time thanks to the timeline.DLCs? I don't recommend it, it adds some features but you'll get bored easily. Besides, the DLCs are too many the price in total is just not worth it. The base game is actually enough.			"

												This is one of my favorite games! The content is filled with little jokes and puns and things to make you chuckle (or groan!) and the game is certainly challenging on the higher settings. I play the lower ones and am challenged quite enough, thanks! I have really enjoyed the DLC, which is on sale often enough to make it affordable for even my tiny budget.  One of the things I enjoy most about the game, is the replay value! I can use the 'sandbox' setting to play any goal, a known or randomly generated map, and with any level of difficulty. Add some of the DLC expansion packs, and honestly it keeps me quite busy whenever I wish to play. Challenging, without being Frustrating, and replayable without being stuck with only select missions. Fun Stuff for the price!			"

												I see that Tropico 5 share the curse of all the good series, the curse of predecessor. If you already have a very succesful game in your hands, developers are facing somehow a dilemma: if they try to keep the old mechanics and game design, fans will accuse them of copying the old game. And if they try to implement new mechanics, then fans will complain about how the new game spoiled what it was good.  The curse of homm3 over its succesors is the best example of that.In case you had great fun playing tropico 3 or 4, this game probably won't give more to you only because it's developed few years later.  In this perspective, i find most of fan's critics are right. Yet, for those who didn't play a tropico game before and for those who seek an enjoyable simulation, i strongly recommend Tropico 5. Particularly the campaign is well designed, and most of all game is fun.			"

												I am doing my best to like this game. But it is a huge step back from Tropico 4. Military plays a huge role in this game, and it is hard, nearly impossible to survive without one. And the issue is, unless you have conscription, your military will never fill up.You start in the Colonial age, its neat, but the issue is, its lack luster. You get randomly attacked by corsairs, who totally destroy your army. They are too powerful, and attack way too early in game before you can even establish a military to fight them off.Then there's the World Wars, its cool too, but Military again, unless you have conscription, is nearly impossible to bring up. You get attacked by the army of invading militaries, and they, again, destroy your army due to some reason.I haven't gotten much to the Modern age and Cold Wars often, because I find myself quitting the game because my militaries keep getting destroyed. And This is on the easiest Difficulty, mind you.I like the features they aded but they need to tweak Rebels, Foreign invasions, uprisings, and coups before it can be enjoyabale again. They defeat your military too often, and you find yourself, despite having a nice 85+ approval raiting, losing the game.I can't suggest this game untill these issues are fixed. Don't even get me started on the DLC they push for this game too.			"

												Firstly, let me make it clear that this is by no means a bad game. If you had no previous experience of Tropico and someone gave you this for free you'd probably be very happy. Unfortunately, comapred to the (cheaper) Tropico 4 this is just seems inferior in so many ways. The storyline is the usual entertaining farce and the new era system works pretty well in that you have a different feel for each time period in terms of interaction with foerign powers. However, it also feels like it's not been totally intergrated (the Colonial era has citizens in the garb of the Pilgrim Fathers but with standard asphalt roads). There's also a new trade system but it just seems different rather than better. The  biggest bugbear is the feeling that it's all been dumbed down. There are fewer micro management options, the almanac has less information (especially regarding politics) and there seem to be less building options. This means that often there feels like there is nothing much to do once a mission gets going and often it's just a case of letting the clock run down, occasionally throwing down some random buildings to fulfil a quest. With Tropico 4 I remember being chopping at the bit to get onto the next mission. After 10 hours of Tropico 5 I'm afraid I'm just a bit bored.			"

												Adds multiplayer and better graphics at the price of having fun. $10 - $15 is reasonable, past that and not so much. It's literally only but a shadow to what Tropico 4 is. I do like the Eras though, but I hate how they did it. You just complete a mission and boom automatic Colonial Era to 1920s to Cold War to Modern Times. The way they talked about the whole Eras was that it was going to be amazing and interesting, but what we got was nothing of the sorts. I do like the Tropico series but as always, it's now at the point of anything new is just going to be crap. Hopefully this is the end of series and they go on to something new or else make Tropico 6 over the top - I kind of personally hope for Tropico in Space or something, something a little different. Oh, and avoid the DLCs, they're stupid. You get a building an outfit and maybe a very stupid and short mission. Not even worth $2, at the quality they are it should be a free update - or just simply already in the game.Not recommended. Get Tropico 4.EDIT: I take back what I said about ""not recommended"" I do kind of recommend it. It isn't horrible, it's just a bit disappointing if you've played previous Tropico games. But, like they did with the other games was they added in what should've already been in-game via DLC. Grab it with all DLC around $20-$30 (or lower) is a good price. No DLC isn't bad but you'll understand what I mean in my review, it's very lacking in buildings. I won't even go into explaining how dumbed down the rest of the gameplay, just read some of the top reviews as they explain it a little better.			"

												Best Game in my library now that I realised how much depth this game has.I play this with a friend and they are the Darkness who murders people and bribes people as well as handle the dirty work.I am the nice El' Presidenté smiles for the Camera.The issue you are having is one I struggled with until it dawned on me.Tropico 5 no matter what anyone says is a unique beast. You CAN play as if it was a REAL place - do things as if you WERE El' Presidenté.If you treat this like a Game and nothing else - you might get success - hell you may even win the scenarios - but that is not the true joy.The true joy is in playing how YOU would manage. I murdered anyone who was homeless, I murdered anyone who didnt agree with me, I bribed those who were poor and approved of me - thus giving them wealth.I was a dictator and a FINE one - even my people said so - the living ones. In time my approval  went up and my detractors went down - literally.Provide a housing community with nearby grocery stores and a park and entertainment for them to spend their wages.Provide working zones that can draw in people to work and pay them a high wage which will get spent in entertainment essentially getting back what you paid.Homeless people are homeless because they can't afford housing so either make housing CHEAPER by lowering the cost on its menu (Dollar sign) or Increase Wages. Income / Expenditure.If people are jobless - increase Job variety - people don't just work a job for the hell of it - give them a reason to, click on the people look at their thoughts and remember - some people are just LAZY and won't work just like real life - kill them - hell - I'd do it in real life if it was legal.You are El' Presidenté - YOU ARE THE LAW.

												This is the first Tropico game I haven't enjoyed. You seem to spend the entre game fire fighting and the campaign is just freaking annoying. I'd rather have realistic economic goals for my island than some far fetched plot about the end of the world. You end up just not caring. It of course retains it's typical humour but really goes overkill to a point that any characters in the games are incredibly unlikable. Even your own president. There's a wide array of buildings to choose from and I really liked the progression through the era's Colonial through to Present day but the games campaign revovles around heavy military usage yet you once again lack real control over your troops. It's highly annoying to watch them act consistently like brainless turds during an invasion or rebel uprising.Futhermore the game has issues with the staffing of your buildings, as your island becomes ever more populous people seem unwilling to ever work in your manufacturing plants meaning they stand there empty most of the time. Frustrating is not the word. Not to mention that mining resources run out far too quickly meaning you can miss targets in game since you son't actually have anymore of that resource to mine. And finally the targets are boring as hell. Given that there's now 5 countries (Yes Europe isnt a country but whatever) you can negiotate with, why do they want the same things all of the time.I did enjoy playing Tropico at times, but it is a seriously lazy game. If the developers had spent more time balancing the above issues and ditching the cheesey puns that occur every 5 seconds then maybe just maybe i'd recommend it to you. Only ever buy on a Sale at a very generous rate.			"

												I'm a big fan of the series and tycoon games in general.  Unfortunately, a low population cap makes Tropico 5 unplayable by its second half.The player will find his citizens emigrating en masse starting around the beginning of the Cold War, which will cause his economy to collapse.  Factories go unmanned, exports are never transported to the docks, expensive buildings are rendered useless by rolling blackouts as power plants run short on staff and fuel. Pulling people from entertainment and welfare buildings causes Happiness to plummet.  Hiring even illiterate foreign workers quickly becomes prohibitively expensive, and pointless, as they're likely to leave on the next transport.As the population cap is invisible to the player, he may spend many frustrating hours trying to placate his citizens before he realizes it's nothing he's doing wrong. In order to play successfully, one has to very consciously limit expansion from the start of the campaign onwards. (Unlike in previous installments, scenarios don't start with a blank slate; everything you've built in earlier eras is still there, although the money in your treasury, mysteriously, is not.) In short, this game is essentially broken without mods.  I appreciate the detail, beauty and realism that Haemimont have added, but they are in no way worth the losses in gameplay.			"

												They've sucked the life out of the game.  Half of the buildings from earlier versions have been removed (though the code has now been hacked and many are already prepared to be added back in as paid DLC content later) and nerfed a lot of existing stuff so you have to buy upgrade DLCs.  Mechanics have been dumbed down and sandbox mode is no longer the days of fun it used to be in previous Tropicos.  You quickly run out of stuff to build or achieve.  Almost all alternate building skins have been removed so every freakin' apartment or tenement, etc. looks identical.  No ability to create a custom, good looking island.  Heck, you can't even place trees anymore.Is it all bad?  No.  They added some new stuff like research and the ""eras"" that are positive.  At this point, though, I have to say DON'T BUY NOW.  Wait until the DLC is released and pick the whole thing up on a juicy Steam sale later this year.  It's not worth anywhere near full price now.			"

												I cannot express how much I REALLY DO LIKE THIS GAME. However, you can tell right off the bat that it was made for the purpose of selling DLC. It's lack of vanilla content compared to its predecessor's is almost outraging- that is unless you BUY DLC. And, even the buying of DLC would be fine with me, if all of it were not $4.00 each and so on. On that note, most of the $4.00 DLC come with only ONE new building, ONE new map, and ONE new quest. So remind me, why is it worth it to pay $4.00 for that? The vanilla game is fine enough, but seriously underdone. If you are looking for a good Tropico experience, play Tropico 4. You'd save your wallet, too.			"

												Tropico 5 just isn't a good entry to the series. The graphics are either too colorful or too bland, the soundtrack gets repetitive after three loops, and the radio host is more annoying than Betty Boom, which is a hard feat to accomplish.The buildings have no variety, placement feels blocky, the roads leave marks if you mess up the placement, and everything feels massively watered down.Elections feel incredibly basic, and there's no speech feature to sway some voters to your side.The only good parts of this game are that builders are faster, the roads snap, and you get more money faster.Tropico 5 is the slope on the other side of the mountain, the peak being Tropico 4. In fact, the earlier games are better than Tropico 5.TL;DR: Buy 3 and 4 instead.			"

												This one saddens me.For singleplayer gaming, there is no reason whatsoever to play this game, as it's significantly dumbed down from Tropico 4, and the core gameplay and engine are still pretty much unchanged from Haemimont's first, Tropico 3 (beyond the DX11 minimum requirements here).Compared to 'T4', large layers of complexity have been removed, building variety 'simplified', and so on. Where previous titles had fires break out, and a fire station to fight these, this was essentially cut from the game with few exceptions, and fire-fighting is provided by an upgrade to the police station. Where previous titles would give you a convincing degree of control over your economy & housing, here you may merely set a 'budget' slider that affects everything from quality to costs. Gone is the feeling that you can freely choose to give housing to the masses or expensive mansions to the rich -- or to go full-on far-left and build beautiful mansions for the unemployed. Gone too is the notion of having plentiful factions with their own ideals on your island, forcing you to make meaningful choices. The reduced amount of factions among your citizens never make you feel they are actual entities with their own agendas (a feeling prevalent in, say, the first Tropico).It's truly telling that when you first start this game with a game controller connected, it makes you play with console-specific UI / menus / controls.Like in any The Sims title, all the content you're used to from the previous ones' DLCs is again gone, to let you await the opportunity to re-buy similar stuff when it gets released for the current game.Besides some mildly funny pop-culture references, the SP campaign is entirely forgettable and not worth playing.For completionists, each major DLC adds 10 achievements to make it impossible to ""100%"" the game without buying all of the massively overpriced expansions.The multiplayer, a first in the series, is what should make this game worth buying.It is, however, full of bugs, glitches and design issues.That they only added the option to save your game in multiplayer after release should be telling - the mode doesn't feel like it received any playtesting. Very often some form of desync occurs, which for whatever idiotic reasons disables the ability to save completely. If you don't manually save every 5 to 10 minutes, you will soon lose hours of progress to this (auto-saving exists only in SP).The worst thing is that any player even just alt-tabbing from the game in borderless windowed mode, while you watch the game run normally in the background, seems to always cause an initially hidden desync. Soon you won't be able to save and then you find out that everybody has their own version of reality, with buildings complete/incomplete/destroyed, armies stuck in fields unable to move, and so on.Speaking about armies, when playing cooperatively your armies help each other out -- but that always bugs up to get the combined Tropican Defense Force stuck at the place of their last engagement instead of letting them return to their bases, so in the mid to late game, you will have rebels in the south and all the army in the north, unable to get there before your buildings are annihilated... every single time. If you don't team up from the start, there are some diplomatic options, but they don't involve temporarily sending military aid to your friends -- you either accept the inevitable problems or can't help each other.Inexplicably, things like removing roads just don't work properly in MP, and you will likely be stuck with any accidental constructions.Knowing Haemimont and Kalypso, none of this is bound to get fixed -- as an example, they and the equally inept AMD managed to break water rendering in the game with the 'Omega' graphics driver release in late 2014/early 2015, and neither side has managed to do anything to solve this in over half a year.EDIT: The AMD-specific water rendering issue was eventually largely fixed with a game update, but it still depends on the precise AMD driver you're running.I can't say the hours I spent with this game weren't to some degree jolly, but that was largely because it's ""Tropico with multiplayer"". As much as I conceptually enjoy this, I can't hide that the actual game is pretty bad compared to what you would expect (at the price point they charge also are entitled to expect).If you are only interested in MP, you have no other choice. For anybody else, pretend Tropico 5 doesn't exist and play the much better (and much cheaper) predecessor(s) instead.P.S.: The game is a bit better with mods[www.tropicomodding.org].			"

												So, I've seen this game get a lott of guff for not being like Tropico 4. Now, having owned both, I can truthfully say; that's not necessarily a bad thing. Should you get T4? Yes, it's a great game. Should you get T5? Yeah, it's also a great game. Why? Because they're both their own games. You'll find, as a gamer, you'll enjoy things more if you can appreciate what makes them unique instead of looking for new graphics for the same old game. TL;DR: Don't listen to the haters, El Presidente; your people need you. (Especially on sale)This game takes you through Eras, not just a one and done Building Cycle, Governing Factions and Trade fluxuations. I swear, T4 was almost too easy with its Factions setup (at least for me). From foreign powers to local politics each Era has its own flavor of personal dealings, edicts and the like. The game has controller support. Yeah, I like that. I stopped trying to create Powerpoint presentations on my PS4 and likewise stopped trying to play every game on my computer with a mouse and keyboard. It's the little things I appreciate. Like also how the different buildings have their own levels of investment to affect their production levels and managers you can hire to offer little bonuses. The way the farms and mines lay out are much more user friendly in T5 as well. It's almost seamless checking between variant crops and ranches to their respective areas to see what would fit where best. The plantations show an accurate area usage for your consideration when placing them and the overall feel of the building options seems fluid. I personally enjoy the little stamps as the icons, I find that to be fitting to the theme of Tropico. I have no trouble knowing where the different sets of buildings are and their skins (especially as how they partain to the various eras) are vibrant and well drawn.There's a fog of war on this game. Interesting use, you can send expeditions out there to find out what lies beyond. I like it. I like the exploration value instead of taking 5 minutes at the start of a map to see where literally everything is. There's more gaming aspects to this Tropico than there was to the last, more ways to enjoy the game besides finding new ways to make the same winning combination of goods and policies. Basically, if you wanna hate on a game, you can find a reason. Me? I'm El Presidente, I have no time for such plebieans.  Game on, fellow Dictators!			"

												I've only ever played Tropico 4 and 5 but personally I think that 4 is bounds and leaps better. 5 Does add some content but not a lot. The only major difference is the military aspect with is absolutely loathsome and here is why:-You cannot control the units so you have to bunch all your military buildings together on the coasts.-There is no option to turn military or fog off-There is this fog that you have to use your military to explore the island but you have to pay 1000 dollars for every spot you want to explore, and you cannot really direct them either making it really costly just to see the whole island.-If your military isn't bunched up they will get slaughtered because they run up one at a time at the enemy, no matter if its a tank squad facing 2 infantry squads or not... patheticIf you are going to add a military aspect then please just spend a little time to make it a plus and not a negative towards the experience.This is not to mention the fact that they limit ""Modding"" in the steam library to making new maps and missions only. God forbid you have the ability to edit their terribly limited traffic/road system, or just improve the game engine in general.I loved tropico 4 so maybe that plays a part in my being truly dissapointed in this game. Maybe I built up 5 too much in my head. Either way, the replayability of this game is slim to none. It strips the fun of 4 and trys too hard. Maybe it will be fixed with expansions or, even better, free updates. I won't hold my breath on that though.			"

Tropico 5 descends into racialized caricatures of Latin Americans worthy of Family Guy. The gameplay itself is lacklustre at best, with a nonsensical tech system, overly difficult and repetitive mission objectives, this game is just crap. Also, they packed the DLC into the download, which is probably the most underhanded thing publishers do these days. This won't get much more play from me and I definitely won't be buying any DLC.

Review for Tropic 5 PCReview by : Joell JoellyPros :- Lovely art style.- Added Multiplayer.- More eras to play in.Cons :- A barebones single player experience.- Not enough songs.- Glitch prone multiplayer.Review :Tropico 5 is a Strategy/Citybuilder Simulation game where you take the role of El Presidente leading the small banana republic of Tropico. As the dictator you wield absolute authority over your people and the island.With a simple but functional campaign mode and a new added multiplayer mode, Tropico 5 feel like a lot of the same but its a new way...Eras :The first big thing added to Tropico 5 is the eras.The eras allow you to play through multiple time periods, starting in the Colonial Era where you play as a governor for the English Crown, and ending in Modern times, where you have to make Tropico future proof.This idea sounds amazing on paper but doesn't really play out that well.The biggest problem is that eras feel short and become boring rather quickly. I would have rather seen them working with one time period (like in Tropico 4), but giving it a lot of depth and attention.Multiplayer :The second big thing they added in Tropico 5 was multiplayer.You can play with up to 4 friends in Tropico 5's multiplayer. The multiplayer is largely mission based, for example: >Who can earn the most tax money in 5 minutesor >Who can export 5000 canned fish firstCompleting these objectives will give a player a point, and the first to 10 points will be the winner.It's fun for a while but suffers from horrible server slowdowns from time to time, and can feel a bit repetitive.Chances since Tropico 4 :Other than a few minor additions the game feels the same as Tropico 4, although Tropico 4 did a few things better.For example, the Tropico 4 had a better singleplayer campaign.Tropico 4's base game also had more content on release than Tropico 5 has (such as prisons), although they plan on adding additional content to Tropico 5 over coming months.There were also visual improvements to the game, and the UI is nicer to look at.Overall the game offers enough to earn a true sequel status, but Tropico 4 is overall just a better product.I still recommend this game because it's still alot of fun to play.Developer : Haemimont Games Publisher : Kalypso Media Digital	Genre : RPG, Simulatie, StrategieWebsite : http://www.tropico5.comReleased on Steam on : 23th of may 2014Tropico 5 is also on : Xbox360 and Playstation 4Follow my Curator page : http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/ Always do more research than just reading a review, to ensure that you get the right product.[sorry for any grammatical errors]Thanks for reading!

												Just an update: I have been playing Tropico 5 a bit more, and even though my issues with it remain, I have found some things that make the game better. MODS.Google Tropico 5 mods and you will find a lot of useful mods. Be warned however that if the mods mess up your save Kalypso might not be able to help you. I personally recommend Road and Sea Rage to make vehicles and ships move faster and clip through each other reducing traffic congestion.Compared to Tropico 4, Tropico 5 isn't as good, even though it has its strengths.The Positive:- For what it is, it is fun and challenging.- The different eras add a bit of variety, and it also means that you won't be dealing with the USSR in 2025.- The dynasty system is different, and allows you to use it in tendem with the manager system.- Missions involving sending dynasty members away for a while and they come back with a perk and some experience- Actual use for your Swiss Bank account, adding the ability to upgrade your dynasty member's abilities.- Managers that add a perk to a building, examples include increasing the beauty of an area or increasing production.- The constitution and edicts have been added and overhauled and I think for the better. The constitution especially allows you to customise what kind of government you are, adding more personality to your island. The edicts also unlock every era which means you have plenty to think about as time passes.- Researching is now a thing in Tropico 5, unlocking manager slots, building upgrades and more buildings. Penultimo also says something funny in relation to the topic when you fully research it.- The humour. Penultimo is the best sidekick a dictator could ever ask for (said no one ever)However, there are several mixed and negatives.Mixed:- The shipping system is a change, but after a while becomes comes off a bit weak compared to Tropico 4. The import and export contracts are a nice addition, but overall you'll be overburdened with trade deals and the inability to make the transactions you need because you ran out of ships. I am fully aware that you can remove ships from a route, but it isn't good for the long term.CORRECTION: I thought that if you add ships to a route you won't be able to export everything else. Turns out freighters and trade ships are different. I still don't feel like the shipping system is better in Tropico 5 than 4 though, so it stays as a neutral.- Faction and foreign relations decay over time. It sounds like a fun challenge to some people but I personally dislike it, it means juggling between factions that will eventually hate you no matter what you do.And now the negative:- Elections are worse than in Tropico 4. Although you can appoint a dynasty member as a new candidate, allowing for several presidentes, there is NO feedback whatsoever of why you are losing. Also, you cannot give speeches. Which means you cannot legally swing votes in your favour more easily.- The modern era is basically the same as the Cold War but with China, the EU and the Middle East added alongside the US and Russia. Which makes it like Tropico 4 Modern Times. Which I can get for cheaper with all the DLC.- I haven't gotten any of the DLC except the Big Cheese (pre order bonus) but if it's like the ones in Tropico 4 (one costume, one building, one mission) AVOID THEM. Unless they add another cement factory.Edit: Looked at all the DLC... yep, all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, except for the expansions that I have no interest in. So yeah not recommended just by glancing.- Penultimo's voice. I just don't like it compared to Tropico 4. Bit of a nitpick but yeah.- And this one sounds even pettier, the lack of a god mode. In Tropico 4 I have two sandboxes. One with God Mode so I don't have to care about stuff and just build, and another with normal gameplay. (and a third one which is normal but with a lot of cheating).- The multiplayer is forgettable.- Traffic congestion is still AWFUL. However with the aforementioned Road Rage mod it'll be solved.- People still live in shacks even if you have a lot of housing with no feedback as to why. Apparently they refuse to move out even if you've fixed it.- Again, no real feedback.- The budgeting is awful. No real way to see why people aren't taking the houses here or taking jobs. Budgeting also decreases the service quality of houses but makes it cheaper for Tropicans which does ♥♥♥♥ ALL.It is a good game, and I would really recommend it if it hadn't been for one thing: the fact that Tropico 4 exists and is so much better than Tropico 5. I'll give Haemimont credit here; they innovated a lot more than they did with Tropico 4 so it wasn't just a more stable reskin. However the additions are just not as good of that as 4, which may not have innovated as much but they added a lot of stuff (behind a paywall, sure) that made it a very good game. It's because of this I'm mixed on Tropico 5. It's a lot of fun, however it's just not as good as it's older brother. On it's own, yeah sure, get it. If you want a cheaper Tropico game go for 4. You'll be less disappointed.			"

												Are you currently mourning the death of El Comandante? If so, Tropico 5 is definitely the game for you to live out your fantasy as a ""revolutionary figure""!Overthrow the imperialists, crush the dissidents, embrace Marxism, and go on to become Tropico's ""longest-serving president"".You never know, in a few decades’ time - you too may be remembered as a ""remarkable leader"", ""social justice champion"", and a ""symbol of the struggle for justice"".

												This game is pretty close to being good but it falls down in 2 major areas. The tutorial for the game is terrible.  It spends more time talking about basic building mechanics than explaining how any of the metrics of citizen happiness and values work.   It basically just mentions that they exist and that they affect your popularity with the citizens. It doesn't explain how far the numerous ""nearby"" bonuses extend, It doesn't explain how to get useful information from the statistic tracking almanac.  Most of what I know of the mechanics of the game I got from reading guides.The other main issue is that the citizen AI makes almost no sense whatsoever in its decision making. My current island has 100s of homeless and jobless people despite there being more than enough houses and jobs for everyone.  I have homeless people who work in the nuclear power plant and jobless people who live, also homeless, next to open entry level jobs.  I have open college and high school level jobs and virtually nobody in either school.  I have dozens of farms and several food imports but citizens starving regularily.   I have quadrupled the number of couriers in the city but I still dont have materials and goods moving anywhere. These issues and the happiness meters they reflect upon are so nonsensicle that I am convinced they have a randomized element to them.I have heard that these issues are almost entirely fixed in one of the DLCs but that's arguably even worse because it means that they are effectively holding the functional game hostage for another $5.Avoid this game			"

												Pretty game. Still has some of the charm of old Tropicos and makes some improvements, as one would hope. The continuous islands, while a bit repetitive, are nice because the game builds on itself and you don't feel like you lose everything with every new level.Buuuut since you can't unlock certain buildings until different eras in the game, people are just dying and unhappy and there's virtually nothing you can do about it. So you're trying to go about your business and build an economy while tredging through uprising after coup every (no exageration) 3-5 minutes. Really takes away from the experience. And they have changed the employment and payment systems so you have less control than ever over those aspects, which adds to people's eager hatred and takes away from the management feel.I wanted to like this game. It still has some promise, but overall, disappointed. I got it on sale... I would recommend doing the same if you still want to pick it up.			"

												I'm recommending this game for one reason: MultiplayerTropico 5 nailed the multiplayer aspect.Being able to play alongside my friends is the reason I love this game.It's the best multiplayer city building game out there. I have not come across any other like this.Tropico 5 lets you build next to players or with them. Cooperative or Competive, whichever you prefer.SimCity can hardly compete since you don't build together, you build in seperate regions. Cities: Skylines is the best city building game on the market hands down, but no multiplayer.During a multiplayer game you can share money, roads, utilities and military forces.It's very satisfying to share the love of these games alongside people who also love it.There are a lot of hilarious moments, especially if you're playing with friends.The rebels have basically become a meme among my friends because they're idiotic and easy to joke about.The only downside is being forced to send backup when a friend is attacked. If you get attacked while your troops are in a friend's city, all you can do is pray. Also, mandate is bs. The game could give all the mandate to one player but not the other.Don't even get me started on roads. Roads suck. They're horrible.The multiplayer is great and I hope it sets the foundation for future games.The dream would be this multiplayer on Tropico 4, Cities: Skylines or SimCity.I personally feel like it still capted the same feel as Tropico 4, except it was watered down and made much more difficult.You will never truly defeat the rebels or please everyone, this game is best played as a warmongering oppressive dictatorship. It will give you the most satisfaction since your prize is blood and trust me, there's plenty so you might as well enjoy it.TLDR: Multiplayer mechanics are great, game is a downgrade, still enjoyable.Advice: Spam sugar plantations and rum distillaries.

												The game looks like its predecessor's poorer cousin. There is less of everything - including building models, music or customization options - compared even to Tropico 4 without any expansions and DLCs. Quality of the existing content also seems actually worse than in the previous installation.As for the gameplay, it seems more shallow. I'm not sure how happiness translates into popular support, because even with my Tropicans being pretty unhappy I never had problems with winning elections without fixing votes. You can rake serious debt without any repercussions and, with the amount of resources on the average island, it's easy to make obscene amounts of money without trying too much.The new features are underwhelming. The consecutive eras don't change much except building models and the amount of available buildings and technologies. The only exception is the Colonial Era - you advance by converting people from Royalist to Independence faction. This sounds like fun but actually isn't - most of the buildings, edicts and other game features are locked, so you pretty much build the same thing several times and pray that the game lets you pass to its more interesting part before the time limit expires.The family system also disappoints. From time to time, you get an another inhabitant of the island who happens to have the same last name as El Presidente. They can be sent to manage a building and may be useful during some events - and that's pretty much it. You can also let them run in elections instead of you, but you usually don't want to do that - most likely, your current president is more experienced anyway.To sum it all up - Tropico 4 is simply better than its supposed successor.

												The main storyline mission is short. There's the signature silly Tropico feel – but it falls flat before anything really happens with it. There's still the typos and bugs from 4 that should've been taken care of. The DLC is insulting – overpriced installments for a stupid hat, an uninteresting map with buggy mission and a new building. The game is... prettier than previous installments? It has that going for it. The Swiss bank account is an interesting mechanic now. The Manager system is a nice touch. Go with Tropico 4.			"

 Fun, but overpriced	I'd be lying if I say I do not enjoy this game.  I'm kinda person who loves things grows and making money :), so I'd still recommend the game.Tropico 5 is not the best of the series though... I'd say T4 is the best.  Being the latest of the series, it removed the fun for traffic (garage) management, and I lost the sense of how people would pick their homes/houses.  Its leaning toward simplistic radius based building effect (you would know what I mean if you are a city building veteran).The good thing it deliver, is on the politics, I did interact more on politics and foreign policy than I had before in other series (T3 & T4).  You could easily dethroned from your presidential seat if you are not careful.  The tech and age concept is sometime feel limiting, but it is as well as creates a sense of growing in the big picture.Graphic wise, it is more or less at par with T4.  and about the price - It just not worth the full price tag.  Grab it when it is on sale, I got all DLCs (while on sale) and finished all of them so I write this review.  You get very small value of those smaller DLC, and some additional value for the bigger one, but none of them deserved their full price tags.  The feel about the DLC is that it did made the game easier to pass - I completed the original campaign without DLC and it just not a simple cake walk... but after I got all of them, you can actually feel they simplify the game quite considerably. Haven't tried multiplayer, I did checked a while, it is not that many open games, but seems enough small group of people playing.Go enjoy this game, as I did enjoy! "

												If you’ve never played a Tropico game, you may not realize the difference between this series and any other simulation game. You might not realize all the political parody that defines Tropico. If you follow along with campaign narration and read the additional commentary tucked into the corners of the game, you will no doubt laugh at the subtle — and not so subtle — jabs at things like communism, capitalism, certain famous figures in history, and cultures that might be found in such a fictional place as Tropico. In Tropico 5, it only gets better as you, El Presidente, bring your island up from Colonial times, wedged between other superpowers, through all the familiar eras of our planet’s history. The fun of this game comes from experimenting with the exact ways you can choose to run your little country. Seeing what you can get away with, or seeing just how happy and loyal you can make your citizens, is the real appeal of this game. Yes, you have to research new technology, make money with farming or mining etc., and construct housing for your citizens, but every one of those choices has its own weight on political aspects. You can construct churches to increase quality of housing in the area, but if you are an atheist country by your constitution, this may lower your approval rating. If your approval rating gets too low, you may not win the next election (if you have those), or a rebellion may threaten to overthrow your rule. One thing you can do to help your situation is create a dynasty. Each ruler, the first being customized by you at the beginning of the game, has a special trait. Eventually, the game prompts you to find a new heir (by ridiculous means like a singing competition or thumb-wrestling match), and that new person will be selectable as a candidate for any election. Also, if you upset one of them too much by not siding with them on other trivial matters, they can rebel and try to overthrow you. You can also send them off to do special tasks like spy on an enemy faction or get a fancy degree to add merit to your regime. This is a really unique gameplay mechanic that I have not seen before, and your dynasty even carries over to multiplayer and sandbox modes. The game feels more robust with such a lasting element that can possibly produce much varying gameplay.Another sneaky, new mechanic is your personal Swiss bank account. This is represented by two dollar signs in front of any amount that concerns your personal account. This is where you can really become a corrupt leader and laugh all the while. The purpose of this account is to get you out of tight spots in the campaign, or to level up your dynasty members. If you are lucky enough to discover a manager that siphons off a percentage of a building’s revenue to put into your account, saving up becomes easy. Combat is in Tropico 5, but to be honest it probably shouldn't be, at least not in this form. While almost everything else in the game feels smooth and refined, the battles are fiddly and tedious. When you're attacked, whether by a traitorous squad of rebels or by foreign powers, you'll see tiny squads pop up on the map. They'll head off to destroy your key structures, and whatever defences you possess, militia squads or your personal guard, will automatically rush over to ineffectually swat at them, often before waiting for backup. Pretty much all you can do at that point is sit back and wait to mop up the pieces. It's not too much of a problem honestly, because larger combats generally only happen when you've lost control of the situation completely anyway. The smaller skirmishes, like the occasional uprising that happens if you irritate one of the game's factions too much, thankfully don't last too long. Combat is the game's most obvious weakness, but it doesn't soil the rest of Tropico 5.The characters of Tropico are drawn in broad strokes, but the canvas they’re drawn on is broader. Everyone and everything is a caricature: your underling, Penultimo, is a dimwitted, unceasing bootlicker; capitalists and opportunists within your staff seethe with delight as they suggest profiting off other nations’ needs, while communist revolutionaries are naively passionate about their cause despite not knowing exactly what they’re fighting for. Entire political institutions are mocked; early in the single-player campaign, a Marxist reveals that the Russians are exporting the Communist Revolution as a buyable service.I won’t bother going through how the basics of a city builder work, as I think you understand most of it if you live in any civilization in real life. But I will say that they scope of Tropico 5, with the added intricacies of politics, makes this game much more fun and in-depth. That’s something other city sims don’t have. The parody in particular is especially entertaining. Once you progress out of the colonial era, you get to hear the perky ramblings of a girl who manages a tavern called the Jolly Rodger, which I think is supposed to represent pirate radio and a public truth-teller you cannot control. She has something to say about almost every new milestone, and she makes sure to embarrass El Presidente any chance she gets, like when you hire surveillance to warn you of any new rebel leaders. The voice acting is top-notch, mainly because it’s so spirited and spot-on for whatever person is being parodied. I appreciate that in a city sim. After all, why build up a regular ol’ society when you could be building one that makes fun of things that have happened in our actual history? Unlike previous games in the series, Tropico 5 includes multiplayer modes - and while these function just fine, they feel like they're missing something. Up to four players can compete or cooperate in pursuing a number of objectives, and the fact that everyone shares the same island elevates the pressure in some interesting ways. If there’s an oil deposit between two dictators, the first person to build a road to that resource can claim it and expand their territory at the same time. In a cooperative scenario, roads become friendly lifelines that players use to share teamsters or construction workers. The lack of an omnipresent scoreboard forces players to visually observe each other’s progress, but it also leaves them data-starved. Regardless of the mode or objective, players still need to tend to all of the responsibilities of a single-player game, which pile up fast. The lack of chrono controls, while inevitable, muddles the series’ traditionally relaxed atmosphere, and most players will eventually turn back to single player in order get the true Tropico experience. Visually, this game is stunning. On high specs it looks beautiful and the effects like wind and waves are really nice. A lot of detail is gone into the look of the game. Which is probably why the developers have opted for a hollow grid look for the best areas to place buildings as opposed to the filled in grid that came before. I really didn’t like this, it makes it far more difficult to read the lay of the land. This is about the only thing in the game I really didn’t like. Fives games in and the Tropico series has really found its feet, creating a cheery and relaxing ambience that sets it quite apart from other city-builders out there. From the music to the bright and colourful graphics and the irreverent wit of your various staff, it’s got a very unique character that makes the simple gameplay very addictive. Okay, so it holds your hand a little too much, and combat is a bit dull, but it’s certainly the high point of the series so far. A very good city management and political strategy game that’s got a relaxed attitude quite unlike anything else out there.			"

												Tropico 5 is NOT Tropico 4, that must be made clear. Tropico 4 was pretty much a beefed up Tropico 3 after all.While I miss some aspects of Tropico 4 (apartment designs, some edicts, etc.), Tropico 5 is a truly great game in its own right.I never did much of ANYTHING with the trading interface in T3 and T4, and while some lament the 'over simplified' and 'dumbed down' new trade interface, I love it. I am actually using it now and I know exactly what I'dm doing. What they made easy in trading, they made more complicated in everything else. Getting 100% happiness in a T4 sandbox was ridiculously easy. Even with $100k in a T5 sandbox, save games will be your friend. ESPECIALLY in the campaigns.Factions are not the end all they used to be. While the people are easy to please, faction approval (and by extension the approval of their members) is not so easy. Happiness doesn't win elections. Approval does. Thus, you can be easily voted out if the largest faction doesn't like you for what ever reason. USE EVERY MINI-CHALLENGE YOU CAN TO PLEASE THE FACTIONS! Your life will be made significantly easier. Communists were easily appeased in T4 with food, housing and medical care. Now they don't give two hoots.A huge amount of new features have been added, and I love them. From edicts to buildings to other mechanics. The added variety of army units is very welcome. Building managers make no sense to me though, since appointing them for each and every individual building is a micro-managing nightmare.As a new edition of the Tropico series, I heartily approve. It is different, and a welcome challenge with many hours of gameplay fun (and frustration as you become accustomed to it). The game has that typical Tropico satire, parody and humour....and it is hilarious beyond what I thought T4 ever was.			"

												I really love Tropico games and would not doubt if the entire team is tripping on LSD as they code it. The graphics are solid this time around. They have a much more polished feel over the others. The musics always solid and you can import your own into the game without much effort. With that being said I'll go into a few negatives. With this one you really do want all of the DLC as too much was withheld from the base game. Once you have everything it's a beauty.This time around you can't zoom out as far as previous versions. There is a script available to undo this but it doesn't work in multiplayer. So now they have multiplayer but it desyncs often which ruins the match. It's definitely playable but there aren't many people online. It helps to know someone with the game if you want all of the achievements because several are tied to multiplayer. I've been trying for a long time to get the final 3 I have left. At least they have it which is a step in the right direction. Then they removed some of El Presidente's previous features. Now you can't follow him around or engage in a shootout. Instead it's all about dynasty members which would be fine... if they let me follow them around, give my speeches, and shoot up the enemy. They must undo this in the next one as it removes part of the charm. I'll also argue that they made it way too difficult to be a ruthless dictator. You'll make money hand over fist being a swell guy, but if you so much as look in the other direction you're going to have a military mutiny. It doesn't matter how well prepared you are for your own troops toppling you. Sure, you deserved it but I invite you to try running a North Korean style of government on this game. You might even find yourself in awe of what that dictatorship has accomplished. It probably is more realistic in that regard but it's also almost impossible since most of the features that could make it a reality aren't available until much later in the game. There is so much to this game that I am overwhelmed by attempting to describe the positives. Teamsters and construction workers are no longer an achilles heal. The army doesn't wander off during a crucial battle. Traffic jams are no longer an issue whatsoever. Parking garages and metros have been nerfed to the point that there doesn't seem to be a penalty for not having them at all. I'd argue that they went too far but micro managing roads was annoying. The military additions, the espionage, industries, trade, and so on are all well done. You have people flying rocket powered gliders all over the place, blimps, airlines, and so on. It's no longer just micro managing a banana republic and more like you're running a western power. I'm really interested to see what they will do with Tropico 6. I hope they add more wildlife as they removed a bit too much this time, give us back control over El Presidente, and work on the different forms of government. If they do those simple things I'll be happy.I will place the script to edit music into the game as well as the camera zoom into the comments section.			"

												As a longtime fan of the Tropico series I had good expectations for this game. Sadly they turned this game into a cash cow. They have LESS buildings than the predecessor Tropico 4. Also some of the main buildings that i enjoyed building are now locked out in Tropico 5 FORCING you to purchase the DLC for even the basics. All in all a huge let down and i doubt that I will purchase any future Tropico games after the let down of a cash cow presented.			"

												Man I love all the Tropico games, and I mean ALL.  This one however really irritated me.  You pay for mistakes in future levels you didn't know you were making in early levels.  There is no way to plan around it.  I simply won't start over to try and fix it and I shouldn't have to.			"

												The game is... solid, but ut quickly loses replay value and challenge. The jokes get tiring as there is almost no variability in the oneliners. I pretty much played through the campaign tried a random map and frankly got bored of the little ants. Hey I even got more playtime out of simple little Banished just because it offered more of a realistic challenge. Food is your issue not some military or diplomatic mess.I was frankly disappointed that a one man studio made a better, more engaging game.			"

												Tropico 5 is a okay game. Tropico 4 is much better in my opinion though.The following concerns the game at medium difficulty settings.The campaignThe campaign includes only 4 different islands. You start with two that you can (or need to) switch after each mission. Constructed buildings will persist between missions on each island. Thus you only really need to build a good economy once and you are done for all remaining missions. The campaign is also rather short.Game mechanics- General buildings: Several buildings grant additional advantages if they are build on higher terrain. However, 3 of the 4 campaign islands are completely flat.- Housing: Compared to the previous Tropicos, the housing system has been improved. Even small buildings make sense now.- Industry: Tropico 5 allows you to build larger industry production lines. You can start with a logging camp, then add a saw mill to generate planks and then use these planks to build furniture. That's quite a nice feature.- Population: You can change a policy (~ every 5 years) that controls the number if immigrants. However, I never noticed any big difference between the options regarding the number of people arriving on my island. With open borders I got about 20 immigrants per ship. This leads to a problem, because you really need a lot of people on the island. The only other option is to increase the number of births by building clinics and hospital (up to 50% increase in births). But that's still not enough and I constantly ran out of workers (~200 workers missing in a population of 1400 people). This wouldn't be so bad if you didn't need to build lots of healthcare, religous and entertainment buildings to keep your population happy.- Unrest: The unrest system appears to be out of control. For example, even if the military faction loves you, they just might start a coup to get rid of you. Also, I haven't found any reliable way to get rid of rebels (However, they only became annoying in 2-3 missions, thus it might be due to scripting).- Military: The military mechanics are just horrible. Certain buildings are marked as targets once rebells or other forces attack. All your armys will then start moving towards these targets, ignoring any enemy forces that they may encounter on their way. The enemy will shoot at you though! This often leads to several causalties before your army even starts fighting back.There is also an option to build an aircraft carrier that does not work at all, because the aircrafts won't fire if the enemy is close to buildings, which is usually the case. However, you can set it on ""fire at will"", which will make them shoot and set your buildings on fire. That would be perfectly okay, if the rockets would actually damage enemies that are moving, but it appears that they mostly do damage on stationary enemies.Tropico 4 gave you more control over the movement of your armies, which made it much better in this respect.- Dealing with criminals, rebels, etc.: Similar to the previous tropico you can banish, arrest or kill people that you don't like. Or... well, you can at least issue the order to arrest them. Apparently the police doesn't really care about it. It takes years for them to take them to the prison.All in all it's an okay game, but I wouldn't buy it again. Get Tropico 4 instead of Tropico 5.			"

												Played 3, 4 and 5. Sad to say this is a step backwards. You lose control of your president, the UI is more complex and clunky than the older games, and the wages/rent sliders have been amalamated into a hideous 'building budget' system. Basically, it feels like Kalypso have almost tried to dumb some aspects of the game down whislt making other parts horribly over complicated. On the plus side, the graphics are great but this doesn't make up for the tedious gameplay.			"

												I am a huge fan of the Tropico series but I unfortunatly cannot recommend this game. Also I should add I have logged about 70+ hours in this game at the time of writing this review even though my account says like 90 mins or something, I played most of it in offline mode. Compared to Tropico 4 (which imo is the best Tropico in the series) this game just feels unfinished even with all the DLC. There was so much stripped from the game that I sometimes found myself spending time looking for something that was no longer present even though they were important features in previous games.My main problem with 5 compared to 4 is that you have less control over your island and its inhabitants.Here a few of my Likes and Dislikes Likes-Era and Research system was a good idea (poorly exectuted though)-Dynasty members was a nice idea and looking forward to a return in futrue Tropicos hopefully-Trade system was also a welcomed feature-Online mode is a great feature but not enough people use it, (good for with friends though)-New mining system-New farm system-Really liked the new combat system-Manager system was a good idea-Buildings look amazing (Best so far)Dislikes-New Almanac is just bad, lacks so much useful information (bring back the old one!!!)-Lack of the Rise to Power, Background etc options when setting up a new sandbox game-Where did all the trait options go?-Labour camp removed (easily on of my favourite buildings, I would have bet money on it making a return in 5. Sadly not though)-Lack of housing options-Shockingly small amount of decorations compared to Tropico 4-Grade school removed-New budget system which replaces the ability to set the wages and upkeep of the building individually.-Building options gone. (cants set schools to Military Education, newspapers to Word of God etc.) This was a huge disappointment for me.-Not enough Tourism and Entertainment buildings-Number of tourists allowed on the island capped-Lack of variety in tasks, after a few playthroughs they become too familiar-New Faction system is terribile (where did the loyalists go?)-Advisors and Faction Reps Removed. Only Penultimo and Oaksworth advise and offer tasks now.-Zoom levels reduced-Criminals replaced with crime lords that justt appear on your island-Election Speech removed (????)-Rebel yell, Immigrants out etc starting options removedI could list a few more but you get the idea. I will end this review saying that if you are thinking of buying this game. Don't do it and buy Tropico 4 instead.			"

												As someone who played Tropico 4, I was actually a bit disappointed with this. It has some features that are better than Tropico 4, and some that Tropico 4 doesn't have. However, it is also missing much of the stuff Troico 4 had. I'll do a little list:What Tropico 5 is missing that was in Tropico 4:1. Placeable statues of the Player Character2. Stupidly large golden statues of the player character3. Character customisation (to the extent it was present in Tropico 4)4. The ability to be a brutal Dictator, and stay in power5. Decent Political system6. The ability to sdjust wages, and rents on residences, in the same way as was possible in Tropico 4 (Only the simplified budget mechanic is there)7. The ability to play as famous figures from the period8. The ability to actually choose you characters name9. Cool DLC (As opposed to crappy cash grab DLC)10. Good Music (In my opinion the music in this is worse than in Tropico 4)11. A wide selection of buildings (there is a similar number of buildings, despite the fact that Tropico 4 takes place over 50 years and Tropico 5 over around 100)What Tropico 5 has over Tropico 41. Multiplayer2. Tanks, Military Aircraft and APC's (Although you need DLC to get APC's despite the fact they can be seen driving around in the main menu on the base game. This is what I mean about cash grab DLCs)3. Ability to control soldiers (Although they are discustingly clunky to control)4. A grid system for ease of placing buildings5. Random Map Generator6. Reasearch7. Different Era'sBasically, buy Tropico 4 unless you want to play with friends, I think it's better and so do so many others.			"

												I've been fan of the Tropico series since Tropico the first back in the days, so I started playing T5 with great expectation, specially when T4 was SO GOOD. Unfortunately most of what made Tropico fun is not there, the quirky characters, the smart and funny dialogues, the voice acting (seriously the actors are doing a terrible job on this one), even the music, everything falls flat this time. It's not a bad game, it is a complex economics and politics simulation but much of what made the series chaming and fun is gone. There's been some subtle change in the UI and it does not feel as smooth as the previous titles.At this point in the series Tropico has peaked at Tropico 4 so if you are interested by the concept of the game - a banana republic simulator full of humor- I recommend you get T4 instead.

												This game has been given way more hype than it deserves. It is currently as buggy as all hell, not to mention dodgy overlaying graphics. The multiplayer is currently completely unfunctional with reliable crashing as soon as someone leaves the colonial era. Having come into the tropico series without knowing anything about them, I find this game a complete waste of money. It's clearly been rushed and hoops avoided to release it on the deadline. Kalypso servers are not able to withstand the release overloads which is pathetic. We all know that when a game first comes out with a fresh multiplayer idea that nearly all purchasers are going to want to try it out, but kalypso managed to completely oversee this meaning they had to completely shut down the servers to reboot them, and then put a limit on the number of connections because they didn't dedicate enough space. The single player is equally dissapointing with game difficulty options making no affect on the play at all, unrefined graphics at higher resolutions, and all round choppy edges that destroy what could have, but never will be, game of the year.

												I wanted to like this game. I spent a great deal of time searching for a game just like this one, read reviews, and finally decided that it was the one I wanted. Dropped $50 for the whole collection, and I will likely not play it again after the 150 or so hours I dropped into it.GoodIt is world-building, political gameplay that I was searching for in a sense. Much of the game allows you to control all of the little details that make the world your creating exactly what you want--for a while. The various constitution options were interesting, and it was one of the options that I found to be the most exciting, being able to control the type of people who come onto your island, controlling the state of the government, and setting up the professionalism of your military are all excellent options that I think really contribute to the overall feel of the game.BadExecution of the above failed. The politics are largely one-way. You pick a side and can't really play the middle in any meaningful way if you want to complete a mission. In major-global conflicts, there is a political out if you are skilled enough. Not an option.The game provides a limited and hilariously unsatisfactory tutorial that fails to explain most of the important aspects of the game that determine approval rating, military tactics, and government effects of a number of aspects. Moreover, most of the constitution is written to be funny rather than informative (along with quests, objectives, and so on), meaning that it is impossible to tell the exact effect most actions or changes will have until it is too late. And I say too late, because you can only alter the constitution once every five years. At one point, I altered mine and my approval rating dropped nearly 30% rapidly.In regard to approval, it is almost a meaningless measure. Having an approval rating of 90+ is pretty safe, but as soon as you drop to 80 or so (keep in mind that U.S. Presidents largely have approval ratings of ~50%), rebellions happen constantly unless you are eliminating rebels (which is expensive). The further it falls, the more impossible it becomes to return the approval to the higher rating, largely because the constant threats result in rebellions, resulting in destroyed property, resulting in lacking the funds to rebuild the buildings that increase approval or eliminate the rebels that destroy them.The military aspect of the game is useless. You can build a powerful military, but it ignores half of the threats that you come into contact with throughout the game. I lost several games because I had military units who refused to defend the palace. In other cases, the military units associate the battle with a specific location, that may not actually be associated with the battle, resulting in buildings (like guard towers) which get destroyed because your military is off defending a building and refuse to march to the actual location of the fight.All and all, the game was goo for a couple of yucks, but ultimately is so frustrating to play, do to a lack of sufficient information from the game designer and buggy units that I cannot recommend it.

												Tropico - The original dictator simulator. Now in its fifth iteration, has enough changed to justify another purchase, after facing criticism of a lack of real progress between numbers 3 and 4? Well, yes and no.I'd like to get this out of the way right now: Tropico 5 is a great game. In fact it's probably the second most fun, humourous and complete title in the series, and having played it through on the Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC, I can say without hesitation this is the version to have, right here on Steam.Gameplay hasn't really changed much from the last title, but some alterations have been made which both enhance and detract from the experience. First of all, international trading is much more involved and satisfying. Instead of going into your almanac and simply checking off things you'd like to import and export, you click on your shipping dock and work to the supply and demand of each nation. You can assign more than one ship to a trade route, so if for example you're trying to get a nuclear power plant up and running early and China have a good price on uranium, you can stick three ships on that route to bring it in as quickly as possible. You'll also find limited time export deals, so you can send your excess stockpile of coal or canned goods to a country which will pay double the going rate for a contracted time of three years. Again, just an example.Another big feature, especially when playing on randomised islands, is the RTS style 'fog of war'. In Tropico 5, you have to send out your palace soldiers to scout the land, uncovering the fog to reveal the landscape. You can see where mines and different are through the fog, but the types of mineral they hold will only be revealed by clearing the fog. You can't build in fogged territory either, so it's a balancing act between uncovering land to build, or making a bee line for the nearest mine to get your production up and running. Like any real time game, this is only really important during the opening stages, but if - like me - you're constantly in the red for the first year or so, paying $1000 per time to reroute your scouting party can prove a costly excercise.A further decent addition is that of having a proper family dynasty. El Presidente will have children, and you can form a dynasty of up to five members. Each of these dynasty members has their own traits which affect the overall balance of the game, and you can select which one to play as before every mission, allowing you to preempt the needs of the people during that mission.Also, you now unlock research, Civilization style, which allows you to gradually uncover more edicts to write and more buildings to construct. Edicts are plentiful and have a huge impact of gameplay, allowing you to do everything from banning tobacco to providing social security for your pensioners. Of course there are fascist ones as well, such as putting the entire island under military control or completely banning emigration.When you first start a new island, you'll be running it under the command of the British Empire as a colony,and you have a limited number of months to achieve your goals and gain total independence. When this happens, you get to decide what kind of leader you'll be by signing a US style Constitution, setting out the terms of your leadership and controlling everything from who's allowed to vote, to how the media is run. If you decide to run your island as a democracy, you'll find yourself at the mercy of the voting factions every year, and as before you can make promises to sway the voters before each election. You can only ammend the constitution every four years though, so be very careful what you put in place!Some of the micromanagement has been pared back, and to be honest it's not always for the better. The individual needs of your people are far less important than the groups as a whole. So, it doesn't really matter any more if a part of your community is outside the radius of a church or hospital - as long as the different factions on your island approve of you as a whole, you're not going to lose an election. Also, your happiness and approval rate are now separate stats, so again, as long as you are ok in the big picture you'll be fine. Direct control of your avatar has also been removed, so you can no longer visit your building sites and establishments to crack the whip.Another simplified idea, which sounds good on paper, is the alteration of the island structure during the main campaign. Previously, you would manage a different island from scratch for every mission, allowing you to push yourself to meet the goals of that mission before moving on and starting afresh. Now, you have just two islands which you go back and forth between, with the idea being you play missions 1,3,5 etc on island one, and missions 2,4,6 etc on island 2. The mission goals change just as in previous titles, but your island is preserved as you left it. Again, it sounds like a good idea, as you have to think ahead about taking care of your people long term. But that's why it absolutely doesn't work: You have no idea what's coming next. Suddenly, you're out of space and you've built a carefully constructed military defence, only to have to tear it all down to meet the goals of the next task. The mission goals aren't structured to take advantage of the long term island system, so they may as well have left you island hopping as before. Half way through the campaign, you do get two fresh islands to start with, and it's a huge relief, but the same thing happens for the latter half of the game, moving between the two.It's a good job then that the actual gameplay is still as robust as it ever was: Building and hiring workers is identical to previous releases, with a radial menu equally suited to mouse or controller. Yes, a city management game which arguably feels as at home using an Xbox controller as it does using a mouse, and it works straight out of the box, with the appropriate button commands displayed on the screens. The game still looks great, with fantastic detail on the buildings, allowing you to zoom right in and see the curtains in house windows, apartments with laundry hanging on the lines strung from wall to wall, and the gradual build up of goods in farms and factories waiting to be taken by your teamsters so the nearest dock. Individual garages have been removed, and people can now take their cars straight from any building with a garage to any other, and they've added a metro system, which you can place anywhere as a station entrance, essentially allowing pedestrians to teleport from any one to any other.The disasters, complete with Penultimo's warnings, are back and are as destructive as ever. They have changed the voice actor for Penultimo, but when you get used to it he's just as funny and just as stupid as before. The great Latin soundtrack is back, and is as fitting and brilliant as ever.Largely, the pros outweigh the cons in Tropico 5. Whilst I still consider 4 to be the peak of the series thus far, there's enough new, funny and outlandish content here to justify diving back in. With the whole collection being available for a good price, including extra missions and two extra campaigns full of new buildings and concepts, if you're a fan of the series you'll love it. If you're a city builder fanatic and have never played Tropico before, this is the perfect spot to jump right on in, but seriously consider picking up the marginally superior previous title as well.

												Worse in pretty much every way to Tropico 4 other than slightly improved graphics.Get Tropico 4 instead.The console rot has finally infested this series.I literally do not get how you can make the UI worse.- It's less user friendly ingame (bulky and no favourites).- You're forced to cycle through options instead of having dropdowns (terrible in char creation).- Stripped out the decent sandbox creation features.- No difficulty rating.- No descriptive tooltips on settings, so I am sat here wondering how temperature will effect the experience.- Have to pay 1000 dollars to ""explore"" the fog of war with your miltary, whom sometimes dont even reach their destination, so exploring the entire island costs a fortune.- Game is too easy, you have no problem with cashflow.- Mines are now placed snugly into ugly horseshoe-shaped rocks.- Trading is shallow and removes the challenge of limited resources.- Military is a badly designed uncontrollable mess.- DLC doesn't add enough to be worth it either.- The largest maps just aren't very big!It just feels like several half arsed elements of a game slapped together for consoles.The devs really need to sit down and fix this shambles by returning to their roots of the original Tropico and some good elements of T2 and T4, and then looking at other games that do certain elements right:Building, simulation, zoning, districts etc: Cities SkylinesConcise ship combat and trading: Anno 1404Land combat and deforestation: Aoe2Uninstalled, back to T4.

												This freaking game infuriates me so much!I bought it half a year ago, was sceptical at first as I saw the following in my first game: A whole family or rulers now? Great! ... wait that's the new Alamanac? Where this?. .. not here ... and where's that? not here either. Alot of graphs and stats that were useful in the past are completely gone and extremely dumbed down to the point of not getting any information out of it.And this trend of pro-cons continued. I find a new feature I like and at the same time am disappointed of not having a feature I'm very used to. Which comes especially appearent during fighting. T5 has ALOT more rebel invasions than T3 and T4, but as your avatar can't fight anymore and Rebels tend to be more agile at scattering and taking down your building than your soldiers are at keeping up and killing them, you usually lose every other fight. Possibly to the point of where you can't afford to rebuild those buildings and your economy breaking down after a few years of subsequent attacks.Anything you can do against this at this point? No - that's exactly the problem. Anything you could do costs ridiculous amounts of money (no problem in modern times usually, but if you advance through timelines you just don't have those 2000$ for each Rebel to execute them (if that's what you want).And at this point I severely miss features from previous games, especially propaganda mechanisms like from the News Paper, School System, possibly the Inquisition if need be (which you can have in this game for $$).so...many months pass and I forget my anger about this game. I remember fondly T3 and want to play some Tropico again. Install T5, can't remember why I didn't play this game more. Fast forward just one several hour lasting game session and my frustration reached unimaginable heights. Frustrated not because the game doesn't work the way I want it to, but because I tried and tried to like it. And there are many things I like in this game, features that I would dearly like to see in Tropico3. But this game here ... damn I wish I could return this trash.			"

												In Tropico Game Play You!It's a meh title, seems like it lacks some buildings and is basically a base-game for DLC.You can't hold valuable resources like coal, uranium, or oil for state use. I import Uranium for my Nuclear Reactor and the Uranium passes through my economy and never makes it to the Reactor. I mine Uranium and most of it was sold on the market my entire country shut down because of a lack of options for a dictator. If they want to make a better Tropico game, make a game where you actually feel like you're telling people to get things done and not on a rollercoaster where you have no control over where even your resources go. Which a dictator would obviously have full control over, so I rate this game a fail because it does not capture what it claims to be. Other than a simple city building game where you just give people jobs and build an industry.Perhaps I'm missing something, I'll play it for a while longer but I don't have any optimism and will just squeeze some nominal fun out of it for the 9.99 price I bought it at. I give it a 5.7/10, but not worth picking up for full price if you already own Tropico 3.I barely recommend this game.			"

												As a bit of a Tropico addict (the combination of silly political chicanery, toy-town construction and comparitive simplicity compared to other city builders), Tropico 5 is a waste of time compared to 4 or even 3. A slight graphical upgrade, but less content and virtually every new feature has an incredibly irritating dark side. The eras system essentially locks off 3/4 of the game's content for no justification and makes your old building redundant. Politics has been dumbed down in the extreme, making pleasing factions essentially a random process. Trading route economics means tedious micromanagement. The greater military focus means huge outlays for rebels that cannot seemingly be appeased or defeated, constant battles with seemingly random outcomes and incredibly important upgrades hidden in rarely-accessed menus. The campaign's focus on four islands means a nice sense of investment, but as every mission has to be playable on one of two choices, say hello to incredibly bland islands with pretty much every resource - and sod if you can guess which island would be best to play the subsequent mission in each era on, because you can't play more than one mission in each era per island.

I'll change my vote if that changes.I do upgrade my computer components fairly often, I'm not a dumb console gamer. My point is this and only this - Tropico 5 blocked a lot of people from playing this for no reason. Build it for DX11, fine, but no reason a DX10.1 user shouldn't be able to play it also. I've seen the videos, this is not a graphics intensive game especially when you compare it to the stuff I do play, again, maxed out.			"

These crashes can occur anywhere between a few minutes to a few hours and because of the infreqentcy of the auto-save (because it's tied to the game speed rather then set time periods) you will be constantly redoing anywhere up to a half hour of work every time this occurs because the game will garunteed crash when this happens it cannot recover like other games do.

												Developers took a few steps forward and a lot steps back on this. While graphics got better and the game seems to run faster they oversimplified every single existing feature and added few other equally simplified features like trading.Character creator remained nearly the same as in previous game, boring and simple. Power struggle improved a bit with an addition of invaders and towers, as well as more active rebels. New dynasty system basically results in up to 7 extra managers for your buildings with no personality whatsoever. Almanac provides less information than before and lacks any sorting features. Controlling building budgets got simplified and there are less buildings, as well as less variety of housing.I didn't really need a multiplayer feature and played only a few games online so i won't judge it. It did seem kinda slow however and i didn't enjoy playing it with my friend, since the game ended when he couldn't upgrade to a different age.I can recommend this for new players but unless they release major content patch or a free DLC - its not worth buying over Tropico 4.

												As a city builder game fan, I have no idea why I was unaware of these series until 3 weeks ago... that's when I found Tropico 5. A great game for someone new to this series, it is easy and hard at the same time, the mechanics are great, the towns we create are awesome, especially when I try to build them organically. I love this game, I will check into the previous titles, I already got a copy of T4 Complete Edition. I just wish we had more diversity by having more campaigns, more buildings, harder achievements and better camera movement. Everything else is awesome. I'm not into the Multiplayer aspect, which can be fun for some players, but I prefer building cities and watching them evolve, and Tropico does just that but with political and economical twists! I love it.			"

												I played Tropico (the original) many years ago when it came out but never really got into it as I'm not a huge fan of economy management RTS-style games.I decided to give this one a shot though and it immediately captivated me. Looking at numbers was never so fun! Don't get me wrong. This game is much more than that. You have city planning, warfare, diplomatic juggling and it's all wrapped together with a very quirky sense of dictatorial humor.Pros:- looks great- addictive- lovely music- funny take on the whole ""be a dictator"" setting- can get very hectic when you're trying to save the economy or stop a riot/invasionCons:- gets repetitive after about 10 missions/plays- it's sometimes very hard to pinpoint why you're losing money when everything seems to be in the green.

												I really enjoyed the gameplay- moving through the eras and the challenge of the scenarios (although I've been doing it on 'easy' budget and it's still difficult to stay above water, but I do like to accumulate at speed). There are a number of maps to play and the scenarios have you juggle two islands at a time so you're not starting from scratch every time with a new island and the longevity of the islands you build is greater as you revisit it frequently to continue building. I did hit a budget snag on one of my games where I lost about a grand a month for no discernible reason (the budget said I shoud have more coming in than going out and it's unclear where costs can be cut. I had a huge labour shortage, too.) Fortunately the game completed when I was on about -100,000 and the people were at 43% happiness!The reason I wouldn't recommend this game is because there are so few buildings available. Only two choices, tall and small, on the apartment buildings- how hard would it have been to throw in a couple of recolours? This means on quite a large island you're going to repeat the same patterns again and again, with only one upgraded house, an unupgradable mansion, and a tall or short upgraded apartment block, all identical. There are a few parks, but very few seem to offer paths to walk on, which means citizens move oddly through them (although it's nice that they can sit on benches in the parks with paths)- it would have been nice if there were a few more options. The entertainment options are very much lacking- and only a couple of them are small enough to place frequently around the map, so you end up having a visually unappealing map with hundreds of identical buildings. On looking for an expansion to up the number of buildings- new high-quality housing large and small, additional much needed entertainment buildings like a zoo, waterpark, alternative restaurant, children's playpark, a grade school required by some employers but not available int he game... I discovered there are many cheap expansion packs, but all with only one building each, mostly employment buildings relating to a new scenario. None of the buildings I'd like to really customise my game!To summarise- if all you care about is the politics, managing a budget and keeping your factions happy, you'll enjoy this game, but maybe wait until it's on sale. If you're a builder who wants their town to look authentic or aesthetically more interesting than 4 buildings repeated 100 times each you're probably going to want to give this a miss.			"

												I was enjoying this game. The music's good, the graphics look great, the new trade system is nice... But then I hit a wall: The game will not load past the loading screen on a campaign mission. I go to the forums, and other people are having the same issue. There's a workaround, but it's not working for everyone. And there's no official response from the developers on when or if they intend on fixing it. Other heavily advertised features of the game, such as Multiplayer, are locking up on players frequently. Oh, and it doesn't have a save functioon, so even if they do happen to make it some ways into the game, they gotta start from scratch if they have to leave. Still others complain that the game won't even start. Again, there are workarounds, but it should not be incumbent upon the consumer to find fixes for a ""finished"" game that was just so recently released. New games have bugs, I get it. I can understand the traffic glitch that forces your teamsters to get stuck, unable to transport  commodities to the docks for export and causing your economy to plunge. That's annoying, but it's an easy fix in game once you recognize it. I cna understand how trade ships might just magically disappear from your inventory, preventing you from utilizing them. Annoying, but you still at least have trade ships, and the computer freighters still come to export, so that's more of a minor inconvenience. I can even forgive them for forcing you to accept new immigrants at a steady speed even when you've indicated in your Constitution that the borders will be closed.But I can not understand how the developers decided it a releaseable product when players are unable to complete Sandbox missions because the game doesn't register that they've accomplished the primary objective on the mission. Or how they determined a final release should have a game breaking bug, the likes of which I haven't seen in a game of this budget since Big Rigs. I guess a 30% success rate on multiplayer matches making it through era changes was high enough by Kalypso's standards. And maybe that's why they didn't figure the mode needed saves; because no one makes it far enough.I want to recommend this game. It's got good potential; even though they reduced the total amount of buildings, and therefore functionality, from previous Tropicos; or put a heavier emphasis on the military's role without expanding on the mechanics behind the military units, forcing you to watch the horribly programmed AI duke it out and hope that your side wins.But at its current stage, I can not and will not recommend this unfinished garbage to anyone.

												Haemimont Games finally added a mission editor. It's a little late, but a very welcome update which makes the base game well worth getting, especially if it's on a sale.Tropico 5 uses a new engine and completely remade graphics, unlike Tropico 4 which simply expanded on Tropico 3. This being said, your old tricks and tactics won't work, so you will get a fresh new experience from playing this.Pros:+new eras feature allows you to advance and rule through time: colonial era, the World Wars , the Cold War and Modern Times, each era has different foreign nations, factions and availible buildings and edicts+new combat system gives you more control over the defense of your buildings+new research feature+new trade route feature allowing you to manage specific imports and exports, which also affects your foreign relations+the ability to form your own dynasty, which can be involved in certain missions+new policies feature allows you to declare and decide laws on your island, giving you freedom of choice over your method of ruling it+continous campaign system which allows you to pick and carry over your old islands over several missions+competitive and cooperative multiplayer+ingame radio is still as enjoyable as it was in the older games, complete with soundtrack and radio host which comments on island events+the ability to make custom sandbox maps and missionsCons:-the new combat system sometimes takes unoptimal routes, and in multiplayer it is very easy for a player to quick-build military buildings and rush the opponent-campaign lacks an actual challenge-the competitive multiplayer component is entirely reliant on luck and map placement, rather than skill-fewer actors and faction representatives than in Tropico 4-fewer buildings and building models than in Tropico 4 (all the missing buildings were either useless or served the same function as other better alternatives, so this is only aesthetically damaging)-the same cheap DLC marketing methodConclusion:The base game is worth getting now, at least during sales. The DLCs, however, still don't offer enough, so I'd advise you to avoid those, or get them during a big sale.The mission editor (through steam workshop) will offer you great, near infinite replayability, for as long as people keep playing and making scenarios. But you can't just expect custom missions to magically appear, so I encourage you to try your hand at making a mission once you finish the main campaign!I will go do that right now.			"

												When first diving in, Tropico 5 seems like a promising experience.  Unfortunately, you're going to bang your head against the concrete, because it just isn't that deep.  Verterans of Tropico 4, in particular, are going to find themselves looking for things that just aren't there.  Minor spoilers below:Pros: Tropico 5 sports some upgraded graphics and a couple of new game mechanics that work fairly well.  The timeline is expanded, and the game's main campaign does a decent job of fostering a sense of ""era"" and moving through history in a way that earlier installments in the series did not.  El Presidente now gets his/her own Dynasty, and the player has the option of training and leveling up several characters with different skill sets.  Any of these characters can be El Prez, while the others can be tasked as Managers to improve the efficiencies of buildings.Cons: Despite the upgraded graphics, Tropico 5 is just missing a lot of customization options that were taken for granted in 4.  Almost no building in the game has an alternate look, so housing blocks tend to look generic.  The decorative options are also fewer, and look much more ""cardboard"" when compared to Tropico 4's decorations.  Many building types have also been combined in ways that don't make sense.  I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out where the option to build a fire station was, only to find out this was an ""upgrade"" for my police station.Trade in Tropico 5 doesn't make much sense, period.  You can ""trade"" resources continually, but to get better prices for goods, you need a trade ship, which you obtain one at a time by building a dock.  Want 5 trade ships?  Build 5 docks.  The trade system scales poorly, has little information provided by the game HUD, and requires a fair amount of micormanagement.The character development and voice acting have definitely taken a big step down.  While Penultimo is reasonaby well done, the other characters in the story line are either flat or overdone.  The faction leaders from prior games (Sunny, Reverend Esteban, etc) are nowhere to be seen and there is no commentary to replace them.  If you want to know how a particular faction is feeling, you will find yourself constantly digging through the menus to do it.For veterans of Tropico 4 looking for a few hours of fun, pick this up when it goes on sale.  If you're new to the series, just go pick up Tropico 4 and skip this one.   "

												Honestly speaking, this is my first time playing Tropico series. I am truly intrigued. You are El Presidente, basically, a dictator of a tropical island nation. As a dictator, the entire nation is under your control. The historical period of this game ranges from the colonial era to its modern counterpart. For each period there is one or two particular types of economic activities that are lucrative and beneficial. You always have to change your construction plan over time. For example, in the Colonial Era, plantations and ranches generate money but as the time passes on you can't count on those to fight the Great War. After the Cold War the space program and internet become crucial as well.It is not only a city construction simulation but a political one as well. You are the sole policymaker. You have to consider all aspects of your nation in terms of policymaking. Should I reduce the wages of the poor to gain public support? Should I use martial law to secure the position of my dynasty? Should I fight the Communists with the US or the other way around? This game is fancinating!			"

												The last tropico game I'll buyGraphics updates are nice, but late game infrastructure is still a mess and the campaign is significantly worse.The worst part about Tropico 5 is the extent to which I don't care about playing the campaign missions. The campaign leaves you with two basic islands to build off of, and your progress carries over mission-mission. This means that the actual act of 'city-building' gets extremely limited - because missions are now about tacking on some arbitrary requirement rather than striving for the most efficient/aesthetically pleasing system. Furthermore, as there are limitations on the number of consecutive times you can re-use an island, both islands have to be able to accommodate any industry (as missions can often boil down to 'make x, y, and then z industry'). Accommodating every industry makes the islands generic - taking away the adaptation game of Tropicos past of dealing with soil/resource/beauty variances. The overarching plot is dumb, and political tweaks (especially over-militarization as detailed in other reviews) just makes things worse.			"

												Tropico 5 has some neat improvements, including research, moving through new eras, and some steps to reduce micromanagement of previous games.  But it's also got some game-crippling bugs that cause your buildings to stop working.Most importantly, the campaign is pretty short and takes place on the same 4 islands over and over. Your island carries through to the next mission, so if you beef it up before winning, the next mission will be a piece of cake, while if you struggle to win, you might doom yourself in the future. The whole thing can be finished in a weekend or two.My recommendation is to wait for a Gold Edition that comes out in a year and has all of the DLC they've planned, which I believe will include multiple campaigns.

												The scenery is there, the jokes are there, everything should be a repeat of the hilarity of running a banana republic through the  ages. But its not. The colonial times are the same missions and just auto repeat. Same partly with the world wars. The cold war era offers some variety with tourism. but there isnt enough buildings to make a fun resort. All in all.. they sacrificed the series soul in order to get mulitplayer. I hope it will be worth it for them, but for now, wait until this game goes on sale.. really cheap.. because thats the feeling i get from this game.. Cheap..			"

												I loved Tropico 4, rule your own country, make your economy rise, satisfy your people, execute those in your way,♥♥♥♥♥♥off foreign countries and wave your nuke around to prevent them from invading. These are just some of the things you can do in the previous game and are still present in 5. But Tropico 5 changed in different ways, military became much more critical, forces are stronger thus stronger defense is required. Trade routes can be chosen and relations with foreign countries' relations affect these. You progress through time and things change even more than Modern Times DLC in 4. Housing is more interconnected with job salary and sometimes you experience problems but don't know the details until you see a detail that changes your prespective. The game provides a bigger mirror to the perspective of a dictator, things need to be watched more often and closely, you must be prepared and at the same time be able to adapt to the situations you must be watchful of such as civil unrest and the end of WWII.Everything got more difficult, more complex, in some cases worse than 4, I miss the old Penultimo, I missing allowing no rent to all residentials, I miss the diverse set of characters and more. But 5 had some things I really liked, the campaign was something I didn't expect and loved, the fact that you make your island grow and don't abandon it at the end of the episode makes you see how difficult it gets to run a country the longer it stays alive. You have multiplayer (which sucked earlier on until some updates) where you cooperate or kill each other with armies and resources. Military played a bigger role, both a good thing and a bad thing because I didn't give a damn about it til 5.Bottomline, Tropico 5 is like a more difficult version of 4, things need to be watched more often as the threat level of everything got more critical such as rebels, civil unrest and pirates and the campaign requires you to realize that you are NOT going to abandon your country and ALL problems you experience now WILL happen into the future unless YOU fix it while you can. Tropico 5 is a great game and I value it as I value 4 but in different ways.If you've played Tropico 4 and loved it as it is and don't want things to change, then stick with it. If you value a bigger challenge, a more complex way of playing it, a chance to compete with other dictators (heads up, few people go online anymore so find a friend) and to realize how difficult it is to manage your own lil island then go buy this, hell it's Steam anyway. Price too high? Steam Sale!			"

												This game is riddled with bugs, even after a day one patch. I have encountered numerous crashes during normal gameplay, and after the last crash none of my saves will load. Kalypso either has a QA department that doesn't know how to test PC games, or they rushed it out the door. They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this in the condition its in.			"

The constitution and tech tree are the only good parts of this game everything else was ruined from the factions to buldings to the awesome humor.

												As much as it pains me to say it - don't get this game. Tropico 4 was simply better. The campaign is just horrible, things don't seem to click liek they did in T4. This is only slightly different from T4, it's clearly the same engine, same characters, same somewhat purile humour, that's just losing it's charm. This game needs it's forehead slapped, and someone to yell 'THINK' at it, the fun is gone, the campaign is horrible, the roads are appalling, the transitions are ridiculous, the game isn't fun. I used to love Tropico, but won't be rushing to get the next installment I'm afraid. Stay clear, get Tropico 4 with all it's add ons, it's a much better game.			"

It has some positives and negatives, here is a list (borrowd from user Nova ● mayroser 么 because I agree with his review):Positive:+Better graphics.+Longer play time.+New dynasty feature.+New trade route feature.+Better wars and riots.+Co-op feature.+Managers for buildings.+New eddicts.Negative:-Unsatissfying character creator.-Colonial era is boring.-There isn't many new buildings.-The happiness chart of classes are worse then Tropico 4.-New building menu is worse than Tropico 4.

												Unfortunately Tropico 5 is a blatent attempt to make money via DLC.  There is one island, limited buildings, limited interaction, and a complete lack of the previous offerings charm.The Product Manager for this release should be sumarily fired.  He has taken a lovely game and gutted it for a mirage of profit.  If it had been a great base game I would have bought the expansions willingly.  They didn't accomplish having a great base game. Worse, for some reason they ""listened to fans"" about dumbing the series down.  Who are these fans?  My casual playing wife who loved the 1-4 games was massively dissappointed in 5.			"

												Yes, it seems like Tropico 3 and 4 may have been the peaks for this franchise - I too have been playing since the original. The game looks better but you certainly don't feel like you have the freedom to be a true dictator (fewer personality characteristics, PAINFULLY dumbed-down almanac, dumbed-down economic system, dumbed-down faction system, not enough edicts, etc.). It seems like they also brought alot of half-baked concepts into this game (research, trade, constitution,  etc. - all good ideas) whereas maybe they should have focused on just one of those concepts and made it really decent. What happened to our pre-election speeches? (We need MORE of those types of things).   It's almost as if the game is under new mangement and that the management is out of touch with what has made the game such a great hit - we don't care so much about what El Presidente looks like, we want more gameplay freedom.We care about having a wider range of political and economic options so that we can tweak and abuse our little island nation for our purposes! Why can't we specifically control wages or rent prices anymore - what if I want a farmer to make twice as much as a doctor?    As a fan of the franchise, I feel like #5 has simply taken several steps in the wrong direction - we needed a political and economic system that had even greater depth, not much, much less. It seems like the developers are getting carried away with the looks and zaniness of the game rather than the original concept of the game - that in which a control-freak dictator can run his island nation however he likes, with an endless array of customizable methods on how to do just that! Think Tropico 3 and 4 but with an even  greater range of economic and political freedom and abilities - we can't even place trees, fountains or intimidating statues anymore...   Overall, a 4/10 - a beautiful game but not nearly the political and economic game it once was. I do like the addition of tanks, though. Also, the concept of trade deals is a good one but still seems not completely thought-out. I will be sticking with previous versions of the game to satisfy future dictatorial urges...I hope the franchise makes a 180 for the next release. Instead of making a good model even better, they seem to have tried to renovate the franchise, which, to me, is undermining what has made the franchise so good. I recommend it to those who are new to the franchise, but would further recommend previous versions.			"

												At its core it’s very much a city builder, where economic concerns, politics, trade routes, production, power, roads, revenue and all that other good city stuff is the name of the game. But by putting players on a tropical island and in control of a dictator in charge of a banana republic of sorts it adds a unique context that is played entirely for laughs, which is something the infectious calypso music spells out immediately. As the fifth entry in the series, Tropico 5 doesn’t stray too far from the formula established so far, it adds the prerequisite new things expected of a sequel, some of which work, and some of which, well, need a little more work.

The newest member to the Tropico family brings all the main features from previous titles with a slight enhancement in graphics and gameplay.  This is a game I really enjoyed playing. Having an option to build my island and accompany it from an early settlement, a minor colony, till the modern days with technologies of this actual millennium. I enjoyed both being a totalitarian leader and beloved el presidente, ruling with an iron hand or with system based on democratic roots. The game allows you to change so many aspects of the game with a dozens of edicts, constitution options, foreign relationships and island infrastructure, that you have a wide range of options where to head with your leadership. Do you want to lead an industrial progressive small tropical island? Or would you rather it to be a tourist resort? communist paradise? or latinoamerican junta? Now you have a chance, so grab it and rule!Pros✪ It's Tropico!✪ The Eras changing in this game I see as the main feature which improves whole gameplay and complements research system. Thanks to tropico 5 you can experience colonial, world wars, cold war and modern eras on an carribean island. This is something really refreshing.✪ Dynasty - Now you can build your own dynasty which members  have overall effects on whole island and in addition can be appointed as managers.✪ Soundtrack - I love that! However for someone could be annoyingly repetitive.✪ Multiplayer - You can now compete with your friends even though MP doesnt vary much from SP. MP rather motivates you to improve your way of leadership - be more effective than your oponents.✪Constitution, basic pillar of a nation, can now be proclaimed and amended with a few policies which influence the gameplay afterwards.Cons✪ Immigration - Tropico isn't Europe. It's an island but it seems that also there the immigration is unstoppable no matter what you do.✪ Placement - I could really use some single trees etc. for empty spaces between buildings or next to roads where no whole building (or smth else) can fit. I would appreciate this feature very much.✪ Untransparency - Sometimes it happens that a building doesn't work and you just do not know why. Or you have empty houses and people rather live in the shacks for god knows why. No reasons, maybe they are just hipsters...✪ The campaigns could be more creative and better elaborated. Nothing much happens there you just build your island and focus on completing tasks, nothing special. At least this is my opinion. Overall7.5 /10The exact same amount of points as when I rated Tropico 4 considering all pros and cons.P.s. I wasnt able to set audio language to spanish while the rest of the game (interface etc.) remains in english. This option would complete the environment and atmosphere.			"

												If you enjoyed Tropico 4 (which was great if you’ve never played it), you will likely enjoy Tropico 5.  However, as someone who plays a lot of this genre of games, I will say Tropic 5 was the first Tropico where I actually had to become a dictator to survive.  Note I only play on hard mode since I do have a lot of experience with Tropico games.In every other Tropico game, all you had to do was give the people what they want (housing, food, religion, etc.) and they would vote for you.  I almost never had to issue Martial Law or assassinate someone, unless I just wanted to do it for kicks.  In Tropico 5, the factions have so much more power.  You can have an overall happiness of 80% and an approval rating of 35%, so if you don’t rig the election, you’re going to lose.  For example, if the majority of your population are environmentalists and you build a factory, you will take a huge hit in popularity.  It’s a pleasant surprise because no longer can you easily make huge island decisions and not be punished for it.  If you’ve done mostly communist things for ten years and then all of a sudden become best friends with the USA and make the plebs pay for their own food and medicine, your population will resent you and rebel, even if their overall happiness keeps improving. And hope that those in your military aren’t part of those unhappy factions because even high wages won’t always save you from a coup d’etat.Wages as they were in Tropico 3 and 4 are gone and have been replaced by something a little different.  I’m not a fan of it because when I’m rolling in the rum and oil dough, I’d like to be able to raise everyone’s wage at the same time and now that can only be done on a per building type basis—and each type of farm is considered a different building, so you can’t even raise all farmers’ wages at the same time, you must go into each type of farm and change it.  They also replaced Penultimo’s voice actor with someone much less annoying, and it bothers me.Overall, it is definitely a buy if you can get it on sale.  It’s quite different from previous versions but has the same feel-you definitely know you're playing a Tropico game.  As I’ve said though, if you’ve historically been a loving, graceful, democratic leader who would never really use the Secret Police to aid you, this game might force you to change your ways. "

												First of all, Tropico 5 is way longer than I expected, which is great, as I do enjoy long games that frustrate you. I played on hard and was forced multiple times to restart missions or redo the entire playthrough due to mistakes I've made. Which is just great!Now lets get down to it, is Tropico 5 just like Tropico 1-2-3-4? A short answer would be no. A long answer will be hell no.Tropico 5 is built on what made the tropico series great. City building and controlling your island as El President is addictive. All that you loved from the older games you will find here as well. However Tropico 5 is bringing a lot of new things to the series.In the older games, you could find a balance and then you would NEVER have any kind of problems again with money, well Tropico 5 skull ♥♥♥♥s that and makes you work for it. Just as you think, “Ah ! I finally figured out how to keep my money in plus”, you will go in huge minus due to one of the many random events.The interface and gameplay in many ways will make you feel like home. But all the new things will toss you a curve ball all the time and keep you on your toes, I had to play the last mission 6 times in a row (Yea ! I'm not kidding, 6 freaking times) to even understand what I did wrong and to finally beat it. In the other Tropicos this would never have happened.The graphics are brilliant as well as the humor. Lets not forget that there is MULTIPLAYER. That's right, 2 Presidents trying to either kill each other or work together for a greater goal.Tropico 5 is everything I personally wanted from a new Tropico game and I can only strongly recommend it. There are tons of DLC's but be careful what you buy as not all of them are worth the money.So to sum up, grab the game for sure and grab the DLC's when they are on sale!			"

												Do I recommend this game - yes or no? Well I wish there had been a ""maybe"".Because if you haven't played the series before and like City Builders, I'd absolutelyrecommend it: nice graphics, game design, sounds and music, lots to do, user-friendly interface and with a political and historical aspect to it.On the other hand, as for myself, who have played the series from the start -it's a waste of money - really. A lot of great features - like many buildings and edicts has beenremoved and replaced with others. In fact - edicts, witch I find the most enjoyable in Tropico,are much fewer in Tropico 5 - sadly. The historical aspect, where you go through Colonial, World Wars, Cold Wars and Modern Times, at first sounds interesting - but fact is, in ruins the free gameplay totally, and will in a few weeks time (if not days), feel extremely repetitive. Because you can only buy buildings in specific historical times and when you have researched many of them. I want to play a sandbox game where I have the most freedom to build my Tropico ""paradise"" with only money and some resources hindering me in doing just that. I don't want to be controlled be a game developer dictatorship - I'm the DICTATOR!So stick with Tropico 3 or 4 - if you already have one of these - you won't get much new here,and the new stuff in Tropico 5 will ONLY annoy you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Off the record and not very hush-hush:In general (Tropico 5 being the sum of that) I simply don't understand what game developers, are thinking about when they make a game. Do they actually play the games themselves?I can hardly believe that - why would you put in stuff that are extremely annoying? And removeprevious great features? It doesn't make any sense. And do they not read and listen to whattheir game communities says or wishes? And what about game testers? Do they actually listento them? Or do they get the wrong people to test the games?But of course - if it's only about making money, it's a clever idea, to make half a decent game,them you'll have an excuse to make yet another game (read: update) to correct the annoying things, that people don't like and put in new annoying things - that way you can keep a series going on for as long as you want. EA being another perfect example of that. Gamers really have to stop falling for that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Developers - make games that you actually want to play yourself -Rockstar Games, Naughty Dogs and Bohemia Interactive are good examples of that. Not that they don't make mistakes, but you have a feeling that they make games they wantto play themselves.			"

												Tropico 5 just never hit it home like the predecessors in the series have.  At first it seemed like a direct copy of 4 with some features either added or removed.  I want to like this game but there are so many things just holding it back, chiefly the DLC spam fest that this company has set forth with this game.  Tropico 3 and 4 had similar DLC but not to the extent that this game has.  Another issue I have with the game is the poor optimization for OS X.  While I used to have a windows box and will be building a new one, I am on OS X for the time being and the game just runs terrible for the specs listed.  If I turn off grass everything magically improves, why even bother porting it if you are going to do a half♥♥♥♥♥job?  Tropico 5 also removed some of my faovrite characters from the 4th, while this isn't necessairly bad, Pinultimo was changed for the worse in my opinion.  Other things follow but they are all small but add up to my dissatisfaction.  But, on to the things that I like about the game.One of the biggest changes that I enjoy was the ability to play with a friend on the same island.  This introduced  mechanic that lets you play relaxed and have a good time while subjugating or liberating your people.  Additionally, some of the newer buildings are nice as well as the other options they added to the edicts. The graphics haven't improved much but they are still decent, if anything they enhanced the color.Overall, the game's performance issues despite having way more than the recommended settings, removal of key character voice acting, terrible pathing of the military (they seemingly walk past rebels in the way to get to their destination), the money solves everything mentality, and much more ruined the game for me.  I won't be coming back to Tropico ever again.  Tropico 1,2,3,and 4 are fantastic and something to enjoy but the buck stops here in the series for me.  Your milage may vary but I find the continual rehashing of the same thing getting old.  I also find that the pay for features that should have been part of the game concept undesirable.			"

												I'll preface this review by saying that I've been a big fan of the Tropico games since the first one. I only played 5 on its free weekend, which wasn't actually a free weekend but was a ""play the demo for free weekend"", since you only get to play the first mission.Anyway, Tropico 5 feels like Tropico 4 at several times the price. The only noticeable difference to the overall feel of the gameplay was the forced research progression, which simply slows you down from playing. Maybe the tweaked mechanics make the game more fun eventually, but not during the short portion of the game I was able to access. If you want to play a Tropico game, get one of the earlier ones for a fraction of the price, and wait till 5's been around a while longer.			"

I really just enjoy the content of this series, and this game is a decent enough continuation of the series.A few things off the top of my head...The UI is different than Troico 4, but one eventually get's use to it.The graphics have improved thanks to utilizing DX11Almost every building is upgradable, and you can upgrade some all at once (if you have the money)Dynasty Members, not really all that great, but you can pick and choose traits to suit your needs (and use them as managers)There are tons of buildings to choose from.Along with the eras you progress through, you have to do research to unlock different things (buildings, edicts, etc.)Farms are more contained and you know where the crops will grow (as opposed to randomly around the building)If you enjoyed the first 4 Tropico games (Like me), then I'd be shocked if you didn't find at least something enjoyable about this game.*I agree with most everyone about the DLC being horribly overpriced and refuse to buy them (I bought standalone before the Complete collection was released). Maybe if they bundle them at a huge discount... "

												The whole game series is going the total oposite direction, and that in every posible way, it has less content, less control over your city, the economy does whatever it pleases ( Sells wares you need for yourself like food or fuel for your power plants ), you can play it 2 diferent ways, u can keep everyone happy and loose money until bankrupcy, or you can earn money and think u have the population repressed until the military u got to defend you against rebels coup you, you could always try to keep your militants happy but then ur back at option 1 and loose since you cant choose who to keep happy, its all or nothing, defeat or death. then not to mention releasing half the game then demanding money to get the other half by calling it DLC`s its all just a big Flop`n Hoax. Buy Tropico 4 instead if you dont have it already, thats a real game :) this is not recomended in any way.			"

												If you've played Tropico 3&4 you'll see that this is functionally a big reskin of both of those. They have yet to add any new real mechanics to the experience, and most of what has been lost from those previous titles now returns as DLC. Boooooo I was very disappointed when I purchased this game at full price only to see the lengthy DLC schedule for it. It really is the same game, with the same frustrating wandering agents and bad vehicle path utilization. And for that, I cannot recommend you buy it.  "

												As a connisseur of loading screens and menus, this game has without a doubt the best ones in the Tropico series! Would like to know how the game plays, but unfortunately...Pros: Great menus and loading screens!Cons:  Kalypso didn't bother to consider that not everyone has a top-of-the-line graphics card, and didn't make that need clear when offering this for pre-order.Sum-up:  Got a great computer? Enjoy the game! For the rest of us? Enjoy Tropico 4. Last time you get my money, Kalypso.			"

												This game lacks the humour, charm and many of the options and features of previous iterations. The trade-off? A family-structure called 'dynasties' which doesn't actually affect the gameplay much, a minor graphics upgrade... and some very very pretty loading screens. Now I understand why this game feels emptier than its predecessors; updates. They are 'updating' this game as they go. Whilst this may seem like a boon; a gift; a nice thing they are doing, the fact is that the game I paid for was not worth the money if you owned previous iterations. This is not labelled as a Greenlight or Early Access game, but compared with previous Tropico games that is what it feels like. Perhaps Tropico 5 will become even better than past iterations, eventually, but with this sad precedent the company have screwed themselves. I will not bother paying release price for their games again, and I highly recommend that you do not either, Ignore this game for  another 6 months, and maybe they will update it enough to be worth the price tag. But whatever you do, don't pay the full £35.			"

												I've loved the tropico series, four was fantastic.  five? lacks the same charm in so many ways, my biggest problem is with the colonial age era.. it feels poorly tacked on, there is little to do during it and they didn't even bother putting period matching music in it. The research system is very boring, rather then letting you unlock differant bonuses to buildings and improve the things you have.. it's just a system to ever so slowly dole out the same buildings you had in tropico 4, The Voice actors were universaly bad, the comments didn't seem as witty, Much of the customization from building to building that the earlier games had was striped out nearly entirely.. as was the customization for your ruler. rather then dozens of ""perks"" flaws and other attributes to pick from and play with, you get to select one of like six. the dynasty system also is as pointless as boring. despite what they hinted it prerelease.. you don't age and die and have to be replaced by one of your family.. you just put a differant perk on each ""tool"" and elect the one that currently best fits what you want. not that the abilities matter a great deal. Decorative items have been stripped out so no more creating visualy pleasing cities. nor can you jail criminals. All and all the game feels like Tropico 4, if it had been lengthened out in size, and stripped of a fair ammount of content to ""streamline it."" I was disipointed by the game.  im sure a flood of DLC will be coming to slowly rectify the situation. but unlike with tropico 4 I don't feel the urge to buy it.. honestly I felt like one of the Factory Farm livestock from it. shoved in a small pen and shoveled this ""Corn"" to make them money.

												Having spent a significant amount of time playing Tropico 4, there is something very off-putting about Tropico 5. In Tropico 4, one would always start fresh with each campaign mission. In Tropico 5, the island is carried over between missions. There are benefits to this, but it changes the way the player plays the game. There are buildings the player might want to put near the coast that aren't available until later missions, but it's quite likely the coast will already be well developed by the time those buildings can be built. This forces the player to build akwardly, with future additions in mind, to demolish what are in many cases expensive buildings to make room for new ones, or to simply learn to live with a less-than-ideal situation that will penalize them moving forward. Many of the interface changes between 4 and 5 seem to make it more difficult to access information rather than easier. There seem to be fewer useful overlays and the overlay can be very difficult to read. Some buildings or building upgrades have an effective radius that can't be viewed, leaving the player guessing. It's still very difficult to easily see what areas are being served by which service buildings. The interface changed from 4 to 5, but that really seems to be the extent of it. It wasn't improved in any significant way. It's just different.There are good points to the new game as well. Features I would be excited about if the rest of the game didn't feel clumsy. The introduction of research, upgrades and building managers are all interesting features. Greater variety in the military is also very interesting, though the military itself is clumsy to use and combat can be rather infuriating. There are some clever additions made in this iteration that might see better development in a sequel.The core gameplay of Tropico is still there, so some may enjoy this. First time players may not find as much fault with the game. Personally, i'll hold out hope that (the likely inevitably sequel) Tropico 6 will fine tune things and simply be a better game on whole.

												Is this a good game? Yes, it actually gave me a few hours of fun before it dried out.Do I recommend this above any other city builder? Not at all.I have enjoyed playing both Tropico 3 and 4, not because of the unbelievably easy AI as seen in 5, but because of the ability to control my city and fix its problems. Tropico 5 not only shields you from changing your laws in less than 28 months, but linearly guides you on what to build next. In previous titles, missions were an optional thing that you could participate in, depending on the mission. But, in Tropico 5, say the communists want you to build them a row of 15 houses; you now have to option to cancel the mission, causing the communists to hate you literally for the entire game, OR, you can go into national debt by building the houses, and have a nice little +1 boost to happiness.This prevents players from building the island nation of their dreams, and instead they get a moshpit of infighting communists, capitalists, and acoholic religious zealots. But, don't worry, you can fix the opinions of EVERYBODY for the new DLC called Waterborne, at the low cost of $40! You get off-shore oil derricks for the capitalists, more coastal homes for the commies, and the religious--well, you can get alongside a future character creator expansion for only $15.Seriously, though; every month it seems that features that should have been in the game already are released as DLC bundles. If you look closely, you can see that, in the time of the game's original release, it was coded so that future DLCs would plug right in; before the off-shore oil derricks, we had off-shore oil deopsits visible. Why? Because monehs.The game with every DLC is a good game, but until Kalypso stops dicing off features and putting on a price tag for all of them, do NOT buy this. My final verdict is a petty 3/10.5/24/2015 Edit:I finally came back to the game to see if they had added anything in new patches; all I got was four new DLC's. Expect Tropico 6 to be even sketchier; maybe we will have a one-time 10 population boost for the price of a $5 gem pack.Everybody, go home, back to Tropico 4; this was a bust.6/4/2015 Edit:I laughed this morning when I opened Steam to find Kalypso gave me the Green DLC for free.I now completely change my mind about this game and the developers, they are so generous by giving me their cheapest DLC for free. 11/10 would be bribed again			"

Liked the new progression mechanics, but you just don't get as much of a sense of control, which is kinda one of the draws of playing a city sim as a stand-in for Fidel Castro. Additionally, there aren't as many characters to interact with and advise you and whatnot, I'm not too fond of Penultimo's new voice and there aren't as many building types (as far as I can tell).

												When Fidel Castro took over Cuba and threatened the U.S. with nuclear weapons it had people all over the world in shock and utter fear. However when El Presidente was randomly given a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ island the size of my local Wal-Mart he established a new nation that would somehow become a major factor on the world stage. Despite only having a revenue of $5,000 every couple of months Tropico was a country not to be messed with for they had a whopping army of 10 soldiers. The country had a large population, estimated to be around 100 civilians. Everyday El Presidente would randomly order his troops to attack random citizens in order to create lolz on his bland island. For some reasons tourism is very popular on Tropico despite the random mass-murders, an extreme lack of liberty and complete corruption of the government. So far every attempted invasion on Tropico failed due to the extensive defense system of guard towers. So far Tropico's education system is a bit outdated with only 7 students attending the local high school and the college destroyed by a volcano located on the island 500 feet away from the main town. Tropico is a country not to be ♥♥♥♥ed with.			"

												A great game, held back by one huge flaw.  You lose everything at each era change, so everything you have built becomes negative income.  And since all of your trade routes go away too, there is zero incentive to spend any time in any era but the final one.  During one game, I had $260,000 entering the World War era, and it was increasing.  2 years into the World War era, I was in the red, being invaded, and dealing with uprisings.  I didn't have the money to upgrade my army, and got thrashed.  In a subsequent game, I was rushing each era, and managed to get through to the modern era with little trouble.  IMHO, any game that penalizes you for playing the game isn't a good game.  Get rid of that horrible transition problem, and this would be a 9/10 game.  With it, 5/10.			"

												Tropico 5 was a game I picked up after watching a few YouTubers mess around with it, and so I investigated the steam page and from there things went swish!It has a nice quirky story, while might slightly infuriate you, is quite rewarding in the end but sadly not made out to be that much of an achievement.  The characters you'll come to either love or dislike , I however never got tired of Penulitimo's comments or Lord Oaksworth's trails.For the most part this game made me feel like I could actually achieve something by building a settlement and attempting to set it up right and in the most efficient way possible, something that Simcity 5 couldnt really achieve, or at least not very well.  While Simcity didnt do a terrible job at creating your own settlement, there were no actual problems or issues with money or power politically at all after completing your city, effectively making your only problem at that point the efficiency and placement of buildings, or the bugs inscripted in the game itself which rendered a problem unsolveable.Tropico 5 puts you in control of everything as the ''President For Life'', as a Roman ruler once said, for production of all goods and foods, public buildings, the army, and social and constitutional matters.  Stuff up and fail to get the support of your people, and your time as El Presidente could well be up with military coups, rebel attackers, major powers invading your island (if you get them really peeved), or an annoying combination of two of these issues, OR the simple fact the you should have cheated or cheated harder in the elections.  Simcity was lacking this redeeming feature of actually trying to hold onto power, and after a decade you were basically done in that city alone (even though the game controls said otherwise).I am a bit disappointed with the emptyness of multiplayer rooms and hearing that it had problems early on also didnt help its reputation either.  I'm also not happy with the news of a hacker who managed to figure out that for future DLC's, money will be required for most, if not all 10 future DLC's over the next year or so.  Most of the DLC's did nothing for Simcity, and actually didn't add much for the game except visual appeal, so I hope that these DLC's either aren't useless or will be free and useful at some point.Another complaint would be at the achievements.  Some seem too easy to get, while others might take along time to figure out and be able to complete.  Not as much of a biggie, but just something to keep in mind if DLC's factor into future achievements.The biggest complaint I would have however would be the seemingly inefficiency the infustructure buildings get by the modern era/age, seriously, it gets pretty annoying once you hit a population of 1000 and truck offices are everywhere and arent seemingly doing a lot.  I just dont get it, if you get stuffed over by this, then you could be stuck in negative bank numbers, and mostly the only way to solve a problem in this game is to throw money at it, and without exporting goods which seem to stock up in the production buildings being delivered to the docks (because the trucks aren't working for some reason), you've basically signed your defeat, and woe to you if its near an election or popularity is taking a hit and the people want change!If you brought Tropico 4, then its a question of if you want spend the money on this one, but from what I've seen its a great overhall of the old game which might only do a few things better (and possibly worse) than its elder.Overall, fantastic game, I would recommend to anyone interested in town planner games or political-type strategy with building elements, as while becomes harder to manage in the future ages, is actually rewarding in the end and might teach you some lessons along the way, if not the occassional laugh at Penultimo.This game I hope won't finish here, as the developers are capable of achieving much more and adding some more layers on this cake.The music is pretty cool also, wouldn't mind seeing some more music tracks in the future though!

Posted: June 4, 2014
												I'm completely gutted that Tropico 5 is such a terrible game. I've been a fan of the series who followed every release back to the original Tropico, and in the week leading up to the Tropico 5 release (of which I pre-ordered a 4-pack) I replayed Tropico 2 : Pirate's Cove through for about the 30th time. Old graphics, a few annoying design flaws, but even in 2014 still a spectacularly fun game, just like Tropico 1, Tropico 3, and Tropico 4... but not Tropico 5. For the first time in the history of the Tropico series we've got a new Tropico game released that is not only not a fun game, it isn't even a Tropico game. Packed with bad design decisions, content compromises, and maddeningly simplified with console limitations/mainstream stupidity in mind, for the first time in Tropican history we've got a game that can't be fixed with patches because the base game is so incredibly, irreparably broken. Tropico 5 is a corporate ""game-by-committee"" insult to each and every fan of both Poptop's original Tropico creation and Heinimont's mostly-faithful torch-bearing continuation of the series since then. It's a bad game, badly designed, falsely advertised, and will never become a proper Tropico game without a complete overhaul of every design mechanic of the strategy gameplay.Let's begin with the interface. Gone is the functional and useful interface we all know and love, with the traditional Tropico feel, intuitive layout, plenty of options, and helpful tooltip popups for every sub-menu or screen. The layout for Tropico 5 is much simpler, missing many important screens, with less information on every screen, and with almost no tooltip popups on any screen. Building upgrades no longer have any graphical representation, and the upgrades aren't located on the primary building screen, so you're forced to tediously check every single upgradeable building on your island with 2 mouse clicks on parts of the screen that are never near each other. This is unforgivably tedious and by itself makes the micromanagement of Tropico 5 unbearable beyond words, especially considering that buildings freshly built or destroyed in disasters revert to the default settings, necessitating constant micromanagement of every single building on the island.What about the lack of content? Tropico 5 advertises, even to date, ""Choose from over 100 buildings from each of the individual eras."" This is false advertising. Counting all the buildings up I can only come up with 91 total, and that includes every building from all the eras. Maybe campaign mode has a few unique buildings used only in the campaign, but I never saw any, and even then there's no way to get ""over 100 buildings from each of the individual eras."" I count 91 buildings in Tropico 5 and 117 in Tropico 4, so this is simply false advertising. No way around it. Furthermore, every Tropico fan who owns Tropico 5 will be quick to tell you why they lied about it: tons and tons of vital and important buildings and even building types are missing from Tropico 5. Take just one example: Prisons. In Tropico 4 you had Jail, Labor Camp, and you could turn the colonial fort into a dungeon for your personal dictatorship needs. Tropico 5 has no prisons or even a concept of jail. You cannot arrest anyone in Tropico 5. Crime is reduced to an overlay and a happiness number, and occasionally you see Crime Lord characters appear in the game that you can have a marginal interaction with. By marginal, I mean Bribe, Banish, Kill, or Discredit, the same 4 actions you have available for you to deal with every single island inhabitant in the game. To quote someone from the forum, ""How does El Presidente run a dictatorship without prisons?"" To heavily belabor this point, what about salt mines, fire stations, radio stations, wind power, solar power, and condos? ""How does El Presidente run an island paradise without condos?"" Why is there only one type of restaurant, ""Restaurant"", when Tropico 4 had ""Restaurant"", ""Gourmet Restaurant"", ""Ship-O-Rant"", and ""Cosmic Pin"", all of which were better rendered, described, and implemented?This brings me to the graphics of Tropico 5, the major selling point of the game, yet still underwhelming and poorly implemented. Tropico 5 requires DX11 for reasons that I can only describe as dishonest. It doesn't need DX11 or any of the hardware functions implemented therein, and the official excuse for the requirement, and I directly quote from the official Tropico 5 Steam forum, ""The game and engine were redesigned from scratch as was requested by many players"", simply does not hold water. Tropico 5 is coming to XBOX360 soon, an old console that is only DX9 slightly extended, and in such context the publisher/developer excuse can be clearly viewed as PR nonsense meant to cover up the fact that Tropico 5 is a functional disaster. The graphics aren't very good, there are only a few high end features added on near the end of the development cycle purely for marketing window dressing, and tessellation, if implemented, has been implemented so poorly that it renders the overall graphic package functionally of a lower quality than Tropico 4. HBAO/SSAO simply can't cover up bad design, and forcing the DX11 requirement on top of the substandard graphics is just insulting.The biggest success of the Tropico series was always in the gameplay, and the gameplay is where Tropico 5 fails the most spectacularly. To understand the level of failure you have to understand how previous Tropico games were successful. In Tropico 1/3/4 you started with a few people, a palace, a couple farms, maybe a tenement, and a blank slate to design a society. If you wanted a peasant serfdom that you ruled through fear of your military might you had many avenues through which to engineer this society, any the effectiveness of your approach was purely determined by how well you engineered your economy, balanced competing concerns, and reacted to changing circumstances. As one example, you could focus on mining, pay the miners/police/military high wages, and give the finger to everyone else, dominating and controlling their lives through fear, imprisonment, labor camps, many detailed and useful edicts, and even through pathing and placement of buildings (indeed, in Tropico 2 the latter is essential for accomplishing ANYTHING). Now what can you do? The budget tool replaces rent/wages/cost and a lot more, and since it only has 5 positions, you've got no subtlety to your economic engineering. Low means low EVERYTHING: rent, wages, maintenance cost, production output, housing quality, etc, etc, etc. Same for high, which functionally turns the budget 5-way into a Win/Lose slider.For all intents and purposes, Tropico 5 is not actually a Tropico game at all. Tropico was always a social engineering game, and in Tropico 5 you do not have the necessary tools to engineer your desired society... or ANY society. All you can do in Tropico 5 is build, react to popups, and set the 5-way Budget selector (the Win/Lose slider) to ""Win"" on every building that you build. It's really that simple, and there's no room to do much else. You could always set the Win/Lose slider to ""Lose"" I suppose. There's no way to win or lose creatively when there is not an underlying framework governing the simulation. Simcity 5 proved this very clearly, and Tropico 5 insists on following in those same pointless, infuriating footsteps. The fact that someone found 10 DLC confirmed titles listed in the launch config files says it all. Tropico 5 is a greedy, absolutely cynical cashgrab for mainstream/console gaming dollars and it throws away almost every good idea that brought the series this far. Spending 108 dollars to pre-order a 4-pack of this worthless game is a watershed moment in my 34-year-old life as a computer gamer. If you can't trust Tropico, who can you trust?			"

												A nice update from the previous titles in the series, this one new graphics and mechanics to make the experience new again. The campaign itself is very enjoyable as it takes place over several ages where you begin in the colonial time and progress to new periods as the campaign progresses.Some of the new mechanics involve the economy, as you can now select specific commodities to import and export, granting you the ability to buy low and sell high, while also allowing you to target industries you'd normally lack resources to develop. Other changes also include military buildings also producing different kings of military units (e.g., Army Bases result in 3 tanks per base), which makes military expansion more strategic compared to the previous interations.Also with this version is the inclusion of Online Multiplayer, which unfortunately, I have not been able to participate in.Should you buy?-----------------------------Very much so. This is a fun macro-oriented city builder that provides an enjoyable experience. If you are a person who is compelled to buy DLC, then I suggest waiting for sales or special editions that bundle all the DLC together. "

												Not a bad game, but I'm voting no for two reasons:1.) Vanillas Tropical 3 and 4 are both more substantive games. Had these not existed, this would be a thumb's up. As it stands, you'd get more for your money from either of those.2.) The incessant DLC. Don't get me wrong; I'm not against DLC. Make money for the devs, more content for us. But, for $4 apiece, you're getting a scenario, a costume, and one building. The costumes, for the most part, suck. The scenarios are okay for a one-off (though, generally speaking, sandbox is MUCH more entertaining). The buildings usually aren't substantive enough to stand on their own.Basically, if they bundled 2-3 of the DLCs and sold the bundles for $5, it'd be much more worthwhile.			"

												Tropico 5 is far inferior to its predecessor.Tropico 5 is not the worst game I ever played, but it has less charme and worse game mechanics than Tropico 3 and 4 (I spent over 100 hours in each of them). - Multiplayer seems to be badly implemented and boring, feels very much tacked on without much thought.- I played through the whole game within 21 hours, which is about one third of the time I spent in the main campaign of Tropico 4.- The new combat mechanics are terrible, you don't have any meaningful control over your units.- The characters and advisors and their voice actors are far inferior than in the predecessor.- Streets and cars are a complete mystery because there are no real gargages anymore. Everything just happens somehow.- The needs of people and factions are not pointed out anymore and you can't hold voting speeches anymore.- The humor is lacking when compared to Tropico 4.- You again need some extra DRM account to play the game.

												Game is a dumbed-down Tropico 4 with a frustrating campaign mode that uses an ill-defined dynasty system that allows no restarting of islands for the entireity of the campaign.  This is one of the worst city building experiences I've ever had.  Half of all of the overlays are gone.  From population density to job happiness, all gone.  If you want to place a house you now need to manually get out the beutification overlay before placing it.  This game feels like a console game, not a pc game.			"

												Only Tropico game that I've seriously disliked in the series.  Tropico 5 fails by effectively being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stripped-down iOS-tier ghost of it's predecessors.  Important gameplay and ui features are cut away, while the UI becomes more bloated and inefficient.  Familiar concepts that set the series apart from other city-builder sims -- like being able to customize your presidential faults and qualities, which makes the game more dynamic, gives the player a wide range of gameplay styles, additional challenges and creates greater replay value -- have been removed or cut down to a micron of thier former strength.The new concepts that are introduced (like FoW) are inconsistent with the genre, hindering that intrinsic creative value of city building.  The islands tend to be much smaller (in both campaign and sandbox) compared to the rest of the series.  The scale of buildings tend to feel bloated and awkward with few effective placeable locations.  Many of the 'new' elements are just disappointing replacements for previous staples, like cocoa being introduced but papayas being removed.  Dammit, I loved papayas...In addition to the cumulative restrictive effect of these changes, the game tends to play carrot-and-a-stick with what little choice you have left.  The campaign (and even sandbox mode) essentially constantly micro-manages the player, which is an unpleasant if not ironic twist on gaming.  At times this is mandatory and oppressive, others it's simply and option one can choose to ignore -- however there is no benefit to attempting to do things your own way.  The player is basically caged in and asked to perform specific meanial tricks.The UX is terrible and easily the worst-in-series.  I honestly felt that the Tropico 2 interface was cleaner, more usable and more efficient.  The Pop up build menu, which is ugly, bulky, and poorly laid out, interferes with with your world viewport inevitably blocking whatever it is you were trying to work on.  The overall design seems to be trying to accommodate touch interfaces, which in traditional iOS fashion means that your have to sacrifice detail and control for huge UI elements.  We've lost 2 degrees of speed control in Tropico 5.  The Overlay's have been turned into the ♥♥♥♥ing ugliest rainbow wire-grid that I've ever seen -- It's almost completely unusable.  The PiP viewport becomes annoying after 30 minutes, and takes up too much screen space as a non-interactive element.  All of the ui changes leave the player with less control and a more cluttered screen.  Useful elements like faction leader notices have been removed, as well as monthly/annual reports (like starvation and deaths from poor healthcare).  Mind you the game still internally wants you to build a new church, or improve healthcare, but you will be left in the dark to guess as to what the social problems are.3/10.  Do not buy. "

												Would I recommend this game? To anyone? Even my most hated enemies? No. That's the answer to all of the preceeding questions. Why, you ask? Now that's an answer that's more elaborate.Tropico is fun, don't get me wrong, but the fun you have with Tropico is the kinda fun you have while drunk or stoned. The kinda fun you have looking at a picture of a badger. It's not fun by sober standards, but when you're smoked outta your skull, it's hilarious.What I'm getting at here is that you pretty much need to be smashed or high to find Tropico thoroughly enjoyable. Unlike actually GOOD city-builder games, like SimCity 4, Cities: Skylines or hell, even Banished, you have ZERO control over ANYTHING in Tropico. You can build stuff. Whoop-dee-♥♥♥♥♥ety-doo. That is IT. That's ALL you get to do in Tropico.Enemies invading your turf? Your soldiers'll take care of that automatically. Built a new cluster of nice mansions and want to keep your elite soldiers away from living in them? Sorry, schmuck, but you can't do that. Want to make sure that your precious and EXTREMELY FINITE iron makes it to your weapons factories instead-a just getting exported for a shïte sum of pennies and dimes? BZZT! Wrong answer! You're not allowed to suspend exports either.Simply put, you can't control ANYTHING in Tropico, and that INEVITABLY leads to disastrous results. Maybe not this month, maybe not this year, but eventually, you'll run out of iron for your weapons factories or crude oil for your refineries, and your high-end exportation will come to a grinding halt because you simply can't tell your ♥♥♥♥♥twäts of a population to göddämn STOP SELLING SHÏT FOR TINY SUMS OF CASH.Ironically, many people laud this game for its simplicity. Those people are idiots. A city-building game should NEVER, EVER, sacrifice control for ease-of-use. Cities: Skylines is a good example of how to strike a decent-enough balance between simple-to-play without shaving off player control to an absolute minimum.So, to summarize: would I recommend this game? No. I would not. It's not worth even one FRACTION of the asking price on Steam, and the DLC-whöring? Yeah, no, that shït's not gonna fly with me. Simply put, this game series peaked with #4, and it rapidly went downhill with #5. It's not worth buying, not even for 0.99, and it's barely worth playing at all. Avoid it. 2.3/10			"

												The layout and changes to the game are somewhat uncomforting, I felt like they had a good base to work with in Tropico 4, and they seemed to remove alot of the features from that one or change how you interacted with them. Everything feels hollow, finding information is unclear or very basic. Could not control my avatar anymore either. Some of the tourists voice acting is HORRIBLE, esp males. I can not recommend this game in it's current state. I'd stick to Tropico 4 for now.I do like the constition options, and the research tree, everything just needs to be more fleshed out and given more personality.

												I have played Tropico since the first. I have lost many hours in the previous games of this series. It was my all time favorite game. I pre-ordered this one when I heard about it and was so excited. I have to say it was the hugest disappointment in all my gaming years. I tried to love it and just could not.. and this was my TROPICO!The base game lacks content seen in earlier versions, the voices of the characters in game are annoying and not funny, the music is absolutely boring and repetitive, and the devs of this game were snarky and rude to those of us that didn't think this was the next best thing to slice bread (forgive the slang).The game is broken with some pretty serious glitches such as trade, vechiles getting stuck, shacks everywhere even dirtying up the beautification, the battles are seriously stupid with issues added to it. The base game is overpriced for what you get and the dlc is extremely over priced for what they give.As a long time fan of this series and it being my favorite game of all time I would say don't buy it or wait until it is in the steam dollar bin.Do not go by the ratings, all gamers know ratings are more lies than truth when comes to certain sites.I would rate this game as a 1 out of ten and that is being generous.

												imagine having to repeat senior year in high school depite all A's, honor roll, and graduating... in this case from the prior gem, version 4.  This version is the exact same thing without the fun.  too many ways to trap yourself down the timeline on a prior bad, usually just ignorant, building decision.  so where in 4 i didnt mind occasionally restarting or going back to an autosave realizing i could fix something, in this version its all the time.  you could blame me, sure... but having done 4 a couple of times and all the wonderful user maps downloads - this game has no fun to it any more...dont buy any Tropico game until the next release comes out.  as they correct and complete the game it will be called DLC.  so anyone whom buys the first release is buying 70% of the game, then over the  next 12 months the close to 30% full game gets distributed.  i loved Tropico 4 because i bought it late and in an on sale complete DLC and game package.   if 5 has any chance then wait for that same disty type.  Buy 4 over this version regardless, if its about fun and your human time... they are going to have to kill this series and reboot the franchise to avoid the 'same old same old' - after this review i am uninstalling version 5 and reinstalling version 4 just thinking about it.

												EDIT 1: I managed to get a somewhat speedy reply on a few of the issues I posted about in the game's official forum. Overall I am quite satisfied with Kalypso's course of action.Tropico 5 is a good game as far as difficulty and presentation goes.Right off the bat I noticed that the game runs better than the previous game on the same machine I played it on. There were times when I crashed due to large invasions but for the most part, the game has function well for about 95% of the time.The Modern Times DLC in Tropico 4 was somewhat of an introduction to the multi-era gameplay in Tropico 5. I like this as it makes the game a bit more dynamic. Prices adjust depending on the Era and available technologies, alliances, and political powers differ as well. All in all the multi-era feature is a great addition to the game.Combat in the game seems a bit lacking. I understand that combat is not the main feature of the game but if you plan to run a totalitarian state then you'd best expect to see lots of it. On addition to that, your dynasty members play a passive role during invasions, uprisings, and rebellions (in the form of global effects or manager effects). This seems a bit strange to me especially since some of them can be Tacticians or Generals. I've also had trouble figuring out how to get the rebels to attack my Palace while maintaining a strong Military. It's not like Tropico 4 wherein I can set up an elaborate trap in certain structures or have my own avatar tip the scales of battle in an evenly (numerically) matched battle.As of now I am 60-40 on this game. It still requires a lot of polish but at the same time, I did enjoy it enough to play it to near-completion. If there was a neutral button then I'd select it. For now, I'll wait for that polish to be applied.			"

												Tropico 5 probably introduces the most new gameplay mechanics out of the franchise. It certainly is not just like 4 (which in turn was just like 3). The idea of advancing with a tech tree (of sorts) is an interesting change while a consistantly changing global environment can often catch you by suprise if you get complacent. Unlike previous Tropico games, putting all your eggs in one basket will be your undoing. I have also noticed that while in older instalments I could win ellections with ease, each election can often leave me with a nail biting victory (or twice so far defeat). So I would recommend reducing the difficulty when you first play as Tropicans in 5 will rebel almost 3 times as often as those in tropico 4 with the modifier Rebel yell on.This Game still still retains the political satire and puns of the previous Instalments and on the odd occasion has made me laugh. It does how ever have a few flaws such as; a lack of customisation for EL presedente and his Dynasty (i feel like tropico 4 had more customisation options), the more clunky almanac (i much prefer the tropico 4 almanac) and the fact that you are only warned about a faction not being satisfied when they protest (often leaving you with little time to rectify the problem before some become rebels or you lose an election).

It seems like this game tries to be more realistic but doesn't necesarrily do it well. I found it grinding to even complete the most simple missions and story missions seem cliche.

												Being a huge fan of the Tropico series, I was itching to get Tropico 5.  When  it came on sale, I pounced on the chance to get it.What to make of this release of the game....There is a large improvement graphics wise, with the islands and the buildings looking really good.  What is sad is that a lot of the building animations was somehow ""cut"" from the game. In Tropico 4 if you upgrade any of the buildings with skylights or aircons you could see the building changing with these add-ons.  Animations in the pubs and restaurants was also much better in T4, you could see people entering the building and sitting at the tables.  Largely there are no such small detailed animations on buildings in T5.There is really a lot to do in the game.  I like the improved economics system, where you can set up trade routes with better pricing for some of your resources and goods.  There is also now a constitution where you can set the type of community that you build.  This is also one of the things that you cannot really see the changes easily, eg. One of the viewable difference is when you select professional military.  Doing that I had all my soldiers abandon their posts in exchange for soldiers with High School training.The introduction of a timeperiod type of system is nice, but it can at times be a pain especially early in the game.  Especially when you have to please the king with a lot of stuff just so that your reign could be extended for another couple of months.  As soon as you get past this era your are back to elections and keeping your people happy.  Some of the buildings also change according to the timeperiod eg. The docks change the crane and the type of ships that dock.Another annoying feature in the game is the building/people cards.  In Tropico 4, you could see all the information of the building on the card, even the people visiting the buidling.  The people cards had detailed info on what they needed as well as the tourist cards.  This information is lacking in Tropico 5, sadly...  The campaign part of the game is a 50/50 parcel.  You only play over 2 islands during the campaign.  Each of the missions build on the previous one.  So if you build up a good economy on your island in the previous mission you will carry over that advantage for the next mission in the campaign.  BUT....  You only get to play that island for one mission!!  Beware if you do not spend enough time in building a good economy on both of your islands!!!  You then have to select the poor island for a troublesome mission and it will see you failing that mission over and over.  I ran into that problem to the point of rage quiting in the end.  Having given the multiplayer a try, I can hardly say anything about it.  Still trying to get a game to play with someone else, where the game does not quit because of different versions of the game.  Will have to try it again at some point.So what is the verdict??   This is a nice looking game, with some nice changes, but I think Kalypso where not quit sure if their were trying to follow the Anno type games or trying to create a different Tropico.  For me Tropico 4 is a way better island gaming experience than Tropico 5.  So if you have never played any of the Tropico franchise and you get this in the bargain bin, give it a try.  If you love the Tropico series, rather stay with Tropico 4.Special note to the dev's:  I would love to see a new Tropico Pirates Cove, please!!!  Had endless fun with that one!! "

												I have logged about 20 hours of gameplay so far and upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars. I got this on steam so I was able to download it on May 23. This is very different from the previous Tropicos. The difference between tropic 3 and tropic 4 was a few more buildings, but overall was the same game. Tropico 5 looks and feels completely different. You will find this game much harder and challenging on campaign mode but now has difficulty settings. There are many new building and upgrades as well. Multiplayer is still not up but I will update this review when this mode is working as it seems like it will be fun. I have played many hours of tropico 3 and tropico 4 so I am very familiar with the series. They released patch 1.02 on June 9th, which fixed numerous issues with both multiplayer and single player.Pros-Graphics are updated and is much smoother than previous tropicos.-The trading system has been overhauled and you now have a guaranteed trade ship every six months. You now also have an additional ship that you can use to trade a certain commodity at above default rate of the computer generated trade ship. Also the ships will change every so many years and look like a ship of that time period.-You no longer have to build a separate tourist dock. All tourist ships use the same dock as what is given to you at the start of the game.-You can now hire a manager for each building. Each manager with have certain bonuses they bring such as better efficiency or better job quality.-Each place where tropicans work will display what income level they will be at. For example a dock worker or a farmer will be a poor tropican, but you can increase their pay to make them well-off. The housing will tell you how it corresponds to their income level. A tenement will suit a poor worker but a house requires their income to be well-off. This also applies to the restaurants and pubs, which serve the poor tropicans whereas opera houses and casinos appeal more to the rich tropicans/tourists. This is much more detailed than previous tropicos.-There is now a constitution that will have selections such as for the labor market-all citizens 16 and older must work, child labor, or work if you want; each with its own pros and cons.-Many new buildings including cotton and cocoa plantations. You can now build a textile mill and use the cotton you grow to make tshirts. You can now mine uranium and coal and either sell it or use it for power plants. There is now a library which is used to research buildings and upgrades per era.-The construction priorities feel like they work much better than previous tropicos.-The dock now shows exactly what you are exporting and the money you will generate with each item. For example: Corn-$3000-You can now have a population well over the 650 person cap in the previous tropicos. (I currently have a population of 800 on one island and it is not even that built up, there is even one mission where I have to have over 900 people.) The low population cap in tropic 3 and 4 really limited how much you could expand and grow your island because you would not have enough workers to fill positions for every building later in the game, especially when you threw tourists in the mix.-Plantations now have plots of dedicated land that crops will be planted on. This is much better than previous tropicos where farmers would just plant crops in random places around the farm.-I like that in the campaign, as you move to the next mission, you continue on the same island with everything you already built and expand upon it.Cons-The overlays no longer include a map of minerals, instead you have to explore the undiscovered portions of the island to find mines. You now have to pay an expedition $1000 to explore differnt parts of the island and can get expensive. Also mines are only located by hills or cliffs now. You start out only seeing about 1/10 of the island and the rest is fog. I find it kind of annoying that as you build you city and reach the edge of what you can see of the island, the fog doesn't clear. You still have to send an expedition, even its across a busy street.-You can no longer build factories until you hit a certain era.-When trying to place a farm, the crop condition map is not as easy to read as it the square tiles are now outlined in a green, yellow, or red border, not a full green or red square. I personally found it harder to distiguish the yellow and green conditions of the map.-In the campaign you only have a certain number of years to rule, known as mandates, and if you cant complete the level in time you lose. More challenging though.-You have to wait to get most of the upgrades for factories till certain eras.-You cant set wages for all farms or mines anymore (Fixed in patch 1.02). You can only set the sames wages for specific farms or mines such as all gold mines or all corn farms.-The game will pause and go to a loading screen when it autosaves for about 5 seconds. This is just kind of annoying when playing, I hope they can patch this issue.Overall, this game is more fun and challenging than tropico 3 or 4 in my opinion. I bet with a few updates some of the cons I listed will make this game much more fun and enjoyable. I was use to just building up my island at my leisure and building up money to purchase better buildings but tropico 5 is not like that anymore. This version requires patience and a see what this does approach in the campaign. I really like that aspect as it has created a much higher replay value. And this is like most game downloads from amazon, it will be on steam. This has been the case for many years now so don't be shocked. (And it says DRM-steam). I will update after more gameplay.			"

												A great, fun, member of an excellent series of city/island building games.So far I've only played the main campaign and 1 of the DLC campaigns, but I've definitely had a good experience working my way from a primitive island to a thriving carribean metropolis. Very happy with my purchase.It's a great citybuilder, and unlike a lot of games I've played, it manages the eras well, so you definitely get an island that you have to build up.			"

												This game is immersive and exciting from the moment you start. Every detail is thought through, and the game manages to keep you on your toes and interested as it progresses through such a long time period. You start in the Colonial Era, which gives you the building blocks on which your city will later stand. You then progress to the WW Era, where you are confronted with a new task of keeping up relations with the Allies and the Axis, or to avoid diplomacy and go down the route of a dictatorship! The next is perhaps the biggest transition, from the WW Era to the Cold War. You are, again, confronted with the two powers of USA and USSR. You experience new cultures such as tourism, industrialism and many more new features. You then move on to Modern Times, where you are put in the 'sandbox' mode and are left to enjoy the rest of the game!Another great thing are the characters! You get Penultimo and Lord Oaksworth mostly, whos speeches are always a welcome surprise. They give you quests and tips, and notify you when anything happens. There are many more as you progress, each with their own distinct voice and interesting script.I give this game 9/10!			"

												This game is just Tropico 4 with all the fun stuff removed.-The player must micromanage imports for every secondary industry they do not possess raw materials for, making an industrialized secondary economy all but impractical. Enjoy seeing the insufficient resources placard popping up everywhere, despite active trade imports for that resource.-There is no satisfying cheap housing solution like the Bunkhouse from Trop4, this is minor but it really gets to me while playing. I used to really enjoy cranking up the livability of bottom shelf housing with beauty, liberty, and crime safety. This one thing takes a lot of fun out for no reason.-The budgeting makes no sense, the ledgers won't show you where you're losing money and include your construction costs which muddies the waters in trying to figure out what the hell is costing you so much money. Enjoy clicking through every building to see what the thing in the red is.			"

												I was waiting for this game since January this year. I was expecting it to have everything from Tropico 4 (because there was almost nothing to critize), but what I received was just a poor version of Sim City. The charme of Tropic was the close interaction and connection to its citizens: the naming of the people, their origin, the education, the family tree, all their personal information. That's all lost in T5.Another thing: the colonial era has no date, only stressful mandate. The selection of buildings is very poor. Then in the WW ear, the game suggests you to advance into the cold war in the early 30s, which has no historical accuracy. Not to mention the following eras. Basically, the game should just start in 1850 and continue from then on.Kalypso promised a lot of things, which I could not find. Also, the dynasty system is boring, to say the least. I was expecting that I could marry and start a real family, instead of these random and usless additions to my ""family"".The research of new technologies is annoying and extremely long.I could continue this list, but I', going to play Tropico 4 now. Would advise the same to all of you. Save the money for something else.			"

												Maybe it's because I was spoiled by its predecessor (which you can't help but compare it to), but I found Tropico 5 very disappointing. The first thing you notice - right off the bat - is it lacks the charm and personality of the Tropico series. While Penultimo returns as hilarious as ever, all your old friends like Reverend Esteban, El Diablo and the Mighty Chinese Dragon (who's hungry for your goods) are conspicuously absent. As such, factions and foreign powers feel like numbers on a page instead of personalities.The campaign is way too short with way too little variety. You can grind through it (fairly effortlessly) in a few days, during which you'll get to play on four islands. That's right. FOUR islands. Two of which are basically the same. As for the running of Tropico, in pandering to the needs of the crown, the people and the powers that be, you get the feeling of being a thankless civil servant rather than being a power-mad dictator in love with his own reflection, as was the case in Tropico 4.While the implementation of Dynasties was a great idea - in theory - it was lacking in execution. Instead of three traits, now you only get one per Dynasty member. And a grand total of about four or five costumes. Thinking about sending el Presidente to a construction site to speed things up, or a building to boost service? Think again, as the option to do so is gone.On the positive side, it *looks* nice. But as it's a Tropico game (and not a super-realistic bro-shooter), it doesn't really need to. If anything, the mandatory DX11 requirements have screwed a lot of people out of playing it in the first place. I'll have to double check, but I could swear the background music (with a couple of exceptions) is the same re-heated soundtrack from Tropico 4. Come on, folks. There's a wealth of Calypso/Carribean/Latin music to choose from. Get a LITTLE creative!In summary, I REALLY wanted to like this game. I really did. Tropico 4 is still one of my favourite games of all time. It's sad to see what could have been an amazing game not fully realised and ideas not fully explored. Until such time as there's adequate DLC (I have no doubt they'll churn it out piece by piece in $5 increments) to give it a little variety and scope, I can't really recommend it. Go play Tropico 4. It's still a damn good game if you want to indulge your inner megalomaniac.P.S. As if it weren't bad enough you can't build a giant golden statue of yourself any more, you can't build ANY statues. How the hell are you supposed to feel like a tyrant if you can't remake Tropico in your likeness?			"

												In it's current release state, I'm hard pressed to recommend this to anyone in regards to fans of the series or as a general interest to city and econ simulation et al. Without delving into past Tropicos too much, these title pretty much abolished everything decent that was good about the past games and while I wanted to strive to figure out the best way to win and be efficient in Tropico 3 and 4, I find myself logging off in frustration a lot with the fifth installment.Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of good and a ton of potential for future DLC's (hate to think that maybe this was a focal point, but it's quickly becoming industry standard). Unfortunately, the bad and the outright annoying is so prevalent that the whole experience gets ruined pretty quickly.Rebels often seem to rebel without any reason. Protests are totally arbitrary and ""negotiating"" with protestors oftentimes has you build or create something to contend with one of the few problems you're probably not having. Construction costs are astronomical. Power plants are very confusing and either buildings need a ton of electricity to run and maintain optimum efficiency, or the power plant itself is severly inefficient given the amount of cost to build and maintain them.Healthcare, schools, and entertainment are a beast of their own. While a single newspaper or television seems more than enough to land me at sufficient levels for happiness, I'm finding that multiple buildings that should have the same effect as a liberty increasing building in a different capacity don't actually do anything, or the difference is so minute that I couldn't even tell.These things all strike me as bugs, but with the lack of feedback from the developer it's hard to maintain that allusion forever. Essentially, I'm trying to save you money. Even if you're dying to play this, or something has piqued your interest, just wait it out. Eventually I think most of the issues will be fleshed out, but, for all intents and purposes, buying this is equivalent to something that only works some of the time.			"

												This game seems to run a great deal smoother than Tropico 4, in fact I'd say it's as smooth as the island rum I make the peasants distill for me which I've given the distinguished name of ""Mein Führerious Alkohol"".It is indeed a great deal of fun making decisions to see how close to a Caribbean 1984 you can make your island, I can truly see why our real-world leaders are constantly making choices to bring us closer to that reality. The revamped military is also worth mentioning, rather then turning their rifles on the more... vocal Tropicans, there are actual enemy armies to engage from time to time. The other notable addition is multiplayer. It's a fairly well done implementation, though likely won't be the main focus of most players. Perhaps this game can best be summed up by a saying from the great Sun Tzu, ""Blame it on the goose/ got me feeling loose/ blame it on patron/ got me in the zone/ blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol.""

												On it's own, Tropico 5 may be a B/C rated game. It has all the basics needed, building up a tropical island and a single bizzare campaign. But it's really impossible to play this without comparing it to its immediate, and fare more affordable, predecessor. Tropico 5 adds multiplayer, does improve some design and planning apsects, but strips out much of the micromanagement, a large number of building, avatar customization, a tremendous amount of detail, and nearly all the wit.  For example, instead of the corrupt political humor oozing out of the previous Tropico games, we get an endless stream of toilet humor and bad sexual innuendo with the most annoying 'host' that Kalypso could apparently find.The list of things missing is staggering, and it's very clear that this game was designed for a long run of DLCs just to get us back to what Tropico 4 had to begin with. The game feels, and is, a massive step backward for the franchise. Multiplayer may be a saving grace, but empire builders don't tend to like multiplayer all that much to begin with, so...In all honesty, I do regret spending any money on this game, and it's the first time I felt that way about Tropico. Excuse me as I go back to the much superior Tropico 4.			"

												I love the Tropico series *very* much, but I just can't get excited for this one. It feels much more like a run of the mill city builder game, they changed a lot of the voice actors for the main characters, they brought back the annoying radio host idea, and a whole smattering of other poor design choices. The jokes fall flat for the most part, and a lot of control has been taken from the player, and a lot of the smaller details that used to make the series great are missing. Where that's been removed, however, needless complexity has been added. Now you need a library to research technology- yep, a tech tree. Military affairs are much more integral and like many, many other terrible city sim games, it too is bland.  You are supposed to appoint managers to your buildings- but why should I waste my time flipping through all the potential managers to try to find the one that actually fits, only to get a 10 point effectiveness boost?  And if you have a plantation colony, say, you always end up with a bunch of managers for things like tourism or landscaping or speed-cubing or whatever else. I played for a few hours and lost interest. Your island is consistent across missions, which is cool, but you'd best hope your crystal ball is accurate. One mission starts with you being invaded, so I certainly hope you thought to build multiple forts and towers. Overall, it just feels like a shadow of the 4th game in the series. The 4th game, with the modern times expansion, offers a much more entertaining, satisfying game, and you can probably grab it for a small fraction of the price.			"

												Short Version: Tropico is a great game. I fully recommend it. Long Version: I joined the series with Tropico 4, which is very similar to this fifth installment, but much easier, so if you have the money, paying for the most modern, challenging one is your best bet. The game is simple in paper: Become Royal Governor of a British Colony, declare independence, and build your small nation throughout history. The 4 eras (Colonial, World Wars, Cold War, and Modern) will force you to change your play style all the time, and the new constitution allows you to replay as a different kind of Presidente (Pro Tip: Try being democratic. You won't get to publicly execute journalists or pesky protestors for ""violations of human rights"" (whatever that means...), but it will make it more challenging). Also, live each era to its fullest, so you can plan ahead. Your nation might be bustling with trade with your preffered superpower in the Cold War, but once the Soviets fall, you better adapt your commercial strategy quickly, or else you'll go back to being a third world hell-hole faster that you can say ""WHY DON'T YOU BUY MY CRAP ANYMORE?"". Hell, maybe I am just bad at strategy games (I am not. Dare you to a round of Civ V if you don't believe me), but the game is challenging for me on easy, as your need to change strategies will ♥♥♥♥ you up bad unless you plannes ahead for 5 years or so (5 year plan? Get it? 'Cause communist dictatorship is an option?). People are much harder to please, especially because the Constitution may divide them (the religious might favor you for all the churches you gave them, but half may hate you for not being a theocracy). The era specific random events (""The Soviets have asked us to stash some humanitarian aid that 'has been nowhere near Cuba'"" (later) ""GOOD GOD! THEY WERE NUKES! WHAT DO WE DO? A) Keep them B) GIve them to the USA C) Hide them, return them to the USSR when possible."" This allows you to ideologically ally with one, while maintaining peace with the other superpower), various play styles (Constitution options) and development plans (Will Tropico be an industrial nation? A farming paradise (Thank Presidente for the 'buy organic craze!')? A vacational hotspot?) will give you countless replay options and entertainment.P.S. The Nazis invaded once, and our armies destroyed each other. One Panzer with a smoking engine survived. It killed me. 100/10			"

												This game offers all that it proclaims on the store page. You have lots of mircomanagement taking care of your peoples needs, making sure you have popular support to win elections, keep eye on other countries and not be invaded, trade with other countries for profit. About every little thing counts in this game including factions within your population, riots, rebellion and protests will be common and will threaten your regime unless you take action and listen to your peoples needs, This game was never really intended for miltary combat, but it is awesome seeing your tanks slowly apporach your infantry who are getting slaughtered and overhead jets blast away at your own buildings setting them on fire. 8/10			"

												Tropico 5....i've waited to get it for some time, i was a huge fan of Tropico 4, sunk a lot of time into it, but i felt the time line was WAY to constircting which is why i LOVE Tropico 5. the Eras system is great, being able to build up as a colony, then declare your indepence and get involved in the World Wars, surive the Cold War etc... while many say the 'humor is gone' i find the humor to be...better! of course, some of the things they took out were good, but they added in enough to make this better than Tropico 4, (even more so with the improved combat) -Humor 8/10-Managment options 7/10-graphics 8/10-Gameplay9/10-overall 8.5/9.99			"

												Viva la Presidente!While searching through the library records we have found that use of the 'review' system will draw more people to our island. The research team and I think that if enough realise that this is the place to be then we will be a success. Task: Write a Review on Tropico 5Reward: Faster updates please?This game is brilliance and a return to form for the Tropico series. My only gripe is the multiplayer system, a new feature  I hope for future modificiations to make this work. Multiplayer is slightly unstable and often crashes out and with no save feature the losses can be very disheartening. However, the game itself is rock solid and beautifully done. For those that like to govern cities and would like the real challenge of people that just don't act sensibly (like real people then) this is perfect. Each individual on your island, and I mean each individual effects the scores. Heaven help you if you♥♥♥♥♥♥off enough of them. You may not quite have enough cake.			"

												I like this installment of the franchise. It abstracts away some of the messier elements (like garages, which always felt wonky to me). Build times seem better as well, which means less waiting. The research, eras, and manager system are nice bits of change :o) It doesn't really feel like a new game, but rather a refinement of 4. I give it a thumbs-up.Overall, it still feels like Tropico, just a slightly prettier, faster-playing one.			"

												I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys its style of gameplay. While there may be some glitches or features which people disagree with, I believe that they are worth overlooking simply for the enjoyment of being a dictator and having to build a country against real issues. I am not a fan of being overly critical of games, and if a game gives me the slightest bit of enjoyment, then I think it is worthwhile, and I can definitely say that this game has been enjoyable to me so far. The developers created a great game, and it is a shame that some people cannot look past small mistakes or glitches. There is a massive distinction between degrading complaint and constructive criticism.			"

												This is MUCH harder than Tropico 4 and I love that fact! However, the mind♥♥♥♥ for me is I will have a 84% approval but still get rebels and even rebel attacks. My favorite feature of this game is the fact you play in multiple time periods and also you can repeal invasions unlike in Tropico 4 were you have to please either both powers, get the nuclear program, or ally with one of them. Another thing is after playing multiplayer for a bit, the game seems to lag for me. Not as in the jerky lag but a lag were if I ordered my soldiers to attack lets say the Green faction, I dont see my men deploy for awhile but on their side they see the attack. Infact, this even prohibits me building even further as I wont see any change on my screen until possibly a full five minutes have passed by even though I can still scroll around the map. Also there is one major feature I miss and thats the Tropico First option on immigration. My reason being is even if you have the safe haven option, you still can get a ship with 20 new immigrants. However another issue I have encountered is the logic of some civilians. For example if they are married and both earn a poor wage (using my tropico 4 logic) I would assume their accumulated income would make them a ""well off"" family thus permitting them to live in a well off house. Boy was I wrong...They only live in a poor house thus promting me to have to lower the budget for housing thus making me loose money from not getting good rent profits. The biggest complaint I have though probably is how quickly you can get over populated. For example if you start off in the colonial era with 50 people, if taking your time you can easily get 200 people, and then possibly 400 by the time you entered the World Wars era. The most I have had was 790 people living on my Island and that was just by the Cold War era. With this its easy to loose track of how many houses you need to build, entertainment, healthcare, and hell sometimes your forced to build a entirely new city on the Island just because you've ran out of room in your first original city. With another concern on multiplayer is the lack of the ability to support another player when attack by pirates or even the Crown. With this the only way you can support them is attacking the player who's attacking them. Also to add in further is the common understanding of ""If you place a parkinglot/garage here. Everyone who is traveling will go to that and take a car"" however in this game, if you place a parking lot right where everyone lives, only a few will think ""Hey...I gotta travel right into the center of the Island for my job. I think I ought to take a car..."" instead of the norm of spending five months to get to the farm they work at, then spend another five months walking back home. By the time you get the metro tunnels, people dont consider that if there's a metro tunnel RIGHT next to their house and there's a metro tunnel RIGHT where they need to work, that they should use it. It is the most frustrating thing when you see that your money is getting wasted on transportation because people simply refuse to drive or even take the metro! Overall the game is great but once you start seeing how these people work at times it can get tiresome. A great example is you can have a good five empty houses for the poor and have enough poor people to house them but refuse to abandon their shacks.			"

												Tropico is a series of city builders lite where you are also a dictator (a pirate lord in 2) who has to stay in power while trying to build his little heaven (or hell) on Earth.And whereas Tropico 4 was just a Tropico 3 with more stuff - Tropico 5 has many features changed, reworked, added (and some cut) to warrant being called a proper sequel. Oh and it also has MUCH more stuff to do.With changes in economy and many product chains and raw resources added compared to the previous game - it may take a few failures to wrap your head around the way things work.Your tropical dictator paradise can now also have sharper teeth with more offensive stuff to beat down rebels and invaders with (although with changes in faction system the rebellions happen a lot more often for my taste).All other categories of things to build and create are expanded as well, coming with a lot more comfortable interface.As usual Sandbox mode is where the real game's at. And now it doesn't have time limits, albeit the generator is unfortunately simplified.Instead the time frame takes you through four eras starting with colonial one where you are just a mere local manager of the king - you have to use crown's cash to kickstart your playground which you also have to make independent before your term's over. Don't worry it can be extended by doing missions (later on they give you much more varied rewards).Of course if you don't want to bother with the colonial era (with it being quite different from the rest of the game, but I personally like it) - you can pick any other era to begin your game in.I recommend it both to newcomers and previous Tropico players alike.

												I say ""yes"" because there is no ""maybe"" button. I'd recommend this as a great entry point to the series for new players, and veterans of the series may very well enjoy it too. For one thing, building farms is much easier due to them being zoned out and planned instead of farmers just throwing fields down willy-nilly after construction is done.But I personally, coming from Tropico 4, don't enjoy some design decisions made with this game. For one thing, having to explore the island is tedious to me, and I don't really like the Era system much. I don't like that you can't have your Presidente walk around visiting buildings to improve their production. I also dislike the problem with genders and working. See, the game is based mostly in past points in time, but this game fails to reflect that in jobs. Women can do manual labor, and men can and do work as strippers long before they would have been allowed in those positions by their society.TL;DR I don't like some choices the devs made, but it's still a well-made game.

												First off ""Glory to El Presidente our glorious ruler and benevolent overlord"". Right the KGB agent is gone I can begin reviewing this game truthfully.  It's a very fun little city management game that puts you through the ages trying to expand and grow your little island nation to take on enemy invasions and prove your supremacy and the genius that is El Presidente. The game mechanics work fairly well and the overall game play is  very enjoyable for the first 40 or so hours while you get used to it. Personally I think I'm just not creative enough to make a good and beautiful city. If you're looking for an arcade-like fun city management game then Tropico 5 is just that. If you want something a little bigger and more realistic city planning then City Skylines would be a better choice.

Tropico 5 is not quite as good of a Tropico game as it's predecessors, however, it is a better city-builder. Tropico still maintains much of it's comedy and charm but, unfortunately, something feels like it is missing since Tropico 4.The new interface leaves much to be desired as much of the information that El Presidente's are used to is now either buried or missing. Want to know which buildings are profitable and full? Too bad. Want to know where the oil is? Use a magnifying glass! The lack of a Tropico 4 style interface leaves much to be desired and makes it difficult to get the information you need.It also seems that with the addition of the new interface we've also lost the fun faction interaction that we've come to expect. They do still exist but they've essentially taken a back seat to everything and are much harder to find with much fewer missions.The addition of the new dynasty system is pretty cool. Your new family members offer you some nice bonuses, more benefits, and you can use them as new 'managers' which help you run buildings better. You can even send them on fun little missions and storyline quests for more bonuses. However, with the addition of these new folks you also lose direct control of El Presidente himself. You can no longer tell him where to go, who to visit, and what store to promote. I used to LOVE that feature from Tropico 4 and it helped pass the time and improve production. Now all El Presidente does is wonder around like an NPC. Furthermore, you also have a lot less options in character creation when it comes to El Presidente and can no longer pick from a vast number of backgrounds, histories, bonuses, and penalties; now you pick ONE bonus and that's it.As I said, Tropico 5 is likely the best city builder of the series. The addition of the new grid or city layout system makes placing and organizing structures MUCH easier. Due to the new era system you also have building that grow and change as time passes. Farms, for example, get nice upgrades and then can be transformed into Hydroponic Farms which are much smaller and more efficient.Overall, I have been enjoying Tropico as a good city builder but I often miss the micromanagement, humor, and the style of Tropico 4. Everyone expects at least a dozen DLCs (ten confirmed so far) and I hope that future patches improve Tropico 5 back up to Tropico 4's level.			"

												Money grap simulator 5. Initial impression:Long loading screens on high end pc. Gfx looks dated and dull.Stale humor (Its really bad this time around, Penultimo no more :( )The game is now easyer then ever. Everyting is sped up. Teamsters on foot are like olympic sprinters.Exploration system is mindnumbingly stupid.The interface is worse, in my opinion. Its bare bone. Ex, there issnt information on what your constrution office is working on.Soundtrack issnt that good.The dynasty feature seem like a good idea, but the customazation of your charater is bare bone. A few outfits and some bonuses. Its disgustingly simple compared to 4.Preorder bonuses... And the fact that you know they will sell custumes and♥♥♥♥♥♥as DLC is pathetic.This feels like a blatant money grap. There issnt anyting better here then in Tropic 4. How the ♥♥♥♥ anyone would give this a score above 5 is heartbreaking. Where are your standards? "

												Cool game, i love tropico: roleplaying as a Dictator,killing rebel scums,building your nationits fun however it still needs some improvement i think it needs what tropico 4 had:more ""story""/goverment characters like add the crazy hippie girl,the commie guy,the ♥♥♥♥ed up anarchist guy,the crazy capitalist woman,the hot KGB Natasha agent(which i think was her name) and especialy tropico should add again the PARLIMENT with ministers and different political parties where you can bann them,kill the supporters (withouth ♥♥♥♥ing paying for each execution -_-),ect  that would be beatiful (ik tropico 5 already has a type of political parties system but its more about ideology rather than real political parties) so please pleaseeeeee add again the parliment where i can nominate my own ministers,however its still a good game so try it !!!my final verdict is 7/10 it can be better !!!

												Well before you judge this post, it was written and posted at exactly midnight by someone who hasnt slept for two days straight... Anyway lets proceed, Personally i think the game is really well made, the sarcasm is absolutely hilarious, THE ILLUMINATI EVEN APPEARS IN THE GAME!!, However you will need a decent computer if you want to run it on the best graphics settings, In addition to this, only people who have played tropico 4 and below will understand this...THEY STILL HAVENT FIXED THE TSUNAMI CYNEMATIC!!!!                        However overall if you like a quirky city building game with a hint of challenge, which you can play with friends this game is for you !    ;)			"

												Tropico 5~~~~~~~This series is getting better with each sequel. Of course you have to build and reach your objectives as usual but in Tropico 5 you have more options than before. From customizing your El Presidente, hiring manager to your building, finding technology and much more.  Using the tutorial is actually a good idea to be honest.But do not worry; you can actually set the level of difficulty easily.Visually, this game is beautiful and run smoothly. The soundtrack is a pleasure to your ears as we would expect from this franchise. My only criticism is with the control, I am wondering why the gamepad is the primary control.  To me this type of game is so much better with your keyboard and mouse. Saying this, you can play with the keyboard and mouse but it is not smooth in my opinion.Positives:~~~~~~~-	Visually splendid-	Fantastic soundtracks-	Plenty things to do-	Setup your levels of difficulties (political, economic, etc) before you start each mission-	Challenging-	Achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	Gamepad as primary controlOverall this game is a solid 8 out of 10 (just because of the gamepad), Otherwise I would give it a 10 out of 10.Well done El Presidente!MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

												I was introduced to the Tropico franchise around the time when the newest Sim City came out. Sim City was a massive dud and Calypso Games decided to capitalize with a 75% sale on Tropico 4. When Tropico 5 came around I was ready for more. I enjoyed Tropico 5 immensely. All the annoying little bits of Tropico 4 were wiped away and the new game style was great. Having to plan a city to last the entire franchise mode was fun. I got attached to my cities. I recommend Tropico 5. Then I downloaded 'The Big Cheese' DLC. It was 5 bucks for a silly costume, new building, and extra missions. It was a ripoff  but I was still loving Tropico so much I didn't care. The building was decent. I could never find the costume. The mission was impossible. I mean IMPOSSIBLE. I normally build my cities to use the resources well and keep my people happy. I tried this with the mission and failed to finish it within the time allotted. Begrudgingly I lowered the difficulty down to east and tried again. I failed. I was a little confused at what I was doing wrong. A month later I decided to load it up again and go for it one last time. I screwed over my citizens in the name of milk. I built as many of the creameries as possible and put all my resources into pumping out as much as possible. I failed. I see this as lazy game design. They made a great game and now are trying to just cash in until Tropico 6 comes around. Get the game. Skip the Expansions.			"

												Tropico 3 and 4 were gems, but Tropico 5 is a joke. And not in a good way. The voice acting is some of the worst I’ve ever heard in a professional game. The music has been “updated” to the modern era, which fits the style of the game like foot and glove, the jokes are so bad that they’re not even worth a groan. Yes, that’s right, not good-bad, like Tropico 4. Just pathetic-bad.I could go on… and on… I’m not going to. It’s not worth my breath. "

												I've been playing Tropico games since the third one. I still haven't played the first and second Tropico games though I might pick them up on the next sale just to see how the game has changed over the years. I enjoy Tropico 3 and 4 a lot but Tropico 5 is by far my favorite with all of the changes that have been made to make it more of a enjoyable and challenging game. If you've played Tropico then skip the next paragraph.For those who are unfamiliar with Tropico, you play El Presidente, the dictator of the island of Tropico. You can play the game as a leader of the people, doing everything to please them, or you can bribe, cheat and kill your way through your lifetime (If you choose to have it end). You'll face rebels, foreign powers, protestors, and elections as you play a much more humorious city building simulator. While I enjoyed Tropico 3, when I got the fourth installment I could tell the developers knew how to improve their game and did what people wanted by adding more of well, everything and included the humor that made Tropico 4 even more enjoyable. However one thing remained unchanged, Tropico has a issue named after it. The issue is once you know what to do the game becomes way too easy and the other problems being builds stop being built by the NPCs (Luckily happens later in so you can insta-build everything) and the worst issue being that shipments stop being transported for some reason. These issue have been taken care of in Tropico 5, however in the Modern Era sometimes I run into issues with the Teamsters again.Tropico 5 adds new features like the time era and research to help keep things from getting too easy. It has you create a constitution that will help and hurt you in various ways. Importing and exporting goods go far more indept, allowing you to choose who you buy and sell to for each individual good to get the best prices and help (and hurt) your relations with foreign powers. For example, in the World War Era, if you sell to the Allies it will hurt the Axis' view of you which can lead to less trade with them and if your relation with them is bad enough, an invasion.Old things like your military buildings are far more useful in this game. Before they were only good for when rebels attack. Now they'll help you with foreign invasion (which before ment Game Over) and pirates when they attack you for your gold. You also won't get that one soldier that just turns into Rambo because they end up killing everyone attacking by themselves. They also add a ""Manager"" system. Most of the building can have a manager and depending on who you pick will give you certain bonuses, like increasing housing quality nearby or increase production.With all of the improvments made, the game has become noticably harder. No more is re-election a definite thing. The player could be making large amounts of spending money but if your people are not pleased, come time for re-election it could mean Game Over. And with no speeches this time to save you (Though might be nice to add something where if you don't keep your promises it'll hurt you in the long run might be good) you may find yourself bribing and exicuting faction leaders more often. I know I did. In Tropico 3 and 4 I never did but here I find myself cheating the votes and taking care of the faction leaders just to end up winning by no more than 30 votes. The game is fair about it though. I've won before having 80% of the votes before, what you do can make or break you here and I love it.There are other things like an online multiplayer which I haven't tried out fully yet but given the way the game plays, it might be kind of like a fast pace version of Anno 2070, but when my roommate and I tried to play together on the same internet connection, I found it laggy.(He was hosting) I could sit here and go indepth with every detail and share my experiences but why sit here reading that when it'll just be there to tell you why you should buy this game when you could get it yourself and give it a go. If you enjoyed the previous Tropico games, like city building sims, or just a casual gamer, this is a purchase you won't regret.			"

												Tropico 5 is really funny, the dialog when getting a mission, clicking on an npc, finishing a research project, your certain to get a good laugh out of it. this game has nice and easy game play and engine features making it easy to pick up and play and have fun.Tropico 5 Background: a Tropical Island empire simulator where you amass a small regime with several advisors, all with different views, aswell as sheltering and feeding ""most"" of your population, you build a drug empire or a paradice on the sea,manage crime and trade and hope to get elected again.this game has excelent multiplayer support but no local support so laning it is harder if your internet connection is slow or drops out. but you can save during multiplayer games so that helps heeps.====>               Don't let haters who say ""oh its missing features"" or ""they made a game with less features then the last ones"" stop you from buying this game, I myself never played tropico 1-4 so I've no idea what features it is lacking and that to me is fine because this game is excelent and heeps of fun!!!              <====loads of fun just Get this game its worth it :)  "

I have played every Tropico game and its just second nature to me what will work and what won't.   their isn't a lot of challenge to the game anymore as far as learning what things do.  There are new building and edicts, like the gay marriage edict or the massive modern apartments, but overall its more of the same.  even the Graphics aren't a massive step up.  Still, Tropico fans will have fun as will newcombers.  I just wish there was more!			"

There is still no way to save multiplayer games, and since games takes 8-12 hours to complete you could see how annoying that is.			"

												The newness of new Tropico:- time passes. Different tech in different time periods. To level up the time you have to achieve different stuff. Start in colonial times and move to modern times. - tech up. You have to research the technologies to unlock them. - fog of war. Before a certain technology is unlocked you have to explore your island to be able to use it. - dynasty members. You level up your dude and his family for bonuses- more battles. Military actually matters cause you get attacked for more reasons than riots. - managers in buildings. You can discover and hire managers to improve and specialize buildings- building upgrades. There are a ton of ways to customize and level up almost every building.- more complicated trading. Lots of trade ships and trade routes so you can play an import export game if you want or smuggle or whatevs. Also political rating affects what trade routes you have available. - fun campaign. It involves time travel and stuff. - multiplayer mode. Which I have not tried yet but would like to...			"

												Tropico 5 contains some substantial improvements over the previous two in the series (because face it, Tropico 4 was really just Tropico 3 with a few bells and whistles added.) Most notably, Tropicans do not have to be physically present in a building for the building to be active-- meaning that the year and a half of downtime while Tropicans wandered over to the Cigar factory to actually earn their pay is now gone. This results in a much smoother economic development.The second big change is that the campaign is not just a story woven through some otherwise disconnected scenario maps. When you finish a scenario in the campaign, your island is saved so that when you return to it*, all your buildings and Tropicans are in the same place.The third item of note is that within the campaign, the progression of time is usually not measured as the passage of months within a year (ex. Nov. 1959) but is instead a countdown to an event related to the scenario (ex. 48 months left before mandate expires) which you can usually extend in several different ways while playing.			"

												I am thoroughly enjoying this game.  I have  played all of the previous versions of tropico and this one is obviously a new generation separate from the older titles. It is more difficult, and it does not run on older machines. However, I am on mission number 4 of the single player campaign and have been having a really good time playing.  I recommend it to any strategy game fans out there. I like that your old builds remain in place- it makes long term planning more important.  I have also found that the military is something you need to pay much more attention to-- which is fine in my book. After all, why play a banana republic dictator if you  don't have to rely on soldiers to keep you in power?  I heartily recommend it to all fans of sims or  strategy games. The graphics and sound are top notch. Of course they will expect you to  pay  for downloadable content in the future, but this is nothing new for those who have prior tropico titles.			"

												Tropico 5 was fun for me - the problem I have with it is that it is so similar to previous Tropico games.  I have played every Tropico game and its just second nature to me what will work and what won't.   their isn't a lot of challenge to the game anymore as far as learning what things do.  There are new building and edicts, like the gay marriage edict or the massive modern apartments, but overall its more of the same.  even the Graphics aren't a massive step up.  Still, Tropico fans will have fun as will newcombers.  I just wish there was more!			"

This review only relates to „Tropico 5 - Complete Collection“ With ALL DLCs! I really love the whole Tropico series and heard nothing good about this game when it was published.So I waited, 2 years, dozens of patches and DLCs!And it was the right thing to do!! Now with all the DLC, this game isfeels complete and there is not much to criticize. There are only tiny things which bothered me and could easily be solved via patch or another DLC (please don’t! :-D): - more buildings in the colonial ages would've been great.- more diversity in buildings, especially other varieties of every building for each era !!!- On „hard“ the rebelsand factions are pretty much impossible to please. One oft he faction will always revolt.- More of this great music or an easy way to include the music of Tropico 1 – 4 would’ve been nice.- There is no different or altered music for each era.- In retrospect (without being affected by this myself) this DLC policy of Kalypso has been pretty dickish.- Trees should be placeable outside the grid, so that cities look more realistic and the gaps between curvy roads and buildings, placed inside the grid, can be filled up.The aspects I liked most are: - It’s a true Tropico and not some pared-down imitation to make money (only with all DLCs!).- There are some nice and new innovations like the eras.- I really didn’t miss anything from the predecessors and really don’t think they’ve dumbed it down as much as said by some people.- assignment of keys is possible.- adjustable levels of difficulty.- The real „Tropico feeling“ is still thereAll in all, I really like this game, just like Lulu Marie does:

												The thing about Tropico 5 is that none of the in your face issues about the game never got patched or addressed in the games tutorials or updates, and that is what makes it hard to recommend it on a level in addressing all of the ""advertised"" aspects of the game. So I guess I'll just make two sections talking about what is really bad or good about the game.The Good: The single player in Tropico is pretty standard where you follow a campain (which is rare but well appreciated in Tropico) as you develope your own little Cuban esc country while siding with different people for different things.  The voice acting is awesome and funny and you'll really come to appreciate the character and personality that the game brings to the table.  The trading system is very confusing when you get past the beginning stages because just because the boat says its bringing in a certain amount of money doesn't mean you will see the impact in your treasury (just a note).  Also if you are a sucker for graphics this game is fine, landscape is a little empty at first, but once you start filling it up you'll be astounded at the bright colors and tropical atmosphere.  If you really want to get the most out of the game I recommend the Sandbox mode and just set everything to a place where you can go on forever (cause it will take you a long time to fill up your island) and the campain makes you start from scartch as you move from island to island so it's nice to have something concrete to hold onto.  Dlc is also alright if you get it on sale.The Bad:Annnnnnnnnnddddddddddd here comes the kicker.  Character selection and custimization is basically worthless most of the time and it's just pointless trying to upgrade them when you could build or do something that will help you much more in the long run, or just have a bunch of lower level characters on your island to have scartered effect which is also a good alternitive.  Going along with characters the manager assingment process in general is just abysmall as I wish that there was a seperate easier menu to see where your managers are rather then going in and clicking on every single building to see.  Then comes the biggest letdown in this game, which is the learning curve.  I have just over 100 hours and I still haven't even come close to mastering this game, the way that the game wants you to build the city contradicts the idea of a city builder completely, they want everything in close proximity  and one supermarket per block and one church per block but thats such wasted potential on something so meaningless and confusing and limiting to the creativity of building your own city.  Then there is multiplayer which is what I would describe as a one night stand, over and over again, because guess what?  You can't save the freaking multiplayer worlds if you are playing with a friend so you will have to start new every single time you restart that world, which is so god dang stupid and should've been patched the day after this game came out.This leads to the conclusion where I'll recommend it dispite it's flaws because at face level and on sale this is a really fun game to play and really get the atmosphere of, and despite all of it's flaws the developers managed to create a game that has some of the most fun and attractive efforts of any city builder game I have ever played.

												Buy Tropico 4, not 5 if you want to have fun owning your own island.There are many small annoyances with this new entry to the series. For instance sometimes it feels like I'd rather pull my fingernails off than try getting roads placed where I want in this game. Same goes for buildings, especially on shore regions. What makes this task even more frustrating is the new ""fog of not knowing your own island"" which can be painstakingly cleared by sending your palace troops to ""explore"" said areas. Only that the troops are idiots that don't reveal important areas (mines, oil) but rather walk right past them. Have fun sending them again and again (1000 credits every time) to reveal even the smallest of areas. These guys are like Vickers in Prometheus, capable running only straight ahead - except when they can use roads to go around and reveal even less of fogged area than using straight path to marker.The ""combat"" in this game... whoo boy. Not good. not good at all since you can't control the troops at all and the outcome is based on placement of your building in relation to path taken by attacking forces. What fun.A new console-player friendly task system within campaign missions is like you're playing a tutorial all the time. Do this and do just to get some reward. What happened to being supreme leader? In this game you're just an errand boy.Campaign missions end on victory condition, just to kick you to another island for one mission and then back to the first one. Around we go. Not the smoothest experience and feels like a continuation of tutorial feeling described above.Execution is poor and overall Tropico 4 is so much better than this its not even funny.			"

												First, a brief history lesson. I was an avid player of Tropico 3, and snatched Tropico 4 up on the first day. I was underwhelmed, as the game seemed more to be Tropico 3.75 than a new game in its own right; for example, all of the UI and art elements were exactly the same. However, over the next several years, patches and DLC helped make Tropico 4 a truly outstanding game, far surpassing its predecessor.Now we're met with Tropico 5, and history seems to be repeating itself. Tropico 5 has a rock-solid foundation. The mechanics and the underlying systems have been streamlined and now make a lot more sense. Building variety has been diminished, but gone are a lot of buildings that you only ever used once (and that was just to find out what it did). What's left has a time and a place, and the only time you won't use a building is if it doesn't suit your playstyle (as opposed to, say, satellite dishes from Tropico 4, which had very little extra-campaign utility). I've yet to experience a crash. The new systems function well. I especially like the introduction of eras. The dynasty system works, I think. I'm not sure. I seem to get all of the bonuses all of the time, regardless of who is Presidente.That said, the game needs work. Some categories (entertainment) are far too sparse, unless you want a dozen cabarets on your island. I've experienced one game-breaking bug: I don't win Sandbox missions despite meeting the victory conditions. Hopefully that gets patched soon. Upgrading buildings is tedious, although I'm happy that they streamlined modernizing them. A big letdown is that the trademark Tropico humour largely falls flat this time around. Instead of the caricatures of various tropes (the drunken priest, the inept second-in-command) and the banter on the radio which could be genuinely funny (I still laugh at General Rodriguez's description of the Museum of Modern Art), you get ""Brokeback Mountain"" references, predictable flat-out stupidity from Penultimo, and...Lulu. One cannot be told what Lulu is, one must experience her awfulness for oneself.All told, it's a solid game that will likely only get better as time goes on. It's worth the price--you can easily get 30-40 hours of gameplay in its current state. It's still one of the best city-builder franchises out there.			"

												So, Tropico 5. We meet at last. Do you know why you were brought here, Tropico #5? Because El Presidente believes with the right sort of, let's say, motivation, you could become so much more useful as a citizen of our great virtual island. But as it is right now? I don't know, Tropico 5. I don't know. Considering the work of the four previous Tropicos who have come through town, who have very rarely made any significant changes to the status quo, which I have to admit, around here we can appreciate that sort of slow gradual change considering how everything has been working just fine, you decided you wanted to make a few more, shall we say, radical changes. This has El Presidente very concerned. Let's go over the dossier, shall we?Let's start with what you've been doing around town that's got so many fellow citizens vocally supporting you. One of the biggest changes you've made is to the infrastructure. It's nice to see that you've scaled down the size of the parking garages to something manageable, and look, in the Modern area you've introduced the Metro to our tiny island! Letting citizens get from one point of the island to the other nearly instantaneously is quite the feet. Something that El Presidente truly appreciates when he wants to get out to the llama farms for some quiet and relaxation without having to drive through all of that horrible traffic. Which is another issue we see significantly less of. It is good to see more people walking instead of filling the streets with cars! I applaud you, Tropico 5, for finally resolving that issue. That reminds me, the whole Era thing. It is, if of a somewhat debatable quality, nice to have Eras from which to transition. Going from the Colonial Era to the World War Era is probably the largest change of the four. The other two are the Cold War and the Modern Era. Having the ability to upgrade certain residential units to other certain residential units is nice as the era transitions, and new constructions become available.Having Edicts become available as the Era progresses is another thing to look forward to, until finally you have access to all of them. And the Constitution! Who would have expected something like that to be introduced into our tiny island? The discovery of science, which is used to enhance the Constitution and advance the Eras, was nice as we can finally figure out that whole sliced bread thing.The price of docks is considerable cheaper than they were previously, which allows El Presidente to build many, many docks to help speed up the export of his new delicious cheese. And speaking of money, it's nice to finally be able to have a use for El Presidente's, shall we say 'private' income. Being able to use the Swiss Bank account balance level up El Presidente and his family members abilities is quite good at encouraging you to play multiple maps with the same family so you realize their full power! Oh yes, and El Presidente would like me to pass along his thanks in allowing multiple members of the family to share power on our island.For the workforce, being able to hire managers with minor Presidente-like powers to manage buildings is a nice touch indeed. The people of our island enjoy being empowered in such a way that makes them more useful to El Presidente.But now onto some concerning trends that I am seeing here. The buildings snap to a rather large grid system that while nice when fitting buildings together sometimes, is terrible unimaginative and can leave a lot of extra space between buildings where they meet at odd angles. It doesn't help any that you have taken away El Presidente's favorite toys. No longer can we build statues to honor El Presidente's might. No, now parks and decorations only come in two units, small and large. The small is one grid or two, while the large fluctuates slightly more, starting at a 4x4, and going to such sizes as 4x6, to the mighty 5x5 and 5x6. But what happened to the gardeners, Tropico 5? Did you murder them in the study with a lead pipe? Because we can no longer plant individual trees, or benches, or any of the small single items. This is a great disappointment to El Presidente, for he had quite the green-thumb.Housing has now turned into something of a mess, since, as we said, Tropicans walk far more than they did last time. Now if a Tropican can not find a house near where they live, they will opt to just build a shack near their work-site, even if there is ample housing on the island. I have been told by many who do this, Tropico #5, that they were encouraged to ignore El Presidente's benevolence and build these eyesores around the city by you.And another thing. Why have you taken away the ability of El Presidente to personally manage the wages of our citizens? Not only that, but he can no longer set prices for buildings or services. Everything has instead been rolled up into one ""budget"" function. Tropico 5, I'm concerned about this power grab. These are function that should be left up to El Presidente himself to manage, not some overly simplified ""budget bar"" that controls everything. This has actually made it HARDER to manage the economy, since if we want to pay people less, we now have to also decrease the efficiency of a building by lowering the budget. This is a big problem, and I suspect it may be sabotage!I was also shocked to discover that we need to discover our own island now! When we start administering our great government in the Colonial Era, our island is shrouded in mist, and must be explored by our soldiers during ""expeditions"" that cost a thousand dollars an event! And you can't even control them, you just click on a way point and hope they go the right route in getting there to discover it. Though the discovery of the Compass does negate this, it is none-the-less irksome.And speaking of discovery, why are our people no longer able to improve their skills concerning their profession? Why have you taken this source of pride from our people, Tropico #5? The people are also kept more out of sight as well, as no longer is El Presidente able to see them when they utilize a building. Gone are the queues that show up when you click on a service building. Instead, they are reduced to mere numbers.Having to mine minerals out of very specific ""mines"" instead of just having to dig it out of the ground did not actually turn out to be helpful. These ""mines"" take up permanent space on the map, even after they are used up and collapse. Which is another issue! When a resource node, with the exception of the fishing wharf, is used up, it is automatically destroyed, regardless of whether or not the output storage is full! This destruction of El Presidente's property at the hands of no other than you, Tropico 5, is a great crime! It is most irritating and wasteful. If a facility no longer has resources to mine, El Presidente will choose when and how it is removed, not you!And with the Edicts, while we do have some nice new interesting ones, I see the Pope is no longer able to visit our island, Tropic 5. That is a little disappointing.Elections are now quite a bit more boring. Why do you not allow El Presidente to do speeches anymore, Tropico #5? In fact, why is it that El Presidente, and the family, are not able to directly control their actions on the map? Gone are the day when El Presidente could walk up to a construction site and encourage the workers to construct faster, or walk into a service building an inspire greater service. This is very disappointing that you have talked otherwise upright citizens into ignoring El Presidente in such a way.In the end, I find my appreciation for you mixed, Tropico 5. I can stay with Tropico 4 and not really miss much, I think, but I do still enjoy your presence, even if I think you're a half step back in progress.			"

It has cool political aspects and many different paths on how to run your community.			"

												I'll post a longer review later, but right now I simply want to post a positive Yes on the game.  It's worth the money for a fun and engaing city builder.  The economy is expansive, can be set to be extremely difficult if you like it like that, and your citizens provide you mulitple obstacles to overcome as well through both politics on the homefront and abroad.

												First, a brief history lesson. I was an avid player of Tropico 3, and snatched Tropico 4 up on the first day. I was underwhelmed, as the game seemed more to be Tropico 3.75 than a new game in its own right; for example, all of the UI and art elements were exactly the same. However, over the next several years, patches and DLC helped make Tropico 4 a truly outstanding game, far surpassing its predecessor.Now we're met with Tropico 5, and history seems to be repeating itself. Tropico 5 has a rock-solid foundation. The mechanics and the underlying systems have been streamlined and now make a lot more sense. Building variety has been diminished, but gone are a lot of buildings that you only ever used once (and that was just to find out what it did). What's left has a time and a place, and the only time you won't use a building is if it doesn't suit your playstyle (as opposed to, say, satellite dishes from Tropico 4, which had very little extra-campaign utility). I've yet to experience a crash. The new systems function well. I especially like the introduction of eras. The dynasty system works, I think. I'm not sure. I seem to get all of the bonuses all of the time, regardless of who is Presidente.That said, the game needs work. Some categories (entertainment) are far too sparse, unless you want a dozen cabarets on your island. I've experienced one game-breaking bug: I don't win Sandbox missions despite meeting the victory conditions. Hopefully that gets patched soon. Upgrading buildings is tedious, although I'm happy that they streamlined modernizing them. A big letdown is that the trademark Tropico humour largely falls flat this time around. Instead of the caricatures of various tropes (the drunken priest, the inept second-in-command) and the banter on the radio which could be genuinely funny (I still laugh at General Rodriguez's description of the Museum of Modern Art), you get ""Brokeback Mountain"" references, predictable flat-out stupidity from Penultimo, and...Lulu. One cannot be told what Lulu is, one must experience her awfulness for oneself.All told, it's a solid game that will likely only get better as time goes on. It's worth the price--you can easily get 30-40 hours of gameplay in its current state. It's still one of the best city-builder franchises out there.			"

												great graphics, great soundtrack, been playing the series since the orginal game. my first experiance with tropico was back in the day when i got a pc gamer demo disk and i have been a fan of the series ever since. tropico 5 is faster paced then the rest of the series which i like. there are a ton of mods for the game that gives it great value.  the mp is pretty fun which suprised me i enjoyed co op a lot. make sure your co op partner has proper soldiers to fight off rebels and armies. i had a friend who got molested by the king it was hilarious. plently of humor in the game and i love selling the russians chocolate and rum :). my biggest gripes are the wage system, every building has a budget but that budget ranges are varied some people getting paid hundreds while others make less then 40. i really would love the old wage system back i felt so bad for dock workers :*(. i wish the game was harder and military invasions and rebellions happened more often,  there are plently of mods for this game and overall this was a fun experiance i would love to see another tropico game :).

												You know? I love this game. It is so fun to play, and I do extreemly enjoy it! But the one thing... That I was so dissapointed with this game? The soundtrack. It is so weird, and... just... Flat out depressing to me... At one point I had to turn on the Tropico 3 soundtrack. I mean, most of the songs were good, and I enjoyed them, but others were just... egh... I think it was mainly it was just... All instramental, and kinda more modern music crammed into it which is not something I'm very used to in a Tropico game's soundtrack. Idk, thats just how I feel about it. Some of them were prety good, some of them are kinda dissapointing. GREAT GAME! YOU SHOULD GET IT! Just, soundtrack's not my thing...~Pilgrim			"

												Economy building game type thingy. The game looks nice, but as a fan of the genre I do have some gripes with it. First of, it is rather shallow compared to feature packed games like Unknown Horizons or Sim City. Since I'm now used to playing high quality strategy games like that (some for free), I expect commercial titles to go the extra mile.Placing roads is akward at best. Yes, you learn to work around it, but a user interface should work for the player, not against him. During multiplayer you can build roads that stretch far out, but they cannot be demolished leaving you no room to make a single mistake while placing them. That is a tall order considering how akward the road editing is.The game rushes you from era to era and I often struggle to remain in one era because I feel I haven't gotten to use my newly researched technologies enough. This combined with very small map sizes (even huge is rather small compared to other games) makes it a poor choice for the month long builds I'm used to.There is supposedly a way to save/load multiplayer games, but it's not clear to me at this point exactly how. As with seemingly all modern games, it lacks a proper server browser, instead your left with some social network thing for matchmaking and remote hosting. I didn't like it in L4D2 and I don't like it in this game either. Really old games like OpenTTD (which is free) solved load, save and multiplayer features a long time ago. Just do what they did.The game has also crashed a few times, not a segfault, but a hard lock forcing me to get a console up to kill it.			"

												I did like Tropico 3 and Tropico 4. In fact I loved them!. However, Tropico 5 was, let's say, different. The graphics were good and the humour was there too (if not a bit repetative, a joke is funny once, twice, three times, four times -cringe, again, again and so on). Too little dialogue was included.I'm sorry to say the gameplay just didn't work. What do I mean by that? Well, it was boring by comparison!One of the features that unfortunatly dictate how the game is played, is that each scenario is played on a different island. That in itself is not a problem, but two or three scenarios later you go back to the island that you previously developed and you have to try and remember how and where all the resources are and how you developed the 'supply chain'. It was like going back into somebody elses half-played game and trying to work out what's wrong with it - even though it worked when you left it!!!The menus are at times difficult to work with - important features, that can make or break a game, are sometimes buried deep in a menu that you hardly use or struggle to find (even though you might remember it was somewhere).My next comment is strange, yes I agree. But it is like the rebels and armies are random. Now I know that they are not. But I felt like they were detached from what I was doing even though I do understand the mechanics.I have saved my biggest gripe/problem until last. Groan. The price of the DLC's!!! I paid a lot of money for this game £35. Nobody should have to pay a total of an additional £52 for all the DLc's) making the cost of this game a humongous £87 (about $135 american dollars as I write this). This was a huge problem for me IN THIS GAME. Because I felt that I did not get the gameplay that I should have had from the original package and the content just wasn't there!!!I am not against all DLC's. But these were overpriced and the original game was short of too many features. So I did not buy them. The original base game is on SALE now at £12.24. I believe £14.99 would be fair price, maybe.......... BUT this price should certainly include all the smaller DLC's. Maybe £19.99 with all the DLC's included. So it is still not good value even at 50% off.If it was reduced to these prices tomorrow would I buy them? I'm sorry no, for all resons that I wrote about above. The game does not compare to the fun that Tropico 3 and 4 were and I tired very quickly from it. "

												I am barely ticking down into the no vote on this one. Maybe ""Not Yet"" is more accurate. I would not recommend paying full price for this game if you have Tropico 4. The additional content is limited and I suspect you will be able to get a good deal in a few months with a bundle of DLC.I loved Tropico 4 and I am quite disappointed in this installment. It is one of the few city builder games being released though, so beggars can't be choosers. I will likely keep logging hours on it so I won't say it's worthless.-Campaign takes you through only two islands - really dislike this because it just seems like one, long and boring mission. Different demands put on you when you strategically set up for a previous mission. This was obviously a purposeful shift to have a ""Dynasty"" and age with the island but I don't enjoy the campaign much.-There are no other missions but there is a missions box so it must be coming or unlocks when you beat the campaign? I would bet it will be $$$ DLC though.-Tropico 4 had a crappy scenario creator which limited the amount of user-generated content there was (and hindered the replay value) and I was hoping for a better one in 5 but there isn't one at all-There is a random map generator for sandbox which is an improvementOverall the things I wanted to see in this installment aren't there and mechanics I thought worked well have been changed.

												El Presidente is Back for the 5th Time. And I do not regret electing him!The Dynasty Features, The ""Constitution"" Feature, more Eras to dictate around with, and even more evil edicts make this caribbean coctail a good drink to a choice cigar and some Swiss Bank Deposits. The cynical humor and the black tone to almost everything make me laugh almost around ever corner. ""We found a Sickle, Presidente, that will go perfectly with our Hammers in the future."" -Penultimo-I am afraid of the empty spaces in the Building Menu. I sense a scammy DLC system. But as long as the Game stays true to the substance it already has, I personally already approve of it.Read a longer Review for a more founded Opinion, this is just Propaganda from a ""Dictator Simulator"" Enthusiast.Viva el Presidente!

												Tropico 5 is a very fun game. It is a distinct experience from Tropico 4. It varies with the competiveness of the campaign missions, the overall features and the core mechanics of the game. It is a very solid continuation to the series, but there is plenty of room for improvement.The core mechanics as compared to Tropico 4 are improved completely. The little things that add to the game are great. There is more of a sense of tightness when it comes to the mechanics.The features and campaign missions vary on experience from player to player, however I feel that it is a good improvement from T4, however is somewhat short and less features than T4.Overall, it is a real good game that I am continuously enjoying and is being supported with DLC and updates regularly. 8/10.----UPDATE as of 2nd August, 2015:I finally got back into finishing this game, and I can say from an updated experience, I loved the final three missions I had to finish in the campaign. The cities are fragile on producing income, but when you have the right amount of buildings, it is sustainable and the missions become progressively easier. The hardest mission for me was building the space/nuclear program and that was half into the second campaign.Updated rating for me increases, but is still rounded to 8/10. Campaign took me a solid 30+ hours to complete. Overall playing time is 53 hours as of now so its hard to comment on the length it took me to finish the campaign, but the majority of those 53 hours went to the campaign.----Thanks for reading my review!

												TL;DR, co-op is neither co nor op. I bought the 2 pack looking forward to a co-op city building campaign that my buddy and I oculd play together, maybe this was expecting too much. Load up the game (after stealing an old graphics card of his, because my dumbass cant read the stickies, or the game requirements), start the campaign, no multiplayer/co-op option. Fair enough, maybe we expected too much hoping to play through the campaign together, maybe we can just jointly build a city, and go freeform/sandbox on it. the first time we get into game together (why cant we make private lobbies?) we start across map from each other, with ""victory objectives"", well wait a second, there was an option for co-op or versus, I must've selected the wrong one, because we are on opposing sides from each other, with no clear way to interact.Restart the game, make sure we are on co-op instead of versus, pick a new island just because. Once we get into the game (not a knock at the loading times, it runs quite smoothly) it's apparent that no part of the ""co-operative"" gameplay will involve interaction between the two of us, he is on his side of the island, I am on my side, and we still have ""team 1 victory points"" Ummm, there is only one team. His fright ships come in on their own schedule, mine come in on their own schedule. He accepts certain missions (such as sell us 3000 lbs of coco), I accept certain missions, on the ocassions that those missions DO overlap, our counters each fill up independently!! Add to that the unchanging, bullet-fast gameplay (in which we don't have time to properly read the rewards/punishments, a slower option would be nice, if it could pause when dialog is happening would be friggin wonderful), and the complete lack of notification when one of us gets knocked out of the game.. oh and why do all of their buildings and civilians cursedly die upon their leaders flight? ITS A CO-OP GAME, Why dont you let the remaining/surviving partner take over the buildings?this game has a LONG way to go, I am incredibly disappointed.Avoid until, forever?			"

I warn u this IS NOT a rutin strategic game like cityville or something similar, this is a very inteligent simulation and needs a functional brain that can solve difficult situations. you have to learn and learn by your failures and try not to losse money and  unrest people.

												All I have to say, despite my rather dull and uninteresting life, at least I can forget about my troubles and focus on my private tropical island when I am down!  Amazing game, it really is!  The ONLY minor complaint I have, and in comarison with the rest of the game it is minor, is I wish we had more control over the various attributes of the dictator like we did in Tropico 4.....  Other than that, Penultimo is hilarious, the music is awesome, building and learning what you are doing is a breeze!  The tutrial is very useful, earning medals is a blast, the economics are balanced and very interesting, and the downloadable content after you buy the game is endless!!!  Far as multiplayer, I have to wonder why every time I try and find an opponent, there are not enough people to play.... but that being said, there is so much else you can do after you finish the campaigns I would STILL say incredible replayablility!  and on top of it all.... I managed to grab my copy for 10 dollars when it was on sale at STEAM..... everyone needs to check this game out!!!			"

												Been playing Tropico 5 for a week now and I must say, though on the surface this game looks like a step in the right direction the inside of this game is 100 steps back. Pros:-Longer game time from the new dynasty eras. (Colonial, World Wars, Cold War, Modern Times)-New ways to power your government through your new constitution-Add members of your family to your government for extra benefits-Bigger islands that need exploring before you can just build anywhere-Multiplayer (All we ever wanted, right?)Cons:-Lacking in everything everywhere (explained below)-Every model of each building is the exact same unlike Tropico 4 where you could change the way they looked.-No more loyalist (my personal favorit faction in T4. no more hardcore dictatorships favoring your loyal subjects)-No more prisons/labor camps to lock away the people against you-No more decorations for your city (Statues of your self, national flag, you know that fun silly stuff)-Only about 5 outfits to choose from all of them worst than the other (Where is my traditional flag suit?)-The Almac is just a tad harder to navigate in (just considering the amout of clicks it takes to find what im looking for)-You cant choose a back story or how the Presidente rose to power anymore (just one and ONLY one stat)-YOU CANT SAVE YOUR MUTIPLAYER GAMES (Who let this one happen?)  -_-I could really just go on and on about how much I really dont like this game. I am beyond dissapointed, this is almost scam worthy. If you already own Tropico 4 and your thinking of getting 5 please, do yourself a favor and walk away, im begging you. Dont fall for this game and it lies. Terrible just terrible.			"

												I was hesitant to buy this game at first because of the reviews but I went ahead and got it anyway because it was on sale and I love the Tropico franchise. This is now my favorite tropico so far.This game got me just as hooked as the others, and hands down it is the most in-depth and complex tropico so far.They have introduced dynasties so you can have additonal characters and vote other dynasty members in during elections and take advantage of their bonuses. Moving the character around to give boosts to buildings has been eliminated. I see this as a good thing because it just seemed like unecessary micromanagement in the previous game. Instead your character or dynasty members give global boosts to production or whatever else they do (military strength, effectiveness of services, etc.)They have also overhauled trading and added trade routes which can be very profitable if you find good opportunites (Not every trade is profitable and sometimes settling for less lucrative ones is desirable.) They are very easy to manage and not annoying at all. Docks are now more useful to provide more ships for trade routes.The difficulty of the game has gone up, which is a good thing for me because in previous installments I'd get bored when I had loads of cash and almost 100% happiness. In this game I've actually had to use my military AND do the voter fraud thing. I had never had to do that in previous games. You no longer need a secret service building to do certain things, which I thought was pretty annoying.They've introduced a constitution which give you decisions to make that will benefit your country. There is no more immigration building but the benefits provided by one are instead on a constitutional amendment. Edicts are basically the same but some have to be unlocked through research. They've also added research, and it's not just buying blueprints like before. Building libraries and staffing them give research points.Armies and military are very important now and are to be utilized. In previous games I would not bother with militaries until the militant faction complained, in this game it is very handy to have a sizable military, especially when declaring independence in the colonial era.There are now multiple eras in the game. I did not have the modern times expansion from Tropico 4 so I will not compare them directly, but the eras add a whole new interesting layer. In the colonial era you should try to increase revolutionary support to buy independence from the crown and move on to the great war era. This is where the military can also come in handy, to declare independence the crown requests $20,000. If you have a sizable military you can refuse and fight off the crowns troops to save that money. It's not extremely difficult to do and is somewhat challenging but it was a lot of fun for me to do.Farms and mines are also much different. Farms are much more asthetically pleasing and larger. The way building upgrades work has also been changed and is more relevant early game. It's not just a statistical advantage to get late game anymore. A previous reviewer has complained about the way the mine looks, but I think it looks much much better than before. Instead of a random patch of land being dug into, mines are now in preselected locations along mountains. Wages & rents are more simple to manage, no longer do you set individual rents or wages but you set budgets which determine worker prosperity. I do not think I can explain it well, but if you set budgets high, the workers income level becomes either poor, well-off, rich, etc. This determines what kind of house they live in.There is now a ""fog of war"" type mechanic on the island. In the colonial and great war era you need to explore your island to reveal what resources you have available. You use your military for this.The game runs just as well, if not better, than the previous version of Tropico. I honestly think it runs better than Tropico 4 did on my laptop which is surprising. I also feel comfortable hooking the laptop up to the TV and playing this tropico from my couch with my wireless laptop & keyboard. The GUI had been changed and is much better. I also like that they changed the portraits on the message screens. It's not as exaggerated and cartoony as it was before. I also feel like I can't zoom in on my island as far as I used to. Cons: Only bad things I think is that there is no real additional building sprites. I thought this would be something easy to do. The almanac also has a little less info available but the data that it does show is much more useful and better organized than before.I highly recommend it for anybody who likes the Tropico series. I have been playing since Tropico 2 and this one is my favorite so far. Definitely buy, even at full price.			"

												Lack of a proper campaign ruins it. Sandbox games are repetitive and beautification is non-existent so towns look boring. The military are morons who just walk to their deaths one at a time then it's game over.The game mechanics are a slight improvement over Tropico 3 but implemented in a lacklustre sort of way. Tropico 3 is just better, I'd swap titles anyday.			"

												Very good game with slight improvements over its predecessors. This latest edition brings updated graphics, some slight improvements with overall gameplay and reduction of some of the more tedious aspects of earlier versions, but does take away from a few of the things that brought some charm to the older editiions (no more campaign speeches for example). Overall if you like Tropico you will love this edition, highly recommend it, 4/5 Stars.			"

												Tropico 5 changes a lot of systems, yet stays familiar. It simplifies some aspects, yet makes goals harder to accomplish. new installations: Humour. This game turned out to be funnier than I expected! Every single line that your Presidente says is quite ridiculous (like for example ""finally Tropico is free from modern medicine!"" or ""Welcome Tropico police force to its new home! You can strip search me any time dear officers, oh and by the way your forgot your handcuffs at my palace""), every single research message is humorous and even some of the mission statements are. You have less base buildings and their functions have been simplified, however the research track provides many many different extra buildings, that you need to spend time on. dynasty system - you get to choose less perks, however each family member of your can carry perks of their own. You can use your family members on buildings as managers, or you can send them on missions. Is the game worth it? Yes. Most definitely yes. The charm of Tropico has not been lost. It's different in many ways to the previous ones, however still worth playing!			"

												This is by far the worst Tropico (excluding Tropico 2 off course). There is nothing left of the original charme of Tropico 1. The developers have introduced several new concepts but every single one of them is implemented poorly. It doesn't feel right. The UI, campaign, dynasty, research, combat and trading feel like they don't belong. And some of the old core mechanics seem to have vanished or are broken. I have played every Tropico there is and  I had high hopes. But this is a big disappointment. Tropico 4 is way better and Tropico 1 is still better then both of them.Even the music has lost its Cuban flair.I would describe it as a poor mixture between Anno and the last SimCity.			"

												TROPICO 5My first serious review so do not judge.GRAPHICSI just have 1 word ""amazing"" the graphics are beautiful but I still cannot see the eyes in the character customization screen.GAMEPLAYThis game is more for hardcore gamers,but not for casual gamers.(SPOILER ALERT)There are always rebels or disasters to cut your way of ruling the empire.Sometimes trade contracts end or you just run out of money.In colonial era you can lose by not having enough revolutionaries.I myself am a casual gamer and I do not recommend this for casual gamers.I have raged alot.MULTIPLAYERNever tried it out :D .The reason is because nobody plays it,you will always just find 3-10 people in an international lobby,even though 600 people play this daily.But mostly singleplayer.If you do not enjoy singleplayer u can still check out multiplayer.MY EXPERIENCEFirst city builder I have ever played in my life.Started out,failed 5 times,reloaded save,got to a new era,ran out of cash,raged hard.Hope you dont have the same experience as me :D .FINAL RATING5/10Reasons:Lack of players in multiplayerNot for casual gamers (U can change hardness)If you fail you need to start a new game or continue from last save.

												The only other Tropico game I have tried was the very first one, which was interesting. This game; However, I found thoroughly enjoyable, though I can't quite explain why. It was fun playing a Quasi-dictator who tried running a democratic state, while juggling the many scenario surprises such as, Russian Invasions, Tsunami destruction, Tornado's, Rebel attacks, Riots and having multiple foreign powers crying for my attention. I spent several hours just getting lost going through each faction member, playing with my population by bribing, arresting, or banishing them to see what would happen. The graphics are not bad, and the mods and add-on content such as, Waterborne add content to make the game even more enjoyable. All in all, I would recommend this game for those who enjoy this type of game. It is worth multiple playthroughs using various tactics.			"

												When this game came out I read a bunch of reviews that said it was Tropico 4 all over again and passed on it as a result.Boy, was I wrong.TL;DR at the bottomTropico 5 takes everyone's favorite role of ""El Presidente"" and adds a bunch of fancy new features that really round out the Tropico expereince and take it to the next level.First off, we have a technology component where Libraries and other buildings help you ""discover"" new buildings, technology and constituional options.Secondly, you have a Constitution; which provides a choice between Global perks / mods that affect how you run your Island.Third, is the concept of ""Eras"", where we begin in the Colonial Era and Gradually progress into Modern Times.All in all, what this does is create distinct stages of evolution for your island so you truly feel that your island ""changes with the times"".Combined with this new evolutionary aspect is the concept of the Family in the Regime; your leader will have children who all have different personalities. At every election you can ask a Regime member to run in the election in lieu of your original Leader. They can be sent on missions and kidnapped, assassinated or disowned.  They have personalities which you can ""upgrade"" with money from your Swiss Bank Account to make them more effective as managers as as Regime members.Also new is the aspect of ""managers"" where the people running each building can bring a minor perk that you can assign to whichever of your buildings you choose.All this is wrapped in the same familiar ""Tropico"" packaging that fans of the series know and love. So, Long Story Short, though I am glad I grabbed this on sale for $10, this game is MILES more than Tropico 4 was and any fan of the series should pick it up.TL;DR Great game. Worth a grab at $15 or less.  Enjoy Ruling, Presidente!			"

Worth getting if you want to play multiplayer.It seems that there were a number of things removed from Tropico 5 (such as different characters for faction leaders and your parliment/cabinet members), but it's balanced out by the things it does add (like different eras, Colonial/World Wars/Cold War/Modern).Tropico 5 is different enough from Tropico 4 that I can play both and still have fun; I don't feel like Tropico 5 is a replacement for Tropico 4, but it's still enjoyable. I'm curious what DLC will add to this game, but given the ludicrously overpriced DLC for Tropico 4, I'm not holding my breath.Pick this game up on a sale for sure. Or pick up Tropico 4.			"

												Tropico 5 is no real improvement to Tropico 4. Any innovation and the promising multiplayer experience are overshadowed by an annoying new combat system, the inability to effectively change the payment of a certain group without influencing building performance and the newly introduced population cap which is annoying in singleplayer and simply gamebreaking in multiplayer.Want to be a Tropican dictator?

												Tropico 5 is the new younger brother of the awe-inspiring Tropico 4. Not suprisingly, Tropico 5 has many less buildings then Tropico 4 *cough* expect DLC *cough* but it still manages to be an upgrade to Tropico 4.  El Presidente's notable new toys include better military and companionship (multiplayer). You shouldn't not buy this game just because it wasn't as much of an upgrade as Tropico 4 was for the franchise. But if you don't have any Tropico games I would suggest buying Tropico 4 now and getting this on sale with the destined-to-come DLC later.Edit: It's a year later and I recently purchased all of the DLC (but two minor ones) for 85% off at 11.00 dollars recently(Humble Bundle). True to my predictions Tropico 5 has introduced 12 DLC's so far to fill the void of initial release. I've put in 30 hours at this point and plan to put in more, so I can safely recommend this game. Buy Tropico 5 and its DLC cheap, and I think you will find it worth it. (I should also mention the older Tropicos are almost just as fun and still much cheaper atm.)			"

												Tropico 5 is a fun game for about 12 hours. Then it becomes a new game, namely 'Find the way to win you didn't do before', and finally it becomes a bore. Kalypso is obviously using it as a cash vector for DLC. If you're a fan of Tropico then I'll assume you have Tropico 4; play that. As it is the game will start to get stale after your 3rd or 4th play on the same map. The best way to 'freshen up' your game is to buy the DLC that should be free updates.-Do Not Support Kalypso's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-If we don't buy their terrible DLC they might take the hint and make real DLC.

												Worth it's price. Fantastic humor and enviornment. Great overhaul in UI and other features. With each version the game just improves and gets better and better. Manage your own economy. Offering many ways to play the game and even a co-op experience. Manage your people and watch them fail or grow. Several options. Fantastic walkthrough as with their previous games too. No need to wonder what on earth to do because they show you what to do and how to play. Love the new elements added. Fastic single player experience or co-op experience. This game is just amazing. Easy camera controls. Flawless directions. Fun challenges!!!! A must pick up game for a wonderful experience to game loves of budget games, sims and strategy game lovers.			"

												It's got pretty rough edges. Sometimes downright ugly edges, like missions that get stuck and horrible loss conditions that don't become obvious until an hour into a mission.

Adds a lot more macromanaging of supplies to get good deals on trade agreements.  Constitution was a nice addition to game.  Multiplayer was garabage and everyone in lobby was having trouble starting a multiplayer game.  They need to release patches to make it smoother.  Overall great single player game.			"

												Lately I've been holding off on reviewing many things, due to the nature of many games being worked on continuously and things changing very fluidly.Today I write a big thumbs up for the Tropico 5 team for pulling through on two things that many in the community thought they had ripped us off on.The first, prisons. Why these weren't there at launch is beyond me, considering they were in Tropico 3 & 4, the community thought perhaps we would get nickled and dimed for a prison DLC. The dev team to the surprise of many, at patch 1.08, have hadded the prison and the ability to arrest citizens for FREE.In addition to this, the second large complaint was the 2000 population limit. Tropico 5 offers various huge Islands for the players to build on, much of which would stay empty due to the low population limit. Not to mention the horrible side effect of this limit and multiplayer - in which the total cap was divided among all players. New with patch 1.08 is the ability to change the max population anywhere between the original 2000, and the new high limit of 10,000.I have to say I am very happy to see the devs change their stance on the population cap after community feedback, and would highly recommend this game to anyone. It's done a lot for the series, and is very unique in its approach compared to T3 & T4. Not to mention the devs, while a little slow on the action point here, nontheless pulled through for the community. With my restored faith I may just buy the large upcomming DLC at full price :)			"

												Viva el Presidente!At first I was a bit reluctant to buy the whole collection on sale, since I didn't know if I would like it, now I'm kind of sad I did not buy it, will do on next sale.Game feels pretty challenging, offers a refreshing take on the tycoon genre with a unique dictatorship style spin, and it was an instant addiction after I got the hanging of it. Good dictatorship simulator, would rule again.The good:-Characters are pretty likable and well thought-Dynamics are nice, great replay value-Several possible ways to beat the game-Mods and custom missions are always welcome-Penultimo is damn funny and gets under your skin in no timeThe bad:-Tutorial covers about 5% of the game mechanics-No voice acting for like half the stuff in-game-Some pesky bugs on transport and housing (tropicans building shacks next to affordable housing)Definitely worth a buy, will buy whole collection on next steam sale.

												It kept me entertained for a good few hours as I built a successful and thriving island democracy, but everything changed when the rebels attacked.I became a totalitarian, big brother, martial law dictatorship with limited liberties withtin the space of 2 months.It was fun, I won't deny that and some of the new mechanics were a lovely little touch to the game but, there was no where near as much building variety as there was in Tropico 4 and the same goes for your presidente customization. I did love the new eras mechanic that they added into the game, infact it is what makes the game different from all the other Tropico games.My overall thought on this game though is that I don't know where I actually stand with it. It was amusing wih its cheesy sense of humor but, I found it to be a touch lacking in content. £34.99 is a bit much than I'd be willing to pay for it now that I've played it especially considering the game is only 1.9GB in size. Anyway, If you want a laid back city builder style game then by all means get this.			"

												8 hours in and I still have absolutely no idea what people are complaining about. I've been an avid Tropico player since the very first game. I sank and hours and hours into Tropico 3 (on the Xbox360) and have a ton of time racked up on 4 as well. So when 5 was released and everyone started complaining I was kind of confused. I held off on buying the game until it went on Sale and let me just say that I think it is more than worth the full price. So far it has absolutely everything I love about Tropico and more. No longer is it game over when the US or USSR decide to invade. You can defend yourself! Your presidente gets a single trait, and all of the members of your dynasty get one as well, every time there's an election you can decide which dynasty member you're going to have run for office. You can appoint managers to your buildings which offers a bunch of different ways in which to modify the behavior of the game. No longer are protests are just the populace voicing their displeasure. You can choose to negotiate with them and trigger an event that increases that faction's opinion of you if you complete it. The import/export system has been overhauled to great effect and the trade system is absolutely a pleasure to work with. Same with the reasearch section which adds a new element to the game and removes the feeling that all problems in El Presidente's life can be solved by throwing money at them. I have a mid-low end computer and even on somewhat low settings the game looks gorgeous. It runs smoothly and feels well optimized. There's so much more I could probably go on and on about it. I honestly don't have any complaints. As someone who has played these games from the start I've had so much fun watching it grow and change over the years. This newest iteration doesn't disappoint and promises many hours of play in the future.			"

												The only real issue I have with this game, is that it often creates copies of your ruling family. After playing half the campaign mode, and 1 game in sandbox mode, I had 5 copies of my single ruling family. Not 2: 5. I like the idea of having your family bridge multiple games, but I'll have to throw away 50% of the time spent playing this game if I want to use my family in its most advanced state. It's unfortunate this feature wasn't implimented better.The music and atmosphere of this game is great. It's relaxing to play, and makes you feel stress-free: like being on a tropical island. At the same time, you have a lot of choices to make, and really feel like your decisions are critical for your island's well-being, although quite possibly your citizenry would be well off if you took a ten year nap.. . there are a few annoyances regarding how the game ships resources: effectively all resources are always sent to the docks: if another building on the island requests them, then those resources won't ship off the island--right away--but as your island gets larger, and more demanding, it can be months before resources get picked up. and they end up getting sold instead of transported forward. The addition of a checkbox you could tick to not sell an item if it's stored at a dock, would solve this, but instead the solution is to import much more of a resource than you need and hope some of it's still there when someone arrives to transport it. And don't get all uppity at me and be all ""oh, just build more resource moving dudes:"" the rate of resource movement is fine when there's a surplus of resources. The issue is that, when your power plant needs iron, and then a ship comes in and all your iron gets sold, and now the task ""transport iron to the power plant"" gets lost. . . Then another ship imports iron, and the task ""transport iron the power plant"" is added again, but to the bottom of the queue. Then, before it reaches the top of the queue, another ship arrives and all the iron is sold again. Do you see how this is a problem? Yes, there are some things you can do to outplay the system and get to your own iron before it gets sold, but just having a option to not sell the iron you critically need for your island, would be a much more realistic, simplier solution, which does not exist. Why not?!! I've given you two issues, and these are really the most serious issues I have with the game. Most everything else is clear, and fun to play with. Oh! It does suck that you can't build new buildings during an attack: the time my island got invaded just as a two large military facilities were about to complete, and so I lost: that sucked. The island was in a state of war for a year and half: you're telling me the new barracks couldn't finish training their troops in a year and a half and come to finish off the one enemy unit that survived and slowly plinked away at my manor until it was destroyed?! Okay, so those three things suck, but a lot about this game is really enjoyableI hope that, being more aware of the issues with this game, will help you enjoy it more, because they are issues you can prepare for, and this is really a relaxing, fun, game to play :)			"

												Wonderful, wonderful game.  The realism is decent, the eras system is a positive step in the right direction for this franchise towards long term strategy, and the graphics are as glee and cheerful as Tropico ever gets.This may sound to many as a astounding review of a Tropico 4 Expansion, not an entire leap forward in  the franchise's progress.  This is not to disuade those that may seek to purchase the game, but to warn of the overall downsides.			"

												This game is for every strategy-building-game lover.It has a great sense of humor, which falls between super dumb and really funny.The Gameplay gives a lot of replay-ability to it because you want to try out other types of ""Tropicos"".I really enjoy it, so if u need a game which can fill a lot of time this might be the right choice.

You zoom in just a fuz then its not blurry at all and crisp and clean looking like my screenshots show, how it should work, but no one plays zoomed in.. how can you manage your city then.. so playing this game is stressfull and not fun at all. 3/10 "

												Viva el Presidente!At first I was a bit reluctant to buy the whole collection on sale, since I didn't know if I would like it, now I'm kind of sad I did not buy it, will do on next sale.Game feels pretty challenging, offers a refreshing take on the tycoon genre with a unique dictatorship style spin, and it was an instant addiction after I got the hanging of it. Good dictatorship simulator, would rule again.The good:-Characters are pretty likable and well thought-Dynamics are nice, great replay value-Several possible ways to beat the game-Mods and custom missions are always welcome-Penultimo is damn funny and gets under your skin in no timeThe bad:-Tutorial covers about 5% of the game mechanics-No voice acting for like half the stuff in-game-Some pesky bugs on transport and housing (tropicans building shacks next to affordable housing)Definitely worth a buy, will buy whole collection on next steam sale.

												Very fun in many ways. You can beat campaigns in your play style instead of it being very strict of how you have to play. Playing skirmish is always a new experience. Unfortunatly, multiplayer does not live to its expectation. I only played it to farmed a couple of achievements, and that was it.THE DLC ALL TOGETHER IS £40.88 ! That's some bullsh## for so little content added for 3 games worth .			"

												I would still recommend this game, although I say this with an asterisk. It ceratinly adds to Tropico 4 although doesn't take the concept any further than its simple formula.What I like: -The new buildings and a co-op mode that you can play with your friends, saying that the co-op could be better designed. The new buildings include one that gives you tanks and other jet bombers, so that's pretty cool.-The new factions that change through the time periods. This keeps the game interseting as you have to choose a faction you would like to keep on good grounds.-The trade system. I like this because I can choose trade routhes that suit me if I want to sell a specific resource  at a certain time that I have an adundance of.What I dislike:-The dynasty system and the overall avatar creation. There are like 4 uniforms and the dynasty feels kind of out of place as they never really change. I thought it would add an effect where each dynasty member would stand for a differnet thing in the eyes if the people and that you could replace one dynasty with an other but instead it is just a set of different leaders.- It could be just me but the AI feel a little worse than on Tropico 4, they feel like they have no agency.Overall I would suggest for people who want a new Tropico, but if you are looking for this kind of game with all the things it brings I may still suggest it but I would also equally recommend Tropico 4 with all expansion. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10 as it doesn't feel very fresh compared to 4. "

												One word, disappointing. This was the first and last Tropico I buy on release day, you lost a customer Kalypso(for now, until you change how you treat your fans). I can't believe the lack of effort put in, it's so sad because Tropico 5 does have potential.Pros:-Graphics are better by a little bit, but not much. Although there are some awful textures I noticed like fishing spots having terrible looking 2D fish and the newspaper building having a buggy garden texture.-El Presidente customization is slightly better than the old Tropicos and Slightly worse. I like that you can now customize the colours of your outfit and there is a good selection of faces and hair, but the game is severely lacking in outfit choices(DLC money grab sadly)-WASD Movement!! Thanks for that Kalypso.Cons:-The menus are awful, big step down from Tropico 4.-Less buildings, e.g. No more firestation(It's a police station upgrade now)-Still can't paint ground textures. Such a simple but important feature to fix dirt patches in your city, come on Kalypso.-Building variety is non-existent. What a step down from Tropico 3 & 4 and they didn't even have that great of variety but it was better than nothing, which is what we have here.-Hardly any gardens or objects to place(the stuff that makes your city look alive) limited to 10 small gardens and 6 large gardens( DLC later I'm sure, gross)-Can't control El Presidente anymore, and he doesn't fight in battles either.-El Presidente's ability tree has been downgraded since Tropico 4. Limited to one skill now instead of 3, very sad.-Flags, they look nice but depending how you rotate the buildings causes the flags to look like they're blowing in every direction. Looks bad, trust me.-Time moves a little too fast.-Co-op is awful, nuff' saidConclusion: Buy Tropico 4, it's an awesome game, if you want to buy this turd; I'd say it's worth $5 tops, buy it on sale. Don't expect a great game, but do expect to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by DLC, sadly. I wish I had my $50 back =(			"

												A good game. Compared to Tropico 4, it still has many similarities, but many differences also. I personally like how there are different timezones and technologies for those times. Politics are a bit harder to deal, since there are less general information given that would point you in the direction what to do, but this only makes the game more of challenge.You should be warned though. The game still sometimes gets patches that breaks saves and forces you to start the campaign from beginning			"

												Save your money and get Tropico 4 instead. Tropico 5 takes all of the freedom of the previous versions and carefully parcels it out to you in stages, while eleminating a lot of the deeper elements. This is basically the EA version of Tropico- dumbed down for the lowest common denominator, and fed to you in tiny spoonfuls so you don't get overwhelmed. I suppose if you've never played any of the previous games, it's... okay.			"

												Played many hours. First let's start with riots. I have 75% support, yet If I banish a crime lord, 200 people rebel. If I order kill a rebel, again big group of riot starts. After the riot ends, homeless people and unemployed people rise. I mean I have 600 open jobs 200 unemployed, (nothing to do with education they have same ratio) I have more than 400 empty houses (modern apartments, apartments, tenanments etc.) Yet I have over 100 homeless people. They roads are connected with more than 30 parking lots and metro station. Yet people refuse to work, get in to the house. But if I demolish and rebuild the house, people move in, yet it is huge waste of resources and it is a bug. Second secret police and jails? We had it in tropico 4, yet kalypso suprisingly forgot to put that? Intraction with citizencez expcept for bribing them, will imidieatly cause riot/protest/uprising. If I kill a rebel, bang uprising. If I banish crime lord, bang uprising. If I discredit some leader, bang uprising. I mean, secret police should do that and normal people should not know about it. Crime Lord's must autmaticlly get in to the prison by the cops. But Kalypso ""forgot"" to put that in game. Luckily they will publish DLC's that everyone can afford...Buy this game if you are really huge fan of it. Otherwise you'll get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Tropico 5 offers a wide range of choices for building a city. Industrial, agricultural, or commercial cities all provide amusement. The era system feels great, and trading in the game has never been better. The missions are diverse and funny, with some being a pain in the neck. Technology is nicely executed. I certainly enjoyed watching my people withstand hardships (since I am a dictator). Foreign relations are greatly expanded, and are more complex, accompanying serious dilemmas that can decide the fate of your city. Military power is straightforward and easy to handle, although I wished for more options. Every building seems to be handsomely illustrated. Concerning transportation, I expected multiple road systems, such as: bridges, tunnels, ext. Tourism in the game is really exciting, but most of its buildings are expensive, which can halt construction for a period of time. DLC? meh, don't even bother. In conclusion, Tropico 5 runs smoothly and is fun to play. It brings this simultaneous feeling of simulation and pleasure. Go buy it if you liked Tropico 4. "

												Tropico 5 feels dangerously similar to its recent predecessor, Tropico 4; and shows a strong attempt by the developers to edge out features but maintain the Tropico feel of the game.Adding of multiplayer seems to make the game cut some slack on some of the indiviudal features as compared to its predecessor (e.g fire station has been integrated with the police station in Tropico 5).There are still some rough edges and a recent patch fixes some of it. Most importantly, the option to increasing your population cap to 10000 :D A strong recommendation to all Tropico fans and for the first timer, there is no harm buying Tropico 4 during a major sale before giving Tropico 5 a try.On a personal note, I prefer the voice of Penultimo in Tropico 4 :PHail El Presidente			"

												Tropico 5 is a game that I originally didn't think I would get much out of. It seemed too simple or too narrow of a topic. Just focusing on a small tropical nation. However, I quickly found it to be quite enjoyable.Tropic stars you, El Presidente, as you and your family take your tiny colony through the world wars, cold war, and the present. Making choices about how free your people are, economic and political choices, and balancing the needs of your people, your own bank account, and keeping your grip on power. You may start out as a benevolent leader, but you may find yourself having to take drastic measures and fight off the occasional revolutionary or election opponent.4/5 Cuban Cigars smoked.

												It is a fun game, if you are into comedy city building game genre. However, once you have played it through, then it gets pretty repititive. The same comments, events etc. happening in about each game. It is a bit expensive, but you could buy on sales and have a good amount of hours of fun from this game.It is not a very ""serious"" city building game. It is a comedy city building game. If you want everything to be all serious and realistic, then this is not the right city building game.			"

												I love Tropic 4, played it for hours on end and then more, never a dull moment. Tropico 5 seemed to lack the Zing, The models Textures colors are brilliant, better then Tropico 4. The songs aren't as nice and the host isn't really that funny compared to 4, I wish I could load my own songs into a playlist... It gets annoying after awhile and I have to turn it off.The DLC came out faster then my pubes and ain't cheap either. I'll recommend the game but I will recommend it on a sale.I paid for a few DLCs today, I wouldn't call them DLCs... seriously, paying 4 - 5 bucks for 1 building? a skin, hat and song? Kylpso is getting lots of bad rep from gamers and it will no bold well for the future. I am glad I bought them on a sale basis. Even as it is on sale I felt cheated.I rather you guys make a full big pack of buildings, missions expansion pack, that is what it is used to be called..... expension pack.......let the community mod the character skin, hats and suits... it shouldn't be something to make money out of.

												Tropico 5 is a good game that has the potential to be great.  In this iteration, the developers seemed to have maintained the core mechanics that makes the game work and took several tentative half-steps in a new and mostly good direction.  This cautious innovation has produced mixed results.  Few of the new changes or features are bad, they’re just unfinished or poorly implemented and it becomes painfully obvious when one plays the game that they were not carried out to their logical ends.  And even though, on the whole, it is still a fun experience the game suffers because of these half-steps.    The Good: -Ambiance and artwork.  Tropico is more scenic and beautiful than ever and the soundtrack is the best yet.  While I don’t find the humor in Tropico 5 to be nearly as amusing as Tropcio 4, it still maintains that sardonic sense of humor that is part of the Tropican experience.  I was also underwhelmed by the voice acting and characters.  While not bad, they lack the personality of the characters in 4.  -The Eras.  This is actually one of my favorite parts of the game.  I like the progression from era to era and the way national and international politics is different depending on which era you are in.  I like the continuity as well.  I like the aesthetic of having colonial buildings existing alongside modern ones.  I thought that the addition of tourist buildings that derive extra benefits from nearby colonial buildings was a nice touch.        The Bad:	-The almanac.  In Tropico 3 and 4, all the information that a diligent dictator needed to run a country was easily accessible and clearly presented.  In 5, the almanac, while still containing most (but not all) of the same information, has made it much less accessible and readable.  	-Rebels, coups and civil unrest.  It is not uncommon, for me at least, during the cold war era to have an approval rating above 75% and yet still have a major problem with rebels which often number in the dozens and seem to spawn out of nowhere.  This relates to the almanac in the sense that it can be difficult to discern what exactly the problem is based on the information provided.  Sometimes when I examine individual rebels it is not uncommon for me to find that they are often gainfully employed, generously compensated, comfortably housed and give my regime high approval ratings.  This makes no sense to me.  In addition, the rebels seem overpowered.  I actually like the idea of not having exact numbers and perfect intel on rebel forces, it adds a level or realism to the game.  However the mechanics that govern their behavior and combat abilities seems broken to me.	-Missing Features and buildings.  This is, hands down, the biggest complaint that I have.  To give one example of this: the police now serve as law enforcement and fire protection.  The latter they do well enough.  The former I’m pretty sure they don’t do at all.  It’s maddening to see people identified as crime lords and rebels by the police, walking around without the slightest fear of being arrested or shot.  And in any case, there’s no jail, dungeon or labor camp to lock them up in.  That’s just one example.  There are several buildings, edicts, and activities (e.g. campaign speeches, official workplace visits from El Presidente, the secret police with their extremely useful and covert skillset.) that are missing from Tropico 5 that really need to be there.  In this respect Tropico 4 is actually, at this point, still far superior to Tropico 5.     The Half-Steps (i.e. good and bad):	-The Dynasty.  The most underwhelming of the new features, the dynasty function feels like it was tacked on at the last minute and is not fully integrated into the game mechanics which is too bad because I think there are some interesting possibilities.	-Research Tree.  While not especially deep or complex, this feature does add a nice progression mechanism to the game.  I like it much better than buildings simply becoming available after a certain year.    	-The Tropican Army.  It’s nice to see that the Tropican armed forces have finally learned how to fight as units as opposed to individual soldiers.  It’s also nice that they’ve learned how to drive tanks and fly jet fighters as opposed to displaying them as useless set pieces like in Tropico 4.  That being said, it is very unfortunate that, for all their improvements, they basically still suck at what they do.  As far as I can tell, when the palace is threatened, all units (that haven’t already been routed by the super-rebels) will converge on it to defend it.  Other than that, there seems to be no centralized command and control mechanic that governs how your soldiers and their support vehicles behave.  	-Multiplayer.  I have not tried the multiplayer mechanic and have no interest in it.  While I’m sure that there are those who enjoy it, I thought from its announcement that it was unnecessary and out of place in a game like Tropico and I wish that the resources dedicated to its development had been tasked to other aspects of the game that are lacking.

												""Chances are, if you’re a “Tropico” fan, you’re going to pick this up anyway despite what reviewers may say.  As such, allow me to address those completely new to the series.  “Tropico 5″ doesn’t exactly redefine the series, but it makes some very ground-breaking additions that make playing the game much more enjoyable.  It unfortunately takes away some really important features (setting rents & wages to an exact value, etc.), but adds almost just as much to keep things interesting.  If you’re on the fence about dropping forty bucks (the price as of 4/30/14), then go and download “Tropico 3″ or “Tropico 4″ for much cheaper.  They won’t give you the full experience (“Tropico 4″ with “Modern Times” comes closest), but will give you an idea if you can handle life as “El Presidente”.  If you can’t, then you’re only out ten or twenty bucks instead of forty.  As a whole though, “Tropico 5″ is a joy to play and I’m looking forward to many, many hours of ruthless dictatorship the likes of which my Tropicans have never seen.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/tropico-5/

												I find Tropico 5 to be a decent game. Some of the additions compared to T4 are nice, like the era's. Others feel contrived, like the dynasty system. Assigning managers to buildings becomes tedious quite quickly, and not very rewarding in most cases. Both T4 and T5 ask for a bit of micro-managing, and while T4 makes it feel meaningful, T5 makes it feel like a chore.The game feels less fleshed out and polished compared to its predecessor, and I find T4 a lot more fun to play. I would advice potential players to buy Tropico 4 with all DLC on a sale instead of T5.			"

												Tropico 5 is a really well made City Simulator, with a great storyline in the background to boost. It really makes you think how you want to prioritise everything you do, from resource production to invasion defenses. Not to mention the ridiculous humour the game provides from a variety of colourful characters and factions all out to get each others throats. Definitely worth buying, have not regretted a single moment of it! Have had many hours already both serious time and casual derping, and just never got tired of the possibilities!10/10			"

												This game will be great (when it's done.) I dont recommend buying this game at this price right now. It's worth maybe $20 and I regret buying it. If they released a huge content addition for free tomorrow I'd change my mind. Seems at this stage to be a demo, albiet a really fun one. The game is extremely easy and has tons of personality, so I had a blast playing it. But, I tried to drag things out not wanting it to end too soon but it did. If you have the money to spare and a free afternoon, by all means get this game. I did not experience all the glitches I've read about and I only lost one time on normal. It's the best so far in the series but man, is it short.			"

												Sadly I can't recommend this game. I am a big fan of the Tropico games and was excited when I finally got my hands on it to play it. But after playing it, beating the missions and doing some sandbox games, there is something definitely wrong with this version of the game. For one thing there seems to be money issues all the time. With no matter what you have set up you are always losing money as you get into the game. Your popularity goes to low  levels that you have no way of recovering from and you get military take overs with no way to get out of that situation. Tropico 4 had it all and fine tuned it and the game was just fun. This one is like Tropico 4 with less options. less fun and more frustration.  The game is supposed to be fun. And for some reason they removed all the elements that were fun in the previous installment. I do like that they tried to come up with new ideas for the series with going through time periods and having family members you can add but instead of removing things that were in prior versions and making the game much harder and frustrating .. how about just improving on the previous edition and remembering that the game is supposed to be fun too? Its not fun always losing money, having everyone hate the president and having less options in the game. Sadly  just not enjoying it like I hoped I would. I played this one a lot as you can see from my time put into it. So its not just a quick play to come to this final decision here. Tropico 4 so much better. Hopefully Tropico 5 will be improved in later patches but I can't recommend this game as it is currently stands. Sorry just was so short and disapointing. No way am I spending another cent on DLC for this mess. The game is supposed to be more fun as you get to the present and beyond. Not ridiculously unfair. Sometimes I think developers are too smart for their own good.			"

I love Tropico but I'm hoping the developers go back to the roots. I would rather pay 30-50$ for a game which is ''complete'' (stuffed with a lot of new! content) than this with a lot of crappy DLC's. So I would recommend this game to everyone because it is fun, but wait for a good price.			"

												The idea of the game is pretty cool, but it still lacks the completion and amendments for the game that make it perfect. I played it like five or six hours and literally couldn't stop, you as a dictator governing your own island and manage and watch it pace into more modern stages. Each stage of an era is a new start, you will have new foreign powers influencing your island's future, you will have to trade as much as possible to fulfill your treasury bag. If your first start at a innately rich island, you basically just need to export as much as possible, making your dictated country rich and prosperous. Build more and more buildings, infrastructures, research facilities, education facilities, be the most self-righteous gwuy in the world and implement it to your real urban planning. As I'm bit interesting in urban planning, this game literally give you the chances to build a city on the basis of all your ideas. In other word, be the most ♥♥♥♥ing awesome guy in the world and your countrymen will kneel down as much as possible, if they don't, make them. ;) The idea of owing an island in Carribean Sea is as cool as developing it into something you aspire to. And the ultimate goal I guess is to develop it into a country that is as strong and powerful enough to be able to against superpowers manipulating you for long. Anyway, till here, the game is kinda cool, but there are defects that it has to address.Typically, the battle element. The game focuses on mostly construction and governing, but the battle is awful. You can't build anything during a battle, you can't save your palace as long as you don't have enough manpowers to fight back, and literally watching it collapse (WTF?!). And the invasion of superpowers are just op, your squads of soldiers literally do nothing but wandering around and getting high I guess, they just get beaten up one by one or just basically get vanquished. And one building only produce one squad of infantry, which is painful, you basically don't have anything to against superpowers army when you only built three or four military facilities. And once your palace is compromised, the game is over, you lose and you have to start it over. And rebels, they are just as annoying as your neighborhood granny, once you stepped into more modern eras they r like periods basically wouldn't stop and appearing periodically. And once appeared a rebellion force you will have to eliminate them, and we start to talk about battle. Yeah, battle is just painful and bad. I wondering why they still haven't fix it or upgrade it since the game has released almost one year and a half and more, and there are people complaining about it.  You can't take peoples money and do nothing. That's basically it, think before you buy.有没有官中无所谓，简单一句话，战斗太蛋疼，被打的时候还不能造兵怎么让我好好大独裁!?			"

												In a word: Over-complication. T3 and T4 are some of my most favorite games. Each with their own liitle quirks, but totally enjoyable. T5 manages to improve on one of my biggest pet peeves from previous installments: Farms now have clearly defined areas in which to grow crops. And that is ALL T5 does for the series. Every single other action is over-complicated to the Nth degree. I can barely enjoy sandbox mode because, surpirse, it's no sandbox. No matter what you do, or what you WANT to do (that is the point of a sandbox, afterall), you're going to be following the same damn repetitious timeline for each and every game. Nevermind the fact that it's boring and complicated, it just doesn't feel finished. Thoroughly dissappointed in this game. Haven't lost hope for the series, hopefully someone at Haemimont is paying attention to this stuff.			"

												Enjoyable overall, but far too streamlined. Somewhat of a disappointment, if you want to play Tropico play Tropico 4, especially with the Modern Times expansion. The Dynasty feature was my favorite part, but too many quests, too easy, too much hand-holding. An example- workers no longer need to walk to their place of business to count as working. Hooray, right? Well... If you hate garages and the entire set of infrastructure that went along with that. The walking was very frustrating- but it made the game more satisfying when you figured it out. In Tropico 5 you don't need to figure it out. I was halfway through the campaign before I realized you could scroll down on the almanac. Just too easy.			"

I played Tropico 3 (haven't played 4 yet) and prefer it a little more, even if it has a little less polish, because the gameplay in Tropico 3 feels more expansive. Tropico 5 is beautiful though.If you're a SimCity player, Tropico 3 is like SimCity 2000/3000 (old but great reception and lasting gameplay), and Tropico 5 is like SimCity 4 (new, graphically polished, but poor reception due to reduced gameplay variety).

												Wow, while so many other franchises are releasing lifeless clones made with more modern middleware. Tropico 5 adds gameplay to the existing strong strategic game mechanic, while increasing the graphics and streamilining the gameplay through use of often comical npc interactions which keep the game moving, adding TRUE online multiplayer, featuring a masterful invite friendlist ready system as well as a join random games list. The TRUE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER GAMEPLAY is done exceptionally  well too. What a superb addition to an already bright futured franchise. I can honestly say this is the first game I can remember enjoying its sequel more than its original... We couldnt be more happy with this title. If I had to find some cons to the amazing list of pros this title boasts, I would have to say the lack of a multiplayer save function and no Lan option. However because the Online multiplayer has been working so exceptionally well since day two, You probably will not miss LAN very much. The only worry I have is when we manage to last hours and one of us runs out of time, the game is effectively over. I hope they will add the multiplayer save in the future. What a great game I highly recomend! ^^PS great music too, but thats not news with this franchise :)			"

There are some things i miss from past games but many of the new gameplay features make up for that. Multiplayer is alot of fun, competing and battling. 100% Reccomend it if you are on the fence and into these types of game. This is a great addition tot he Tropico franchise and keeps the humor and great gameplay that the past games have.~Sim			"

												Tropico 4 was a slightly more polished Tropico 3 with a few more buildings. Tropico 5 is far from a remake of Tropico 3 or 4 - But not in a good way. The features and mechanics of this game are, in addition to beeing unpolished, just bad features. The era concept look entertaining on paper untill you realize the only one that matters is the last one and everything up to that is a chore and not at all entertaining. The mulitplayer is a complete joke. What bugged me the most is still the way you regulate a buildings budget. This system is supposed to reduce micomanagement (just what the city-builder needs) but ends up giving you much more micomanagment and less control over your citizens development.This might be a good game after an expansion and a couple of dlcs. But I would still not reccomend buying this game and rewarding Kalypso for releasing what is, plain and simple, just a bad game			"

												Tropico 5 expands on the old things that made the Tropico series great.

I know that Tropico 2 was comparatively a failure and its pirates theme was probably part of that, but I'm not asking for that much of a deviation. The one thing I would absolutely love for Tropico to do is to take the same everything its known for and place it into different nationality themes. Its great to be Castro for a while, but maybe sometimes I want to be Kim Jung Un, or Idi Amin, or even Erich Honecker. I would love to see a game exactly like Tropico that let me do everything tropico does but with a different ethnicity of people, a different flag, and a different climate.			"

												Tropico 5 is an extremely detailed, hilarious game that's basically a dictator simulator merged together with a city building game. I think that this blend of two interesting genres really works, and I have a lot of fun playing with my friend, competing, but also helping, each other. I highly recommend this game, though it is certainly a lot more fun if you have some people you know playing with you. Overall, I'd give it 8/10.  "

												I love Tropico and have done since my first experience as El Presidente in the original (i love it so much that i rebought 1-4 on steam). For a long time all I ever played were city building games, and I will say that the Tropico series are my favourites. While yes Simcity (the old ones) and even the new Cities Skylines are enjoyable, I usually get bored of the city I'm building after a while with the whole zoning, waiting for people to come to the city and build house/shops/industry build some services then repeat. The Anno series steps it up with you building each building, production chains and the occasional quest making it more engaging for me. Tropico gives me that but it also brings a fantastic humour to my megalomania experience (sorry in advance if I over use humour/funny etc, but it's true) that has me laughing out loud every time I play it and after nearly 300 hours of play I'm still not bored.In this latest instalment the humour that has kept me endlessly amused in previous games is still fantastic (I wish we could all have a Penultimo in our lives). The building models are done with great detail, the colours and textures of my island paradise are amazing. I sometimes like to zoom the camera right in and tilt it so it's like you standing at street level and watch the occasional sunset/rise.I used to feel that I never really had enough time lording over my adoring subjects (benevolently lording, most of the time anyway), especially in sandbox with games 3 and 4, but with the eras setup in this latest instalment I’m in El Presidente heaven. The addition of the colonial time is really nice, when declaring independence I always say 'let the redcoats come, I ain't paying the crown anything' (I'm actually British before anyone says anything). And the era specific random quests have fantastic humour in their delivery. There's one quest during the world wars era where La resistance needs messenger animals, the result of each animal tried - pigs are too tasty and become bacon before reaching their destination, still make me laugh every time. I know there have been a lot of disagreements over the whole DLC thing, I have to admit with other games I've thought they were a bit of a rip off, but with Topico's I've been really quite please. For £2.50 the small single mission ones have kept me entertained for at least a weekend on each play, the 2 £14.99 new campaign ones at least a couple, so I see them as good value (I have played them all more than once). The new random 'side quests' that accompany the DLC's are just as funny as those in the vanilla game and playing through the main campaign again with them popping up can drastically change how things play out. I failed a mission during my 10th play through of the main campaign after the addition of the Mad World and Espionage DLC's, due to a revolt caused by my overuse of banish/kill of crime lords and enemy spies. It was hilarious. So I have bought them all and I probably will continue to buy anymore that come out - if anyone from Kalypso is reading this I loved Pirate Cove, so if you wouldn't mind doing a piratey DLC. As Lulu say's everything is better with pirates!The one thing I will say I don't like and that's the complete reduction in advisors/representatives. I miss Miss Pineapple and her love of spanking (her little guest appearance visiting the fish people in one of the new side quests from the Waterborne DLC was a nice addition). Where's El Diablo telling me to stop letting the riffraff in. And while I love Lulu's radio show, Sunny and Penultimo's banter in 4 was just as fun (maybe they could do a guest spot). What happened to the other nations diplomats? Sometimes I could do with the 30,000 instead of the promised camelI’ve would definitely recommend Tropico 5 to anyone who likes city building games and I hope that Kalypso will continue to bring us more life as El Presidente			"

												I don't think this is a terrible game, and if you're bored or not worried about the cash - sure, buy it.But it's not great.  I think the series (or developer) has gone a little bit creatively bankrupt .. clearly struggling to find new ways to reinvent the game.  (Which, strictly speaking, I don't think you need to do - you can just improve on the existing formula).What I mean is - rather than look for substantial changes, make iterative ones - make the underlying financial simulation stronger, make the graphics better, make the islands larger ... and then make it all about the story-telling and controlled challenges in the scenario.Instead, it feels like they've kind of tried to reinvent a bit .. consolidating concepts that came up in Tropico 4 DLCs (like changing eras) and introduce them into this game.  Problem is it all feels shallow.  There's this dynasty concept where you can have children, raise them, have them fulfil roles in your dynasty (but you yourself don't die, apparently).  There's just .. I don't know .. a shallowness to it all that makes you start yawning before you're even halfway through the game.They've also left core elements out of the game, and a lot of the stuff that made Tropico 4 interesting (such as balancing the factions) has been de-emphasised in Tropico 5.It feels to me that Tropico 5 is kind of like the wanna-be cool grandad of Tropico 4 .. it's actually older and less edgy, but it tries to dress up in a younger persons clothes and act cool .. but you can kind of tell it's struggling to keep up the charade and running out of ideas.It was hard to decide whether YES I DO recommend this game or NO I DON'T.  For me it's marginal .. if you're looking for a city builder with it's own personality, why not ?  It's not a terri♥♥♥♥♥♥game .. it's just not great.			"

												I DIG city builder games and I went into this with as positive an attitude as someone possibly could.  After 10 hours of repetitive gameplay unfortunately the experience is incredibly 'lightweight' and disappointing.  Much of my time has been spent alt+tabbing to find the solution to something on a Steam guide, which sometimes turns out to be 'just a bug' or 'guesswork'.Cons:- City builder elements are very shallow.  You upgrade Police Stations to put out fires as there are no Fire Stations. Tropico lacks the essential city building elements of its rivals, and it doesn't do a good job of explaining or giving information on the elements that it does have.  There is no 'traffic', and no feedback or information as to how your production network even runs.- Strategy elements are near non existent.  You plonk down some houses and some farms then after a while you get enough money to plonk down the next thing.  You do get attacked by rebels but there is zero strategy involved with how it plays out.- A huge issue with lack of information.  How many construction offices do I need?  How many Teamster offices do I need?  How much stock makes up the 'other' stock which is about to be shipped out - why can't I expand that window to see how much I am actually producing?- Communication ambiguities, for example, 'setting the budget' on a house actually means 'raising the rent', not the budget you give towards the upkeep of houses, like you do for other buildings.- Housing bugs, for example citizens refusing to live in houses and instead declare themselves 'homeless' even though you have set their salaries high and the rent of the houses low.  No information is given as to why citizens would be homeless, and after searching online though guides, this is possibly a bug.- Lack of building variety, even with the DLC buildings, which are very unreasonably priced.- Voice acting is used sparingly.- 'Advanced trading mechanics' - lol, good one.- Even when on amicable terms, signing an alliance treaty with the Axis results in them invading you, then you defeating them, and then them immediately agreeing to the alliance after they declared a 'mini-war' on you for initiating an alliance treaty.  That's not what I'd call a believable simulation of the diplomatic and strategic implications of an alliance...Lastly the population is capped at 2000, you have the option to raise it up to 10000, but raising it above 2000 comes with a warning message about game stability and bug issues.  If I can only populate 10% of an island then where's the fun in that?			"

												It is not a bad game but it has too many problems which limit the fun.  It is better to buy Tropico 4 instead.The game is considerably harder with a stronger military focus.  You absolutely must build your military up to high levels which means your economy will be strained.  Unfortunately it is excessive and stupidly implemented. The UI and generation of your characters and island are not very good.  The are less buildings and the game needs more time control.It is relatively attractive on par with Tropico 4 and the quest system is a little better.  I did not enjoy the music much but YMMV.  The game makes an attempt to cover a longer time period with eras and dynastic elements which needed to be implemented better.Buy Tropico 4 instead.			"

												I do not recommend this game because of its various bugs and flaws. First of all: This is like the 4 games before in this series. The concept is not new: build your island, control your money, eliminate rebels, do a tiny bit of diplomacy. After one or two tries you will realize that this game is much to easy compared to other simulations.And there are some really annoying things about this game:- You can't control immigration. Even if you restrict immigrants to only educated people you will get swarmed by them. They will be homeless and unemployed and rebel costantly.- You can't control stored goods. Even if you essentially need goods like Uranium, the game will sell it. You even can't check how much goods you have stored. Only in your harbor and that's where you don't want to have them- the transportation system is completly bugged. If you add tourists your roads will be one single traffic jam. But your people completly ignore alternative roads but simply pick the shortest route. Even if it takes years. Also you are forced to place production buildings directly next to the resources. Otherwise they will never get them. And later in the game even that doesn't work. If you want to play a city simulation that really works then try Cities Skylines. This one will only frustrate you.

												Right now with the state of affairs with the game I wouldn't really buy this. You're best to wait until all the DLC is out and for a fairer price as it seems that some buildings are currently locked out to be DLC that seem to be pretty base to the experience for example - Prisons. Without it makes policing a lot harder and you can't put Crime Lords in Prison the best thing you can do is Banish or Kill them (which will result in Rebels = bad).So while I like the game and it is fun to play it's really not the FULL experience I'd expect from something being developed when all the game files are in place but just need you to buy the DLC from Kalypso, as someone who's bought and played all the other Tropicos through time I am deeply saddened by the move to DLC than releasing a fully fledged functioning game.

												I was one of the many die-hard Tropico fans who was suckered into pre-ordering this game. Tropicos 1 - 4 were all amazing, I can't even begin to count how many hours I've blown playing them on PC and X-Box. And I don't regret a minute playing any of them. So when I heard Tropico 5 was coming out, and it would include features like multiple eras and even a Constitution, I got very excited and pre-ordered ASAP.Big mistake. The game is buggy as hell, some things they refuse to fix. The Constitution options for immigration? Forget about it. They don't make a lick of difference. Even if you ban immigration you still get bunches of immigrants (illegal aliens, anyone?). The entire game has been simplified and dumbed down. And forget about better graphics. Buildings may look sleek from a distance, but zoom in and they are flat and pixelated in the extreme.Just about everything I loved from Tropico 4 was cut out of the game, and precious little was put back in to make up for it. This game is bland, boring, and a complete betrayal of the fan base. Do yourself a favour: buy Tropico 4. I promise it'll be more worth your money than this piece of crap.			"

												I played this on console and then returned my rental to buy it on PC. I will say this, its not a well balanced game. The whole corn over powering your teamsters issue is terrible balancing, I have to remember the kinks of the game just to maneuver through. And sometimes one mistep into a buggy type of balance can throw off your whole island. The DLC is ridiculous. I love the ideas they are putting out but have to wait til its not the cost of buying the whole game twice over. If there are DLC hungry players out there I feel for your wallets. I got spoiled on tropic 3 and 4 since I adopted on PC late sand got the steam special editions with all the DLC. But Ive been a player since you could foster wars with countries as a pirate king, I honestly miss those days. Its a good game for a tropico fan willing to learn a buggy system and deal with patches and high price dlcs til it goes on sale. If youre as passive as I am about this games situation then take the plunge.			"

												Tropico 5 is a very nice improvement to Tropico 4. i like Many of the featurespros-Co-op-Time Periods-Many new Buildings-Ability to raise your own armyCons (in my opinion)-There seem to be alot of DLC for the product listed.-Disasters happen alot even when its set on occasionalNeutrals-Approval seems very fluctuating, very difficult to keep above normal. while i do like this, it gets annoying at times.

												It's a great game and is going in the right track management-wise, but it just lacks the fun, wit, and charm that Tropico 4 had.  If you're a Tropico fan, then by all means get T5.  If you've never played Tropico before, get the complete version of T4, then decide if you want T5.  Tropico games are always great, but this one just isn't quite as fun as T4.If I gave T4 a 9/10, this would be a 7.75/10.			"

												I have had a lot of fun with this series. Is it perfect? No. But as you build your city, your putting into place the laws/rules of your country. Some of your people will love you, others will love to see you hang. You dont have to please them all, just keep the majority and you will survive.			"

												It is an OK game at best, I feel that their is so little content that they provide for you that it really is not worth buying. Unless you can get the game and all the add ons for at least 75% off or more I would say hold off and wait till then. The game is fun, but it requires you to buy dlc after dlc which I am very much against unless the game is crazy fun.			"

												If you're going to play a tropico game, play either 3 or 4, they are superior in almost every way. 5 is nothing more than nickel and diming (screw over) the customers. It's been proven some of the so-called dlc's were PART OF THE GAME AND DISABLED, so you are forced to pay for them to turn them back on. It's like buying a car, but forced to pay extra in order to start the car, or use the lights, etc, etc. The only reason I got the game is because it was 80% off. And the only way I'll get the add-on is again, 75% or more off. It is NOT worth more then that. So many buildings are missing, it's pathetic.  Again, if you want to play tropico, only play 3 or 4, unless you can get it for 75% or more off.As for tropico 5 play, it's frustrating. You are forced to play only 2 maps. Your own city builds. Win too quickly and you auto-screw yourself for a auto-lose. Like one mission is timed and you are required to do research to be allowed to build something. You will never make it if you won too quickly on the previous mission of that island.Other things will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, like many entertainment buildings LIMITS how many are allowed to visit and therefore limits your profit. That alone really screws up the city build.There is also a HIDDEN rating system like even though happyness in the charts show 55%+, your rating on the tab says 40's%. ZERO chance to guess why. Maybe housing, maybe limits of the entertainment buildings. Screws you up trying to get re-elected.Some missions AUTO-LOSE if you take too long as well. Or force hotels to never fill even though they filled to the max the mission before on that island over and over. Many parts of the game almost made me destroy my keyboard a few times. Something tropico 4 or older never did.It's like you would love the game, if it didn't screw you over so many times in so many different ways.			"

												I love Tropico and have done since my first experience as El Presidente in the original (i love it so much that i rebought 1-4 on steam). For a long time all I ever played were city building games, and I will say that the Tropico series are my favourites. While yes Simcity (the old ones) and even the new Cities Skylines are enjoyable, I usually get bored of the city I'm building after a while with the whole zoning, waiting for people to come to the city and build house/shops/industry build some services then repeat. The Anno series steps it up with you building each building, production chains and the occasional quest making it more engaging for me. Tropico gives me that but it also brings a fantastic humour to my megalomania experience (sorry in advance if I over use humour/funny etc, but it's true) that has me laughing out loud every time I play it and after nearly 300 hours of play I'm still not bored.In this latest instalment the humour that has kept me endlessly amused in previous games is still fantastic (I wish we could all have a Penultimo in our lives). The building models are done with great detail, the colours and textures of my island paradise are amazing. I sometimes like to zoom the camera right in and tilt it so it's like you standing at street level and watch the occasional sunset/rise.I used to feel that I never really had enough time lording over my adoring subjects (benevolently lording, most of the time anyway), especially in sandbox with games 3 and 4, but with the eras setup in this latest instalment I’m in El Presidente heaven. The addition of the colonial time is really nice, when declaring independence I always say 'let the redcoats come, I ain't paying the crown anything' (I'm actually British before anyone says anything). And the era specific random quests have fantastic humour in their delivery. There's one quest during the world wars era where La resistance needs messenger animals, the result of each animal tried - pigs are too tasty and become bacon before reaching their destination, still make me laugh every time. I know there have been a lot of disagreements over the whole DLC thing, I have to admit with other games I've thought they were a bit of a rip off, but with Topico's I've been really quite please. For £2.50 the small single mission ones have kept me entertained for at least a weekend on each play, the 2 £14.99 new campaign ones at least a couple, so I see them as good value (I have played them all more than once). The new random 'side quests' that accompany the DLC's are just as funny as those in the vanilla game and playing through the main campaign again with them popping up can drastically change how things play out. I failed a mission during my 10th play through of the main campaign after the addition of the Mad World and Espionage DLC's, due to a revolt caused by my overuse of banish/kill of crime lords and enemy spies. It was hilarious. So I have bought them all and I probably will continue to buy anymore that come out - if anyone from Kalypso is reading this I loved Pirate Cove, so if you wouldn't mind doing a piratey DLC. As Lulu say's everything is better with pirates!The one thing I will say I don't like and that's the complete reduction in advisors/representatives. I miss Miss Pineapple and her love of spanking (her little guest appearance visiting the fish people in one of the new side quests from the Waterborne DLC was a nice addition). Where's El Diablo telling me to stop letting the riffraff in. And while I love Lulu's radio show, Sunny and Penultimo's banter in 4 was just as fun (maybe they could do a guest spot). What happened to the other nations diplomats? Sometimes I could do with the 30,000 instead of the promised camelI’ve would definitely recommend Tropico 5 to anyone who likes city building games and I hope that Kalypso will continue to bring us more life as El Presidente			"

												I played Tropico 4 and fell in love with the series, that game was near perfection for a city building series. I then played Tropico 3 and loved that too. It had less features than Tropico 4 but was still fun. Tropico 5 is terrible compared to the two and that's putting it nicely. They literally took 20 step backwards to try and pretty up the game. But in doing so they made the game much tougher to run and just plain slow unless you have a pc that's not 2 years or older. T5 also has very little features compared to the other Tropico games. They essentially want you to buy the DLCs and they did that by literally stripping all the features that made tropico great to package them into dlc to make extra $$$. When companies do that to their games it strips the quality in the game and you can tell if you just get the base game. Do yourself a favor wait until the game is like $15 with all the dlc content packaged together. You'll save yourself money and MIGHT actually enjoy it in the end.			"

												Tropico 5 is an extremely detailed, hilarious game that's basically a dictator simulator merged together with a city building game. I think that this blend of two interesting genres really works, and I have a lot of fun playing with my friend, competing, but also helping, each other. I highly recommend this game, though it is certainly a lot more fun if you have some people you know playing with you. Overall, I'd give it 8/10.  "

												It's an addictive game, which makes it all the more infuriating when a game you tell it to save... doesn't save.  I've caught it in the bug too, checking the save time of the file that was JUST saved, and finding it a few hours old (loading the game confirms it's not displaying the save time incorrectly).  The game is over a year old, and among the many bugs is the inability for it to consistantly save your game.  Un-freaking-forgivable.  And I played Cities for years, so I have a huge bug tolerance.  Not saving the game consistently?  How do you justify that?			"

												I played this on console and then returned my rental to buy it on PC. I will say this, its not a well balanced game. The whole corn over powering your teamsters issue is terrible balancing, I have to remember the kinks of the game just to maneuver through. And sometimes one mistep into a buggy type of balance can throw off your whole island. The DLC is ridiculous. I love the ideas they are putting out but have to wait til its not the cost of buying the whole game twice over. If there are DLC hungry players out there I feel for your wallets. I got spoiled on tropic 3 and 4 since I adopted on PC late sand got the steam special editions with all the DLC. But Ive been a player since you could foster wars with countries as a pirate king, I honestly miss those days. Its a good game for a tropico fan willing to learn a buggy system and deal with patches and high price dlcs til it goes on sale. If youre as passive as I am about this games situation then take the plunge.			"

												As a big fan of the Tropico series: This game is good, But not good enough to recommend. Here's the difference between this and Tropico 4 By the way these are the things that pop right at you:Contrast: (Bad) They got rid of how your government is raised at the begining and Traits aren't as large.  Maps aren't as large and nice. The music  doesn't seem as good to me. Contrast (Good) Eras They're all good besides the colonial era. The Campaign seems more important than the last. It has much improved graphics, The combat seems more accurate: Like you have a sqaud of 6,000 guys and the enemy has sqauds with about 7,000 guys or so, Which sounds better than Rebels- 1 Your army- 12, <--- That made me fell small and puny, Like what if an actual military came it'd crush me.  Both good and bad: The trade system you can trade more things, But if your people are starving and you build a banana farm, They'll export it. If you're a Big fan of the Tropico series you might want to  consider buying this, But for the Newbies just buy Tropico 4.			"

												Tropico 5 removed the only thing that made it stand out from the other city building games; the ability to play as a dictator. With no propaganda, cult of personality or prisons and “accidents” for dissidents, Tropico 5 is a disappointment to its predecessors and nothing but a mediocre city building game. For those who enjoyed playing as a ruthless Caribbean dictator, save yourself the disappointment. For those seeking a fun city building game, I recommend purchasing games like Anno or Sim City instead.			"

												The latest iteration of Kalypso Media's Tropico series, you take the reins of controlling your very own dynasty in order to create thriving metropolises right smack in the middle of a tropical island. Those familiar with the Tropcio series will feel right at home here with the fan favorite city building style that Tropico has to offer, but with some distinct gameplay, UI and graphical changes that spice up the series. For those unfamiliar with this game as well as the previous installments, the series is very Sim City-esque but with a refreshing take on the city building genre, giving you free rein on your citizens to do what you please. Want to be a absolute dictator, policing your city completely, riging elections and stopping the immigration of people all together? You can. Overall, I highly recommend this game, as well as the previous Tropico games. It might be worth it to pick up Tropico 3 or 4 with all DLC's if they go on sale before buying this game to get a feel for the series.			"

												It's alright, but I'd recommend playing Tropico 1, it's just much much better. Sure, graphics are nice.... but the actual gameplay is lacking. There is just no challenge. It's soooo easy in this game to get enough money... and then you just do whatever you want.It's relaxing.... but I want challenges. If I want to relax I grab a book, gin&tonic, sit next to the fireplace and I have it.			"

												El Presidente Cisco-Ronaldo here.   I’m dictator of a beautiful tourist island. I have two gold mines.  My Swiss bank account is overflowing with cash. I’ve got keys to nukes and I have never lost an election. Sure I may have buried a few leaders of the opposition, but I was just following the advice of the famous arborist Thomas Jefferson –“the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of protestors and truant citizens.”  The media knows how to communicate such messages, yes yes, because I carry, for them, a long stick of seductive power and magnificent opulence.  Oh, and I speak softly.  Come closer so I can whisper again about the special rainbow narwhale keychain I have, from which hangs my precious, the illustrious golden nuclear apocalypse key.  Isn’t it beautiful!

												Tropico 5 is still a Tropico game through and through, although it is a slight step below Tropico 4.There has been a lot of reviews that say that Tropico 4 is better, and it is, but Tropico 5 is still a fun game and that doesn't mean you should skip it.In Tropico you still play as a lovable dictator leading his latin america island to glory. You have to manage the economy, population happiness, military defence and politics in order to survive.There is flexibility in what economy you want, whether it be exporting raw materials like iron and coffee, turning them into goods like steel or canned food, or tourism.Politics is more advanced than in Tropico 4, where you have the Constitution which affects your country in different ways, and what you choose will affect your standings with the external world powers and also the internal factions in your country.The things that Tropico 4 did better are little things like Penultimo being voiced by a goofy hilarious voice actor, but in Tropico 5 he sounds like a monotonous person with no charisma.Tropico 4 also had nice music with the singing, but Tropico 5 doesn't.These little things however create the funny and fun atmosphere that Tropico is famed for, and something that is slightly missing in Tropico 5.Overall Tropico 5 is still a good game for people who love the franchise. But if you have never played Tropico 4, that game may be more worth your money.			"

												Well , if you have already played previous tropico's then this review is for you , BUT if this is the first tropico you have ever play , then this review is for you aswell :DAlright , for the previous players of tropico you may find this one is easy , with slight compeition and more realistic ways of getting things done , how? well they have added exporting/importing system to be more ''manual'' than just an automatic process , meaning is you can sell your production with higher prices if you get yourself a nice contract , and importing with all its types needs to be done manually. this might be abit harder for the players who first time play tropico through this 1. also the animation of military has been improved , got to be more realistic and more variable. soldiers / tanks / aircrafts / gun towers etc.-The humor in this tropico is slightly less than the previous ones but it didn't vanish.-The dosage of fun when you play either campaign , or single/multiplayer has much more improved than previous ones.-Graphics , textures , buildings has been improved to fit a realistic standards without damaging the purpose of the game.-Choices choices choices , well you get to do more things in this one , so u get to have everything in old tropicos with bounses. BUT HOW COME THEY FORGOT TO ADD PRISONS !!!!??? -Resources variation has been increased , also manufactoring system has been improved , to better.in other words , if this is the first time you play tropico , you will find it one of its kind between the other games in this similar genre , and if tropico 5 isn't your first experince with this title , you will enjoy the variation and upgrades that shows the effort that was put on this one. i recommend having this game either in full/discount prices 10/10.

												Such a fun but horribly flawed city builder.  I spent the time I have in this game developing my island into a democratic, high liberty, and manufacturing mega plex. Single player only review.Positives-You can develop your island as you see fit (manufacturing, tourist focused, agriculture power house, or any combination)-Streamlined development options for your island-Start in colonial era and work your way into the modern era-Foreign affairs with robust trade options for several other countries-Robust government management (write a constitution with various effects and issue edicts, LOTSA edicts)-Many interesting and unique buildings *IF* you purchase the DLCs (I got them all for .99 during holiday sales)-Military options and invasions (see negatives)-Great graphics, entertaining voice acting, good cha-cha music, humurousNegatives-Poor implementation of the military aspect (if you are going to implement something do it right). Poor pathfinding, very little or no control over military units-Rebels everywhere! No matter what you do you are going to♥♥♥♥♥♥some faction off and they will attack frequently.  It doesnt matter how nice your island is. It dfoesnt matter how free your government is.  It also doesnt matter if you have a 95% happiness rating. It doesnt matter if everyone is filthy rich and living in a mansion.  You WILL get attacked by rebels.-Strange citizen behavior.  Example: Your filthy rich bankers will erect a shacks below a luxury high rise.  This happens often and is very annoying.  Example:  You have guys and gals that just wont get a job no matter how many open jobs there are.  Then these citizens get mad b/c of no work and join the rebels! Example: Your citizens choose to  live in a shack rather than commute to thier job site (even with mass transit available)!-'Cha-Ching' DLC policy by Kalypso (this is nothing new)Overall a fun as hell game with a few annoyances.  Would definately recommend if you are into an interesting city builder where you dont want to worry about micro managing things.  Rating: 80% FUN! 20% Aggrivation with a dash of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off thrown in.			"

												This game is awesome, its so much better than Tropico 3 &4, with all the dlc release so far gameplay is much more fun and buildings esp farmhouses are much needed in early stages, unlike T3 & T4 u can basically skip some of the buildings as it doesnt make sense to even build it when u can get a slightly better housing e.g. tenements which is the only building u need...Looks like they actually reviewed what T3 and T4 and build a better game which has buildings which u actually need and hardly skip.I just started playing after playing T4 and immediately I am able to feel the huge differences e.g. farms now shows the areas which is actually farmed unlike T3 and T4 it depends on the farmers, even logging is done better. I would recommend getting T5 over T3 & T4 as I had all of them and after playing T5 its hard to go back to either T3 or T4, T5 has need trade and u can appointment managers to building more micro management.will update again.verdict is get it now, try to search around for a good buy I got mine for only ~$27 including  all DLC.

Later after giving the game a 2nd chance I actually understood that game is GREAT!  Even though there is small build variety, it still has enough.   The humor is great keeping me want to play.-PROS-great graphicslots of control of game but no too much where you get confusedhumormusic is nicethe game goes together with the real world. For example, you get involved into cold war and choose to work with USSR or USA.Always something happening or to worry about.  You will most lilely not just sit and waitReally good multiplayer except that theres is no one to play with due to people litterarly joining and multiplayer and no doing anything.  No joining server or creating. -CONS-Small building varieties.overpriced dlcsI could not think of any more cons.I rate the game   9/10    If had more items to build then it would be much better.			"

												Quick pros and cons of Tropico 5Pros:-Grander scope-You can research techs (as opposed to Modern Times where you had to wait for buildings to unlock)-Constitution is a fun dynamic-Trade routes are a great addition and extra docks are more than just another pick up point for exports-New edicts and edict system (""freebies"" to the people aren't a sure fire way to please the people I've actually had to repeal free food in some cases)-More unique raw resources and industry options-More robust politics and diplomacy-No more ""one economy fits all"" economic strategies-Less ""build building x to make people y happy"" missions-Campaign is greatly improved, you play on two islands that remain unchanged mission to mission-Building upgrades no longer exclusive to industrial and residential buildings-""Repair All"" button after a disaster is a welcomed additionCons:-Learning curve might be a little steep for newcomers compared to older Tropico games-Politics can be muddled at times-Spending money to explore the island is dumb-Invasion combat seems one sided as my defenders have only won twice despite being fairly robust-Building aesthetics through the eras are unchangedOther Thoughts:-Managers system is a little useless in the early game-Dynasty system is interesting but there's no real introduction to it-It's slightly more difficult to gauge what your citizens want so popping up a few churches, clinics, and markets is not a sure way to make your early game citizens happy-I saw a lot of reviews saying most of the humor was taken out of the game which may be true when it comes to building descriptions and the radio broadcasts but the dialogue of your advisers and foreign powers is still pretty funnyIf you're a fan of the Tropico franchise or city builders this game is easy to recommend. However, if you were expecting the same old Tropico you may be little disappointed at first.			"

												This is the first Tropico game I played, and although the game is not really complex, it delivers. At first I felt close to my people, I wanted to make their life better. But as time passed, and industrialization kicked in, I started been more concerned on my exports and how much could I earn for a specific good. My citizens weren’t all that happy, but i told myself, after I set up this industry I'll  be financially independent and with that base ground I will attend their concerns. Just as in most dictatorships, that day never came, and after a few hours I was in front a monstrous city, struggling to keep up construction and industry profitable enough to avoid default...Force was the fastest way to dissolve protesters, while I was building my so call autarchic society. Sadly I found myself in the same road taken by most dictators today…			"

												I'm at a lost with this one. As some of the new features are really cool (Going through different eras, precision bombing rebels which would cause casualties of innocents as well, and and have eight army and tank barracks in your country, fighting either the rebels or the invaders which will actually duke it out on the island.) I also feel as if some of it's greatest features were taken away. In esscence, sending political, or whom ever you target to prison, viewing people who strongly support a faction or yourself, and a bunch of key characters that we all know and love from the fourth have been taken out as well. But with that aside... It's still a great game, and I strongly recommend it if you are able to bypass of what has been taken out.			"

												It's okay. I bought it for 30$ on sale, and haven't got my money's worth out of it. DLC is crap, gameplay is fine. It has about 2 sandbox games worth of VO content that tends to be very amusing. Cities all feel the same in the late game though, and there tends to be a ""correct"" way to play, which doesn't gel well with me. A lot of systems are odd. It's almost great. A few alternate building models, some buildings dedicated to avoiding natural disasters, some more interesting mechanics for trafic and roads and pollution, and it would be a different, awesome game. As is, and knowing what I do now, I wouldn't buy it for more than 15 dollars.Suitably amusing.			"

												Tropico 5 complete collection is the best out of all tropicos. Just like all other tropicos you lead an island settlement building the colony up and opening trade ruotes around the world. Its really important that you produce alot of goods to export so you can build fast .-The graphics are really good on highest settings and run smoothly.-Not 1 bug as of yet.-Alot of content to keep you busy with 3 different time peroids "

												Great continuation of renowned tropico series with many fresh ideas. But... its like every banana you want to have on your island, has to be bought as separate dlc for at least 5 EUROS !. Best to buy on steam sale, with pack of dlcs / expansions for 2-3 years from now. I can highly recomment it, but to play full game now You have to prepare tens or even hundreds of euros for dlcs. My best advice - wait, until dust settles, game receive more patches, dlcs, etc.  and then buy.			"

Earlier this year my dad got himself Tropico 4 on sale and we have played ""together"" (backseat gaming when I visited him).

												I'm at a lost with this one. As some of the new features are really cool (Going through different eras, precision bombing rebels which would cause casualties of innocents as well, and and have eight army and tank barracks in your country, fighting either the rebels or the invaders which will actually duke it out on the island.) I also feel as if some of it's greatest features were taken away. In esscence, sending political, or whom ever you target to prison, viewing people who strongly support a faction or yourself, and a bunch of key characters that we all know and love from the fourth have been taken out as well. But with that aside... It's still a great game, and I strongly recommend it if you are able to bypass of what has been taken out.			"

												I think it gets a lot of unnecessary hate.  There are only two real annoying systems in the game - a timed first era, and an INCREDIBLY destructive spy system with the DLC.  Once you figure out how to mitigate both, you're going to have a good time.  Figuring out which structures need roads, benefit from roads, and don't give a darn about roads is a rough trial and error process however.Didn't touch multiplayer - There can be only one El Presidente.

												Tropico 5 is a city-builder but is unique due to its economy system, overall satisfaction of populace and export-import prices depend on demand and supply through the eras. Its multiplayer is so satisfying, when playing with my friends our troops would help each other in every battle. But i wish that i could move my troops around manually, but i understand that this game is focused on being a city-builder but hey, a little rts mechanics wouldn't hurt right? ;). Overall i feel dis game deserves a 8/10 because of the amount of content for it's current price. (without dlc)			"

That being said lets just say the rebel uprising is very common even among populations with 93% approval ratings.The lack of instruction and detail in the tutorial is laughable,  you can actually fail the tutorial.  I needed to increase my entertainment rating just as the game instructed me to and I also did the other quests.  My approval rating did not rise above 32% it just stayed idle even after completing said tasks.  I failed the tutorial.TL;DR This is a $10 game, not $25			"

												If you've played any of the previous Tropico games, you're bound to like 5. The game changed a bit from 4, but still has the same feel about it. Build a communist haven, a capitalist grinder, an agricultural uneducated police state, or just make a Tourist hotspot...Really enjoyed how the game progresses through historical stages with totally different strategies to them. Highly replayable, excellent sound and visuals, and a great value.			"

												Really funny city simulator.The campaign is solid and its objectives are really nice.There are several different (and all valid) options to get fast cash, from farms to factories, from tourism to offices.In this game you are the people manager, for real - not only the buildings positioner -, you need to understand how many educated citizen you have (high school and university), how many not educated, and how your economic development choices will impact on the high school / not educated ratio - for example a farm based economy just needs not educated ppl / a offices based economy needs all ppl from university. Besides the education the population is sorted by age, wealth and preferences, since the population is divided in factions, often asking the opposites, like nationalists vs globalists. During my almost 40 hours play-through I experimented several different economies and I had fun with them all, which is the most important thing to me.To succeed you have to find the right balances between multiple contemporary conditions, all spiced up by random disasters and the various rebellions / invasions.Suggesting the game, my personal score is 8/10			"

												If you love City Building Games then I highly and most certainly recommend this game for sure. It is by far the most interesting and tedious city builder there is to date which covers a lot of ground to keep you busy and reeled in for hours on end.There are only two major complaints I still have about this game - read why below.1 - The Multiplayer was horrible at first and because of that the game got a really bad wrap from the get go so players stopped playing it online due to the issues it originally had. On a positive note most of those problems were fixed and it does work very well online now. However, due to that bad start it may be hard to play it online unless you go to the community or get a friend to join you.2 - One of my biggest problems that I have always had with this game with each of it's following game sequences is that the buildings are way too repetitive as in all of the building types are the exact same. So once you get further into the game you'll notice that you have lots of areas with houses and buildings but they all look exactly alike with absolutely no variance whatsoever. I have repeatedly complained to them about this in every series and nothing has been done and I doubt now that it will ever change either unless a ton of people start to do the same. One thing though that does make it a little better is the different building types and the added buildings from the dlc but still if you have a bunch of houses and similar buildings you will notice that and it may become an annoyance. If you can look past that then you'll enjoy it! On top of that the Eras also do help aid with that in changing the look of several types of buildings after upgrades have occurred from advancing in time but many do not such as housing unfortunately.Anyhow though, aside from those two issues it is still an epic game and I definitely think it's worth the price in full but if you'd rather wait for a sale then I would certainly recommend grabbing it for sure to say the least!

												Bad enough to prompt me to write this review. Stats that are no longer linked and missions that have nothing to do with your island. ""New Steel Mill"" when I have no coal mines - it's too god damn expensive to import coal to make it worth it. Rebellion every 5 minutes even though my Almanac consistently says 0 Rebels on the island. ""Budget"" is a confusing mess of dollar symbols.Do NOT spend your money here, Kalypso does not deserve it this time. See the comments too.I have played for more than 100 hours at the writing of this final piece. Tropico 5 is a badly designed, badly implemented, really pretty version of Tropico 4 that was made for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in diapers who have never played a city builder and need hand holding to the max. Replayability: 0. Expect the SAME THING every time. Put it on a higher difficulty? Don't expect it to be logical or even challenging in a humorous way like T4 was, it will just be a BIG WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Campaign? Oh, play the same 2 islands that will get bugged out and impossible to play the campaign if you try to do anything other than what your hand holder tells you. Multiplayer? Don't waste your time, the rest of the game is terrible. One way stat progression, one way tech trees, mines and mines of useful information that is buried 15 layers deep in the game, time-flow corruption (i.e: your trade ship says it will be here in 6 months, the election doesnt happen for 8 months. Somehow you lose the election before your trade ship gets back to dock.) Not to mention it's so god damn FAST. By the time you have researched ""power plant"" in the world war era, its already time to advance to the cold war and you are in massive debt from trying to keep up with the tech tree! Economy is BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN on any higher level difficulties, with or without trade it is nigh impossible not to go into debt while trying to keep ANY factions or people over 50% happiness, let alone one at a time. Disasters want to feel like they are broken but really some noob game dev at Kalypso decided it would be a ""good"" game addition for disasters to break everything all the time. Don't even get me started on the TERRIBLE voice acting and the ATROCIOUS sound effects, as well as the three whole songs that loop on repeat OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER.PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. Kalypso has made some good gems and a lot of terrible trash. This game is terrible trash with faux gems hot glued all over it.			"

												I bought this game, in the hope to find a good city building game, which I'm sure it was, however despite this: I found that the game would not function properly as far as the game would not go in full screen correctly, the taskbar would still be on the screen, whilst the game running in full screen mode so some of the screen would be unaccessable, meaning windows would still be running in the background thus affecting frame rates and how the game runs etc. I run a 1920x1080p monitor, a common resolution yet I got this problem; I tried to fix this by trouble shooting however the fixes did not work such as ALT+ENTER etc. I attempted a reinstall many times however the problem persisted. Luckily, I got the game for £12 on sale, so not as much money was wasted, however a game that has been out for almost a year and is pumping out DLC already, shouldn't have any issue along these lines under any circumstances. Despite this, I was very lucky because steam offered me a refund due to its issue. On another related topic: I would, from the gameplay I've seen, heard from friends and the brief while I played, I would reccomend this game for gameplay however, if you have a 1920x1080p monitor, I would say it's not worth the risk, especially at £30. As advice to people who may have purchased this game and experience this issue or any game affecting issue significant enough for the game to not be playable, it is against UK law(only applicable if you bought and use this game in the UK), and you are entitled for a refund, however luck and good tech support is required, which I was fortunate enough to have.Thank you for reading, for the developers on the other hand,Please fix your games and don't let this happen again.

												This is in my opinion the best version of Tropico. Many people complain that there are not so much statistics, and infos are missing. They are not. Even the famous ""empty buildings"" statistic is there. The only things which are missing are the first person view and the speeches before the elections. But these few things that are missing can't compare to the things which are added. Four epoches, many more buildings in total, new units and finally some suspense. The best features are the slightly harder difficulty and the controller support, trade missions,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ colony status at the beginning, more fights (which are by no means the center of the game, but it's better than the games before when nearly no one was attacking you). The graphics are nice, the music is great as ever and the humor is always there.A really nice game to relax, to shape your town, to do mad or bad or good things, listen to caribean music and watch your people embrassing their beloved leader (or trying to kill him).

												- Voice actors are worse than 3 and 4, especially Penultimo- Character variety, faction leaders typecasting and funny plotlines are less than other games- Actually, in general the game has lost its funny and sarcastic nature compared to old games- Only 2 maps for campaign and you continue next missions where you left off.  This seemed to be a good feature at first but after four or five mission it's getting annoying- New trade system is frustrating and complicated.- Constitutions change nothing, there were still religious tasks/demands/protests/riots even though i proclaimed ""atheist nation""-Campaign scenario is weird, Every new mission starts at Colonial Era no matter how far the date progress on previous mission. But plot, buildings and character interactions stay chronogical. This is a very stupid thing.- Zoom-in is restricted to about 4-5 meter top down view and you can't see the Tropicans closely or even El Presidente.- By the way There's no controlling El Presidente anymore- I didn't like the new radio host. She is not funny and don't compatible with events that happen on island.- El Presidente customization is barren, you can't even customize your first name. Wt* actually?To make the long story short; Tropico 5 is a big disaster and fail. Absolutely not recommend it, buy 3 - 4 or both instead.			"

												Well to be quite honest, I got this game for like $2.50 from an extremely nice trader... so although it was a $40 game to start with, I had little to no expectations for this game. At the price I got it for, it' s a nice and fun city/island sim, well worth the price I paid for it... of $2.50. As for higher prices, I'm not too sure, but I can certainly say I got far more than I paid for it.Overall, fun game, worth the price I paid.			"

												A very fun addictive game. I recived it on sale and im glad i did, at first it might seem like a down grade of the first game due to there being less building options with decoration, but the mutiple eras and new manager and upgrade system make it all the while worth it. personaly I woudnt pay the full price for this game but if its on sale for 50% off or more then its a must try for those who enjoyed the other Tropico games.

												If you didn't bother reading the reviews, this game is entirely a Cuba simulator.  It's not a city builder like we all believed.  That being said lets just say the rebel uprising is very common even among populations with 93% approval ratings.The lack of instruction and detail in the tutorial is laughable,  you can actually fail the tutorial.  I needed to increase my entertainment rating just as the game instructed me to and I also did the other quests.  My approval rating did not rise above 32% it just stayed idle even after completing said tasks.  I failed the tutorial.TL;DR This is a $10 game, not $25			"

												Tropico 5 is a city-builder but is unique due to its economy system, overall satisfaction of populace and export-import prices depend on demand and supply through the eras. Its multiplayer is so satisfying, when playing with my friends our troops would help each other in every battle. But i wish that i could move my troops around manually, but i understand that this game is focused on being a city-builder but hey, a little rts mechanics wouldn't hurt right? ;).

												   I've enjoyed playing this game and dont regret buying it (on sale for $15.00). Having said that, let's discuss the elephant in the room. It's missing something and I think it's most of the stuff being sold as DLC that should have been included in the game anyway. Don't get me wrong, if you have a good idea or product you should make money on it but this feels like a shakedown or extortion. it only serves to make the main game more bland and less replayable and thus hurting their product in the long run. I hope they get the message or they will lose fans like me who have enjoyed playing the series only to watch each new game take a step backward in content to get a quick profit rather than long term playability like Tropico 4.

Best to buy on steam sale, with pack of dlcs / expansions for 2-3 years from now. I can highly recomment it, but to play full game now You have to prepare tens or even hundreds of euros for dlcs.

												After playing Tropico 3 and 4 extensively, I can say whole heartedly that Tropico 5 is a welcome addition. It adds new islands, challenges, buildings, research, personalities and changed how the level up system works for your dictator. Most of the mechanics are the exact same as the previous games, but you will have to reaquaint yourself with the newer UI. Unfortunately, Tropico 5's DLC is falling far short from the family tree, but that's another review entirely. A must have for Tropico fans.			"

												   I've enjoyed playing this game and dont regret buying it (on sale for $15.00). Having said that, let's discuss the elephant in the room. It's missing something and I think it's most of the stuff being sold as DLC that should have been included in the game anyway. Don't get me wrong, if you have a good idea or product you should make money on it but this feels like a shakedown or extortion. it only serves to make the main game more bland and less replayable and thus hurting their product in the long run. I hope they get the message or they will lose fans like me who have enjoyed playing the series only to watch each new game take a step backward in content to get a quick profit rather than long term playability like Tropico 4.

												I played both Tropico 4 and 5. Out of both, i liked Tropico 4 way better than the Tropico 5. Tropico 5 has some improved graphics and with new features though but you have to unlocked it first in order to use it in your island which can be little tricky and need some patience where as tropico 4 gives you all the available features and build your place whatever you want. Tropcio 5 is good and must try for all tropico or city making lovers, buy this game if it is on sale as it is good but not the best.			"

Of course they should have add somethings like detailed economical graphics, reason percentage of the hapiness levels etc. but it is one of the most playable city building game there is. Expansions are expensive but Steam does some great sales so wait for them.Pros-Great graphics-Family system-Variety of buildings-Variety of random events-Trade system-Age varietyCons-Lack of economical graphs-Lack of itemised explanations for the happiness etc.-Lack of inovation to the series-Expensive expansions-Sometimes annoyingly hard			"

												(Note my comments are strictly holding to the base game.  I have not played a single expac/dlc.)  T4 just felt like a more compelling and engaging product.  Managing the army felt better, and also playing the tourism side felt more interesting.  The Campaign for 4 definitely felt superior too.  5 has some improvements: less guess work with construction, and I like managing the plantations/ranches in 5 (unless you are talking hydroponic farms.  Really Calypso?  High school graduates?!  You don't think that doesn't totally bork your game?)  but I do miss running the prison farms from 4.  In short, I may remember a few small details wrong because it's been years since I played 4, but I do remember being super satisfied with my experience with 4.  Not quite with 5.  I liked it enough, but I wouldn't recommend it. Oh and Calypso, after playing Prison Architect, the only way you are getting me to buy the eventual T6 is if you provide  a layout mode.  Guessing, placing, cancelling construction, replacing, maybe cancelling again, etc. until i get the building placement perfect (I hope) for my future plans is something we need to get passed.  Presidente' has access to paper and pencil.  It is well within his/her capabilities to plan ahead.			"

												I can't recommend this title, despite it being somewhat enjoyable to play. The cheeky story and humor are there, but, if you're looking for an experience as deep and challenging as Tropico 4, you will be disappointed.Unfortunately, as with many games of recent issue, this game suffers from dumbing down for console play. Lots of things that experienced Tropico players know and rely on to really add depth to the game are gone. The most useful overlays, such as occupancy, profitability, employment level, newspaper, television, and rado station types... all gone in favor of being able to play the game on limited hardware with just a few buttons. In fact, radio stations are gone altogether. You cannot directly set wages at buildings anymore, in favor of a ""budget"" system that supposedly sets wages, but in reality allows you NO control over wages to properly prioritize your economy. Rents and entry fees on homes and service buildings also gone, in favor of a simple button saying ""Tourists Only"". You can see these glaring oversimplifications everywhere you turn.The campaign is far too easy, and I was able to complete it in about 20 hours with no failures, really. The dynasty system seems pointless and can be ignored without affecting gameplay in any way. In short, Tropico 5 is to Tropico 4 as the Texas flag is to the US flag... a dumbed down, easy reader version of the original.Also, I got the ""Big Cheese"" DLC as part of my pre-order for free, and this is a good thing, because I would have been really upset if I had paid for it. All it adds is a singlee building, the creamery, and ONE, count em ONE mission... which is 100% more missions than the game came with outside the original campaign.Look, I'm not a console player. I don't like console games, because I prefer something a bit deeper. That said, there are some console-type titles I have enjoyed and do enjoy playing. If this is the future of the game industry, then there are some pretty dark times ahead. I'll be putting this back on the shelf and playing user content in T4 instead.			"

												While the only other Tropico game I have played is 4, I can say that Tropico 5 makes a number of enjoyable changes to add freshness and more depth to the gameplay. The era system introduced in this game, alongside the campaign that involves playing on two different maps and selecting whihc one you believ that you have already built up to be the most useful for the next mission makes for an interesting change of pace from the constant blank slate starts of Tropico 4. Managers are also a welcome change, bringing new ways to help your economy grow. While overall I would say the game is very good, there are a few small problems, the first being the research points system, whihc while I do like better than purchasing blueprints from Penultimo, I find ot be a bit dull as I always find myself choosing to do my researches in the same order. Additionally I feel the number of wacky quest giver characters to be reduced greatly. The final issue, and perhaps the only big one is the cost of the DLC, which for what it gives is simply too high, but the base game is plenty of fun without it, and Im sure it will eventually go on sale for a reasonable price.

												While it is by no means bad, I feel that this game is a lesser version of its predecessor, lacking a certain depth and variety that Tropico 4 enjoyed. The addition of a 'snap-to' grid that allows for easier building placement is welcome, but with so fewer buildings available, my cities are just never as vibrant as before. The changing of eras throughout the missions is nice, but no replacement for the genuine humour and excellent voice-talent that is sadly absent.Even the soundtrack lacks the panache that was present in Tropico 4. It's still a competent, enjoyable city-builder that's worth a play if you're new to the series, but even then, you'd be better served by picking up one of it's predecessors, much more cheaply.			"

												This game doesn't seem to be finished.  They've added some cool concepts since the previous title, but seem to lack some of the previous things.  For example, there's a grade school education level, but there doesn't seem to be a grade school anywhere.  There's a huge lack of management screens as well.  There's no way to see the price of exports before exporting them or having a trade route established and it's not as simple to see factions' desires.There's not enough character customizations.  I can't even customize the first one's name, but rather choose from a bunch of ""Tropico names"" where I just press left/right starting from A...  Also there's hardly any real customizations for like, clothing or hats and such.  They have the basics, maybe 4 or 5 that look somewhat decent, then a few more that I can't imagine using.  Like, who would use a pacifier or snorkel?  There's even Napoleon and steampunk - and don't get me wrong I love steampunk, but this isn't steampunk lol.Possibly the worst part of this is it feels like it takes the customization out of everything.  The game randomly generates mini-quests which change everytime you play the campaign.  So you might start off with it telling you to make a couple meat ranches or sugar plantations, then the next time you come back to this map instead of going with something like a cannery quest or rum - it suggests planks.  Or you'll have a couple wharves already made and the quest now needs a couple more - I'm out of fish already.  And if you take initiative and try to make your population happy by building clinics and such, the next quests might be to build a new clinic or mission - wtf.  So I find myself more often just sitting back and following the quests instead of doing anything on my own.			"

												This is a bad game. It's pretty to look at, and an interesting idea for a game (so interesting they made it four times already), but when you actually play it, you find that most of the difficulty comes from wrestling with frustrating and unclear game mechanics rather than competent game design or an intentional learning curve. I think this game may have made me smile twice; once at a Pirates of Penzance reference that seemed completely at odds with the offensive characterchers and cheap gags populating the rest of the game, and the second time when I uninstalled it and could sigh with relief that the experience was finally over and that I hadn't paid a dime for it, unlike the other sad souls leaving reviews here.

												Really funny city simulator.The campaign is solid and its objectives are really nice.There are several different (and all valid) options to get fast cash, from farms to factories, from tourism to offices.In this game you are the people manager, for real - not only the buildings positioner -, you need to understand how many educated citizen you have (high school and university), how many not educated, and how your economic development choices will impact on the high school / not educated ratio - for example a farm based economy just needs not educated ppl / a offices based economy needs all ppl from university. Besides the education the population is sorted by age, wealth and preferences, since the population is divided in factions, often asking the opposites, like nationalists vs globalists. During my almost 40 hours play-through I experimented several different economies and I had fun with them all, which is the most important thing to me.To succeed you have to find the right balances between multiple contemporary conditions, all spiced up by random disasters and the various rebellions / invasions.Suggesting the game, my personal score is 8/10			"

Also, once you've researched every tech, you have three options to pick from every year or so(kinda forgetful). I would rather have more freedom with tech trees. They can even just go the lazy route and have you research for a happier populace but gives you some whacky penalty. But I guess if you did that, you would probably have to get rid of edicts?

												After playing Tropico 3 and 4 extensively, I can say whole heartedly that Tropico 5 is a welcome addition. It adds new islands, challenges, buildings, research, personalities and changed how the level up system works for your dictator. Most of the mechanics are the exact same as the previous games, but you will have to reaquaint yourself with the newer UI. Unfortunately, Tropico 5's DLC is falling far short from the family tree, but that's another review entirely. A must have for Tropico fans.			"

												Really funny city simulator.The campaign is solid and its objectives are really nice.There are several different (and all valid) options to get fast cash, from farms to factories, from tourism to offices.In this game you are the people manager, for real - not only the buildings positioner -, you need to understand how many educated citizen you have (high school and university), how many not educated, and how your economic development choices will impact on the high school / not educated ratio - for example a farm based economy just needs not educated ppl / a offices based economy needs all ppl from university. Besides the education the population is sorted by age, wealth and preferences, since the population is divided in factions, often asking the opposites, like nationalists vs globalists. During my almost 40 hours play-through I experimented several different economies and I had fun with them all, which is the most important thing to me.To succeed you have to find the right balances between multiple contemporary conditions, all spiced up by random disasters and the various rebellions / invasions.Suggesting the game, my personal score is 8/10			"

												This is a bad game. It's pretty to look at, and an interesting idea for a game (so interesting they made it four times already), but when you actually play it, you find that most of the difficulty comes from wrestling with frustrating and unclear game mechanics rather than competent game design or an intentional learning curve. I think this game may have made me smile twice; once at a Pirates of Penzance reference that seemed completely at odds with the offensive characterchers and cheap gags populating the rest of the game, and the second time when I uninstalled it and could sigh with relief that the experience was finally over and that I hadn't paid a dime for it, unlike the other sad souls leaving reviews here.

												Ever want to be a leader of your own nation? With it's own set of rules, laws, and regulations? plus the ideological factor that drives your nation so? Then this game is for you!I had a blast while playing this game and you will too! There is a lot to do in this game, which can make time fly fast which is nice. Like in Sid Meier's Civilzation V you have to keep an eye out on your happiness, and your production level! Too litte, and your nation will starve of resources and rebel against you, Too much, and you will have constant invasions by the outside world. You need to find the right balance, plus make sure you choose your edicts wisely, pick the wrong ones too early and you will be at a disadvantage, pick the right ones in the right point in time might just help in your favor, or not depending upon whether or not you choose to upgrade your armies and defenses.You can 'customize' your dictator, with outfits, looks, first name and last name. However, the first name is randomly generated so that's the downside to that. Plus you can upgrade your 'dynasty' members to be better, which is highly advise. Another downside is that it's not like Crusaders Kings where you can marry someone and have a child, it's randomly generated with a look, and the only thing you can customize is the outfit itself.The locations are very well done, each island offers a unqiue spin on how you want to build your nation. If you pick a tiny island you have limited resources to build your country, If you have a huge island you have endless opportunity to build whatever it is you want to build. Like real life you must geographical plan out where you put your buildings and roads, plus your defenses and what not. The last you want is have a full fledge invasion, and your military defenses is sub-par, plus your guard tower locations are out of whack.The music in this game while it's fun to listen too, It can get a bit repetitive so becareful there. I am honestly surprised there is no mod workshop for this game, i can see the potential in what kind of mods this game can produce. Lastly, the achievements are easy to earn. And the tutorial is really simple and easy to understand.If you want in-depth nation building then this game is for you. Recommend!			"

It is much similar to Simcity, but as a small tropical nation rather than a large city. So grab your dictator uniforms and hire some soldiers, and go get this game now. Why are you still reading this, I said to go get the game now. When I said now, I meant now. What about now don't you understand? GO GET IT NOW!			"

												This game has the potentialto be a very fun game. However, every multiplayer game i have played there have been hundreds of revolts with no reaso for. I have just played a game with 62% of popular support and good standing with every faction apart from the commuinists. Who accounted for 40 people.   When in the first 5 minutes into the world wars era (about 30 mins into the game) 27!! rebels rose up against me. There is no way to play this game without getting stressed. Rebels will rise up if you cough to ludly and it will be completely unbalanced and unchecked. Do not get this game. Seriously disapointed.			"

YouTube™ Video: Tropico 5 - Sandbox Play Through Each Age 

			Views: 74		

			I present to you, Tropico 5! This is a great development of the series. A common complaint for Tropico 4 was that it was too much like Tropico 3, so this is the answer for those that wanted something...		

Tropico 5 is a great development of the series. A common complaint for Tropico 4 was that it was too much like Tropico 3, so this is the answer for those that wanted something different. Luckily they didn't change anything about the game that made the previous ones so great. I recorded this video with no music, because sadly Youtube griefs me anytime I've done that for any Tropico game... so the video is a bit lacking. Just play some Hispanic music in the background and you'll be all set.The age system is the biggest difference in this iteration of the game, other than perhaps multiplayer, and although it is a valiant effort... it becomes tedious after progressing through it a few times.  It works ok for the story mode, but the best part about the age system is that it can essentially be turned off during sandbox games by setting the starting era to Modern Times. Multiplayer looks good... but I haven't played enough to really get a feel for it yet. The best change to Tropico 5 is the Dynasty system. Building your dynasty is fun, and finally gives you a reason to have a fat stack of cash in your slush fund. So all in all, I'm really happy with the game. I sometimes miss the simplicity of the older games, mainly because of the addition of the age system, but the Tropico series is still my favorite city builder, and I expect to play Tropico 5 for many, many more hours to come.

												Went ahead and familiarized myself with the tutorial levels to what new has been added to this already excellent game series; and I have to say, Kalypso has outdone themselves. The engine is smooth, AI works more accordingly, changes to buildings such as updgrades and expanded timelines with technology research has made the next piece in the Tropico anthology an obvious gem.The reactions from foreign powers and consequences against your little island paradise are vast and far reaching. Random events and disasters are far more balanced; and politics and trade are a bit more in depth, giving players a chance to either maximize profit or be able to work up foreign relations through trade.Most notable in the Tropico game series, is implementing different era's for your island to push through with a new technology tree, allowing one to progress in numerous paths when deciding there tropical paradises fate.For any looking for an excellent city building simuation, Tropico 5 is worth the price-tag.Edit: Update on gameplay:So I get to a population of about 2,500 and things are looking good not only financially but my diplomatic stances with foreign nations were all warm, if not neutral. However there was discontent brewing over the past decade, the nationalists were becoming increasingly vocal and taking up arms in small rebel actions against my regime. I began noticing arresting rebels belonged to a mixture of the nationalists and environmentalists. Years of an open immigration policy, immigrants on almost every boat to port for the past couple years. Then recently I managed to receive 60 Chinese immigrants.Immediatly rebel action began to scale up with a series of attacks on my cash crop farms, and they were succeeding with every other attack. I chose to put my foot down and lure the rebels numerous times, thinning there ranks and arresting identified rebels. But of course I had many citizens who were very loyal, I met all their desires, the militarists, globalists and capitalists were almost eating out of the palm of my hand.Well one fine morning I put the finishing touches on putting the last of identified rebels down. Moments later the uprising began. Markers began popping up everywhere as my military scattered to intercept any rebel forces. There were people fighting for my regime, but many more fighting against. I watched as my population counter suddenly dropped by fifty in mere moments. One by one guard towers fell and the mob slowly gathered together in an unstoppable show of force. My fighters bombarding the crowd to no avail, there were to many to stop now.After a drawn out battle with some few loyal forces I had left who trekked over half the island to my palace were to late as the rebels burned my personal fortress into ashes, three square blocks on fire or bombed out. The revolution was over, it wasn't even sunset yet.			"

												This game is fantastic, looks amazing, 10/10 soundtrack, the comedy is there, building variety, so many different ways to play the game, and still looking forward to trying multiplayer ( Will update) the resource management could be a little more in-depth. I have not long come off a banished binge, and I think tropico 5 should be able to keep me going, as a little more relaxing game play. If you are into city builders this is definite worth a look.

												A much needed update to the franchise, and it is still very challenging. Even in Sandbox mode. I like this game, just need to learn how to manage all my resources, ALL my power plants went dark after 2 mines got used up, they were the only ones with the stuff I needed. The new buildings look great and there is no shortage of tourists. Just be ready to get hammered by power usage demands.. With almost 3 hours on record, I can safely say I have experienced 99% of the game, I have yet to go online with it, I prefer singleplayer anyways.. The DX 11 requirement does cut off a few people from getting this game, such as those with laptops that are 4+ years old.. Or work pc's that just use MOBO gpu's.. But I stand by the requirement, this game has never looked or ran better. I am certain this game will be on my must play list for a long time..			"

												Although I was a big fan of Tropico 4, I can not in good faith recommend Tropico 5. Massive chunks of content were taken out from the previous game. What little has been added is sort of a ""one step forward, two steps back"" scenario. While the constitution and era mechanics are nice, it doesn't make up for the fact that most buildings were taken out. Not only that, but several GUI elements have been removed entirely, like being able to see the monetary balance of specific buildings and being able to see population maps. There are even fewer political factions as well. Just about everything in Tropico 5 is a downgrade, and it's a real shame because I was rather excited for it. All in all, you can probably squeeze a few hours out of this game, but I'd recommend getting Tropico 4 instead. 4/10			"

												Went ahead and familiarized myself with the tutorial levels to what new has been added to this already excellent game series; and I have to say, Kalypso has outdone themselves. The engine is smooth, AI works more accordingly, changes to buildings such as updgrades and expanded timelines with technology research has made the next piece in the Tropico anthology an obvious gem.The reactions from foreign powers and consequences against your little island paradise are vast and far reaching. Random events and disasters are far more balanced; and politics and trade are a bit more in depth, giving players a chance to either maximize profit or be able to work up foreign relations through trade.Most notable in the Tropico game series, is implementing different era's for your island to push through with a new technology tree, allowing one to progress in numerous paths when deciding there tropical paradises fate.For any looking for an excellent city building simuation, Tropico 5 is worth the price-tag.Edit: Update on gameplay:So I get to a population of about 2,500 and things are looking good not only financially but my diplomatic stances with foreign nations were all warm, if not neutral. However there was discontent brewing over the past decade, the nationalists were becoming increasingly vocal and taking up arms in small rebel actions against my regime. I began noticing arresting rebels belonged to a mixture of the nationalists and environmentalists. Years of an open immigration policy, immigrants on almost every boat to port for the past couple years. Then recently I managed to receive 60 Chinese immigrants.Immediatly rebel action began to scale up with a series of attacks on my cash crop farms, and they were succeeding with every other attack. I chose to put my foot down and lure the rebels numerous times, thinning there ranks and arresting identified rebels. But of course I had many citizens who were very loyal, I met all their desires, the militarists, globalists and capitalists were almost eating out of the palm of my hand.Well one fine morning I put the finishing touches on putting the last of identified rebels down. Moments later the uprising began. Markers began popping up everywhere as my military scattered to intercept any rebel forces. There were people fighting for my regime, but many more fighting against. I watched as my population counter suddenly dropped by fifty in mere moments. One by one guard towers fell and the mob slowly gathered together in an unstoppable show of force. My fighters bombarding the crowd to no avail, there were to many to stop now.After a drawn out battle with some few loyal forces I had left who trekked over half the island to my palace were to late as the rebels burned my personal fortress into ashes, three square blocks on fire or bombed out. The revolution was over, it wasn't even sunset yet.			"

												This game is very entertaining to me and my friends overall, but there are easily some complaints about some things. I would still recommend this to most people.Pros: Multiplayer is fun. Most of the jokes are funny. The family member system is cool. The Radio announcements are honestly the best reasons to play through the entire game. Good music. Great graphics. Easy to understand UI. Pretty decarations. You can see how pretty your place is with the touch of a button.Cons: ""YOUNG PRIESTS!!!"" ""The most annoying sound in Tropico."" Some of the jokes are really cheesy and accually force me to physically harm myself. People require a highschool education to become a filthy factory worker. They removed the elementary school so you can no longer indoctrinate the youth. DLCs hurt me. The roads in multiplayer will give you an aneurysm. Some curved roads will never go away. You can troll other people by slapping the crap out of their plantations with roads.(I consider this a pro.) The dynasty system can be cheated by playing in games by yourself with infinite reasources, powerplant victory, using the Building Permit edict, and spamming Cathedrals and whatnot. The randomization of new Dynasty members can make your youngest duaghter appear to be a corpse with makeup dug up from the mud of the deep Vietnamese jungles. "

												Absolutely terrible in every way. This game is one of the worst I have played in recent years. Every single game I own that I frequently play supports 4K no problem, this game only does 1440p. When you turn 4K on, it's pretending to be 4K but really it's exactly the same as 1440p. On 1440p AND 4K mode, the scroll/camera rotation rotates at least 100 times at the slightest touch. The only way to make camera rotation work is to run it on a low resolution like 1080P and turn V-sync off. However, every few minutes with v-sync off on ANY resolution will cause my screen to get visual artifacts in the middle then flash black over and over causing my graphics driver to crash and the card to over heat. I have never experienced such a faulty game since tropico 4, which right after I purchased my 4K monitor started glitching and flashing black, then corrupted all of my save files. I don't know if the developers are ignorant or incompetent, but whatever it is, they're obviously not very professional when they can't make a game without significant bugs. Will try to get a refund.			"

												Very..Very..Very..Very..Awesome.avi.The game takes on eras.It starts with my favorite: ""Colonial Era"".My problem with that it is pretty short.I could use a era lock on that.While the game progresses through the eras and when you research,it gets a bit more intresting.And a few buildings dont really become useful anymore,Military forts? You can keep them untill modern times where the upgrades of WW2 Infantry wont be needed.Multiplayer is good.I sometimes get frozen if i have too many squads invading another player.Some screens are different than others.Im not sure though whats up with those people asking: ""Can we please save our multiplayer games?!"",Multiplayer is not supposed to be saveable,If its the Co-Op.Well thats fine.The fog of war,if you have the cash.You may actually explore all land before getting drydock research abillity.Its good though.Its annoying how the radio people last time were not in this game.Just lyld,the new AND only radio person.Jollyrogers..Heres a summary:Pro:Good multiplayer.I didnt get to the singleplayer campaign,but i think it sounds cool.Cool sandbox.Eras.Some tweaks,additions,other stuff.Not pro:No cheat codes? I WILL KILL YOU!!!No era lock.No same voices.Penultimo and a few others arent on the radio too.NOOOOOO!Some buildings taken out.In all,this game is fine.I can rate this 9/10,With a high recommendation,AND A HUGE AWESOME STATUE!GO get it.unless you want to wait for the DLCS and patches.or weirdly next game.

												Sent the king some pink underwear, queen was jealous, the king hates me now. 11/10 would insult him again.On a more serious note, I think Tropico 5 is an awesome game, also a lot more challenging compared to Tropico 4 which was a bit too easy for my taste. (but still an awesome game though!) The game looks and feels a lot less like you have to run some 3rd world country. Besides that, being able to actually control where the crops grow is one of the best new features in the game; in previous versions the crops fields were randomly scattered around the farm buildings.All in all the game is definitely a major improvement and definitely worth buying if you enjoyed the previous games, or if you are interested in the genre. I'm most certainly going to 'waste' hours of my life on this game, and I'm sure many others will as well, the game is that good in my opinion :)			"

												7.8/10In terms of ""new"" city building strategy games, you cant get any better than this.heres a list of the things I think are good and bad so far.Pros-Nice refined graphics and an up to date art style.-Gameplay hasn't changed much, but in a good way!-Good system of ""leveling"" through the ages, with buildings and policies refering to each period, e.g, cold war+uranium-Better trade system, a lot simpler and makes more sense.-Dynasty system allows you to boost your economy and can be upgraded with Swiss bank account.-Better Military system alround.-Multiplayer (its always good to play together)Cons-Fewer Factions alround, easier to ""appease"" everyone. focusing more on Housing, entertainment etc.-Lacking Customisation, clothing for dynasty members, and different ""housing"" styles and colours.-Dynasty/President members traits are less focused, ""Religious Zealot"" or ""Capitalist Dog"" or ""Power to the people""-Fewer buildings/not much in the way of new added buildings.-Less Secret Police/specialist buildings and actions, and theres not a lot added in relation of this.

												OverviewTropico 5 is a fun, light hearted yet deep city builder game.  You can create your ""El Presidente"", and through the course of the game, their dynasty.  You rule over an island over various eras and need to build it up, focusing on housing, food, money making, employment, religion, healthcare, happiness, diplomacy among other things.  For fans of previous versions, Tropico 5 is more of an evolution of the series rather than a revolution.  New & Improved features (A sample)- Dynasties - Can have more members of your family, can make them managers, send them on missions or make them El Presidente- Eras - Can start from the Colonial Era, under the tyrrany of the crown, up to the Modern era. - Managers - Can now employ different kinds of managers to buildings to grant bonuses. - New buildings- Improved AI - Especially construction priorityPros: The game has a lot of depth and challenge, that gets more challenging to handle as your island grows.  Managing employment, military, production, diplomatic relations, security are just some of these.  The game has a nice, tongue in cheek humor that I like and it looks great.  A lot of the annoying AI issues in the previous version seem to be fixed.  The campaign is fun and does a good job of taking you through all the areas of the game.  Also, the Dynasty / Manager system is a nice feature allowing you to provide good bonuses to key areas / buildings. Cons: The game, like the previous one, suffers from lack of information tabs.  While it does a good job at providing the basic information you need it lacks the ability to get a more detailed look, for example, to compare production vs transport capacity, unemployment by area, free jobs by location etc.  While with practise and some manual effort you can get some of this information, it really should be provided to you in an easier way.  As such, it leads to a reactive nature, reacting to issues instead of being able to be pro-active, especially when your island grows. Summary: An evolution of the series that has fixed most of the issues from previous versions while adding some nice new features on top.  The lack of in depth analytical info is a shame and I can imagine some Tropico Vetrans might be dissapointed with the lack of new content vs previous versions.  But for those new to the series with an interest in city builders, this one comes highly recommended. Score: 8/10 - Good Solid City Builder			"

												Neutral Recommendation. It's a Tropico, Better then 4, but still not any huge difference or improvement over 3. The problem is the publisher/developer has fallen into the same rut of releasing a mildly refreshed product and flogging the same DLCs for it over and over again. There are a few very minor production issues still (like un-normalized volume at times between the voice samples)If you want to get Tropico5, get it on sale for cheap as a bundle with all the DLCs you may want.

No one can deny the amazing development of Tropico within one mandate.  Yes, there is more of the same, with the usual problems.  But there will always be problems.  These problems will be resolved as the global economy stabilizes.			"

												 While I found Tropico 4 the pinnacle of the series, I enjoyed Tropico 5 as another aspect to the game play that has made the series a darling.  Tropico 5’s timing seems slower paced than 4, but the consistent humor and different ways to build your nation is never repetitive.  The only thing I wished was better was the DLC package.  The DLCs are more add-ons rather than enhancements to the game.  For example, the Waterborne expansion allows me to utilize the ocean, but it’s an “okay” feature that doesn’t enhance the game.    Regardless, I’m a sucker for these games and I keep buying the DLCs in hopes that they’ll make a Tropico 6.   "

My experience playing this game is solely based on vanilla singleplayer sandbox mode.I enjoyed Tropico 5 quite a bit. It's a bit different than CIties skylines but I would say that for me it has atleast the same entertainment value if not better. Tropico 5 was definitely better than EA's simcity. Nevertheless, I think Tropico 5 (or 4, more on that on the end of the review) is a must buy for everyone who like building games or economic games in general.I must add that Tropico 5 is more difficult, atleast I found myself struggling with economy on my first two runs. This is because you rarely receive constant income like in other city building games, but instead you receive money when trade ships show up and buy your resources, and the income you get from a single ship is very irregular. For example one day you might receive 1k for selling bananas and weeks or months later when next ship arrives 10k for jewelry. And meanwhile you are constantly losing money to upkeep your production facilities.Tropico 5 is quite solid actually, no bugs or anything that I've experienced. Only thing I was a bit annoyed about was that everytime autosave happened my game went to a loading screen and after that for some reason wanted to change my dynastys name, so I had to press cancel and second loading screen followed. But that can be avoided by reducing or disabling autosaves in options. Loading screens were also fairly short so I wasn't too bothered really.It is quite common that Tropico 5 can be bought at discount, especially outside steam, but I can recommend it for full price as well if you like building games like I do. Many reviewers seem to say that Tropico4 is better, so check that out before you buy and make your own conclusions.			"

												I love this game - I agree with the feedback on the DLCs, though.  Expansions shouldn't cost that much for what little they provide (imo).THE BIGGEST ANNOYANCE: I reassign W/A/S/D for panning up/down/left/right, etc - but there is no function you can assign to Q or E for rotating left/right around what you're looking at.  These keybindings (I feel) are quite common - the game normally has the arrow keys doing these things.  It just feels uncomfortable to me. :\			"

												People of Tropico!  The importance of this review has brought me before you.  I must warn you about the so called rebels on our island.  Those are anarchists who give poor reviews but present themselves as liberators.  Compañeros, do not listen to these narcissistic anarchists.  I must pay my respect to communists of Haemimont.  No one can deny the amazing development of Tropico within one mandate.  Yes, there is more of the same, with the usual problems.  But there will always be problems.  These problems will be resolved as the global economy stabilizes.			"

												I am disappointed with this. I enjoyed Tropico 4 on the XBox 360 and assumed that this game would have been optimised to play on PC. However, it assumes you are playing with a controller. Trying to play with the mouse was clunky to say the least. My knowledge of Tropico 4 didn't seem to help me at all as the UI seems very different. I have requested a refund.			"

												Buy this game.Every Tropico released since 3 has felt like a refinement since, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. This series has always been right where it needs to be in terms of gameplay, humor and style; it's just been a matter of perfecting it. While Tropico 5 brings the series closer than ever to perfection in an absolutely beautiful iteration of the series, it's had to take some things that fans love away in the process. But I trust Kalypso to continue to refine the game in later updates and expansions. I'd wholly recommend this game to fans and newcomes alike. Viva El Presidente.Pros:- Graphic updates bring you a gorgeous, sun soaked Carribean.- Difficult. In previous Tropicos I never had an issue getting elected with the majority of the vote. Now I'm constantly on the offensive trying to figure out what needs fixing.- Fantastic little details crammed into every corner.- A new sense of depth to the gameplay, new strategies to be brought out, and new ways to plan your regime.- More of the fantastic humor that's always made the series a joy to play.- New trade and political options.Cons:- Faction advisors gone, no more Sunny or Ms Pineapple to update you on the latest situation.- Difficult UI, a bit of a hassle trying to sift through all the citizens to uncover the root of a problem.- Buildings could have used more variety and height as in previous iterations. While the graphic updates are charming, there could have been more options.- Seriously. I miss Sunny and Penultimo's banter.			"

There should have been some sort of grace period or perhaps just have the occur naturally as the years tick by. With the later being my preference. It's harder.

												This is a subpar sequel to the Tropico 4 masterpiece, but it still has its value. The management is still there, the politics, the cheesy humor.The added military side of the game was simply an awful decision, and you'll need to go through it at least some times in the main history, despite of how well you handle your rising economy.Being able to start on an island from where you took off is nice at times, but somehow I miss the many different islands with different challenges.

												Here is what i think.  I came from tropico 4 so I knew a bit about the game before. This game is good as far as concept and graphics, very smooth and addicting. The bad thing about this game is that after the colonial period, the game is next to impossible to finiance a country.  It is very robotic when it comes to riots and game play. after playin this for a month you will be done with it. This game is honestly pointless after the colonial period you will not be able to go forward with your country. the trad system is so flawed. After the colonial period the trading system turns to importing only. all of the deals you found moderatly simple to make is no more after the colonial. It's almost like the game is not finished. other than that.. enjoy the music and funny script.. but this game is next to impossible to ""win"". tropico 4 is way more free. you can do it your way. this just looks better and the programing is weak, I wish i could get a refund. i spent weeks trying to force myself to have fun.. you will find yourself starting over a lot with this game.. and multiplayer does not work. deleted this from my computer, waste of time.

												Tropico 5 is a welcome sequel to a great series. Many fans were underwhelmed by Tropico 4. While the game was solid it did little to innovate on Tropico 3 and its expansions. Tropico 5 took notes, and now offers a very different gameplay experience.The biggest changes are the multitude of little tweaks, such as how farms work, a new research system, new specialist system, the dynasty mechanics and a dozen other little things that overhaul the game hugely. Each is well implemented with the level of detail and balance we've come to expect from the series.The new time based campaigns are also something that Tropico players have talked about for a long term- persistent islands. Traditionally each level in Tropico is its own map, but no longer. You have only two islands in this game, and you develop them through the campaign. This requires much more foresight and planning and led to me needing to restart the campaign twice because I didn't think far enough ahead. I thoroughly enjoyed overcoming this great new challenge.If you've never played Tropico I'd suggest starting with 3 or 4. 5 is a very different game but it maintains the tone, feel and gameplay shape of its predecessors. As such you can spend a little less seeing if you like the style before you commit to spending more on the recent title.If you know Tropico and love it, then you'll love Tropico 5. Faithful, but not afraid to break new ground. And they break it with extreme competence and authority. "

												In tropico 3 and 4, you felt like you were building a real nation. In tropico 5, you can sit back, do nothing and be rewarded. Although it's improved in some regards such as the extended timeline. The fact that police no longer roam around the city, and the military is no longer based on individual soldiers/units creates a disconnect. To me it feels that I have a massive disconnect with the city I'm supposed to be building.			"

												Really enjoy this game, I've come back to it time after time and it still offers some funny/relaxing gameplay.  DLC is overpriced.  This has been the standard practice for Kalypso, it would appear, and it probably isn't going to change.  For a new mission, building, and some useless costumes/styles for your dynasty, should be a 2 bucks max.  Have I still bought all the DLC? Yes.  Do I regret it?  No, but some of the DLC is more fun than others.  If you're going to buy any DLC, stick to the ones rated higher.  Inquisition, supervillian, didn't seem all that fun to me.			"

												The game has amazing music and humorous dialogue. It provides a good challenge while simultaneously offering a relaxed and even casual play time. The new Waterborne campaign is fun and worth the money. Multiplayer is fun but few people seem to take advantage of it.  The Tropico line of games continues to impress and is a fan favorite. The company would not hurt from giving attention to a few minor details like ensuring the correct accent is given to the voices in the game (Carribbean Spanish accent versus Spain or Mexico Spanish) and other little details.I feel like the game could do a better job with tutorials by offering advanced tutorials that show players the ins and outs of economy at a detailed level to include how to maximize trade and edicts. Also, constitutional choices and how they affect factions and political standing.. Explanations on why my island might have 100 job openings and 100 unemployed even when I am making them pay for their own healthcare and food would be nice.The game has much more potential especially if they focus on multiplayer. Allow each player to have their own islands and conduct trade with each other, setting their own prices, etc. Marine and Air warfare. Corporate espionage and sabotage. Paying pirates to invade th other players. Joint ventures.			"

												I personally am new to the Tropico series and have heard of the complaints that this game is lazy, overpriced, doesn't improve upon the past titles, and is a DLC fiasco. I believe these arguments are probably true, but I cannot deny that I've had a lot of fun with this game. The content within the game is comparable to that of city builders like SimCity, but is quite unique with its castro style setting, including a corrupt government, constant foreign aid, and an island atmosphere. Although this may be the case for the other Tropico games, I can say that it was an enjoyable experience for me personally as a first time Tropico player. That said, I do not think that the game is worth $40 at all, and that it should certainly be bought while on sale. Also note that the game has decent graphics requirements, so don't try and play it on a scrub PC or else it won't work.			"

												I love this game. I was a huge fan of Tropico 4 but this game beats it. Multiplayer, and new textures and they changed that way all the buildings look. I love the new layout in my opinion it is way better then previous games. Id recommend this game to everyone who loves city building games.			"

												This is a subpar sequel to the Tropico 4 masterpiece, but it still has its value. The management is still there, the politics, the cheesy humor.The added military side of the game was simply an awful decision, and you'll need to go through it at least some times in the main history, despite of how well you handle your rising economy.Being able to start on an island from where you took off is nice at times, but somehow I miss the many different islands with different challenges.

												I personally am new to the Tropico series and have heard of the complaints that this game is lazy, overpriced, doesn't improve upon the past titles, and is a DLC fiasco. I believe these arguments are probably true, but I cannot deny that I've had a lot of fun with this game. The content within the game is comparable to that of city builders like SimCity, but is quite unique with its castro style setting, including a corrupt government, constant foreign aid, and an island atmosphere. Although this may be the case for the other Tropico games, I can say that it was an enjoyable experience for me personally as a first time Tropico player. That said, I do not think that the game is worth $40 at all, and that it should certainly be bought while on sale. Also note that the game has decent graphics requirements, so don't try and play it on a scrub PC or else it won't work.			"

												I discovered Tropico only after 4 came out, and wow... how did I not know about this series? I bought Tropico 5 on launch day and promptly lost an entire weekend ruling as a dictator over a small island nation. Oh what a glorious leader I became; the people, they loved me. My bank account was flush and everything was wonderful! Then the communists started trying to change my liberal paradise... but I refused their demands! Those damn Russians sent warships to my shores, they threatened me, but I will not back down! Russia invaded my country and I was killed. 10/10 will continue to fight Communism (now with added diplomacy).			"

												The game has amazing music and humorous dialogue. It provides a good challenge while simultaneously offering a relaxed and even casual play time. The new Waterborne campaign is fun and worth the money. Multiplayer is fun but few people seem to take advantage of it.  The Tropico line of games continues to impress and is a fan favorite. The company would not hurt from giving attention to a few minor details like ensuring the correct accent is given to the voices in the game (Carribbean Spanish accent versus Spain or Mexico Spanish) and other little details.I feel like the game could do a better job with tutorials by offering advanced tutorials that show players the ins and outs of economy at a detailed level to include how to maximize trade and edicts. Also, constitutional choices and how they affect factions and political standing.. Explanations on why my island might have 100 job openings and 100 unemployed even when I am making them pay for their own healthcare and food would be nice.The game has much more potential especially if they focus on multiplayer. Allow each player to have their own islands and conduct trade with each other, setting their own prices, etc. Marine and Air warfare. Corporate espionage and sabotage. Paying pirates to invade th other players. Joint ventures.			"

For example, why cant we choose where to placce the beginning buildings? Andwhat happended to the map editior? But the pros far outweigh the cons and i would suggest anyone who hasn't played any Tropico games buy and play this one as it is currently the best.			"

												Really enjoy this game, I've come back to it time after time and it still offers some funny/relaxing gameplay.  DLC is overpriced.  This has been the standard practice for Kalypso, it would appear, and it probably isn't going to change.  For a new mission, building, and some useless costumes/styles for your dynasty, should be a 2 bucks max.  Have I still bought all the DLC? Yes.  Do I regret it?  No, but some of the DLC is more fun than others.  If you're going to buy any DLC, stick to the ones rated higher.  Inquisition, supervillian, didn't seem all that fun to me.			"

												I've only played Tropico 4 and 5 and since most people have been commenting and reviewing on the differences between the two of them, I figure I'm qualified to review this accurately.I highly enjoy Tropico 5. I find it very addicting as I'm a complex strategy player at heart and enjoy the extra content, options, and challenge it provides. I think the dynasty mechanic is pretty interesting, it helps you overall in game though it does suck you can't control it a little more, specifically the first names and skill trait your heir gets.You definitely have to use your head! This is a simulation of you being a dictator after all! ANY decision you make will typically either affect you positively or negatively. How extreme depends on previous decisions you've made like who your allies are or will be and whether or not you've taken precautions to keep social unrest down. It's a lot more scale tipping than Tropico 4 and you have to have a short learning curve to enjoy this game for what it is. It's highly political and invasion is more likely from people you♥♥♥♥♥♥off than Tropico 4.Overall I think it's a more realistic rendition of a dicatorship simulation. Even at ""Occassional"" freaking random disasters, riots, conspiracies, etc happen regularly. I love it.If you don't actually like critical thinking strategy games, rely on foreign aid like a crutch all the time, or only played Tropico series for the humor then I wouldn't recommend this to you. If you love a true leadership simulation including managing, building, arresting, bribes, banishing, political gambles, and all the little aspects that come with it or just love world history, I do recommend this game!Likes- More challenging overall- Nicer Graphics- Dynasty Members Mechanic- In Depth Import/Export Trade Mechanic- Politics Game- Love having building managers to increase overall production/job/building function!Differences | Dislikes- *BIG* Less humorous than previous Tropcios IMO. They have jokes but it's like ""Ha. Ha."" More than hilarous imo.- Wish I could name and pick the trait (other than the 3 provided) for my heir- Would like more outfits than currently provided for avatars (Might be future DLC)- Wish I could purchase/attract more trade ships other than building a dock per trade ship ratio.- While I like the Eras mechanic, find it a little hindering BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE for things like tourism or imprisoning/arresting etc not able to be done earlier in the game.- There is less of a subtle teaching mechanism in Tropico 5 than 4. You pretty much trial and error play blindly until you find yourself out of a job and have to restart the game with what you've learned. I can handle it personally but it might be a turn off for other players who need a bit more guidance in a game. (Took me a while to figure out how trade works and that I could send squads to unveil the island. No instructions on that.)Tips- Save Regularly. It does autosave but since crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥happens in short amounts of time, you may want to change a bad outcome.- I reccommend doing a little research before playing the game. If you aren't familiar with actual world history or the game's new mechanics it will behoove you to look a few things up ahead of time like what technologies/resources and trade will be available in future eras so you can plan accordingly.- Check the trade routes before you designate farms/ranches/mines. You can profit more with something in demand.- Send out the squad from your palace to open up other areas of the island. (Costs $1000)- Don't be afraid/panic if you go into the negative in your treasury a bit. You have a -$10,000 Defincit allowance.- If you have 51% love of your people, I don't recommend doing an election if you can't improve in 12 months. I've literally lost an election like that hitting 49% by 12 months. And when in doubt if you've already agreed or suddenly lost a lot of support dont be afraid to call Martial Law to stop the election!- Always expect the unexpected.			"

												Just picked this up for 75% and I do not regret my decision. I agree with most reviews that it is pricey right now but just wait for a sale like I did. Also, yes the game is similiar to the others that came before it but is that not why we bought it. I loved Tropico 4 and I hoped that five was the same and I was not wrong. I continue to buy the sims and yet it is the same thing but that is what I want and love. So if you are like me and are happy with the past games then you will enjoy the fifth one like I have. Just a side note, I love all these ""helpful"" negative reviews on that game claiming that Tropico 5 is a let down or is the exact same thing and yet look at some of the hours they logged into the game...

												A singleplayer game worth your money. Tropico 5 is a fair game for a fair price, an enjoyable Dictator simulator that while borrows many visual assets from previous games, has gameplay rebuilt from ground up. As a player who never touched campaign mode, the focus on a deep and richer sandbox mode is exactly what I wanted. Here are some ups and downs from my experience.-DON'T BUY FOR MULTIPLAYERAnyone buying Tropico 5 for multiplayer should definitely wait a long time, its a half-baked feature that may very well need an entire expansion (or two) to get right.-ALMANACThe new Almanac technically has most of the information you could get from 4, but its not very intuitive.  It takes a long itme to figure out where the important info is scurried away. Sometimes you need to scroll down, sometimes its behind an inconspicious word button. You have to explore every nook and cranny to find what you need. +DYNASTYThe Dynasty mechanic was kind of a letdown. Its an upgrade from T4, where each skill doesn't go into a massive pool, but is tied to a specific character (who can potentially die in certain circumstances.)+ERAS AND MISSION STRUCTUREThe Era system is the real game changer. If you've seen TotalBuscuit's T5 preview, you'll know the game has a very rigid, formulaic mission structure at the start, the Colonial Era. This is the most defining and brilliant of changes made to the Tropico series.These Colonial missions are guide you to very specific objectives, ignoring these usually  results in a premature ending. This is done to prevent you from falling into a routine which in prior games, would kill the fun of these games after awhile. These mission chains will seem binding, that you HAVE to do exactly what these missions tell you or fail. However, as your understanding of the game mechanics come together, you can figure out how much breathing space you have to fulfill the missions while building the Tropico you have in mind. +-COMBATCombat is all about expectations. Its no RTS. Its a little hands off, but for me personally its hard to react to changing circumstances. Your firepower comes only from three sources: guard towers, soldiers and tanks. If all of these sources of attack power are gone, you're effectively done. The most depth I've found with the system is grouping Guard Towers, so that the tankiness of the towers are complemented by consistent firepower which can kill enemy units and actually turn battles around. There should be ways to react to a bad situation, by cutting deals or accepting demands.			"

												Deluso. This game had the potential to be a true tropical paradise. Unfortunately, it fell short. Here is why:1.  The Dynasty feature isn't properly exploited.  While having a dynasty of dictators sounds badass, throughout the entire game, I never really needed to switch my main dictator. To be honest, it did not feel groundbreaking or really relevant for the game that I had backup dictators. I did not feel that they were ”valuable assets” either.2.  The Eras lack substance.  They felt like simplified boxes. Advancing from era to era is not as exciting as you would think.3.  The multiplayer is cringy. I wanted to be a co-op dictator, I reaallly did. But I felt like at every step of the way something was not working.  FEAR NOT TROPICANS, TROPICAL 4 REMAINS!  "

												Topico 5 lacks much of the charm that made the earlier Tropico games memorable. The songs are all weak instrumental tracks rather than the awesome vocals tracks of earlier titles. There is none of the fun advisor commentary from earlier ones (""You are making qute a lot of enemies, Presidente!""). Even the simple pleasure of clicking on a random citizen and getting to know who they are and what they are doing is gone. The people instead scurry around as faceless drones that can't be interacted with. That takes all of the fun out of crushing a rebellion. The developers seem to be abandoning the roots of what made the original Tropico (and Tropico 3) special. "

												Tropico 5 is a fun city builder type game. It is not the same as Sim Cities or similar games so don't expect it to be.You get to play as an oppressive dictator, what else could you want? Stalin 2.0The main difference aside from some parts of gameplay is the single player story mode which ties together a large portion of the game.You might be wondering how a city builder can have a story mode, which is exactly what I asked myself.Oddly enough it was not horrible, mildly confusing, but it brought out a lot of game play mechanics you might have otherwise avoided or missed in sandbox.I have yet to try out the multiplayer and probably wont so nothing to say there.The game play is similar to Sim Cities, but it is in no way the same. It's hard to explain, there are a lot of similarities and differences at the same time so you'll have to see for yourself.It's a fun alternative to any other city building game because you have more control over the region and less people (WHO STILL HATE YOUR GUTS) to worry about.I have not played the DLC, but from what I know it adds more story to play which is probably the only part you'll touch so you'll enjoy that and more buildings if you liked the original.8/10Pros:- You get to be a dictator.- Resources are more prevalent and important than in other city building games.- Trading is a fun and important aspect of the game.- Sandbox is fun to play with infinite money.- Graphics are good, no texture popups, and generally polished all around.Cons:-  An oppressive government doesn't work, who knew.- Riots everywhere, not the good kind either, so much murder.- Combat is garbage.- No way to pre-plan your city.

												It was fun while the 2 day trial lasted, great game and really realistic for a tropical island country type game, lots of options and choices to make. Even better with friends which can be an absolute blast. Natural disasters and rebel attacks on your poor friends can lead to some very funny moments, not to mention the game it self is a very fun city builder. I don't have many hours on it. I wish that it would go on sale, I would buy it for sure but until then im going to wait.			"

												Viva el presidente!So, lets address the elephant in the room. Yes, this is another city building game, a distant relative of Sim-u-know-what. Surfing thru the ages gives you a new challenge, particularly because you need to carefully reshape your city every now and then as the main campaign progresses. One of the issues I had at first is that the game forces you to jump between two islands, giving a false sense of “choosing”. You pick first knowing next to nothing about the resources available at the start, but then the game forces you to alternate between them making sometimes a really hard time, specially if you created a “military powerhouse” for some mission, and then pushed back to turn it into a “tourist heaven”.Having said that, whatever you are required to do, always think you may need to revisit your island, so make it as self-sustainable as possible. If you sacrifice population growth, happiness or food production for some short term objective, you may have a nightmare to deal with in the later episodes.Oh, the freaking military troops.. that is really annoying how they spread and head to the enemy's objectives instead of attacking the incoming troops.. man! How many battles lost because only a single troop faced 3 enemy squadrons while the other 4 where zipping mojitos at the gold mine or the farm “waiting” for the enemy to reach them. For the invasion times, try to built towers and army thingys close to the shore.Now for the good side:Loved the political puns, especially Penultimo quotes. Was kind weird hearing the same sentences once you're throw back in time and some technologies have to be “re-invented” though, if he is a time traveler as you are, why to repeat those? (ok ok, nitpicking here).The music is catchy and the visuals pretty good. Being able to see the little tropicans walking everywhere I zoomed in make me feel important lolI bought this on a Steam sale, and I'm really glad. If you like sim games, this one is a really good addition to your library.			"

												This game is a great game if you like creating a perfect utopian society where everyone is happy with you leading them.  It also compliments those who would rather take a different route with their country and make it a military powerhouse, industrial king, or even one of the best tourism supported countries to ever rise.  Personally I love being able to construct a simple city that can be self-sufficient and have a low crime presence.  This game does have something that I believe needs to be improved, and that would be the multiplayer because while playing with my friend on multiple occasions one of us would get disconnected and no matter how often we saved it seemed to not be able to restart from savepoint.  Other than the multiplayer I would highly suggest anyone who is a lover of strategy games and city build games to purchase this.			"

												I give Tropico 5 4.5 pairs of fancy El Presidente Brand Sunglasses out of 5. The other one got broke when El Presidente single handedly broke the noses of the Premier of the USSR and President of the USA with a swing of his beard. Seriously, this game gets a 4.5 out of 5. Another of the great series of city-building dictator sims that made me fall in love with city-building sims again in the first place and have a personality that makes it so few people can turn away after beginning to play with them, it delivers much of what it promises, but there's tarantulas in those crates of bananas. The first and foremost is that the voice acting has degraded, and things are less funny, than its predecessor Tropico 4. The storyline shares some mirrors to that game, ultimately, but is enjoyable despite this fact. The addition of tech research and a static continual build of your islands throughout the campaign (Which is something I greatly greatly missed in the Tropico 4 game, wishing it existed) provides a cohesive story and more believability, while keeping things humorous. Add in options like crafting your nation's constitution and it has plenty of playability, eve if your fun per minute might be lessened and ther's less commentary about your actions.Sandbox mode remains solid, especially with the addition of a random generator for islands. The multiplayer is a GREAT GREAT GREAT addition to the game, but that crate of bananas has a tarantula in it, too. What is that, you say? There is absolutely no save mode at all in it. So if you and your friends play 2 hours playing a multiplayer game? YOu'd better finish it because you won't be able to come back to it, you either have to devote a large chunk of time to it or play on small maps, in the end.Finally, there are plenty of bugs and glitches, even now, including things like the menu stuttering (at least 30 people including myself had this problem, which was because an intromovie playing in the background had horrible frame rate issues) but there are easy enough fixes of these until official fixes from Kalypso come forward.Over all? The game is a solid addition to the genre and the Tropico family. IT could have sailed higher, and it might still with DLC, but it's already far more enjoyable and far more playable for computers with lesser capabilities than its competitors in the city building genre, especially with very real trade, invasion, and competitive options in the multiplayer making an already deep game deeper.

Posted: May 7, 2016
												I'll finally post my review of Tropico 5, sort of as my swan song to my long history with a game I've come back to countless times since it was released back in 2014. Back then I bought at full price, same for the two extensions (Waterborne and Espionage), and many of the DLCs (mostly to get my hands on new maps). I've not regretted a cent of that cumulative purchase price; it's come out to about $1 for 10 hours of pure play time. I spend $3 every day for my morning coffee, and about 6 bucks to throw a dart at a balloon at the county fair to win a pink elephant which I couldn't even convince my girlfriend to carry. If you niggle about a dollar or two more or less for this much value that you get with Tropico 5, there's something wrong with you. If you still haven't purchased it (either you've lived behind the moon or you just took up strategy gaming), it's so cheap now for what you get, just buy it. End of THAT discussion.I'm finally posting a review also to counter the many posts from the good people who love their Tropico 4, and post negative reviews on this board. It's a blessing and a curse for any creative to create something that is so strongly adopted by many. You may have followed the saga of the unfortunate Alden Ehrenreich, who Disney cast to be the young Han Solo in new episodes of the Star Wars franchise. Mr. Ehrenreich will not live another happy day on social media because the die hard, self appointed guardians of the Star Wars fantasy galaxy will rather have a septuagenarian Harrison Ford act out a young Han Solo than - heresy - a young and fairly unknown Mr. Ehrenreich. Something similar seems to be going on with Tropico 4 and now Tropico 5. Tropico 4 created a unique world that sucked people in, and with which they became so familiar that anything that breaks with tradition becomes a bridge too far for some. But to continue a successful franchise means sometimes having to take things into a new direction. Tropico 4 already got cluttered, and its graphics and tool tips and drop down menus betrayed its origin in the age of desktop computers running Win XP Pro with a middling graphics card. At a certain point, the economics of game development are inescapable: you have to be able to address a user base beyond your hard core niche players (who aren't getting any younger either), and open up to new systems (consoles). Firaxis did the jump with going to Civ 5 from Civ 4, and the reactions were similar. In the end, I've logged many, many hours on Civ 5, seen the modders base for that game grow exponentially and churn out awesome free mod products, and wonder with hindsight what the heck all the fuss was about in the first place. Same with Tropico 5. The devs had to break with some traditions, and what we got - and what you should get - is a game with beautiful graphics (don't buy this with a marginal graphics card, you want to run this on max resolution with all effects and all texturization turned on) and wonderful replayability.This is personal, and may not apply to you, but I found a few decisions the devs took unfortunate. For example, they lost me from ever playing their campaign again when they force you - warning: spoiler -  to switch islands right at the start. There's no rational reason, no macguffin brilliant enough to somehow explain that story-wise, so the devs didn't even try. They just send you on another island. That took me completely out of my little world they had me in, and I never touched their campaign again. You may also find that the wit of the base series is lacking from the DLCs, which veer into slapstick and - again for me personally - made them too silly for me to care. I did wholeheartedly adopt Sandbox mode, in which I think Tropico 5 truly shines. Again, it's a special beast: those who wish for a city builder a la the old Sim City franchise before EA inexplicably decided to drive that against the wall, or the more recent Cities:Skyline, will find Tropico 5 odd in some aspects. You have to put up with the silly story lines and some extreme abstraction in some aspects of gameplay. The amount of information available to El Presidente is also somewhat limited (but then, you can always just consult the T5 Wiki). But Tropico 5 has something that makes it addicting: personality. If I build a perfect city in a city builder, fine. Yawn, eventually. But with Tropico 5, I found I can build cities, like real cities. With slums. Traffic jams. Political shenanigans and NIMBYs you just can NOT get along with. And you know what? You won't have to. Just have them come out on the street, then roll over them with your tank. And after the mayham of another revolution put down, sit back in your presidential lawn chair on your presidential lawn with your presidentially strong pina colada in hand, and look from atop high out over your sprawling, smelling, living, breathing, but strangely beautiful city, and take in that gorgeous sunset painting the sky behind all those houses in the most magnificant colors any citybuilder will give you. That's Tropico 5 to me, and that's what made all those hours I played it time well spent. "

												Deluso. This game had the potential to be a true tropical paradise. Unfortunately, it fell short. Here is why:1.  The Dynasty feature isn't properly exploited.  While having a dynasty of dictators sounds badass, throughout the entire game, I never really needed to switch my main dictator. To be honest, it did not feel groundbreaking or really relevant for the game that I had backup dictators. I did not feel that they were ”valuable assets” either.2.  The Eras lack substance.  They felt like simplified boxes. Advancing from era to era is not as exciting as you would think.3.  The multiplayer is cringy. I wanted to be a co-op dictator, I reaallly did. But I felt like at every step of the way something was not working.  FEAR NOT TROPICANS, TROPICAL 4 REMAINS!  "

												Topico 5 lacks much of the charm that made the earlier Tropico games memorable. The songs are all weak instrumental tracks rather than the awesome vocals tracks of earlier titles. There is none of the fun advisor commentary from earlier ones (""You are making qute a lot of enemies, Presidente!""). Even the simple pleasure of clicking on a random citizen and getting to know who they are and what they are doing is gone. The people instead scurry around as faceless drones that can't be interacted with. That takes all of the fun out of crushing a rebellion. The developers seem to be abandoning the roots of what made the original Tropico (and Tropico 3) special. "

												I've only played Tropico 3 on the Xbox (briefly) and have extensively played Tropico 4, but Tropico 5 takes the cake for me. The graphics are greatly improved and the campaign feels much more interesting to me than the past games - you have two islands to jump between, with their own achievements and research and everything so it doesn't really feel stale. That being said, there are still problems from Tropico 4 that didn't get fixed in Tropico 5, including the ever-aggravating road system...but it's something you adjust to, in my experience.Overall, good game. I recommend it, and if you can get it on sale, I recommend that more. 4/5			"

												Tropico 5 (Review from a guy that'd never played it ever)TL;DR Version. 7/10 Its good, like addictively good but the tutorials are sub par and barely teach you a damn thing. Elaberation; Its good don't get me wrong but it does lack some real sort of direction. First age ""Get Independence."" Okay, well I got that. ""Good job now your economy completely changes!"" Wonderful, lost in my own fish bowl and in the middle of a world war. Alright, I can deal with that. ""Oh by the way, Rebels want to raid your Sh*t. Good luck with that."" Okay, not bad but- ""Hold on there, don't forget about your elections!."" Oh yeah! Nice not bad. ""Okay age over time to make peace with the axis and allies! Even if you were not at war and they both like you F*CK IT, make peace of stay there."" Right.. and I'm assumeing if I tell them to shove it up their respective bums I can expect invasion. At this point things are getting a little strange but hey lets advance. ""Welcome to the cold war! Now, get your economy working and move forward."" Alright, well I expected worse but I get it now. At this point I looked up a tutorial on how the hell the economy works. With about an hour of researched I got it down and now I'm not having to much trouble. Again its a good game but the fact that the tutorials teach you 10% of everything is a little trashy. They are not called ""Tutorials"" for nothing.If you need a break from Sim city or Skylines, its a good buy. However the extensive DLC for the game. (DLC which is little things for 4$ each.. Seriously?) Seems interesting but I personally will not waste my money on the DLC unless its offered as a good priced bundle.7/10 Decent Buy. I'd recomend it. LONG LIVE TROPICO			"

												Tropico 5 is a welcome sequel to a great series. Many fans were underwhelmed by Tropico 4. While the game was solid it did little to innovate on Tropico 3 and its expansions. Tropico 5 took notes, and now offers a very different gameplay experience.The biggest changes are the multitude of little tweaks, such as how farms work, a new research system, new specialist system, the dynasty mechanics and a dozen other little things that overhaul the game hugely. Each is well implemented with the level of detail and balance we've come to expect from the series.The new time based campaigns are also something that Tropico players have talked about for a long term- persistent islands. Traditionally each level in Tropico is its own map, but no longer. You have only two islands in this game, and you develop them through the campaign. This requires much more foresight and planning and led to me needing to restart the campaign twice because I didn't think far enough ahead. I thoroughly enjoyed overcoming this great new challenge.If you've never played Tropico I'd suggest starting with 3 or 4. 5 is a very different game but it maintains the tone, feel and gameplay shape of its predecessors. As such you can spend a little less seeing if you like the style before you commit to spending more on the recent title.If you know Tropico and love it, then you'll love Tropico 5. Faithful, but not afraid to break new ground. And they break it with extreme competence and authority. "

												Tropico 5 is just not as good as Tropico 4. Now I wouldn't say that makes it a bad game, but it does mean that I can't seem to judge it on it's own merits because the other games in the series are there to remind you what it should have been. Your building options are a lot more limited (because of the eras) so it feels a lot less open and free, it hardly feels like you are building your island as much as being told to build someone else's island. You can make the choices, but there aren't really that many to make. It has some nice new ideas, but they are executed in clumsy and simplistic ways that take away from the gameplay rather than adding to it.And Tropico 4 is cheaper too.			"

It is witty and quests are quite varied. I have played Tropico 2-5 and I could say this is slightly better than its predecessors and that's not a bad thing. Even though this installment is quite similar to the others it still worths to play it. Just don't skip the dialog. Some people say that everything is dumbed down. There are additional mechanics and dumbing down some aspects made the game more manageable.			"

												In tropico 3 and 4, you felt like you were building a real nation. In tropico 5, you can sit back, do nothing and be rewarded. Although it's improved in some regards such as the extended timeline. The fact that police no longer roam around the city, and the military is no longer based on individual soldiers/units creates a disconnect. To me it feels that I have a massive disconnect with the city I'm supposed to be building.			"

For starters the DLC situation is just... wow. There's not a soul alive whom can convince me that, that isn't quite simply a money trap regardless of content, I bought the two that seemd most appealing (and cheap during a deal) and I actually still felt I'd been cheated out of money. Honestly I would warn people away from this title for the most part. You will want to pick this up on sale and give it a couple of hours when you've run out of things to do, but apart from that... I'd recommend to at the very least set your expectations down before you buy.			"

At first you have few high school education which is needed for the factory. So you have 2 wirking there using lets say 400 cotton ti make texture. That fine if the extra cotton is diverted to docks like in the old games, but all cotton goes to the factory, meaning your lossing 14600 cotton, which is no where near even as texture isnt that valuble, so you go broke you picked a free tropico, so you cant build stuff to make people happy, they hate you you get voted out or they revolt and bye little island life.If there is a fix i dont know it, but this is still a good game.

												This is the first Tropico game I've played.  The concept is cool and really refreshing.  It has a great level of detail and the there is so much depth to this game (actually, almost too much).  It has a lot of potential to be fun, but there area few problems that took away my recommendation.As a newbie, I don't know what I'm doing.  If it weren't for SimCity, I'd be completely lost (and yes, I tried the tutorial).  I play on all medium difficulty settings and I'm finding myself struggling to get an approval rating above 50%.  I give the people everything I can give them and yet they're still unhappy.  Many of them claim to be bored, but I can't build anything except taverns.  They whine about how boring the house is, but all I can build are country houses and mansions (and I'm not buying a mansion for a farmer).  So you could say ""why not lower the difficulty?"" but then the game becomes boring.  I want a challenge, not an impossibility.  When you rely on approval ratings and the people hate you for reasons outside of your control, that's not fun.  You could say ""so just become a dictator"" but that defeats the purpose of having a choice in the way you play.The game is also a little overwhelming when it comes to management.  Just too much stuff that no president/governor actually does.  They might be cool features to some degree and they could be why I failed the first level, but it's just a little too much to juggle.  It'd be nice if it were more similar to SimCity, where you just zone areas and have the people figure things themselves.  I see no problem with having the *option* to intervene, but this game *requires* it, and I consider that more tedious than fun.			"

												I would recommend this game BUT, and that's a big but!!! The game has a lot of future potential. Meaning the content and overall design of the game is outstanding. However, it is lacking in some key aspects.One of the biggest issues in Tropico 5 is bugs, this alone would have been fine and I'd still recommend the game even with the bugs. It is the second big issue that is the problem on top of the bugs namely that there are some important design oversights in the game.It is mostly in little things, here one little thing and there one little thing. All these little things really add up though to cause a great deal of loss to personal enjoyment of the game. Combine these little design oversights with the bugs in the game and you have yourself a recipe for a day of fun gaming - ruined!For example, if you play on Sandbox mode with all difficulties set to medium and give yourself unlimited money. You’d think with this unlimited money you could make the so-called perfect island, this however is simply not yet possible in Tropico 5 due to a combination of design flaws and game bugs.Firstly, unlimited money is not really unlimited, meaning there will be many times in the game that certain things will say you do not have enough money for it! Wow, well lot of good unlimited money setting did me!Then there are the design flaws, as you play in sandbox mode with unlimited money (and same issue exists on normal modes), your city naturally will grow to become quite large and fill the entire island. The game simply has no good management tools to manage such a sheer number of different buildings. This task is made harder by the game’s bugs. For example if you set “all buildings” to the same budget level. This only sets the current buildings of that exact type. Meaning you still have to set it for each different farm that farms a different crop. It also means when you build new buildings they all start at the default budget regardless.Secondly, you have the design flaws in both the UI and the actual game mechanics hampering your play. Some buildings allow you to upgrade all to the new version. However, not all buildings offer this functionality oddly enough. It is as if the developers were not working in a team and one developer thought, hey! I’ll add this feature. But no one else knew about it on the development team. Thus only the buildings that one developer designed has those functions. Then the small upgrades completely lack them. If you have 20 buildings to upgrade, well you gonna have to click 20 freaking buildings individually! Crazy right!If this wasn’t bad enough, the game mechanics are pretty messed up. I gave my citizens all the rights in the world, built them all the stuff they wanted. But apparently 20 Cathedrals on a small Island just is not enough to satisfy religious needs... what??? To add more insult to injury, I made everyone on my Island filthy rich, gave them all the best entertainment, luxuries, environment, everything possible within the game and STILL I had rebels by the dozens, I had 100s of citizens leaving my Island. I just don’t get it, I had so many empty jobs and as soon as I’d hire foreign nationals they’d leave in a heartbeat despite having all their needs fulfilled to the maximum and happiness ratings in the 90 range on all elements except religion (due to the above issue).As a result this really has discouraged me from playing. I love challenging games, but I hate it when a game is challenging not due to design, but due to design flaws and more importantly, game breaking bugs and issues.And it is a real shame, as there is so much potential for enjoyment to be had in this title. Multiplayer modes (full of issues still though), great single-player content, a wide array of different buildings and technologies. But yet it is all lost due to the game bugs and design flaws.			"

												Tropico 5 lacks the level humor it had in Tropico 4, but at least you can build perfectly straight roads and blocks of buildings with the new grid system. Before you consider buying this game, check your pc/laptop specs as some people I seen on steam aren't compatiable with there graphics card supporting direct x 11. After 15 hours in playtime, Tropico 5 doesn't go past the start up... I have to remove all files to make it work again.			"

												the wage system is one of my biggest gripes. a lot of workers are screwed over by the new wage system since every building has a budget now. which means you can no longer set the wages of all your uneducated, high school, college workers manually. i like how this tropico is slighty more fasted past then the previous. the dlc is another issue i feel they dont take their dlc content seriously and i will always buy dlc on sale. the game has a decent soundtrack even tho the orginal tropico i felt had the best soundtrack. the voice acting is done well and you have various chacters they you like or hate or laugh at. i would give this game a B-. what saves this game is the mods i will post a link to a site that has a ton of mods that make the game much more enjoyable then vanillia. i will include a link to my other steam account to show i have a over 200 hours in this game. http://steamcommunity.com/id/MyRaceIsDoctorhttp://www.tropicomodding.org/ "

												I will say that after Pre-paying for Tropico 5 I will never do that again.  I was led to believe that I would recieve a free copy of Tropico 4 to pass onto a friend.  Instead it just sits in my games profile and I can't pass it on because as far Steam is concerned I don't own a steam version of Tropico 4.  However, I do own one.  I bought it via Amazon.  Steam and Kalypso won't work with me on resolving this.  They got their money so what do they care if I bought a spare trop 4 to pass onto a friend and I can't do that.  The combat system just plain sucks.  No deploying troops or assigning targets to attack or defend that you want.  The tanks go like 4 blocks out of their way to get to the combat area and they won't even go cross country.  What tank can't go across a field?The new pay system is confusing.You cannot control El' Presidente.  He just wanders around doing whatever?I've pretty much ignored this game since I bought it/got screwed.			"

												Ok first Tropico game I bought so no expectations going in. Neat game. But.....I was completely confused on what the point was. I thought I would play through the game on one island, build it, maintain it and go through the eras. Instead its like jumping through hoops, jumping to different islands but with similia goals. I wanted to finish my island from start to the end. SO after finding that out, Chapter 1 complete, removed from PC. I understand there is a Sandbox to build how you want but there is no end to Sandbox. I dont want to give myself goals to play the game. I liked it up to the point when I won my indpendence, but jumping from different islands for the story purposes and carrying out pre-made checkpoints to then jump to another island just did not suite my taste. Read other reviews on IGN, Gamespot, Gametrailers and you will get a taste of what I am talking about if I was not clear. Recommend only when on sale.			"

												It looked promising at first, which is why I was one of the many people that pre-ordered the game. I regret it since I only played literally a few hours before I realized I was playing the same exact game but cut down  in content. The new features WERE a fresh breath of life into the series but to see them spam out DLC that is not worth the asking price only makes me feel even more regretful of my purchase. I never asked for a refund due to the fact it was my fault to begin with for pre-ordering the game and I had false hopes that they would atleast fix up the game and give out free content for a short while where things were missing, since it was obviously missing most of the content that they are now ramming out in DLC. Note to self: Never pre-order a game again. First and last time I'm doing it.Note to Kalypso: The current PR you are going with is only making you lose more and more customers that were once loyal to you. Once you lose your oiginal fanbase, you only start to see a decline in future sales. Yes you get a quick return in money spent on developing the game, but in the long run you hurt your future sales to make any profit. Note to future customers: Don't buy the DLC until its on sale for half price or 75% off. Otherwise they will continue with this greedy cash grab. It's just not worth the asking price considering a modder could dish out more content for FREE.			"

												Tornados are shorter, which I like. Aside from that, I could've continued playing Tropico4 and saved the $40.This game is pretty buggy. Earthquakes can wipe out your garrisons, but leave invading forces untouched. The graphics are busy so if you do put your diplay adapter to work on medium or high settings, it noticably affects movement around the map.I also don't get why I'm on two different islands ...			"

												It's pretty and the time advancement is neat as you go through the cold war.They took out a lot of buildings, tourism is vastly reduced.

												Noticed this was ""free"" in my Steam list for 24 hours so played 9 straight hours of sandbox mode, which is essentially a cheat mode, and the tutorial. Verdict? Imagine communist-based jingoistic Sim City with some very forced ""humour"" and you've pretty much got Tropico 5.You can really see how this game tries to ape a simpler Sim City but like most clones misses some of the subtler part of the game play. For example while the game would love to push random, sometimes nonsensical tasks like ""Place Llama farms next to Waste treatment farms"" in your face, it fails to instruct or inform you until it's too late that you population is dieing due to lack of food; an interesting game mechcanic it would have been nice to know even existed fairly early on in the game!

												Good game with good graphics and humor. Special appreciation for a good music theme, and good sound quality without interruptions.A bad thing is a mouse rotation in game, which was made poorly - its jumping tilting manner make whole gameplay experience less enjoyable. Developers/publishers better release a patch to fix it.Another questionable thing is loader which is looking just like cheap blocking screen virus.And you can't expand ingame music stream with your own mp3 playlist.And yet, after weighting good and bad, i'd prefer a good side. I enjoy playing this game. I'd recommend it if asked. :-) "

												This game is fun but quite limited.  I managed to squeeze some time out of it, but overall it gets monotonous quite quickly.  The gimick of you playing as a dictator start of rather funny but, the humour slowly becomes cute before descending into repetitive and annoying.  The ceilling of what you can build and advance to felt far too low and also quite restrictive.  The choices you may make, again while funny initially, don't seem to do all too much outside of changing some numbers.  It's a weak city building/management game wrapped in gimicks.  While I did have fun, I cannot reccomend it on account of how incomplete this game felt.+Fun for a bit-Not worth the money-Low ceiling for progress and creativity in the game-GimickyI cannot say the experience was bad, i did not dislike playing it by any means.  Rather, it was lackluster across all facets of gameplay.			"

												Probably THE Best Game I have on Steam. It's sooooo much fun! You basically go to an island and try to make a civilization out of it. You can make it the island whatever you want. But if you start in the Colonial Era you want to get out of that era quickly (or don't go in the Colonial Era at all) because you are in the hands of The Crown and you depend on missions to extend mandate, and if your missions end, or if you don't get a mission in time, you lose the game. But the World Wars Era is different, you depend on elections. This game is soo much fun and I recommend this!			"

												A worthy addition to the series. Being able to advance through ages as a very interesting mechanic, and revisiting your older islands and building atop them in new eras adds some awesome strategic depth to gameplay.Unfortunately the DLC missions (apart from the big expansion packs) are not as satisfying because they don't use the 'through the ages - replay the islands' mechanic - and so are not very interesting. Still, I bought this as the huge 'GOTY' pack though, so its nice to have everything, and I guess I used some of the DLC buildings in other missions.			"

												Let me start out by saying this is a pretty good quality game before I criticize everything about it...I've played Tropico 3, 4 (on xbox) , and now 5. This game has amazing graphics, BUT YOU DONT SACRAFICE CONTENT FOR GRAPHICS. I use to be able to play the other Tropicos for days and never feel bored, this game however is contentless. It feels like they cut out 50% of the potential buildings to add multiplayer and better graphics, just to sell it as DLC. I will admit I like the new soldiers, and tanks, and research function, but that means nothing if I can't keep my people happy because (unlike past Tropicos) the almanac is near pointless, also I can't keep my cities looking good if it looks like some communist utopia where every house is exactly the same. I liked in Tropico 4 where you could press < or > to get different styled apartments or condos.This game would be 9/10 if it actually HAD MORE CONTENT. But since it doesn't I give it 5/10 "

												For those who have played Tropico before...This game is quite different.. There are more options towards the world play rather than just your island. The global trade affects your island, and other countries,You can♥♥♥♥♥♥countries off and they invade,You can bomb and/or nuke your own country,Be the American or North Korea of the tropics,TANKS!!For those who havent played it..I was invaded by America because I refused to sell them oil, but they said I had WMD's 10/10			"

												This is a downgrade from Tropico 4. There are actually far fewer customization options in this game than in Tropico 4, the only real improvement is graphics. Even at a discount you should just go back and play Tropico 4, which probably got a lot more money and development time.			"

												Rebels rising every year in spite of an approval rating of 80% ? Yeah right...No depth, no economy, no nothing but just building guard towers and barracks. There are much better games where I Can do that. If you are lso one of the unlucky ones like me who bought the Espionage pack high chance that the game will stop working without giving any indication as to why. Workaround ? If you find any please also tell me.Not recommended at all. Wish I could sell back mine.			"

												I'm new to the Tropico series and haven't played any previous installments so I'm not sure how this game compares to other Tropico games but for the most part I've had an awesome time playing it. It has a lot more depth than other city-building strategy games by adding the political dynasty element. The mechanics are easy to get used to and the design, concept, and writing all really augment the experience. The tutorial doesn't give you enough info to really play the game. I spent a lot of game confused about why my happiness was high but my approval low or why approval was high but civil unrest was growing. In that regard a lot of the details of the gameplay fall a little flat. That aside the problem solving political aspect is at least enjoyable if nothing else. Whyever revolutions keep continually popping up on my island dealing with them is always an exciting element. Though it stagnates a lot and could use some better tutorials overall I forsee myself spending many more hours in this game. (A side note: I got it on sale for 10 bucks so this review is entirely contingent on I didn't drop a lot of money on this game. 10-20 dollars is exactly the amount I think this game shoudl retail for. 40 dollars for this game, in the state it's in, seems excessive. )			"

												I hate but have to agree to all people before me. With Tropico 4 standing at 110 hours and 5 still at 'only' 35 I must say for some reason it's not the fun or challenge that the previous one is. I feel now desire to pick it up again, rather to play the 4th again. It's still worth to play though, I'm annoyed by the 'DLC' hell that games are nowadays . Mainly because of that I recommend getting the previous version plus all the DLC that was strutted and just wait around when Trop 5 will be written off and you can get the whole package.			"

												Tropico 4 has a much better Penultimo voice acting.  This game is not as funny that game was.I wanna know how this happened?  How do you interview a voice actor ""please read these Penultimo lines for me"" and they read in some deep gravelly voice and it isn't funny at all... ""you're hired!""  You have to be kidding me?  No!  They aren't kidding!  This is a no longer funny version of Tropico.  The world has ended.			"

												I was expecting a light-hearted city-building sim, and I got that for the most part.  But the game isn't at all pleasing to play in the long term due to issues with the UI and hidden mechanics which aren't easily understood except by lengthy trial and error.[PRO] * Light-hearted military dictatorship game, with really cheesy and surprisingly dated humor.  (How long was this game in development?  Simpsons quotes from twenty years ago!)[PRO] * Fairly simple building UI.  Drawing roads is annoyingly finicky, though.[PRO] * Initially looks like it is really simple game but does have some depth when you scratch the surface.[PRO] * Production values are quite good for this style of game.  Graphics are fine, voice-overs are fine, sound and effects are fine.  It's no Sim City 5 but I would say it's on par with an older Maxis game, like SC4.----[CON] * HEY.  HEY.  HEY, LISTEN.  Your advisors will be popping up constantly, interrupting you.  New build requests, new edict requests, new declarations, etc.  I can't count the number of times I was about to change some micro-managed setting only to have everything backed out when the dialog opens.[CON] * Combat is lame and poorly executed.  You either typically pwn the enemy or get rolled over, and it's never entirely clear why.  I've also seen a tank squad try to drive to the other side of the map by its lonesome self, because an intended target was some far-off mine, but the enemy was halted by guard towers along the way.  (Meanwhile, said tower gets destroyed because my tanks are out sight-seeing.)[CON] * Poorly thought out era system.  Some buildings are era specific, in particular military buildings.  There's no way to upgrade or change them so they are useful for newer eras.  Eras also feel like artifical limitations on what the player can build or do, in order to lengthen the game.  (It's frustating to have severe crime problems in colonial era that you can't do anything about until the World Wars, when you are allowed to build a police station.)[CON] * A lot of the game mechanics are hidden from you and not exposed in the UI.  There are stats that I wish I could see in the Almanac or graph that are not visible -- Which is frustrating when you see the data (and graphs) exposed for other things.  The devs already had code for making pretty drill-down nested lists and graphs, why couldn't they use it everywhere?  Another example:  Buildings give certain bonuses and modify other sim values (such as a water treatment plant reducing pollution), but the game doesn't give you visual feedback for how far these bonuses/modifications reach, leading to expensive trial and error city layouts.[CON] * Obtuse gameplay elements.  For example: Factions become very important in later eras, but it requires that you click an unmarked, hidden label on your Politics screen of the almanac to get information about factions.  Even so, the information is obtuse.  You know a faction hates you but the game does not make it clear how to please said faction.  Generally you can use common sense (ie: communists want more free social services, militarists want more guns to play with, etc) but when it comes to constitutions and edicts, this isn't always clear.  Lots of trial and error are required, and the game doesn't let you experiment easily.  For example, you can only change your constitution infrequently, so you are stuck with a bad decision for several in-game years.[CON] * Disasters are random.  I wouldn't mind a tornado or volanco eruption to spice up the game where there has been a lengthy period of inactivity, but when I am under attack from a foreign power, my treasury is bankrupt and civil rest is high -- And then the game tosses in a natura disaster?  At the same time?  I just feel like I am being kicked in the teeth by a random number generator.[CON] * Dynasty system is initially neat, but then you realize you utilize your family members for simple building managers (or, later, building new empires).  I find myself just skipping past all the customization stuff since I'll never see these people outside of a random event face icon or a generic indicator in a building info panel.[CON] * Single player campaign is a mess.  What the game does not explain early on is that you have two islands, and the campaign missions take place over either of the two islands.  (Sometimes you can choose what island, otherwise the island choice is fixed.)  You retain your buildings and your empire setup between missions.  It is INCREDIBLY easy to screw yourself over in later campaign missions by having a ""thrown together"" or imbalanced empire.  ie: You build just what you need to complete a mission scenerio.  On the next mission, your prior choices might be detrimental and you might find yourself in sudden and unexpected debt, as task bonuses (which were given in prior missions) are removed.  Playing the campaign requires foresight and understanding of late-game mechanics, which is a bit too much to ask of new players.In conclusion:  I would pass.  I hear Tropico 4 is a better game, but I suppose that will have to wait for my Tropico 4 review...			"

It fell way short of expectations for reasons listed in many of the reviews below. Horrid pathfinding, numerous bugs, and an entirely dumbed down interface that lacks all the detail of older versions. The game feels watered down, even from 4. DLC was disappointing too, not nearly as useful as it could have been.It does have it's good points, but it loses out to clunky controls and losing so many good pieces of interface since the last iterations of the game. I miss so many pieces of the old overlay and almanac, it makes me long for the days of the original Tropico when Kalypso had it's integrity.

												It looked promising at first, which is why I was one of the many people that pre-ordered the game. I regret it since I only played literally a few hours before I realized I was playing the same exact game but cut down  in content. The new features WERE a fresh breath of life into the series but to see them spam out DLC that is not worth the asking price only makes me feel even more regretful of my purchase. I never asked for a refund due to the fact it was my fault to begin with for pre-ordering the game and I had false hopes that they would atleast fix up the game and give out free content for a short while where things were missing, since it was obviously missing most of the content that they are now ramming out in DLC. Note to self: Never pre-order a game again. First and last time I'm doing it.Note to Kalypso: The current PR you are going with is only making you lose more and more customers that were once loyal to you. Once you lose your oiginal fanbase, you only start to see a decline in future sales. Yes you get a quick return in money spent on developing the game, but in the long run you hurt your future sales to make any profit. Note to future customers: Don't buy the DLC until its on sale for half price or 75% off. Otherwise they will continue with this greedy cash grab. It's just not worth the asking price considering a modder could dish out more content for FREE.			"

												You are the president of a tropical island, you build, manage and raise your Tropico to become the ultimate Tropico. Tropico is a game that requires you to think before you act, to use all of the opportunities to your benefit. The people of Tropico must love you, your resources and trade must provide for you and your people and importantly you must complete any challange that comes your way whether it be joining the Axis side in World War 2 or claiming independence. The game is great fun along with a great challange. You must deal with the uprise of rebels, natural disasters and even world wide issues such as the World War and the Cold War. You get tasks randomly, demanding things that will make your people happy. Sometimes you are required to build a school, a library, raw resource industry. Even required to make the Crown happy until you claim independence. So the gameplay is smooth, challanging and interesting in what makes your people happy. Every game you start won't be the same. The mechanics are stable, I have never experienced a crash. For now, I am playing on a low end PC and it is still very VERY stable. The gameplay is all good fun, you have complete freedom as to what to do. Build a school, build a military barracks, concentrate on education or military or industry. You get to choose what industry you dominate, choose what you people get, what your constitution includes, what benefits your people get, what your government concentrates on. You can even click on your citizens, and they tell you everything good and everything bad about your Tropico. You can even patrol the streets yourself and find rebels, crime lords, rebel leaders. The game is always different, you start a new game and you will always have new problems and new tasks.  "

												I approached this game, two years after release, with playing Tropico 4 in my mind.It's a whole different game, literally and gameplay wise.You are not playing as one immortal dictators, you're playing as one of many immoral dictators coming from a dinasty. You are not passively importing and exporting stuffs, you are actively seeking import-export markets.You are not going to ignore world powers, you are playing with and being played by them.And you are not going to get your buildings automatically in time, you need to do researches.And those researches are divided by historical eras.And fishes, fishes deplete. And no longer you will have endless gold mines, you will need to import.It's a whole new game, with its up and down compared to Tropico 4. My heart is still with Tropico 4 though, but Tropico 5 is still a good experience.Especially with jet fighters flattening the rebels. Fun! "

												Ok first Tropico game I bought so no expectations going in. Neat game. But.....I was completely confused on what the point was. I thought I would play through the game on one island, build it, maintain it and go through the eras. Instead its like jumping through hoops, jumping to different islands but with similia goals. I wanted to finish my island from start to the end. SO after finding that out, Chapter 1 complete, removed from PC. I understand there is a Sandbox to build how you want but there is no end to Sandbox. I dont want to give myself goals to play the game. I liked it up to the point when I won my indpendence, but jumping from different islands for the story purposes and carrying out pre-made checkpoints to then jump to another island just did not suite my taste. Read other reviews on IGN, Gamespot, Gametrailers and you will get a taste of what I am talking about if I was not clear. Recommend only when on sale.			"

												Tropico 5 is broken. That's the bottomline. Have you played Tropico 4? Well imagine if they sawed Tropico 4 in half, and then improved the graphics. That's it. Half the content of 4, despite having tons of unneccessary and greedy DLCs in which you usually get about 1 building and maybe 1 outfit. You get hardly any variety in buildings, hardly ANY overlays, so you'd be hard pressed to understand what's going on at any given time. Okay food satisfaction is low, why is that? I have a ton of farms, I have places distributing food, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? Do I need yet more farms, more workers, more markets? No idea, just guess work. In 4, and in fact in every previous itteration of the game EXCEPT FOR 5, you had overlays for pretty much everything, not so in 5. Oh and good look finding a building and seeing at a glance what buildings you've already built, what areas are serviced with what etc. Unless you're looking for one of the many gaudy eyesores that don't fit in anywhere on your island, like the circus tent, one of the extremely few available entertainment buildings.Compared to 4, you get almost no chance of influencing the elections or the people in any way aside from what you build and the edicts. If you go into an election with less than 50-55% approval rating, you're going to lose. Penultimo as always asks if you want to ""rig"" the election, only in 5, he's hopelessly incompetent because he gives you so few extra votes that you won't win unless you were going to anyways or were balancing on a razorblade. Yeah, some dictator simulator.In 4 you got the option of making a speech, giving promises, it was a great way to keep your head above water, you appealed to the largest group of voters and if you held your promise, great! In 5, you don't even have a faction overlay or anything resembling it anymore. There are factions, and they are discontent, but you don't know how many there are of each, what they want etc. And there are no election speeches, basically it goes like this; Election time, have you satisfied most of all our needs beforehand despite struggling with money and gotten 50-55% Approval? Great, click election, keep improving and HOPE you´ll win. No? Okay, click no election, get instant mobs with 8000hp crushing your puny millitary and bringing down your palace. Or click yes for election and lose anyways. Not even in the very first Tropico did this system function so very poorly!So on islands with rebel threat and unrest, you stand no chance. No really, you don't. You need millitary buildings to fend off rebels, but those take up valuable highschool workers you could be using for factories and services. What's worse, despite having millitary, despite having all the upgrades and beefing up, the millitary doesn't stand a chance against a simple mob of people. A millitary unit has about 3500hp, a mob has 8000hp! You can build tanks in Tropico 5, the mobs kill them WITH EASE.Oh and get this, thanks to the newest feature, the Dynasties (which is a useless feature much poorer than the ones in 4), you get to revisit your previous islands for each new time period during the campaign. Hey great, no longer do I need to start from scratch with every new mission! Yeaaaah, there is that, BUT you also need to make sure your island is tip-top, because when you re-visit with a harder mission, you're gonna have a much harder time. And that would sound fair, if it wasn't for everything I've already mentioned, so basically if you struggle early, your whole campaign might go down the toilet, and you won't know it until several missions later.Tropico 5, is broken. Play Tropico 4 instead.			"

I like to save money.. and 40 dollars is way too muchedit: I still like it, but would like it on my ps4. they have it, but ever sense its launch 2 years ago, it still hasnt dropped in price. especially on ps4. theres only a few reviews on the ps4 as well. I dont know why it hasnt dropped the price at least a little. Still, great game all around. just needs to change price on all platforms. Im sure then it would make more than it would if it stayed at this price			"

												I was expecting a light-hearted city-building sim, and I got that for the most part.  But the game isn't at all pleasing to play in the long term due to issues with the UI and hidden mechanics which aren't easily understood except by lengthy trial and error.[PRO] * Light-hearted military dictatorship game, with really cheesy and surprisingly dated humor.  (How long was this game in development?  Simpsons quotes from twenty years ago!)[PRO] * Fairly simple building UI.  Drawing roads is annoyingly finicky, though.[PRO] * Initially looks like it is really simple game but does have some depth when you scratch the surface.[PRO] * Production values are quite good for this style of game.  Graphics are fine, voice-overs are fine, sound and effects are fine.  It's no Sim City 5 but I would say it's on par with an older Maxis game, like SC4.----[CON] * HEY.  HEY.  HEY, LISTEN.  Your advisors will be popping up constantly, interrupting you.  New build requests, new edict requests, new declarations, etc.  I can't count the number of times I was about to change some micro-managed setting only to have everything backed out when the dialog opens.[CON] * Combat is lame and poorly executed.  You either typically pwn the enemy or get rolled over, and it's never entirely clear why.  I've also seen a tank squad try to drive to the other side of the map by its lonesome self, because an intended target was some far-off mine, but the enemy was halted by guard towers along the way.  (Meanwhile, said tower gets destroyed because my tanks are out sight-seeing.)[CON] * Poorly thought out era system.  Some buildings are era specific, in particular military buildings.  There's no way to upgrade or change them so they are useful for newer eras.  Eras also feel like artifical limitations on what the player can build or do, in order to lengthen the game.  (It's frustating to have severe crime problems in colonial era that you can't do anything about until the World Wars, when you are allowed to build a police station.)[CON] * A lot of the game mechanics are hidden from you and not exposed in the UI.  There are stats that I wish I could see in the Almanac or graph that are not visible -- Which is frustrating when you see the data (and graphs) exposed for other things.  The devs already had code for making pretty drill-down nested lists and graphs, why couldn't they use it everywhere?  Another example:  Buildings give certain bonuses and modify other sim values (such as a water treatment plant reducing pollution), but the game doesn't give you visual feedback for how far these bonuses/modifications reach, leading to expensive trial and error city layouts.[CON] * Obtuse gameplay elements.  For example: Factions become very important in later eras, but it requires that you click an unmarked, hidden label on your Politics screen of the almanac to get information about factions.  Even so, the information is obtuse.  You know a faction hates you but the game does not make it clear how to please said faction.  Generally you can use common sense (ie: communists want more free social services, militarists want more guns to play with, etc) but when it comes to constitutions and edicts, this isn't always clear.  Lots of trial and error are required, and the game doesn't let you experiment easily.  For example, you can only change your constitution infrequently, so you are stuck with a bad decision for several in-game years.[CON] * Disasters are random.  I wouldn't mind a tornado or volanco eruption to spice up the game where there has been a lengthy period of inactivity, but when I am under attack from a foreign power, my treasury is bankrupt and civil rest is high -- And then the game tosses in a natura disaster?  At the same time?  I just feel like I am being kicked in the teeth by a random number generator.[CON] * Dynasty system is initially neat, but then you realize you utilize your family members for simple building managers (or, later, building new empires).  I find myself just skipping past all the customization stuff since I'll never see these people outside of a random event face icon or a generic indicator in a building info panel.[CON] * Single player campaign is a mess.  What the game does not explain early on is that you have two islands, and the campaign missions take place over either of the two islands.  (Sometimes you can choose what island, otherwise the island choice is fixed.)  You retain your buildings and your empire setup between missions.  It is INCREDIBLY easy to screw yourself over in later campaign missions by having a ""thrown together"" or imbalanced empire.  ie: You build just what you need to complete a mission scenerio.  On the next mission, your prior choices might be detrimental and you might find yourself in sudden and unexpected debt, as task bonuses (which were given in prior missions) are removed.  Playing the campaign requires foresight and understanding of late-game mechanics, which is a bit too much to ask of new players.In conclusion:  I would pass.  I hear Tropico 4 is a better game, but I suppose that will have to wait for my Tropico 4 review...			"

												I will say that after Pre-paying for Tropico 5 I will never do that again.  I was led to believe that I would recieve a free copy of Tropico 4 to pass onto a friend.  Instead it just sits in my games profile and I can't pass it on because as far Steam is concerned I don't own a steam version of Tropico 4.  However, I do own one.  I bought it via Amazon.  Steam and Kalypso won't work with me on resolving this.  They got their money so what do they care if I bought a spare trop 4 to pass onto a friend and I can't do that.  The combat system just plain sucks.  No deploying troops or assigning targets to attack or defend that you want.  The tanks go like 4 blocks out of their way to get to the combat area and they won't even go cross country.  What tank can't go across a field?The new pay system is confusing.You cannot control El' Presidente.  He just wanders around doing whatever?I've pretty much ignored this game since I bought it/got screwed.			"

												I'm new to the Tropico series and haven't played any previous installments so I'm not sure how this game compares to other Tropico games but for the most part I've had an awesome time playing it. It has a lot more depth than other city-building strategy games by adding the political dynasty element. The mechanics are easy to get used to and the design, concept, and writing all really augment the experience. The tutorial doesn't give you enough info to really play the game. I spent a lot of game confused about why my happiness was high but my approval low or why approval was high but civil unrest was growing. In that regard a lot of the details of the gameplay fall a little flat. That aside the problem solving political aspect is at least enjoyable if nothing else. Whyever revolutions keep continually popping up on my island dealing with them is always an exciting element. Though it stagnates a lot and could use some better tutorials overall I forsee myself spending many more hours in this game. (A side note: I got it on sale for 10 bucks so this review is entirely contingent on I didn't drop a lot of money on this game. 10-20 dollars is exactly the amount I think this game shoudl retail for. 40 dollars for this game, in the state it's in, seems excessive. )			"

												Tropico, a gem of a series -- witty, fun, engaging, well-made, great music and characters, and just a real pleasure to play. And each edition better than the last, with Tropico 4 being a polished diamond.Then along came Tropico 5. Tedious gameplay, badly voiced characters, pointless scripting, and truly horrible, oversaturated graphics -- which once were one of the game's simple delights, as you crawled into the teeming, detailed maps or plopped rows of palm trees and gardens while waiting for the trading ship to dock. (If you don't know the series, grab and play 3 & 4, you won't be disappointed.)I don't think anyone who created the series is still left at the developer to give this game the guiding vision and TLC it deserves, and this release shows the series has entirely lost its way. RIP, Tropico, you were great while you lasted. Truly a shame.			"

You have to build up a bunch of research facilities to be able to build the nucleur program. So I did that, it's almost impossible because there are constant rebel attacks, tsunami's, earthquakes and the people trying to throw you out of office that when I finally learned the technology I was so happy. Only to find out now it costs 30k to build!!! What the hell! So this mission is almost impossible and the autosave keeps saving over my last saves and making me redo everything back from the very beginning. IF they allowed cheating, I know that sounds terrible, I could at least get through this ridiculous game ending mission. I AM DONE WITH THIS GAME.			"

												Let me start out by saying this is a pretty good quality game before I criticize everything about it...I've played Tropico 3, 4 (on xbox) , and now 5. This game has amazing graphics, BUT YOU DONT SACRAFICE CONTENT FOR GRAPHICS. I use to be able to play the other Tropicos for days and never feel bored, this game however is contentless. It feels like they cut out 50% of the potential buildings to add multiplayer and better graphics, just to sell it as DLC. I will admit I like the new soldiers, and tanks, and research function, but that means nothing if I can't keep my people happy because (unlike past Tropicos) the almanac is near pointless, also I can't keep my cities looking good if it looks like some communist utopia where every house is exactly the same. I liked in Tropico 4 where you could press < or > to get different styled apartments or condos.This game would be 9/10 if it actually HAD MORE CONTENT. But since it doesn't I give it 5/10 "

												I am a latecomer to kalypso's Tropico titles, so my perspective is that of someone who isn't all too experienced with city-builders in general. Keep that in mind.I always read reviews before I buy stuff, and the majority for this game said to buy Tropico 4 instead. So, that's what I did. I bought tropico 4 and played quite a bit, and then I bought tropico 5, and I've played them within days of each other.I think Tropico 5 is the better game. The graphics upgrade is... substantial. I don't know if people say to play Tropico 4 instead because they've been long time followers of the game and weren't impressed with the new mechanics or what, but Tropico 4 is just too easy. Time consuming, but easy. Tropico 5 is hard. Much, much more challenging than Tropico 4, and it adds in some new elements and removes others. The ""Faction"" system seems to take less of a precedence, and foreign politics and a trade system seemed to have taken it's place. The trade system, the rebel system, the edicts, and the constitution all make Tropico 5 the more challenging and worthwhile title, in my opinion.Now, don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike Tropico 4 even when compared to Tropico 5. I've played more hours of Tropico 4 to date, but I believe I'll play more Tropico 5 in the long run because it's just kicking my♥♥♥♥♥even on low difficulty. That's why I reccomend Tropico 5 over 4.The DLC mess the company does I won't comment on, because it doesn't effect me negatively too much especially since the game was on sale and I definitely feel like I got my moneys worth. But if you have a problem with the DLC scheme, I'd just go with another game. :)			"

												I love the tropico series, but sadly this represents a step back in QA and design. I'm still enjoying it, but I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.As it stands, sandbox is broken (none of the victory conditions work), the game is buggy (teamsters getting stuck and ruining your economy), and the game fails at giving you adequate feedback (rebels at 90% happiness, unhappy population despite adequate facilities, etc). You can take this with a pinch of salt though - I completed and had fun during the main campaign, but can't help but feel this game is not worth the money when you have the alternative of Tropico 4.

												Tropico, a gem of a series -- witty, fun, engaging, well-made, great music and characters, and just a real pleasure to play. And each edition better than the last, with Tropico 4 being a polished diamond.Then along came Tropico 5. Tedious gameplay, badly voiced characters, pointless scripting, and truly horrible, oversaturated graphics -- which once were one of the game's simple delights, as you crawled into the teeming, detailed maps or plopped rows of palm trees and gardens while waiting for the trading ship to dock. (If you don't know the series, grab and play 3 & 4, you won't be disappointed.)I don't think anyone who created the series is still left at the developer to give this game the guiding vision and TLC it deserves, and this release shows the series has entirely lost its way. RIP, Tropico, you were great while you lasted. Truly a shame.			"

												Livid at this game. I have played every tropico before this one. Been a fan since the beginning. But now I'm stuck on this Nucleur program campaign. I have played it at least 10 times. You have to build up a bunch of research facilities to be able to build the nucleur program. So I did that, it's almost impossible because there are constant rebel attacks, tsunami's, earthquakes and the people trying to throw you out of office that when I finally learned the technology I was so happy. Only to find out now it costs 30k to build!!! What the hell! So this mission is almost impossible and the autosave keeps saving over my last saves and making me redo everything back from the very beginning. IF they allowed cheating, I know that sounds terrible, I could at least get through this ridiculous game ending mission. I AM DONE WITH THIS GAME.			"

												If you enjoyed Tropico 3 or 4 - don't get this. It's a watered-down knock-off.In most respects, this is a simplified version of Tropico 4, with fewer options and less customisation. The few additions, most notably the eras system, don't really add anything to the game except arbitrary limits on development at various stages, effectively capping your happiness and increasing the risk of rebellion.The game has a far higher emphasis on combat then previous Tropicos, both versus rebels and foreign invasions, but it retains the autonomous nature of your army - you can't issue orders, so you get to spend a great deal of time watching your island get overrun while powerless to do anything about it.Tropico 4 had very weak low-budget graphics - just compare it to other games of around the same age like Anno 2070 and it's clear they're not playing in the same league. Tropico 5 adds higher system requirements in exchange for a very marginal improvement: it's still far worse looking than games released several years ago, but a marginal improvement is at least an improvement. In contrast, the music and the voice acting are markedly inferior to Tropico 3 and 4.And then there are the bugs. Like Professional Army actually *reducing* your army's effectiveness, or mission 2 of the campaign not actually loading without a workaround. Put alongside the frustrating and unenjoyable gameplay versus previous game in the series, I somewhat suspect this game hasn't received any playtesting outside of the development team.Pretty much the only good point I can come up with is the humour - there are some good jokes and references in there, very much like the previous games.Overall, this feels like a small low-budget indie release that's inexplicably sold at AAA prices. In a few months when the worst of the bugs are fixed and there's a slew of DLC re-adding features deliberately removed, then it *might* be worth picking up if it goes to 75% off or more. Otherwise: avoid.			"

												I love the tropico series, but sadly this represents a step back in QA and design. I'm still enjoying it, but I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.As it stands, sandbox is broken (none of the victory conditions work), the game is buggy (teamsters getting stuck and ruining your economy), and the game fails at giving you adequate feedback (rebels at 90% happiness, unhappy population despite adequate facilities, etc). You can take this with a pinch of salt though - I completed and had fun during the main campaign, but can't help but feel this game is not worth the money when you have the alternative of Tropico 4.

												if you love a little roleplaying game where you act as a dictator of the island you want to make. this is the game for you!you will have several obstacles to overcome while going through the different eras : economicaly, socially and diplomatically.if you have played tropico 4, you will most likely love this one as well, because it is just tropico 4 whith updated grapichs and more mission and new feathers.

												Do you like Tropico? This is more Tropico. I'd say it's worth $15-20, all DLC included. The campaign is not great, but the overall island-building economy simulator deal is still there, still fun. Tropico is very much an acquired taste, and whether or not you liked the previous versions will likely dictate whether you enjoy this one.It's not Simcity, and it's not Skyline. It's simpler, and narrower in scope, and at certain very specific things, better at what it does. Worth it if you ever wanted your own Banana Republic.			"

												Tropico 5 is fun or at least I agree to the Discounted price. it was a steal. I love both Tropico 4 and 5. but there is a huge difference between the 2. game system has change. it has some flaws but it has some good.So here is the change.1. no more blue prints, you now need to reaserch to unlock advance buildings and Edicts.2. if you are playing in colonial era, maps are unexplore. until you research Drydocks/compass in the next Era.3. Easier to recruit soldiers as you don't need generals. and soldiers are uneducated by default.4. you will need military to survive rebels and invasion. but they are cheap to maintain. so build a lot of gaurd tower around your castle.5. salary increase is repalce with budget. you can increase building budget. which I recommend you do this to all NON-residential buildings.6.  trait customization is removed and replace with dynasty. this is a flaw. I prefer Trop4 Trait customization. they add depts to gameplay.7. Trading are change... there is so much to discuss here.. but I'm lazy to tell you. so my rating is.   8/10  get this on discount.

Sadly It wont start.. just a screen with a scrollable changelog and what looks like a place to enter my email and password(why?) and perhaps a cd key window below that i couldnt tell because nothing happened to my starting screen (it was stuck behind the endless changelog- guess they didnt fix everything). I reinstalled a couple times... so screw it. I guess you get what you pay for.. Im asking for a refund.			"

												update: yeah so found 2 GIANT flaws with the game, export ships have limited cpacity unlike previous games, so every time by the time you hit the modern area youll go into an unending debt because ships are taking industry items and no more raw materials netting you -$$.  second major problem is teamsters dont work proberly at all. not sure what they did to them from trop 4 but in that one, theyd choose industry buildings first and docks last, so if you have tobacco itd always go to the cigar factory (if you had one) then to the dock to make you more money. now in tropico 5 they just dump it randomly between the factory and the dock making the first flaw very very very apparent. another way teamsters suck is that they will rarely grab imports, they mostly leave them in the dock and eventually they clog up the dock like in the first flaw.  THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED, MAKE SHIPS HAVE UNLIMITED CAPACITY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE THIS WOULD FIX MOST OF THE ISSUESi liked this game i played tropico 3 and 4. 5 is a little different it dumbs down a lot of things making it hard to understand because it is very different, some new buildings and some old buildings. the buildings now are very squared off and fit better in the areas unlike trop 4 where everything exploded around your palace, now its everything is crammed into your palace. im not a fan of the export system because it requires multiple docks for import ships so your exports will be spread around 5 different docks making income hit or miss when a boat shows up, i liked trop 4 where it was you gave the dock an amount of money you were willing to buy imports like 15k and it would buy many different things your island needed to have based on which structures allowed raw material imports, now it is you have import ships for SPECIFIC items like 1 ship for iron, 1 separate ship for gold, and 1 separate ship for uranium, that means building 3 docks to support these ships. To make matters worse in 4 if you didnt have the money you couldnt buy imports, in 5 itll sometimes spend money you dont have on imports. im unsure how co-op works, the budget system as to the old trop4 version which was easy to understand, and im unsure how the manager system for buildings helps them function. the new military system is great and ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO REPELL AN INVASION FORCE is the best as to in 4 its just you lose since you were invaded.

												Dissapointed... Coup happens every 10 mins when you have economic crisis, people can throw you down easily by the coup, and there are rebels even though i have high happiness. Somewhat when i'm transitioning to the modern era, coal usage in the power plants are reduced 50-60% for no reason thus i have less economic activities and less satifaction which leads to the annoying coup. The  few positive things about this game is that it's funny and the battle is realistic.Tropico 4 was better...Overall 4.5/10 "

												The fifth instalment of Kalypso's banana republic simulator has little to offer in strategic depth and an occasional amusing but generally unfunny, hyperbolic sense of humor.The game seems to hide information that is essential to learning its model. There is too little information to understand both the supply and demand of your economy to make decisions. In the late game, odds are high that your otherwise happy and well fed citizens will bring an end to your rule in large part because your army can't be bothered to assemble before attacking. They all arrive and charge the rebel mob one by one on their own, impaling themselves like Persian Immortals on the 300 Spartans.To its credit, the game is delightfully pretty and briefly satisfying.

												Good : More fun than Tropico 4You can research your tech, and customize your Law.You can not get everything. You should choose.You should make sure your strategy as each stage has specific mission.Bad : uncomfortable than Tropico 4To play  with the mouse you should disconnect the game pad.You can not cancel your actions.And I could not find old hot-keys.

												Well, I had enough time to get through the tutorials...and that's about it before my life took over.  From what I saw, Tropico 5 is a much more visually beautiful game than Tropico 2 (last game in series I recall playing) but I've decided not to buy the game, even at 10.99CDN.  Why you ask?  I saw the many, many and expensive DLCs and said screw that - $48CDN - in ADDITION to the 'full game' at 10.99.  When I buy a game, I want the full experience.  I'll pay extra for a proper expansion, just don't try to piece-meal parts of the game to me.			"

												Do you like Tropico? This is more Tropico. I'd say it's worth $15-20, all DLC included. The campaign is not great, but the overall island-building economy simulator deal is still there, still fun. Tropico is very much an acquired taste, and whether or not you liked the previous versions will likely dictate whether you enjoy this one.It's not Simcity, and it's not Skyline. It's simpler, and narrower in scope, and at certain very specific things, better at what it does. Worth it if you ever wanted your own Banana Republic.			"

GT400 or above. I have a GT330, which works fine for practically any other game but this one. These graphics from youtube videos don't even look that intensive. Such a waste of money.

												I hate but have to agree to all people before me. With Tropico 4 standing at 110 hours and 5 still at 'only' 35 I must say for some reason it's not the fun or challenge that the previous one is. I feel now desire to pick it up again, rather to play the 4th again. It's still worth to play though, I'm annoyed by the 'DLC' hell that games are nowadays . Mainly because of that I recommend getting the previous version plus all the DLC that was strutted and just wait around when Trop 5 will be written off and you can get the whole package.			"

												If your on the fence about getting this game get it. It's after I've played all of the Tropico games (with the exception of 2 I believe which didn't come out on the PC for some reason..) What's cool about this game is: 1 Trade routes. - If you like to play sandbox the game is so much better. You run out of resources, and what's cool now is you can set up trade agreements at different prices to import/export. And in order to make good money and have your buildings function you will need to import. 2 Multiplayer adds a nice touch; it's not my #1 in a Tropico game, but it's a nice side thing to do when you want to goof around with other dictators. :) 3 The research trees are nice; they could be more detailed, but they are a nice addition. 4 Some of the buildings were NOT available in Tropico 4 without buying Tropico 4 modern times, yet they are in 5 such as modern apartments, offices, etc. 5 Your dynasty is just that. You eventually will have more rulers in your dynasty and you can level them up with enough $$$, and they have different skills.. 6 There are a LOT of managers with different skills. You get them via people attending colleges. You can then assign them to buildings. 7 The islands are decent size, AND random maps can be generated just like in T4. 8 This game is selling much more than Tropico 4 did. Does it mean it's better? No, it means that you will have people to play with in multiplayer mode, and the game is pretty good. I liked 4, but like 5 more. The options in sandbox with trading after you've researched everything are nice.. I used to get bored in Tropico 4 in sandbox because once you have a lot of money it seemed pointless; this is not the case in Tropico 5 with resources running out and the need for trade.			"

												Tropico 5 a good game, don't get me wrong.  However, if you try to play the game in sandbox mode you quickly learn that the game is designed to be mission based, like Omerta was, rather than a true sandbox like the previous tropicos.You have 4 stages, the colonial era, the world wars era, the cold war era, and the modern era.  You progress to the next era by fulfilling objectives, even in sandbox mode.  In sandbox mode the game does not even tell you what the objective are, but once  they are fulfilled your ""reward"" is to advance to the next era until you win.If you played the previous Tropicos for the campaigns this game if probably for you, however if you want a true sandbox city builder, Tropcio 4 is a better option.  This Tropico seems to care more about the campaign than the sandbox mode.			"

												I've been a fan of the series since Tropico 3. Tropico 3 and 4 are roughly similar, with Tropico 4 adding more content. They're wonderful games, and I hightly recommend them. On the other hand, tropico 5 has had a serious overhall. There are some similarities, but the whole feel of the game is very different for me (other reviewers disagree). Here's a quick overview of the differences between Tropico 4 and Tropico 5:-First and foremost, this game is HARD! The previous Tropico's were a piece of cake. You could easily win an election 85% for you 15% against (on average, without trying). In Tropico 5, if the people love you, you're usually riding around 65% for 35% against if they love you. Usually it's more 50%/50%, to a lot less. Electrion fraud is often a necessity, and even then it won't guarentee a victory. With rebel attacks, uprisings, and invasions... there's no ""you get one to two chances before you lose"" deal. If you can't repel them, they'll burn down your palace, and you'll lose the game.-Tropico 5's timeline is more well developed than Tropico 4. Tropico 5 no longer keeps track of the actual year (AD) but rather the Dynasty's time in office. You begin in Colonial times, and progress through WW2, the Cold War, and Modern times. Just like in Tropico 4's expansion ""Modern Times"", buildings and edits become unlocked as you progress through the eras. However, you don't progress through the eras just by letting the time pass. Certain objectives need to be met.-The Blueprints from Tropico 4 are non-existant. Instead it's been replaced by a research system. You need to build a library, hire researchers, etc. You get to choose which research (edits, upgrades, buildings).-The international relations has been completely redone. Other nations/pirates/etc can invade. In tropico 4, an invasion by a world super power means you lose the game. In Tropico 5, your army is pitted against the invader's army. You're also able to establish trade roots between you, and other nations/pirates. This will either increase or decrease your relations with certain parties, as well as offer more or less favorable prices for specific goods.-Building managers are included, which can provide a specific benifit to the building.-Instead of being able to control wages, you invest money into a specific building. This increases wages, job quality, etc.-You have to pay to send out explorers to your island. Without this, you cannot discover new resources, or build beyond your prediscovered area. This is annoying, and I've read many complaints on this. But it's more realistic than Tropico 4.-Building placement has been improved. Farms and ranches work within defined perameters, rather than having patches spring up near the farm wherever is best. Also, it's a lot easier to fit buildings closer together and make the most of your land.-The graphics have been ""updated"". In my opinion, it's a bit of an eyesore compared to Tropico 4. With this graphic update, I've heard of people having issues with the graphics running at all on their machines. My computer is only two years old, and had the latest, top of the line graphics card when I bought it. Never even had a so much as a stutter playing any AAA title, and yet I had to turn down the graphics for this game to run smoothly.There's also one major con I want to point out to those who are not familiar with Kalypso media. There will be between 5 to a dozen DLC ranging between $4-$6 that add minimal content and brush up the game. This is true for almost every game they've published since steam, and they're usually ""patch update"" quality. It's one of the things I dislike most about the company, and it is certainly this way with Tropico 5. You're not paying for the complete game. For that, I'd expect to chip out another $40 over the next few years.			"

												If you're a fan of the Tropico series, then have no doubts Tropico 5 has surpassed any of the otehr games in the series at present.The gameplay has been redesigned to be so much better than previous games and the graphics are amazing...considering it is a city building game after all.All in all who doesn't love El Presidente!

												I've been waiting for this game to come to Mac since May. I played at least 150 hours of Tropico 4 (Mac App Store version). But I was nervous about this T5 release because of all the bugs and missing features reported by PC gamers. I got it anyway on sale from Humble Bundle and I'm so happy I did. The developers have been hard at work since May, fixing many bugs, making gameplay smoother, and creating this wonderful Mac version. The graphics are amazing, especially compared to T4. The buildings and decorations are beautiful. Optimizing buildings with upgrades, budget, and managers is more fun and easier. The humor is fun. The research system and edicts work well.I played the tutorial and a quick sandbox game up through the Cold War era on medium difficulty settings. I had no problems with managing happiness, rebels didn’t appear out of the blue, teamsters didn’t get stuck in the docks, my military performed decently, etc. So it seems like the game-breaking bugs have been fixed (at least for Mac). Minor complaints:I went onto multiplayer, but no one else was there. Granted, this was at 3 am CST. :pI miss being able to zoom down to street level and “walk” around my city.I hate the way the grid overlay looks. It was perfect in T4. Now all the lines of the grid are thick and they glow, making it difficult to see the ground for good placement.Looking forward to more updates for more polish. And once all the planned DLC comes out in a bundle, then I'll buy 'em.			"

												Much too laggy, mainly on multiplayer, as well as the main fact that sometimes even after 20 minutes, the game becomes impossible to play every multiplayer round due to the fact that there are many issues that bog down gameplay (intense rebellions, even the developers commented on the arbitrary amount of rebellions even if your island is a paradise). I also feel rather suspicious of the direction that Kalypso is taking this game, and most of the models get rather quite repetitive and boring (it took me a while to memorize all the models) like how,all the houses have the same model, and the Time Era's are nothing really but sections of the game which lock up certain buildings from you later in the game. All the tanks are literally the exact same T-34 1940 edition with a different paint job. It doesnt matter of its 2005 and you're fending off China or its 1917 and you're winning the Battle of the Somme on the German side, everyone has T-34s. The 3 main issues with this game is 1. When you upgrade buildings or hire managers and the perk menu says something like 'generates funds off nearby houses', it doesnt say how far 'nearby' means, and for a game made in 2014, i really would like some more clarity. 2. Rebels are far too high in numbers, even when i have 82% popular support and 46 soldiers along with 9 tanks, rebels will still bulldoze through my highly trained Commandos and commit arson on my palace, therefore me losing the game due to a coup. That part mainly gets rid of the stalinist dictator feeling, sadly. 3. Man, is Kalypso sure hardballing us with DLC. $4 USD for 1-2 buildings with questionable usefulness, an outfit you probably won't use, a mission that you'll burn through in 20 minutes, and a music track (Despite me not owning any of the DLC, I have met people who do own DLC and have mainly said those comments). Would probably repurchase this game if it were cheaper and DLC was consolidated into main game.			"

												I have played a few campaigns in 5 so far, and here are my initial impressions.Pros    I like the graphics. They look beautiful. Enough said.    I like the music. Not as good as 4, in my personal opinion, but still good.    I like the trading system changes, or what I've seen of them so far. It adds some depth to the trading, which is something I didn't know Tropico needed until now.    I like the snap-to-grid effect when placing buildings/roads. It makes it a bit easier to set up your island.Cons    I don't like the overlay system. It is hard to see underneath all the trees. It looks nice, but personally I find it just makes it hard to judge where to drop ranches/plantations/etc.    I don't like the amount of gated content. There is the research gating (which is fine on its own) and the war requirement gating (which is annoying and unnecessary in a lot of cases). Obviously, the war gating makes sense historically most of the time. In-game, I think the amount of content gated by the wars is a bit extreme. I should be able to have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little clinic before the first war if I have the cash for it.    I don't like the lack of WASD camera controls. The devs did announce that they'd be implementing them soon, so its not a huge deal. It just seems like it should have been put in to begin with, as I remember quite a bit of clamoring for them in 4.    I don't like the new voice actors or characters. This is a serious issue for me. Way more serious than it is for others, I'm sure. The NPCs seem flat and bland. Even the new characters' pictures are less caricature-like than they were previously. The voice acting is sub-par compared to 4. The humor and silly voice acting were what made me fall hard for Tropico. If I had played this game first, I'd probably never try the others and I probably wouldn't play after finishing the campaigns. Seriously. I never thought I'd miss Sunny. The new Penultimo sounds like a toolbag compared to 4's. I miss Lord Chuffney.Overall, I'm enjoying it but am I little bit disappointed at the same time. I'd like to mess around in multi-player before I can say if this game will be eating up all my free-time in the near future or not.Check out my Let's Play series for Tropico 5 for more info:

												I wanted to like this as much as Tropico 4. There are a lot of improvements to how the economy runs, the graphics are beautiful, and in general the feel of the game is less chaotic. The 'Era' and 'Technology' pieces are neat additions as well.Ultimately though, this is a soulless game that tries too hard to make you like it. The characters are grating, the ""It's a new era, now everyone hates you!"" is obnoxious at best, and most of the game is spent preparing for the 'end of era invasion'.. because that's the biggest ""challenge"" and frankly the most fun part of an era. No more can you do fun things like pander to the religous and environmental factions and force everyone else off the island. Now it's ""Faction A"" vs ""Faction B"".. and that's it. Oh, and if Faction A doesn't like you, it blows up your stuff. Yay..I would maybe buy this game if it and all of its DLC's are on a huge sale.. maybe.			"

												I've only played a few games in Tropico 5 and so far, as a long time fan of the Tropico franchise, this is great!Many new features are introduced in this game that the previous ones never have! The Eras, Dynasties, many other great stuff that enhances the typical city builder gameplay! With the addition of Research, you can actually play this more strategically and plan out which research will help to boost your city in the future. With the introduction of Eras, it gets more challenging. Example, you have to stay in regime as govenor during Colonial Era and build up Revolutionaries to strive for independance. So, you have to be the Crown's puppet but at the same time,♥♥♥♥♥♥them off!So many great stuff! Not disspointed at all! If you are a fan of the Tropico series and have yet to get a copy, get one! Or Else!			"

												2 Hours in and I have to say; I do notice a lot of differences between Tropico 4 and 5, it takes a vastly different approach to the game while the gameplay has remained more or less the same.Buildings are unlocked after you've gathered enough research points through new buildings and you progress through time frames in a way that I would have liked to see in T4: Modern Times.I do think they deliberately made the game a bit harder to exploit (this is the first time I failed a tutorial in a long time) the game, though the learning curve isn't that steep.It will take some time to get to know the game all over again but it's pretty fun so far.Pros so far: Authentic Tropico feelEasy learning curvePretty good graphics qualityMuch more diversity compared to it's predescessors Cons so far:They gave Penultimo a stache, a hat and a different voice actor.

Posted: July 2, 2014
												Okay, now that I've put almost a full day of my life into this, I feel the need to re-write my review. After 6 hours, I really didn't have a good idea of what kind of flavor Tropico 5 had in comparison with the other games. As a certifiable Tropico junkie, I have to say that Tropico might be my favorite city builder series of all time. I know that this might rub people the wrong way, but whatever. Anyway, I felt the need to completely re-review the game. I have some complaints, some compliments, and some other things that I feel are perfectly valid. First of all, Penultimo's voice actor still sucks. I still wonder why they would get something so incredibly terrible to do his voice acting. They could've just paid the same guy to do it again. Other than him, the voice acting isn't terrible. The soundtrack is an improvement over the previous installments, but it's still basically the same. A few songs, boring after one mission. There's a much higher emphasis on doing ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING ELSE rather than focusing on city building in Tropico 5. After reading other reviews of the game online, I can't figure out how they can necessarily compare it to the older games and describe it as ""too similar."" - It's really not. There are some staples that are of course left in Tropico 5, the edict system, etc, - but now you have different challenges and things to deal with. You have to have heirs, and you create a dynasty - this is just unintentionally irritating. I don't like this feature - mostly because you don't have NEARLY the same amount of options to design the dynasty members as you do to create your initial ""El Presidente"" character if you choose to go the custom Route. And in any case - you get one trait. Someone else pointed this out to me before, but I didn't realize how much of a detriment this really was. Give me a break. One trait? I'm guessing it's supposed to balance out when you can assign managers to different buildings for various bonuses, or in some cases, things that don't really make any difference/might even be a drawback to your buildings. In other words - the Dynasty building/manager assignment system is totally unnecessary and keeping up with it is extremely irritating and ruins immersion. Just how I see it. Also, having to build a dock for every single friggin' ship is both unnecessary and makes trade slow and difficult. I don't know if I stated this earlier, but the difficulty level of Tropico 5 in comparison with the other games is ramped WAY up. You build plantations and ranches to export goods, as well as building mines and and harvesting other resources just like you did in the other games - only now, you need to assign a proper manager to that building, open up the trade routes, and work even harder to improve your foreign relations. In this way, it's more realistic, and I don't necessarily mind having more gameplay elements - but it could've been executed better. Again, this isn't going to stop me from playing the game. The sharp increase in learning curve with Tropico 5 in comparison to the earlier games is not the problem - the problem is that they took a lot of what made Tropico fun - basically giving you a big Zen Garden to play with, and took it out. Certainly, after playing all of the other games in the series, I have a biased view, and releasing the same game again would be pointless - but how about introducing some of the elements as the game progresses at a more natural pace, instead of making it a mad dash to do anything at all? When you're bleeding money because your plantations are producing too much to actually export the goods, unless you build 30 more docks, which you can't do because you're bleeding money. The game is much more linear than previous installments, where you could stall doing certain mission tasks in order to play around more - not so in the campaign for Tropico 5, you're better off just to do everything as fast as possible, and even then, it can become quite hard quite quickly regardless of how easy the settings are for the game. I don't want it to sound like I'm complaining TOO much about the changes, again, because releasing another Tropico 4 would be pointless, and Tropico 4 seemed much like a smooth, pleasant UI update and graphics update for Tropico 3 than anything. Tropico 5 IS, most definitely, a different game than the others, but it takes a lot of the freedom out of what you're trying to accomplish. Making you pay to explore your island in order to expand is one of the most annoying factors of the new gameplay - why do we have to build a dry dock to unlock the friggin' map? Lame. Missions that ask you to find certain things that are either in extremely short supply or not there at all also completely waste your time and money, and your citizens are much harder to keep happy. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the citizen interactment was something I thought was well-balanced in Tropico 4 - not so well balanced this time. More or less, to a certain point, if you don't have Conscription activated, you're just screwed - you can also very easily build yourself into  oblivion and regardless of what you do, your military will probably suck. That is, unless, you about 10 guard tower for every building you have and have Conscription turned on, then it's not so bad. The idea of tenaments degrading over time is also great - I don't know why I like that idea, but I do. Everything looks much better, and more modernized, than most other city builders that are coming out right now and I can certainly appreciate a pretty game to look at. But it still feels a bit cramped while at the same time feeling bloated and artificially limited in options. I still love the game, I'll still play it until the end, but I feel like putting 150 and then some hours into it like I did with Tropico 4, or as much time as I have in the other games, is kind of a waste, and most of it will be from things that were put in the game JUST to purposely slow you down so the game can seem longer. Not quite as exciting, much harder, and much more to keep up with that has nothing to do with city building, but more to do with dealing with jerks. Extremely de-emphasis on city building, and much more emphasis on politically stuff. In a way, the increased focus on being a good El Presidente and representing your people and what you think is best for them is great, but at the same time, is Tropico a series known for city building or for being a dictatorial jerk who has citizens trying to kill them every 3 minutes, so they can't explore the island or really protect themselves from someone hurling an underarmed golfball at a guard tower that you didn't place quite close enough to one of your docks? Not as good as previous installments, but still good. Tropico 5? more like Tropico: More Politics, Less City - STILL worth the money, and still extremely fun. But comparing it to previous installments is fairly pointless beyond certain things that they really couldn't take out of the game.			"

												Free weekend, download it because I can, can start up the game without problems.Then get in the game after setting everything up.Can't play the game because there is a whole bunch of blackness making unwanted love to my screen.Realise game requires newer graffics card.Don't have money to buy one.Blame the game. No but seriously on the serious note. I can play lots of games fine but some games like this, farcry and watchdogs just seem to have something build in to stop people with lower graffics cards from playing them regardless of having DX11 and being able to play other DX11 games just fine.So if you don't have the graffics requirements sure maybe I should check, but if stuff just appears in my inventory I don't. So now I wasted bandwidth, and my time downloading this game. So my opinion of it is ... **** it.I have the earlier games 1-4 and il play them because the new one just denies me to.So my review will be as the developers choice is for not allowing lower spec graffics cards to play.I can't play, so il thumb it down. When you fix the arbitary blockade. I might reconsider.For the rest, despite having my eyes stabbed, this game is the same as the ones before, buy the old ones, they are better.			"

												I did not get a lot of time to play Tropico 5 during the free weekend, but I am glad I did. It was unexpectedly enjoyable. The art and music are pretty great. and the gameplay is easy to learn.  Of course its always best to go into these big sim games with some sort of guide. I am sure you will find your way around eventually.  The Tropico series is something I am interested in now. and I recommend you guys give it a look.  I cant really do an in depth review or anything with this little time in game, but I can tell you guys to at least take the time to check it out.Raise your little island nation from per-colonial times into the modern era, be a benevolent ruler or a cruel leader, that's the sort of thing you are in for, but after all you are a dictator either way.

												Much like the previous game, emphasis on the same aspects in that it's very clear what the game is trying to do. You play ruler of a tropican island and it's your job to have the island prosper and grow while juggling your relations with the big superpowers as well as your own growing population.The game is now built around 4 time periods or Eras; Colonial, World Wars, Cold War and Modern Times. Special events happen all the time throughout the game, depending on which Era you are in. This brings a lot of variety to the game and is a nice addition from Tropico 4.Multiplayer has been added to the game, which is exciting - I haven't played it much but it seems decent enough. Nothing really worth invisting too much time into - If you are thinking about buying the game, buy it for the Single Player modesThe music is excellent and probably the only thing about the game done to perfection. It's mostly instrumental music unlike Tropico 4 and i have to say they pulled it off perfectly. You never feel like it's' too much and listening to the same music isn't getting in the way of enjoying the game.I'll recommend the game to both fans of the series and newcomvers, but don't expect fireworks. 7/10 "

												This game gets my guarded recomendation - guarded, because there are things that I have mixed feelings about. The obvious dumbing down of the game doesn't sit right and the fact you have to go through eras and again research the same technologies over and over is beginning to grind on my nerves. I say wait for a sale on the game. It's pretty good and it does get a recommendation, but it also has some features I don't exactly feel like are a good idea.The worst part of the game is the awful music. Previous games had much better beats.Kudos on finally getting the issue of farm fields sorted out though.(Frankly nothing beats Tropico 3)			"

												While I'd reccomend this, it's only with cautious optimism. It reminds me of Civ5's bumpy start, but if they can't pull it out of the dumpster like Firaxis did for that game, it'll only hurt the Tropico franchise. In all lucklihood it's sadly likely best to wait for a few DLCs/Expansions to come out for it. Also, stop whining it needs DirectX 11. Old technology gets phased out, it happens.			"

												As is the tradition with Tropico games, the next in the series really has nothing ""new"" to offer, that the previous already had.  Sadly, in the case of this game, Tropico 5 actually has LESS than Tropico 4 did.First off, and most noticable is the change in (good) voice actors, and huge reduction characters.  Sunny is gone, as well as many other favorites, which in turn cuts back on the humor and charm that makes Tropico so much fun.  There's now a more stream-lined way to build (ie plantations vs farms) which is sometimes good, but mostly bad -- it cuts back hardcore on your building options.If you're new to Tropico, stick to Part 4 and it's DLC.  Veterans of Tropico will most likely feel cheated by Part 5.			"

												Tropico 5 shows a series in regression, an industry in regression, and a company that puts more value into what DLC is possible instead of how much game is possible.Tropico 3 and 4 are both better games than 5. Tropico 4 had the same horrible DLC release model, but was still a fun game. Tropico 5 is an empty shell of poor ideas. Tropico 5 is at best a sandbox for DLC purchasing. Once the sandbox if full however, you are not left with a fun game. You are instead left with sandy cat turds.			"

												If Che Guevara made Sim City, Tropico would be the result.Tropico 5 is an Island Defense game.  Everyone wants you dead & you must maintain power.  The ways to die remind me of a rogue.  The ciy is very sim grown up with real issues.  The strat is mostly defensive.  Perhaps because of all this, Tropico has grown into its own, setting the standard for multiple genres.  Playing through Tropico's 1-5, I must say this new one is my favourite.  Haemimont Games keeps upping the ante and it's awesome.The sales scheme confuses a lot of kids.  It is a AAA game worth $60 for $40.  The DLC are part of that initial cost.  At $5 each they are well priced.  The Expansions for $20 add plenty of content for the cost.  This is still cheaper than most AAA games and they were able to do it by parsing out the content as aforementioned.  The game is well worth it.  If this all bothers you, be patient and get it on sale, as Kalypso often does them along with bundles and charity discounts.Any way you make it to the isle, Tropico 5 is well worth whipping out your wallet, sending those Swiss bank account funds, & building your own pirate nation.  The replay value is literally endless.			"

												Nothing more to say than what has already been said.  The game, while stepping forward in certain respects, has slid backwards in so many other ways.  The improvements to the military, trade, and dynasty aspects are easily undone by lack of follow through.  You now can get tanks... but there is still no control over the units and how they fight. You are helpless to sit back and hope they all don't attack the enemy force one at a time like a typical henchman.  The trade system requires boats for special deals with different countries/sides but I was unable to find the unit prices of any of the trade goods to plan my growth accordingly.  Then with the dynasty, it’s great to have some illegitimate children every once and a while, but can't I have legitimate children? Or choose their name or not get annoyed when I have to customize a dynasty member?Besides spelling errors, over the top (and borderline racist) caricatures of the various factions, and general half way approach I've been getting used to, they game is at least a decent waste of time.  I would not recommend purchasing it for anything less than 50% off.  After Kalypso’s other recent games, I honestly don’t know why I had high expectations.  "

												I'm trying really hard to give this game a chance. I've never played a Tropico title before. The controls seem horrible. The abilities they give you to key bind are seriously gimp.  I think this is all because the game is able to be played with a controler. So the keyboard driven aspect just seems like an after thought. Which that's fine I'll either get used to it or i wont.

												This game is a disaster and an unworthy sequel for this series. There is little control over what happens in the game and little useful information to understand . A lot of things got worse compared to Tropico 4. You can't set salaries or rents, houses stay empty while people live in shacks. You can't get satisfy the needs of the citizens in the early eras because most buildings are unavailable. You need far too many buildings of a given type to provide services. Combat is pathetic.All in all playing this game is no fun and a total waste of time.			"

												Are you a rebel? If not you should definitely buy Tropico 5. The new era design is interesting and add more to the strategy in this game. The graphics are nice and buildings are well done. The only complain I have is the DLC´s culture of Calypso and Haemimont, they realease small DLCs all the time containing only a building, mission and some useless clothes for your char, they should add more to those small DLC´s or decrease the price. Thought we would be free of this with Tropico 5 but the preorder shows that they´ll continue doing this. Other than that a nice 10/10 game.			"

												If you dont have Tropico 3 or 4 already then well worth buying.  If you do (and I do) not really enough to warrant buying this in hindsight.  It is more of the same which is not necessarily a bad thing as Tropico is a decent series but somehow, this was too similar to previous edition.  It does have some new bells and whistles but it wasnt really enough to justify another Tropico. So if you dont have any previous Tropico games and like the Genre then I would say go for it. It is a solid game to have on your game library list. If you do already have aTropico, you might want to consider if the extra content/features are worth upgrading to.			"

												After playing this game for several months, I have to say it's not as fun as Tropico 4 which has a much higher replayability value through it's funness and humor. Tropico 5's humor and voice acting seems low budget and the whole game feels 'half baked' and not very challenging. I love the Tropico franchise but this is a serious let down.			"

												The game is actually good in most respects. I enjoyed being able to put more thought into the layout of the city I was building, and liked all the variation that was available. However, I never really understood the game. The tutorial shows you a bit about how the game works, but there's a lot that it doesn't tell you. You need to have public opinion on your side in order to get re-elected and keep playing, but if the public turns against you, you have to click on each person to figure out what needs they have personally in order to meet those needs. It would have been better if there was a page that told you exactly what you were lacking in so that you could meet the needs, but I didn't see any, and if any exist then it certainly doesn't come up in the tutorial.There's also the issue of money. You want your island to be profitable. The tutorial does not tell you how to do this. I ended up in extreme debt multiple plays because I didn't know how to stop the spending of money (You have to adjust the budget at EACH building btw).Basically I was left with the impression that there's a lot of things going on in the background and you are not privy to the knowledge without a lot of extra steps. I'm not saying that it's a bad game, but rather that it is not for me. I'll stick to more traditional city-building games.			"

Tropico 4 had the same horrible DLC release model, but was still a fun game. Tropico 5 is an empty shell of poor ideas. Tropico 5 is at best a sandbox for DLC purchasing. Once the sandbox if full however, you are not left with a fun game. You are instead left with sandy cat turds.			"

												I am not angry with tropic 5 am just disappointed.It just is not up to your usual tropico standers. (Which is hard to do. You expect a few tropic bug  too squash which is what players do as el presidenta but, there are too many. )The game itself fells more like a bet then a finished game with serval DLC.			"

												Tropico 5 to moim zdanie jeden krok w przód, ponieważ wprowadza parę ciekawych nowości tj. epoki, konstytucja czy kierownicy budynków. Plusem jest też to, że rozgrywka na danej wyspie w trybie kampanii jest zapisywana (przynajmniej w podstawowej) dzięki czemu możemy w pełni nacieszyć się epokami i nie musimy zaczynać zawsze od zera. Lecz nie dlatego dałem palec w dół, tylko dlatego że w pewnych, moim zdaniem, ważnych miejscach gra robi 2 kroki w tył. Jedną z nowych rzeczy jest ustalanie budżetu, które ma z góry ustalone kwoty. Oczywiście to nie jest rzecz, która psuje grę w dużym stopniu, ale zabiera mozliwość samodzielnego podjęcia decyzji o zarobkach pracowników co odbija się na budynkach mieszkalnych, w których też wybiera się, z góry ustalony wariant budżetu. Muszę budować domki, które mieszczą tylko 4 rodziny i zazwyczaj dają minimalny przychód, albo muszę zwięksazać zarobki pracowników, po to by mieszkali w lepszych (również 4 rodzinnych domkach), co powoduję mniejszy przychód. I dlaczego w pierwszych dwóch epokach muszę zbudować tak wiele tych domków?? Nie dość, że są stosunkowo drogie, to muszę jeszcze, zbudować ich kilkadziesiąt, żeby pomieścić wszystkich obywateli. Oczywiście, można wybudować czynszówkę w drugiej epoce, która z czasem traci ""jakość"", przez co obywatele nie chcą w nich mieszkać, a potrafią budować sobie szałasy, gdy są miejsca w domkach. Kolejną rzeczą jest polityka wew., która w tej części, moim zdaniem, kuleje, ponieważ, gdy jedna strona cię kocha, druga nienawidzi, czego nie było w poprzedniej części. Rozumiem że jest to część systemu epok, lecz przez to bardzo często poparcie jest mniejsze niż 50%, a potrzeba przynajmniej 51% by ruszyć z epoką do przodu lub by wygrać wybory, co jest KLUCZOWE w tej grze. Jest opcja fałszerstwa wyborów, lecz ona nie działa jak powinna. 2 razy sfałszowałem wybory i 2 razy przegrałem, DLACZEGO???? W poprzedniej części ZAWSZE wygrywało się sfałszowane wybory, były za to jakieś kary, ale mogłem grać dalej. Polityki zagranicznej nie będę oceniał ponieważ nie zagłębiałem się w nią. Kolejna rzecz: imigracja w Tropico 4 wystarczyło wybudować urząd imigracyjny i można było zgrubsza kontrolować napływ imigrantów, w Tropico 5 już nie. Oczywiście jest opcja konstytucyjna regulująca to, lecz ona nie działą tak jak powinna. Mam 4 porty, ""państwo imigrantów"" i przypływa 10-20 imigrantów jednym statkiem na 6-8???? gdzie ja w tym czasię będę już potrzebował 40 bezrobotnych, którzy też, za bardzo do pracy się nie palą, ponieważ czekają na wolne miejsce ""ucznia"" (co powodowało, że byli bezdomni). W Tropico 4 praktycznie na każdym statku przypływali imigranci, przez co czasem trzeba było blokować imigrację, bo przypływało ich za dużo, a w Tropico 5 jest ich zawsze za mało. Ktoś pewnie powie ""przecież można zbudować parę klinik i wprowadzić zakaz antykoncepcji"" tylko, że do klinik trzeba drugiej epoki i uniwersytetu (bez zapraszania pracowników z zagranicy), a antykoncepcję można zablokować dopiero w trzeciej epoce, więc wskaźnik urodzeń jest na początku słaby. Pisałem o portach i tutaj mam kolejny minus. Rozumiem konieczność większej ilości portów, by mieć więcej statków handlowych. Tylko dlaczego zazwyczaj towary które eksportuję, są w kilku różnych portach?? Nie można było wprowadzić jakiegoś filtra, który by sprawiał, że dany towar na eksport, byłby w tym samym porcie, a nie trzech różnych, przy tylko 1 statku przydzielonym do eksportu?? Duża ilość portów sprawia że tylko się traci pieniądze na ich utrzymanie, a muszą być ""obsadzone"" by mieć więcej statków handlowych. Pisałem też, o tym, że progres na wyspie jest przenoszony z misji na misję. Tylko, że przez to mamy do wyboru, aż DWIE wyspy (przynajmniem w podstawowej kampanii). Jeden krok w przód i jeden krok w tył. Kolejną rzeczą, która robi krok w tył, jest biuro budowlane. Po #1: budowlańcy NIE naprawiają uszkodzonych lub podtopionych (co jest ciekawym, nowym dodatkiem) budynków, trzeba zapłacić za naprawę takich budynków, gdzie w poprzedniej części budowlańcy, sami to robili, i to za DARMO, jeżeli nie było budynków do budowy. Przynajmniej wprowadzili opcję ""napraw wszystkie budynki"" czy ""odbuduj wszystkie budynki"", dzięki czemu nie trzeba było ich szukać. Po #2: w Tropico 4, zaznaczając biuro budowlane, wyświetlały się informację jakie budynki pracownicy aktualnie wznoszą, czego już w Tropico 5 nie znajdziemy, przez co gracz nie ma pojęcia, czy budowlańcy pracują, czy się po prostu opier...niczają. Turystyki nie będę oceniał, ponieważ nigdy jej nie lubiłem w tej serii i dlatego, że jeszcze nie doszedłem do tego momentu.Ogólnie oceniam grę pozytywnie i polecam ją, ze względu na dwie poprzednie części, które mi się podobały i mam nadzieję, że ta też mi się spodoba, ale radzę uzbroić się w cierpliwość, ponieważ gra może zniechęcić w kilku momentach. I zanim ktoś mi odpowie, że grałem za krótko itp. To odrazu mówię, że w poprzedniej części byłem ""weteranem"", co można sprawdzić. 140 godzin w Tropico 4 i około połowy tego czasu w Tropico 3 (lecz nie na steamie).Jeżeli moja recenzja nie jest profesjonalna, to dlatego, że rzadko to robie.

												This game is a disaster and an unworthy sequel for this series. There is little control over what happens in the game and little useful information to understand . A lot of things got worse compared to Tropico 4. You can't set salaries or rents, houses stay empty while people live in shacks. You can't get satisfy the needs of the citizens in the early eras because most buildings are unavailable. You need far too many buildings of a given type to provide services. Combat is pathetic.All in all playing this game is no fun and a total waste of time.			"

												Very disappointed in this version of Tropico.  The gameplay seems shallow and inevitably your island will pass a sort of critical mass point where regardless of how many teamsters you build, you cannot get goods transported and your economy quickly tanks.			"

												If you dont have Tropico 3 or 4 already then well worth buying.  If you do (and I do) not really enough to warrant buying this in hindsight.  It is more of the same which is not necessarily a bad thing as Tropico is a decent series but somehow, this was too similar to previous edition.  It does have some new bells and whistles but it wasnt really enough to justify another Tropico. So if you dont have any previous Tropico games and like the Genre then I would say go for it. It is a solid game to have on your game library list. If you do already have aTropico, you might want to consider if the extra content/features are worth upgrading to.			"

												This game is SO SO Good that I dont have the words to express how much I enjoy playing it. This sort of genre of gaming is my favourite. I sit there and build my dream world and spend hours on it. Its a great game that never gets old, I loved Tropico 4 and I love Tropico 5 even more. I LOVE YOUUUUUUUU DEVELOPERS OF TROPICO, you guys read my mind for what the perfect game should be (in this genre) and you put it together, THANK YOU			"

												The game is actually good in most respects. I enjoyed being able to put more thought into the layout of the city I was building, and liked all the variation that was available. However, I never really understood the game. The tutorial shows you a bit about how the game works, but there's a lot that it doesn't tell you. You need to have public opinion on your side in order to get re-elected and keep playing, but if the public turns against you, you have to click on each person to figure out what needs they have personally in order to meet those needs. It would have been better if there was a page that told you exactly what you were lacking in so that you could meet the needs, but I didn't see any, and if any exist then it certainly doesn't come up in the tutorial.There's also the issue of money. You want your island to be profitable. The tutorial does not tell you how to do this. I ended up in extreme debt multiple plays because I didn't know how to stop the spending of money (You have to adjust the budget at EACH building btw).Basically I was left with the impression that there's a lot of things going on in the background and you are not privy to the knowledge without a lot of extra steps. I'm not saying that it's a bad game, but rather that it is not for me. I'll stick to more traditional city-building games.			"

												Tropico 5 is a very good game.Pros:They have made the economy much harder to manage. In Tropico 4 it was just make some sugar farms and you were set.The era system has also been managed very well, new challenges come with every era and also new buildings, edicts and technologies...The tech tree adds a whole new perspective the game.You now have a Constitution where you can change different laws such as voting rights and immigration.Uprisings, Coups and especially invasions are now a real threat that has to be dealt with, In Tropico 4, foreign invasion never really threatened me at all.Better combat systems.Tasks actually have a meaning late-gameThe new trade system allows you to sell specific items to a nation of your choice at a higher price to normal.The swiss bank account actually means something now rather than something you can feel bad about as you earn twice as much money as the country does,Cons:You can't control any of your units you just have to hope for the best that they arrive at the combat zone.Economy is extremely hard to manage late game as more and more buildings are built.You can't activate martial law and have a happy military. The military loyalty is determined by the people's happiness, meaning that if you issue martial law,ironically, the military will probably start a coup.Teamsters and Construction workers are extremely slow, and if you put a building on low priority forget about it. I was looking around for any oil deposits and I saw a corn plantation on low priority still being built from the Colonial era.It literally takes a year to get some wood from one side of the island to the other.Almanac has been simplified, The economy page only tells you your expenses and revenue, no detail of income or expenditure.Budgets make a large bustling city cost you $1000 a second.Overall:8/10P.S: At the end penultimo blames the Illuminati.

												Tropico 5 Multipalyer is fun I must say! And I would recommend the game if you can get it on sale (Eastern European here so dosh are limited). Here you can see and get an idea of what I mean by multiplayer, I recorded a whole 3 hour match (my god it was so long lol) and you can see the playlist here uncut. (music is not the music from Tropico 5 because youtube will flag it otherwise, check description for source)


YouTube™ Video: Tropico 5 Multiplayer  | Miros vs. Captain_Beer vs. Vympel Part 1 | gtx 970 i5 4460 | 2016 

			Views: 372		

			Yet another Tropico 5 Multiplayer Gameplay video although this time I will make a series because the recording is too long, almost 3 hours, so I will have to cut it down on smaller ~15 min episodes...		

Although I must warn you that there are like 2-10 guys maximum on the multiplayer lobby that you can play with, so you must wait for peak times if you to play with strangers. Otherwise I would recommend the game and enjoy multiplayer (up to 4 players), singleplayer has a bit less than Tropico 4 as I heard but I am here for the multiplayer aspect after all! Peace!			"

												Ah Tropico a great premis with so many succesful titles. It delivers so well on early game with pirates and plantations. Packed full of acc 4 nostialga goodness but........... this game later just falls flat of anything intresting or just any goals that you want to achieve. Is it a bad game, No of coarse not but it just fails to deliver the fun and pure comedic joy from the beggining to keep you playing. Is it a game where you build a vast army with jets and tanks to destroy your enimies? No. Does it have a very enriched economic gameplay. Not, realy. Well in the sense,they got panel and a few trade ships.So  Yeah i guess they do. So in my final verdict i say no do not get this game Theres plenty of great strategy games where manage an empire like Civ 5 or Total War  if your lookin to pic this up wait for a sale.  i hope the developers can still bring justice to the franchise caus p.s. i love tropico			"

												The game is great fun! A little more of the same Tropico, but with quite a few additions/changes that only become more apparent the longer you play!Money well spent!P.S. The music is gorgeous! Gorgeous I tell you!9/10Edit:Sadly, others seem to have received a different game to the one I received. My copy is enjoyable and really good fun with plenty to do and some really nice additions to the gameplay. My copy is also pretty much bug-free, there is a little bit of a buggy UI when selecting buildings in the Almanac, but other than that it is in very good shape. There are also some items of information missing, such as Mines from the list in the Raw Resources section of the Almanac and how many free slots/total slots available in Residential buildings. These are definitely not game breakers and will probably added in a patch as they shouldn't be difficult to implement. More of an oversight rather than a bug per se.Others though, it seems, have received a game that they are extremely disappointed by...Who's right? Who knows, but I can say that I'll be sinking a lot of hours into Tropico 5!If you do see past the vitriolic comments and give the game a try, not expecting a rehash of Tropico 4, then you won't be disappointed.After all, change is not for everybody.

												You start the game at 1am for some reason. You spend 4 hours with two other people, remember there is no offical maps that support 3 players so have a even amount of freinds otheriwse you have to prey to RNGesus that your generated ma[ resources are equaly ballanced otherwise your skype call turns into toxic♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then the toxic♥♥♥♥♥♥turns into to arkward silence and somebody dies because they dont know how to play the game and rebels kills them. Then your entire military stays over on there city and the game thinks you are in battle so you cant build any military buildings.

												Tropico 5 now this game is fun for a person who never played any tropico or any games by this company i have been playing tropico since the third installment and to be truthful the game feels a lot like it i mean but tropico 5 has better graphics new models of the buildings but to get right down to the bone this game feels EXACTLY like tropico 4 i mean i really love the tropico games but every new one you guys make is just a sort of barely improved i mean yay you get to research and new stuff like that but its not that big now multiplayer i havent played that so i dont know but tropico 5 the way you play it is just like omerta and tropico 4 and 3 the this company needs to take risks by adding new things dynasty mode is not what i thought it would be not at all i mean if people really actually wanna buy this game i recommend to people who never played tropico or any games by this company then maybe it be more exciting but personal in my opinion this game is Tropico 4.5.

												Hi, my name is astrosoup. I am a veteran of the franchise, and I really like Tropico 5.I just can't wrap my mind around some of the criticisms being levied against this game. I read all the user reviews before booting it up, with phrases such as ""gutting the franchise"" and ""total let-down"" setting me up for a huge disappointment. I'm happy to report that this game is 100% Tropico and the rumors of its demise have been highly exaggerated.To begin, the interface has been incredibly improved. Clear categorization and images of each building help me find what I'm looking for much more easily than any version before it. Also, the game looks fantastic. To my eyes, its a little heavy on the saturation, but even still, Tropico has never looked better. Most of this has to do with the details of how buildings fit together so nicely. Tropico has a history of forcing you to put things in awkward places due to obscure rules about terrain leveling, etc. Alot of that is gone, and I find myself actually staring at my cities fondly, proud of what I have designed. Building textures look better than ever, and farms can fit the contours of your roads, buildings, etc. Even the decorative garden options look good! Anyone complaining about beautification options in this version has either a short memory or has never played Tropico before. These games have always been lacking in little things to make your island look nicer, but Tropico 5 does it better than ever. I have been enjoying the art of city-building, which is something Tropico has never delivered to me before.Also, the new campaign style is far improved over the old system. Like much they have done away with, the ritual of starting from scratch worked for Tropico 1, but never quite made sense in Kalypso's version. I never made it very far in the campaigns, simply because I got tired of constantly starting my island over. In Tropico 5, the campaign takes you through various time periods, with only a couple of islands. With each era, the game challenges you in a new way, keeping it feeling fresh and forcing you to change your play styles, while allowing you to build on your previous work. The hackneyed mission narratives have been tossed out in favor of a richer meta-narrative that spans all of your missions. Watching a third of my populace suffer in shacks while I desperately cling to power by throwing large amounts of money at foreign powers gives me a sense of what it is like to be a true developing world dictator- the artful mark of a good sim. I like how buildings seem to (so far) maintain their ""look"" as you move into a new era, as opposed to magically changing skins. It really keeps a sense of continuity and history, allowing me to look back fondly on my colonial roots. Also, assistance from NPCs, such as extending deadlines, or taking bonuses can be forfeited for Swiss bank funds, so that the size of your swiss bank account actually reflects the amount of extra help you did or didn't accept along the way. For the first time, in the 5th generation of the series, the swiss bank account actually means something to me! Furthermore, alot of the charming hangups that marvelously infuriated me in Tropico 1, and mildly annoyed me in 3 & 4, have finally been ironed out. Ships come on a regular schedule and get loaded immediately. Construction office run more smoothly- no more bursts of activity followed by months of stagnation. I now build about half the amount of construction offices I used to in order to compensate for this. Goods move efficiently. You don't need to build giant parking garages every 10 yards. In general, things just work better. All in all, it has been a major improvement.This is not to say the game is perfect. As others have mentioned, it would be nice to have a little more data available when making decisions, especially in terms of trade and the economy. I'd like to know the market price of goods before I build a production faciltity, for example. The system for clearing fog of war is expensive and not very well thought out. There are some peculiar design decisions here and there, but none of it is game-breaking. I should note that I do experience occasional crashes with my GeForce 660 video card. At least I'm assuming its the card, because Tropico 3 & 4 have always had trouble with it. So save often, even though its a bit of the chore. The autosave doesn't unfortunately doesn't happen often enough to have your back. Also, don't buy it quite yet for the multiplayer experience, until they fix the game speed issue (set to fastest) and the no-saves policy. This game is a fantastic step forward for Kalypso's stewardship of the Tropico franchise. Nothing will ever beat the original, but this one certainly beats 3 & 4. Most of the ire seems to be centered around the removal of peripheral features, such as locking people up in prisons, or setting individual wages, etc. Yet, for every building they removed they added a handful more. This is anything but a DLC 'money-grab' as some allege, as it is brimming with engaging new content, spanning several eras. Honestly, Kalypso took flak for making 4 a carbon copy of 3. I don't really miss anything they removed in the new version, and if I ever do, I have THREE PREVIOUS VERSIONS that I can go re-play. I, for one, am glad that they changed things up a bit for T5. It's still 100% Tropico, but in a spiffy new form.Also, they added a VERY DIFFICULT mode for both the economic and political game mechanics. Of course, I started the campain out on this, daring to hope that Kalypso has indeed returned a degree of difficulty into the franchise. I haven't lost or anything yet, but I did feel on a couple of occasions that my decisions did matter a tiny bit. So there is another positive change. Also, I am having to deny elections, so we shall see...Great work Kalypso. Please fix the crashing issue. Thanks for being responsive to the community. And thanks for treating our beloved franchise with respect.			"

												I played for an hour and just finished the ttutorial. I must say.... a tad bit different from Tropico 4 and a bit confusing. So far I'm not all that much into it, I especially hate that some voice actors have been changed, but ouh well I belive it's gonna be a better experiance once I get used to it all and go into the campaign a bit.

												I don't like introducing myself so let's jump in to itTROPICO 5, should you buy it, of course my answer is NOIN THIS REVIEW I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO BUY TROPICO 4 AND NOT 5. This is why:If you never played tropico it is basicly a game about being a dictator on a tropical island (without genocides or crazy Sh*t)So let's start, tropico 4 VS 5In tropico 4 you want (economicly speaking) to produce much and high quality goods, or you can focus on MANY raw materials, mainly exotic fruits.in tropico 5 you want to produce only a certain thing beacuse you have trading offers which limit EXTREMELY and i mean EXTREMELY the potential of you building your economy, you can build a rum distilery but you can get 0 MONEY out of it beacuse you have no offers on your dockIn tropico 5 you can issue a lot more edicts like: no free food, contraception ban, social engieniring, socialsecurity etc etcIn tropico 4 you can issue some eddicts like: National day ,social security ,food for the people not so many as in Tropico 5 and i have to give 5 this.In tropico 5 you will be in debt every time, (but in the modern ages) and you should expect only forgin aid to help you beacuse without it you can't do anythingIn tropico 4 you will be in debt only if you can't manage the economy and when you are in debt you feel like : ""Ooops i have done some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sh*t"" and you have to THINK on how to make the treasury full(er)In tropico 5 PEOPLE♥♥♥♥♥♥♥REBEL TO MUCH, ok i understand you can be a rebel but at some ok conditions and food+shelter+a clinic nearby you become a rebel, i tell you, you can gave 5 rebel attacks in no time and, no problem you will crush them secound time you play, but the frist time after you build your stuff some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people attack you ITS HORIBLE, you have to focus on armies and not on food beacuse of them. Frist time it's fun, secound meh BUT THIRD they♥♥♥♥♥♥you off beacuse they have 0%%%% REASONS to rebel against you.In tropico 4 people rebel for serious things, like: they want a hospital and you didn't bought one even though you could. or they rebel if you pay them very little and dont provide them with shelter and hospitals and that seems very ok to me if you can't take care of your people they should rebel, not if they are bored like they do in 5.I can go on and on now but TRUST ME if you buy tropico 4 you will have a better time, all those positive reviews haven't played tropico 4Goodbuy (------------ You see what i did there? :D "

												Check if your graphics card is definetly able to support DirectX 11. Otherwise, you will face serious graphical bugs which make the game unplayable. After all this time, I would have expected backward compability like in Civilization 5 or other products. Personally, I don't need the fancy-pancy graphics stuff but a playable game with intersting mechanics. I was blinded by the enjoyable experience of Tropico 1 back then, wanted to revive the days as communist can exporteur, but nope. The store page didn't warn me enough about the lacking functionality if your have a too old graphics card (NVIDIA Geforce GT 230M works with soo many games, even with those sold in the same year).

												For what it's worth, it's pretty enjoyable. Let's get the cons out of the way though: El Presidente customization has been slaughtered, bringing it done to a bare minimum which was really disappointing. The Dynesty system wasn't that intuitive. And the difficulty still isn't much challenging. And there's no WASD support, which is just a pet peeve. Although, the new Era system is actually really interesting. It adds variation that i haven't seen done in my time with Tropico 4 (Which was just one singular era wiithout much deviation) although it feels like there's less buildings for some odd reason. Still, the game is very enjoyable for what it's worth. I reccomened this game decently. Oh, and multiplayer was ♥♥♥♥ed right off the bat, so still have to see that.			"

												For what it's worth, it's pretty enjoyable. Let's get the cons out of the way though: El Presidente customization has been slaughtered, bringing it done to a bare minimum which was really disappointing. The Dynesty system wasn't that intuitive. And the difficulty still isn't much challenging. And there's no WASD support, which is just a pet peeve. Although, the new Era system is actually really interesting. It adds variation that i haven't seen done in my time with Tropico 4 (Which was just one singular era wiithout much deviation) although it feels like there's less buildings for some odd reason. Still, the game is very enjoyable for what it's worth. I reccomened this game decently. Oh, and multiplayer was ♥♥♥♥ed right off the bat, so still have to see that.			"

												Unless you plan on playing a military dictator, this game is pointless. Rebels appear all the time (even if your happiness is maxed) and are made of adamantium, while your own forces are made of tissue paper. If you really want to play Tropico, try Tropic 4. It's a much better game.			"

												The developers had a bold and commendable strategy, one which may even be without precedent: design an aweful user experience, cover it with a terrible user interface, add a couple of mostly-useless tutorials, and bury an otherwise incrediby fun game in it. This is my first Tropico game, for what it's worth, and I'm playing it on a free weekend. The core mechanics are a lot of fun. The UI is visually aweful, unresponsive at times, obtrusive at others, and incredibly dated. Windows randomly grab focus.The first time a disaster hit, my camera got rotated in some weird way. I had to go to google to discover how to rotate it (alt+mouse or mouse3+mouse, btw).Colourblind mode makes no sense (though a whole-hearted ""thank you"" for actually trying, at least!)I went to plant corn and a grid came up. Its name was 'grid: corn'. Hrm. Is red a place where corn is lacking or is it a place where corn won't grow well? I never did find that answer.The controls and their customization is aweful. UI elements became completely unresponsive at times (I haven't 100% figured out how to reproduce it yet to tell the dev).All kinds of windows will not just pull focus (as mentioned above) but close other ones you are in.I found myself frequently going to google to just figure out what something meant; I was completely lost with things that the tutorials didn't cover and for which no in-game help existed. I'd highly recommend reading the manual (if there is one,) before starting if you decide to play (this may be better for people who've played a Tropico game before?)If they'd overhaull the UI and UX, I'd absolutely buy it; I've greatly enjoyed the gameplay part for the weekend. In its current state, however, I would not recomment it whatsoever.			"

												Great game, diffrent aproach to show dictatorship on tropico, game fell more realistic than others part. Progressing time era, constitution and trade system (in my opinion best part of tropico) allow you have much more fun. Rebels hide in society, you need to use police to discover them, its much harder game than tropico 4. Multiplayer is also not that bad. I hope they will release some big updates like they did with tropico 4!			"

												I give Tropico 5 4.8 El Presidente Smoking Pipes out of 5.  Because El Presidente used one of his smoking pipes to stab someone who would dare run against them and broke off the tip.The game is amazing.  It is a straight upgrade compared to 4 with lots of new mechanics, buildings moved so they provide bonuses to each other, much more clear definitions of what farms and ranches are capable of using, lots of buildings removed and condensed, which is a good thing means less to manage!I have put up a post in the dicussions mentioning all the bugs I found after the campaign and a few sandbox games.  I have also put in the suggestions for Kalypso.The execution is amazing but the running did kind of trip at the starting gate and not is in a close running for first place despite the tripping in determining best game in the series.I can officially say I will buy every DLC that comes out.

Throw all of your money at this game if you're into city building/ strategy games!Update: The problem with Tropico 3 and 4 was that once you played the game for 50 hours or so, you knew exactly what to do (for me it was a mix of tourism and cannery's) With the era's attition, the gameplay is drastically changed every so often, I tried using my colonial era strategy in the World Wars era... Axis invades, my palace collapses and the game is over. I've played 20 hours now and have only got to the last era once... then lost the elections.

The developers claims they cannot make it run on DX10 machines (pathetic) since it was designed from the ground up - great guys, now half of us cannot play.

												You win some, you lose some with Tropico 5. There were definitely some nice features that they pulled out from Tropico 4, which was definitely a shame. The addition of multiplayer makes the game pretty fun, it's nice to be able to work alongside, or against other players. The soundtrack doesn't have nearly the oomph that Tropico 4 did, I find myself muting it and going back to the 3rd and 4th soundtracks to keep the vibe.Thankfully, glitches aren't as abundant as they were in past games, but when they happen, they break a game you worked hours on. Mod support is okay, it's only as good as the community making the mods, and right now it's definitely not as large as other communities like Fallout and Prison Architect.All-in-all, this is a good vanilla gaming experience. Multiplayer is fun, and if this is your first Tropico game, you won't be set up for disappointment. It's a great city-builder, with many options to keep things fun for hours.			"

												It is not a bad game but has such big flaws i can not reccomend this game.Tropico4 is miles ahead of this one with so much more to build, most of this game was stripped of content to charge you as dlc later.The combat is really bad too, no control at all, that is not a bad thing but i had 3 bases and many many barracks, and for no reason at all i had a uprising, they destroyed my army and suddenly game over, it just doesnt work right, at least let us turn this buggy part off?The Happiness is flaky too, something just doesnt tick in this one, jobs not being taken, homeless with empty homes, it just doesnt work, maybe it is the awful road placement?As for the Coop play? forget it, it is terrible, there still is no save game feature for coop games, yes thats right, how stupid is that?The best period i enjoy is the colonial, but you stay in this period for like 5minutes or its game over, its just stupid.The radio speach this time around seems to be aimed at 10yr olds too, seriously just grab Tropicool4.Rushed out game and no denying that and very overpriced for what you get.Oh and lets not forget the killer, you have to click every home, choose the upgrade tab and then choose Electrocution on every single home of any form to upgrade it, the most tedious thing i have done in a game ofr the last decade. Why we could not have upgrade all or make it auto if they fall within a powergrid. TERRIBAD.			"

												You win some, you lose some with Tropico 5. There were definitely some nice features that they pulled out from Tropico 4, which was definitely a shame. The addition of multiplayer makes the game pretty fun, it's nice to be able to work alongside, or against other players. The soundtrack doesn't have nearly the oomph that Tropico 4 did, I find myself muting it and going back to the 3rd and 4th soundtracks to keep the vibe.Thankfully, glitches aren't as abundant as they were in past games, but when they happen, they break a game you worked hours on. Mod support is okay, it's only as good as the community making the mods, and right now it's definitely not as large as other communities like Fallout and Prison Architect.All-in-all, this is a good vanilla gaming experience. Multiplayer is fun, and if this is your first Tropico game, you won't be set up for disappointment. It's a great city-builder, with many options to keep things fun for hours.			"

												Tropico 5 is the biggest pile of rubbish I've ever played, 1. When you start a game with your friend it crashes 30 minutes into the game so you have just wasted half an hour of your life. 2. When your mandate runs out the game crashes and you have to restart it. 3. Altogether it just is'nt what it says it is in the trailer, So I would not recommend it to anyone for the stupid price its put at on steam.			"

YouTube™ Video: TROPICO 5 Strategy Guide  Part I 

			Views: 453		

			This is Part one to what will be a Strategy guide on how to successfully complete the Tropico 5 campaign even with the increased rebel threat introduced in previous patches.		

Above is Part I of a strategy guid for Tropico 5.  Tropico 5, in my opinion, is the culmination of the series and a refined product that takes the best parts of the series and expands them whilst getting rid of the parts of the series that were often annoying.    If you liked the previous Tropico games you will love this one....if you've never played Tropico games before this is the best and only one you need!For fullscreen and more videos please visit:   http://www.youtube.com/c/LittleMacscorner "

												First Impressions:Tropico seems to suffer the reversed curse of Windows / Star Trek. The even numbers are great, the odd numbers...not so much.And why? It's the characterisation. Penultimo is competent and not the snivelling cowardly sycophant he needs to be and there's a Juanita replacement called Lucy - who is just as annoying. While 4 had wonderful cariactures, 3 and 5 have ""realistic"" characters - who just don't suit the game. All across the game there are fingermarks of designers saying ""But we should say this is bad"" - which really hurt the immersion. For instance, you can choose to have an Atheist Constitution while wearing a Fedora. While this is relevant in the 21st Century, the idea of Atheism would be far more abhorrent to the Crown than simple Independence - especially if you then join the Nazis. A better option would be to have a choice between Catholicism, Animism (Witch Doctors) and Godhood (El Presidente is God himself) - same choice, far better game immersion.Is it better than 4? No.Tropico works best when it's lampooning reality - this feels like the FOX NEWS History Channel when it should always be the Muppets.Secondary views:Nope - this is plain awful. There's swathes of this game that are borderline offensive and it's removed everything that 4 took from 3. I can't recommend it in good faith. Just a badly written game.TL;DR: A cynical pitch into brofist territory with pretty graphics and multiplayer hiding a fundamentally broken game.			"

No help.Another patch came out, still same terrible lag issue and unplayable.Tried so many times so many different ways, played many hours of this game, have never finished 1 round.Do not think I ever will either, completely dissatisfied, and will never buy a Kalypso product again.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												What the Tropico series seems to understand better than some other strategy games is that quality trumps quantity when it comes to strategic options.Especially in the earlier eras, you will find fewer choices in Tropico 5 than in Tropico 4.  Early ages especially have few buildings in each type. Building management options is based on a budget (affects service quality and wage at the same time).  In general, specific numbers are replaced with broad categories (see budget).However, these are all good things.  Ultimately, entry fees, rents and wages were largely either trial and error, following a guide or broad categories anyways in Tropico 4.  Tropico 5 doesnt offer a lot of options all the time, but each is distinct in at least some ways, and not to be taken lightly (especially constitution principles, which are logically harder to change than small picture policies).Overall, the eras system gives the game good pacing, the new algorithim provides challenge to more experiences players, and Tropico's humor is still alive and well.  You could do a lot worse.			"

												Before proceeding, let me tell you this, this will be long and I will try to point out why I didn't like Tropico 5 in detail, if you want the resumed version just check it in the end.To start it off, I didn't enjoy Tropico 5 like I did with Tropico 4, really, it is FAR worst than 4, the humor is way more childish, voice actors changed for your loyal Penultimo that sounds nothing like him and honestly makes him far more boring and, worst of all, the story is just... lame. It felt like it was written in a rush, making it simple with a more than disapointing ending.BUT the game isn't compleatly bad, the mechanic is far more challenging and the era things aswell as the multiplayer are both good, which makes the game enjoyable. Sadly the game doesn't explain many of its new concepts, making it confusing and really frustrating, you'll have to dedicate a good while just checking each screen the game has to fully understand how everything in it works.Tropico 5 also adds a limit to your total population, making your growth stop at a rather bad point, max 2000 people, you'll start to feel such effects of a limited population way before too, at around 900. Some structures feel useless too, such as the subway and the garage, both say they'll increase the efficiency of nearby houses, but they don't really change.Speaking of apparently useless structures, many buildings have an awful tooltip, lacking explanation for how it works. During my first plays I made factory ranches, an upgraded version of ranches and then suddenly it stopped producing. I searched, read the tooltip again and again, checked efficiency, everything seemed normal, only after a lot of frustration I checked the forums to find out it required a supply of corn.Some new concepts are also interesting, but really badly planned out, such as the manager for buildings and dynasty members. Both should help you improve your buildings and offer some sort of use, but they really feel useless, it is REALLY had to see a change in a building with managers. Your dynasty members are basicly that too, improved managers and frankly nothing else. You could also see your swiss bank account has a new use, improving your dynasty members, which isn't that hard and after a while you just say ♥♥♥♥ it to the swiss bank account.Speaking of dynasty members, you can customize them and your character, but frankly? Customization is just AWFUL compared to Tropico 4. Meager 4 or 5 suits which you won't EVER see as your characters are really, really small. Remember how you had to use your presidente for all sort of things? Boosting constructions, moving him to make speeches, help improve a building, you actualy cared for the character and tried to keep track of him. In Tropico 5 you make and forget about him, what is the point of following him if he won't do♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can't control him either.Lastly, upgrades are now boring, really boring. In Tropico 4 you could upgrade something and it would change visually, even if it was a small detail it was a change and it was fun! You could see you had improved that building! In Tropico 5 nothing changes, absolutly nothing, I forgot how many times I ♥♥♥♥ed up because I forgot to upgrade a building because I had NO idea what was and what was not upgraded at that point.Resuming: Tropico 5 is not Tropico 4, see it as a different, harder and way more rushed version of it, otherwise you won't get to enjoy it and YOU WILL be frustrated.

												I feel this is definitely better than the 1st game. The Dynasty system is interesting that you can 'swap out' what ever buff you want active that your dynasty member has. The military aspect is better as well as there seems to be a feel of more direct control over your army and you have tanks and planes now! XD.  Being able to trade with different countries is cool too. I do miss the prisons and being able to imprison your political opponents though like some other reviewers mentioned. Probably will happen on a dlc or something. Overall though this incarnation of Tropico is the best one!			"

												I played Tropico 3 before, and this is a great improvement:The spirit is the same, but the graphics are better (you bet...) and the Eras are a nice addition. The radio shut up a little bit, but Penultimo is still funny. You get to create a dynasty so you can use several dynasty members around the island who give various bonuses to relationships, effectiveness, etc. Multiplayer has been added too. You have to gather research points too to unlock new buildings, constitution options, edicts, etc. All these additions make the game more fun to play.On the bad side, the limo is gone!! :'(Regarding campaign mode:The campaign mode is not boring, i.e. from one mission to the next you do completely different things. You play on a few different islands, but you will ""reuse"" these islands in coming missions which makes the missions more look like a sandbox game while you can get straight to the point of the mission more easily since you already know the island. It's really good to bend the learning curve a bit: just play campaign! If you're completely new to Tropico the tutorial goes through the very basics (at some point it explains what the pause/play/fast forward icons do when you click on them...!!)I still have to try multiplayer, that might extend the life of the game.Great game, get it while it's at -75%!

												Penultimo and El Presidente are back.  I am really fond of this iteration of Tropico, and I find I'm playing it a lot more than any previous version.  While I've heard some complaints about the interface (especially for the build menu), I found it pretty easy to figure out and having used it for awhile, I find it better than the menu in previous versions with one caveat:  I wish that it didn't show buildings that you can't build because you haven't reached the proper age or haven't researched the proper technology.  It's annoying when I see a building I want to build, and I forget I can't build it until much later.  I'm also not too fond of the research mechanism, since I see no real reason to have research in Tropico.  It feels like it was just tacked on to add a little extra depth, but it doesn't really provide any at all.  All in all, if you're a fan of previous versions of Tropico, this is a must have.  If you like City Builders, this is also a must have.			"

												Before proceeding, let me tell you this, this will be long and I will try to point out why I didn't like Tropico 5 in detail, if you want the resumed version just check it in the end.To start it off, I didn't enjoy Tropico 5 like I did with Tropico 4, really, it is FAR worst than 4, the humor is way more childish, voice actors changed for your loyal Penultimo that sounds nothing like him and honestly makes him far more boring and, worst of all, the story is just... lame. It felt like it was written in a rush, making it simple with a more than disapointing ending.BUT the game isn't compleatly bad, the mechanic is far more challenging and the era things aswell as the multiplayer are both good, which makes the game enjoyable. Sadly the game doesn't explain many of its new concepts, making it confusing and really frustrating, you'll have to dedicate a good while just checking each screen the game has to fully understand how everything in it works.Tropico 5 also adds a limit to your total population, making your growth stop at a rather bad point, max 2000 people, you'll start to feel such effects of a limited population way before too, at around 900. Some structures feel useless too, such as the subway and the garage, both say they'll increase the efficiency of nearby houses, but they don't really change.Speaking of apparently useless structures, many buildings have an awful tooltip, lacking explanation for how it works. During my first plays I made factory ranches, an upgraded version of ranches and then suddenly it stopped producing. I searched, read the tooltip again and again, checked efficiency, everything seemed normal, only after a lot of frustration I checked the forums to find out it required a supply of corn.Some new concepts are also interesting, but really badly planned out, such as the manager for buildings and dynasty members. Both should help you improve your buildings and offer some sort of use, but they really feel useless, it is REALLY had to see a change in a building with managers. Your dynasty members are basicly that too, improved managers and frankly nothing else. You could also see your swiss bank account has a new use, improving your dynasty members, which isn't that hard and after a while you just say ♥♥♥♥ it to the swiss bank account.Speaking of dynasty members, you can customize them and your character, but frankly? Customization is just AWFUL compared to Tropico 4. Meager 4 or 5 suits which you won't EVER see as your characters are really, really small. Remember how you had to use your presidente for all sort of things? Boosting constructions, moving him to make speeches, help improve a building, you actualy cared for the character and tried to keep track of him. In Tropico 5 you make and forget about him, what is the point of following him if he won't do♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can't control him either.Lastly, upgrades are now boring, really boring. In Tropico 4 you could upgrade something and it would change visually, even if it was a small detail it was a change and it was fun! You could see you had improved that building! In Tropico 5 nothing changes, absolutly nothing, I forgot how many times I ♥♥♥♥ed up because I forgot to upgrade a building because I had NO idea what was and what was not upgraded at that point.Resuming: Tropico 5 is not Tropico 4, see it as a different, harder and way more rushed version of it, otherwise you won't get to enjoy it and YOU WILL be frustrated.

												I feel this is definitely better than the 1st game. The Dynasty system is interesting that you can 'swap out' what ever buff you want active that your dynasty member has. The military aspect is better as well as there seems to be a feel of more direct control over your army and you have tanks and planes now! XD.  Being able to trade with different countries is cool too. I do miss the prisons and being able to imprison your political opponents though like some other reviewers mentioned. Probably will happen on a dlc or something. Overall though this incarnation of Tropico is the best one!			"

												Tropico has been one of my personal favorite city builders and management sims ever second only to sim city 3000. This tropico Rights the wrongs of the 4th game and takes some of the good things from 3 and fleshes them out even more. Redesigned art assets give the game a fresh look and the trimmed down amount of buildings and menu screens makes managing your island much easier and allows you to get what you want done faster and with less pointless busy work. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves city builders and or simulation style games. Its not a easy game but its relaxed enough you can enjoy it while sitting down enjoying a rum and coke. Opressing the people of your tropical paradise. This game makes you thankfully forget that tropico 4 ever happend.			"

												OMFG what a pure PoS. Attacks without warning and somehow there are magically 4 enemies that stick together attacking your  island while your squads try to take them all on 1 at a time and your guys get wiped out. Rebels appear out of nowhere also. Tanks will not even go to the battles unless the enemies are rather close. Total waste of my time.Economy side and building up of industries is sort of fun, but after spending 6 hours building your place up it only takes 3 rebel squads to wipe out my palace and game over. ♥♥♥♥ that.

												I bought this game out of the gate face value expecting the wait for linux to be a week, maybe 2 at the most. This expectation was based on the fact that Kalypso announced their linux plans as early as Thu, 08/22/2013 - 21:08. So my thought process was, ""Kalypso has had some time to get linux under wraps and the only issue they should have is the directX11 substitution."" Well I was wrong and lost out on $40 bucks for the foreseeable future, eventually they should release a linux version so I am not at a complete loss. Although it might take as long as Bethesda getting Skyrim DLC to the PS3, almost a year and a half later, but I did get it. After plenty of Xbox/Microsoft ridicule. After hearing about all the other bug problems that Kalypso has been having, like Rebels on steroids and game crash issues I do not plan on investing the time and energy tweaking directX on wine and all kinds of other dll issues only to be faced with the PC communities own bugs, nor should I have to when I pay retail for a ""complete"" product. So until Kalypso gets its♥♥♥♥♥♥together I have to give this game a negative review, its only fair on the customers part.After the Bethesda Skyrim fiasco and now Kalypso's linux and mac issues I hope I do not see an ugly trend forming in videogame development. Hopefully steam will make the linux transfers to steam boxes gracefuly and in time for this holiday season, but as an already disappointed customer I am not getting my hopes up.			"

												First off: the game is by far too easy, and far too short.The main campain took me ~20 hours, same as Tropico 4: Modern Times, whilst the main campain of Tropico 4 took me over 80 hours.The economy is Tropico 5 far easier than in the previous games, no challenge at all.Effectively there are no factions in Tropico 5, everyone is always happy.No crime, no rebels, safe for the few episodes where rebels were part of the plot.Even the military part, was too easy, with the aircraft carrier and the towers being overbuffed.The nice idea of guiding an island through a century was not as well polished as I hoped for.You can just hit ""upgrade all"" at the start of a new age, and you will see nothing of a historical city core.The idea of a dynasty was great, too, but how can one El Presidente live for 200 years?Why did one El Presidente guide two islands at once?On the cover there were two El Presidentes, which would have been more logical.The last major drawback was that this game was more serious than the previos games.The speakers were less funny, less random interaction.Even Penultimo sounded clinically depressed.The core ideas of the game are great. Having islands that follow you throughout the times is nice. Alas, the game was centered on ""newbs"", with too little challenge.Also I guess many features were cut to have many DLCs later on.The graphics are very nice, but that is in my opinion only a minor part in a city-building game.

												Penultimo and El Presidente are back.  I am really fond of this iteration of Tropico, and I find I'm playing it a lot more than any previous version.  While I've heard some complaints about the interface (especially for the build menu), I found it pretty easy to figure out and having used it for awhile, I find it better than the menu in previous versions with one caveat:  I wish that it didn't show buildings that you can't build because you haven't reached the proper age or haven't researched the proper technology.  It's annoying when I see a building I want to build, and I forget I can't build it until much later.  I'm also not too fond of the research mechanism, since I see no real reason to have research in Tropico.  It feels like it was just tacked on to add a little extra depth, but it doesn't really provide any at all.  All in all, if you're a fan of previous versions of Tropico, this is a must have.  If you like City Builders, this is also a must have.			"

												I haven't played the other Tropico games, so I can't opine on how it compares to to those.  This is a fun game, and I recommend it to anyone into strategy games. It's light hearted, though not casual. A funny take on history. I was basically looking for something to tide me over while waiting for the new Dwarf Fortress release. This will do. My only complaints are little things: chartacter customization is limited, and the system for placing roads needs to be re-worked.			"

												Would I recommend this game?  I want to.  But I can't, not right now...For one, the game requires a videocard that supports DirectX 11, (updating your drivers won't make a difference) which was not a problem for me since my desktop is fairly beefed up, however, running the game on my laptop or an older desktop is absolutely out of the question.  What's more, I didn't notice anything indicating the game would not run without DX11, and numerous people have apparently bought the game only to find out that it's unplayable.With that out of the way, a few other issues...The game has a seemingly steep learning curve- you'll have the basics figured out without much effort, and then BAM!  You find yourself in one no-win scenario after another.  After restarting campaigns a few times and even playing around in Sandbox mode, I realized the gameplay is actually just wonky sometimes.The game also reduces all the micromanagement I loved about Tropico 4.  You can't see who's visiting your buildings or other minutia that used to aid in figuring out how to resolve issues with your island.  Everything is sort of streamlined (or tries to be) which actually to me seemed a little too dumbed down.The dynasty system is a novel idea but nothing to get excited about.The variety of buildings comes drastically short.  I want to believe that that the reason for this is because, I don't know, the game was rushed.  However, I have this odd feeling it was intentional and a few months down the road we'll be seeing DLC with more buildings.  And then more DLC.  And so on and so forth. To be blunt, everything about the character customization sucks, and the rendering of the characters themselves is absolutely butt ugly.Drop down the price, fix some gameplay issues, add content, and I would definitely recommend.  Right now I feel like the game is an unfinished product.			"

												It's Tropico 4, but stripped down and with a new coat of paint. The progression throughout four ages, from collonial to modern, and the added dynasty of presidentes unfortunately strips away a lot of the charm and quiantness that was present in previous games. Instead of a single presidente lording it over his tiny banana republic trying to win Smelliest Cheese Competitions for the glory of Tropico, you now shepherd an island nation from humble beginnings to metropolis. Like the Modern Times expansion of Tropico 4, it's jarring and strange to see towering glass and metal skyscrapers next to your Cold War era pubs and houses. It makes the island look less cohesive and much less functional, since lots of towers constantly block your view no matter how you turn the camera. It's fun and challenging enough in its own right, but the goofy small island charm that made the series unique is diminished by it. It also seems to have taken a peek at other city builders and grabbed some elements here and there. From the Anno series, it takes the concept of trade routes and implements it quite superflouesly, to the point where you have to wonder why the feature is even there at all. From the Civ series it takes the tech tree, which is really just an artificial barrier that stops you from building the more advanced buildings straight away. If you want that cigar factory, be prepared to work for it.That's not to say this game isn't enjoyable. The unique sense of humor is still there, the campaign is suitably unpredictable and silly, the mechanics work (as do your builders, for the first time in Tropico history) and some of the new elements like the constitution are interesting and well-implemented. All in all it feels like a bare-bones game, with lots of room for DLC, but what's there works very well. If you enjoyed the previous Tropico games, you're most likely going to enjoy this one as well. If this is your first Tropico game, prepare to do some research into what certain buildings actually do, but once you've gotten past that hurdle, this is as good a place as any to dive in.(Note: these are my experiences from single player campaign. It's early days still, so the online component is predictably wonky. Sandbox mode does not have many options. There is no island editor for sandbox.)			"

												For fans of the series I think it's a logical chocie to get Tropico 5. I think it's quite decent step forward over Tropico 4, I found it to be more long term fun (as well as harder) then the previous one; the era system and other improvments such as the constitution suit well for Tropico 5.However on the downside in some areas Tropico 5 was stripped down, much less customization for your members; some options are also gone MIA, for example ""work modes"" are gone for the most part, many buildings were removed while often for the the better, experts will miss buildings like the Immigration Office or Prisons for more fine grained political control.Political backgrouds are also removed in favor of the new dynasty system, though this is actually a decent change.At the time of release, the multiplayer also has some issues such as hangs/crashes, no adjustable speed and no options to create a save game, but hopefully those will be amended in the the future.But it is also a new and fun experience to play Tropico 5 in multiplayer, though at this point it is still rather problematic to play and the dipomacy options are limited, but since it's a first for tropico, one can hope for fixes and adjustments by the developers.Despite all those flaws, Tropico 5 still provides a nice boost to fun and difficulty, it provides much of a challange to create a working island state, rebels, military revolts and uprisings are an actual threat now, and pleasing all factions can be diffcult. The eras require you to adjust your economy as well as profitable goods will change thoughout the eras.4/5			"

												(The following review is mostly based on campaign/single player gameplay; I've yet to try the multiplayer portion)I find that the opening menu of Tropico 5 sums it up perfectly. The amazing Caribbean soundtrack causes immediate deja vu for fans of the series, to the point where I thought they had recycled the same song from the previous games, yet something about the song feels better, cleaner, more refined. That's Tropico 5. Familiar ground that, on the surface, looks unsettlingly similar to previous entries, yet hides the game that Tropico 3 and 4 should have been all along.I get the feeling that the majority of Tropico 5's target audience consists of people who enjoyed one or more of the previous four games. But, for the uninitiated, Tropico is one of the extremely scarce non-independant developed city building (aka management or simulation) games of the past decade. It centers around the idea of players taking the role as ""El Presidente"" of a Caribbean island, and building a small tropical society through agriculture, trade, tourism, and light-hearted political corruption. The first Tropico game was released in 2001 along with a sequel in 2003 and, though Tropico 2 was a major departure in theme from the rest of the series (a rather wonderful... piratey departure), both games gained something of a cult following. In 2009, Tropico 3 was released by a different developer and publisher as a 3D game, but by then most major city development games had vanished. The fact that Tropico survived was a pleasant surprise for fans such as myself. Though some would argue that the game lost a bit of its greatness in the transition, it stood on its own as a solid city builder in spite of its flaws. Two years and expansion pack later, Tropico 4 was released, and... it was Tropico 3. Though by no means bad, you had to dig quite deep to find additions that made it feel like a worthy sequel and not a copy. An overabundance of small DLC packs made it difficult for even the most diehard of fans to not feel cheated.With that mindset, skeptical eyes turn to Tropico 5 and, if many of the reviews out there are to be believed, the knee-jerk reaction to this game is that it is yet another iteration of the same formula. However, I feel that these reviews are overlooking how the small changes make an all-around better gaming experience. So what's changed?The most drastic change to the Tropico formula is the ""era"" and research system. Previously, Tropico focused primarily on the Cold War era, not-so-subtley hinting at the time and rule of Fidel Castro (he was even playable in earlier games), and only in the expansion pack for the fourth game did they try to shift the focus to 21st century society. Instead, the game now starts with Tropico as a 19th century royal colony, and El Presidente starts as a governer for the crown. Over time, you unlock new technologies, fight for your own independance, and establish new laws and decisions while new factions and global concerns crop up with each new era. Mechanically, this works brilliantly and fights off the biggest problems Tropico had with monotony over longer games. In addition to giving a perfect framework for Tropico's whimsical storytelling (more on that later), it adds a much needed sense of advancement to your society and promotes the use of strategies that would have been ignored in earlier games (such as how to deal with housing when you only have access to tiny houses and overpriced mansions). It all builds up to a much more refined modern era, complete with new industries like electronics and car production, as well as jabs at modern day political issues, which still fit perfectly into a banana republic setting.Another change is a more refined economic system across the board. For me, this is Tropico 5's selling point. You can tell a lot of thought went into how the pieces of the game work together. Though Tropico is still a ""butterfly effect"" kind of game where the desires, opinions, and actions of every single AI driven person on the island effect the way things work, the chaos is controlled where it needs to be. For example, I haven't run into a situation where a ship misses a shipment because all the dockworkers were off at the tavern (a frustration in previous games). All buildings now also have an ""effectiveness"" rating, which acts as an easily understood percentage of how well a building does what it's supposed to do (a plantation with 100 effectiveness produces 100% of its crops, maximizing its budget gives +20 efficiency, whereas missing part of the workforce drastically lowers it). All buildings also fit together in a cleaner way than they did before (many are smaller), and things like the placement of a plantation's crop field is infinitely easier to work with. There are also two brand new features that make the economy more controllable, one being the addition of ""managers"" who are people with specific skills that you can assign to have special effects on individual buildings, and the other being a revamped trading system where, in addition to the traditional system of trade ships showing up at your docks and buying all your excess products, you can sign deals with foreign powers and send your own ships to them to get better deals on your goods, which both encourages specialization in your city and adds an extra twist to global politics.The last, but least exciting addition is the idea of El Presidente's dynasty. In previous games, you had much greater control over the personality of your ruler, as well as his strengths and weaknesses. Instead, this concept is stretched out over multiple members of one ruling family who bundles their bonuses together. You gain new family members and increase their ranks through stashed away ""Swiss Bank Account"" money that you earn while playing (an interesting way to use the stolen money concept from previous games). Only one member of your family can be El Presidente at any given time, but the others can be deployed as managers in your city, or used in certain storyline-based events. It's an interesting system and it works well enough, but I can't help but think it didn't turn out quite the way it was supposed to. Ultimately, it ends up feeling less like a system of family and lineage, and more like a team of immortal El Presidentes for you to accumulate for their individual bonus effects. Fortunately, nothing about this system gets in the way of the game from anything other than an immersion standpoint.((NOTE! - I cut out a portion of this review so it would fit on Steam's review system. My apologies for being so long-winded! This portion of the review can be read here http://steamcommunity.com/app/245620/discussions/0/540742667604319054/ ))Overall, Tropico 5 is a very pleasant surprise. It's similar enough to earn criticism from some, but for those who felt the formula was strong and just needed some refining, the refinements are well worthy of a new game. It does fall short of perfect for some of the same reasons that previous Tropico games have, such as the lack of good explanations of some of the game's deeper concepts, its refusal to open the game up to any kind of modding, as well as clear signs that they plan to do a lackluster and exploitative DLC system similar to Tropico 4. But, for me, slipping into El Presidente's shoes may just feel better than it ever did before.			"

												Right to the point... other than the addition of the eras, which was a great attempt to add something fresh to the series, this is a skeleton version of Tropico 4. I love the series, don't get me wrong, I have been playing since the original, but I am not a fan of this game. There are 50% of the buildings missing from the previous game and no ability to change the names of your populace. That last one was a huge blow. I just know a lot of buildings will be added in DLC, but I feel that we have purchased an incomplete game. This was a late night rant, so it may not make much sense. Enjoy.			"

												I cannot help but feel like Tropico 5, even with the dynasty stuff, is ""dumbed down"" from Tropico 4. The Almanac is trickier to navigate and not nearly as detailed, there seems to be less buildings, and less micromanaging capabilities.Nonetheless, if you liked the Tropico series you will enjoy Tropico 5.I would give it a 7/10, if you love the series buy it now, if you are lukewarm, wait for a steam sale.

												Well, take a real good look at this Maxxis. Look long and hard, because this is exactly the sort of game SimCity should have been.Tropico is a heap of fun. It has learning curve that is steep enough to keep you engaged, whilst not being so steep as to deter players or make them feel overwhelmed. Once you have learned all of the little tricks it's then that you beging to experience some of the emergent gameplay on offer. Want to rule as an iron fisted dictator that suppresses his population? Go ahead. Want to be a benevolent president who opens the country to free and fair elections? You can do that. Want to run a communist or capatalist state? The choice is yours. Some of the most interesting choice come through how to structure your economy, and how to run the social aspects of your island nation, and each of these decisions has an impact on your nation's relationship with the wider world. Trade will be impacted with each decision, as will your security.There's so much do do in Tropico 5. While the Tropico games have alsways been fun, Tropico 5 adds a tonne of options without sacrificing the core gameplay of the previous installments in the series. In that way it feels like both a great leap forward for the series while being comfortable for fans.But, above all, Tropico manages to do what SimCity couldn't - it's fun and it's functional. There appear to be no game-breaking bugs, and the whole experienced is polished and extremely smooth. While Tropico 5 might not be perfect, it comes pretty danmed close for those looking for a fun, funny and challenging city builder.Highly recommended.			"

												Tropico 5 graphics is great and l find the graphics are important part of game now because great graphics pulls you into the gameplay and makes the player (which is you) want to play the game more because it looks more realistic.The only thing l dislike about tropico 5 is you cant'set approximate rent for property or how much people earn from there job (there is slider for each building eg(poor,well off,wealthy etc) that determines how much they get instead of setting the appoximate number) and there is no jail building in tropico 5 which is abit of a dissapointment.And no statues of the leader and no immigration office (player can set immigration policies by changing the law in your constitution within the game which isnt a bad idea) And no 7 star hotel in Tropico 5 as found in the Tropico 4 dlc (Modern times) which was abit dissapointing.Overall my first impressions was good to say the least but l wanted to be blown away by tropico 5 but l enjoyed the gameplay and graphics of tropico 5.Overall l liked tropico 5 had to offer which was different in a good way.l hope my review of Tropico 5 helps alot of people decide if Tropico 5 is right for the player (which is you) bye.

Even if there is not a lot of changes from its predecessor (Tropico 4) it has a much friendlier interface and more overall logic, making it much more fun to play.Tropico 5 stays true to both the old game mechanics while introducing some new ones (not many tho, it's still the same game from 2001 when you think about it), so if you've played any of the previous Tropico games (and liked it) you should give this a go.8/10 "

												Would I recommend this game?  I want to.  But I can't, not right now...For one, the game requires a videocard that supports DirectX 11, (updating your drivers won't make a difference) which was not a problem for me since my desktop is fairly beefed up, however, running the game on my laptop or an older desktop is absolutely out of the question.  What's more, I didn't notice anything indicating the game would not run without DX11, and numerous people have apparently bought the game only to find out that it's unplayable.With that out of the way, a few other issues...The game has a seemingly steep learning curve- you'll have the basics figured out without much effort, and then BAM!  You find yourself in one no-win scenario after another.  After restarting campaigns a few times and even playing around in Sandbox mode, I realized the gameplay is actually just wonky sometimes.The game also reduces all the micromanagement I loved about Tropico 4.  You can't see who's visiting your buildings or other minutia that used to aid in figuring out how to resolve issues with your island.  Everything is sort of streamlined (or tries to be) which actually to me seemed a little too dumbed down.The dynasty system is a novel idea but nothing to get excited about.The variety of buildings comes drastically short.  I want to believe that that the reason for this is because, I don't know, the game was rushed.  However, I have this odd feeling it was intentional and a few months down the road we'll be seeing DLC with more buildings.  And then more DLC.  And so on and so forth. To be blunt, everything about the character customization sucks, and the rendering of the characters themselves is absolutely butt ugly.Drop down the price, fix some gameplay issues, add content, and I would definitely recommend.  Right now I feel like the game is an unfinished product.			"

												I've been playing Tropico since the begining.To be honest, my first 10 minutes or so, I was disapointed. It seemed like they had dumbed things down, to make it more accessable. But after a few minutes, I realized that they had managed to keep the level of complexity of this game at the same level, while making the UI work FOR you, not against. Buildings can now be found without having to remember exactly where you placed them, many building upgrades can be done universally, instead of clicking through each one, and the new Era system forces you to adapt as your island changes. Well done guys!			"

												If you liked 3 or 4 you'll like this. It's definitely changed, but for the better. You will spend some time getting used where everything is laid out, but in the long run it's much improved. If you like games like Rise of Nations, you will like this. If you're a hardcore Civ V player, this may be a little too casual for you, but it's still fun,  humorous, and challenging.			"

												One of the best in the Series. Tropico 5 is like a combination of all into one. With the new Era's system and improved gameplay systems, it is the strongest Tropico to date. While the large majority of features are very well implemented there are some aspects such as multiplayer which is very new to the series.The game offers a good range of strategy and to an extent challenge for those who would like it. From a personal point of view I feel Kalypso value their customers and will take on board any criticism and feedback. They changed alot during the closed beta phase and I am sure through DLC and if not the next Tropico, things will only get better.Viva El Presidente!			"

												The Tropico series never fails to deliver on a fantastic City Building game, providing a style of gameplay which is easy to learn and difficult to Master which has become the core of the series. The game is divided into Eras that break up the game never allowing you to get bored or comfortable. Unlike other games in the same genre Tropico 5 also has an intresting Trade and Military functions as well as a political system that means your Island is more than a collection of buildings, following your own ideologies you can create your own socalist paradise or your own captalist utopia, a totaltarian police state or a liberal democracy and while in this persuit you have to tread carefully not to upset too many people with your Grand Ideas or else face a rebellion from the unwashed masses who cannot see your obvious genius, of course thats what tanks are for. The challenge of juggling the powers of the Tropican world will either cement your rule as absolute ruler of your own paradise island, your have you on a row boat far out in the sea being waved off by an upstart new Presidente who hardly knows what he's gotten himself into. Tropico 5 builds on the positives of past Tropico games, and delivers so much more, and anyone new to the series should check this out as it promises to provide hours of frustrating, fun, and rewarding gameplay.

												What I did not like:That number of free family homes are not shown.The creation of a dictator is well, plain horrid, bad graphics, 10 000 names to choose from but very little choices otherwise. What happened to more advance personality characteristics? The fog of war. How nearsighted are these people? Or how lazy? When building should be able to push the fog back a little at the time.What I miss:More advance banking.Not that it is a bad thing, but what happened to crime and jails? I simply loved the labour camps that made the criminals in to nice, proper farmers instead.Some more entertainment choices: Bread and circus people, bread and circus. Or perhaps Rum and can can girls.  Ministry could have been nice if you could make your family ministers.Sadly enough, I miss our dear Reverend Esteban that has exchanged communion wine with rum and the church with the pub. Palace updates.Penultimo and Sunny Flowers “radio show”. (Penultimo actually seems smarter and more honest.)That El president can give speeches from the palace.Ability to go down to street level and “walk” in your wonderful little town. What I miss in every single game in the series. The chance to place your palace and first dock by own choice. Set salary in a building to make sure it has labour.  What I liked.Its now shown what level of jobs are free and what education level the unemployed has.The police station double as fire station and they actually seem to be able to get where they are supposed to. Finally both gender can work the same places all over. I hated it in Tropic 4 when you lacked labour because those on that education level was of the wrong gender and those of the wrong gender went without a job. It always seemed to be more jobs for men than for women... Those lovely little country houses that has their own food production. That the buildings no longer look the same no matter what version your playing.Power-plant less big and ugly.It seems that a building dos not stop working because there is to much products piling up. (A big, BIG problem in Tropico 4, modern times).Seems like distribution of raw material works a a lot better. Also show what products are in the docks.What I simply loved.Updates can be done from any building and you can choose if you want to upgrade one building or all of them. No need to wait for Penultimo to give you the choice.The grid, I love the grid.That the buildings nicely fit in to the grid. Yes I suffer from “Prussian disease” but I love my nice, orderly streets and buildings.No more big, ugly parking-houses that gets overloaded after five minutes.  That the plantations and Ranch's show how much space they will use. All about the grid and the orderly banana republic.   That the plantation fields are not fixed in case one need a little guard tower. Again: those lovely little country houses with their own food production.Did I mention those lovely little country houses?That subway station don't become more and more expensive. The mines, those lovely new mines you can't build over by accident.The natural disaster edict, I LOVE the natural disaster edict.  There are a lot of great improvements, even if spooky with the immortal El presidente. A vampire in Tropico? Perhaps that's why you no longer can send  El presidente out to construction sites and production sites. (There is a lot of sun in the Caribbean). Not every one can keep it going as long as Fidel Castro. Would be nice if could choose successor from the family. Europa 1400 - The Guild would let you choose your heir when you died.			"

												OMFG what a pure PoS. Attacks without warning and somehow there are magically 4 enemies that stick together attacking your  island while your squads try to take them all on 1 at a time and your guys get wiped out. Rebels appear out of nowhere also. Tanks will not even go to the battles unless the enemies are rather close. Total waste of my time.Economy side and building up of industries is sort of fun, but after spending 6 hours building your place up it only takes 3 rebel squads to wipe out my palace and game over. ♥♥♥♥ that.

												I first began playing Tropico 4 last year and was impressed with the extensive campaign and dlc missions.  As many other reviewers have already mentioned, Tropico 4 was also full of humurous subplots and crazy characters.  Compared to its predecessor, Tropico 5 does not overwhelm you with tons of buildings, nor does it force you to repeatedly rebuild your island kingdom every mission.  On the other hand, the humor seems more subdued in this version, while the soundtrack (although a little more varied than Tropico 4) is still a little too repetitive for my taste. Overall, there is much to commend about Tropico 5.  The graphics are quite beautiful, the era progression system adds variety to the game, and there is enough crazy story in the missions to get you laughing (and keep playing).  Veteran dictators may find issues with certain details of Tropico 5 (e.g. the awkward AI combat system and the generic voice acting), but players looking for a fun and addictive city building game will be quite pleased with Tropico 5.

												Tropico 5 is...different. I am not saying it is bad, quite opposite it is a very enjoyable, relaxing and strategic game. What I mean by different is that they took the Tropico game and remade it all over again.The mines, farms, style, everything has changed. I was expecting something very similar to Tropico 3 and 4, but boy did I get a surprise. A very good one at that! It could almost be said this game is a spinoff...almost. It still has that iconic and unforgettable Tropico base humor and mangament system, along with other features that have made Tropico....Tropico.A Wonderful game with a wonderful gameplay! I stromgly recommend this game!			"

												I have been a big fan of city building / resource management style games since I first picked up Caesar II. However, I've never picked up a Tropico title until now and I am blown away by the wonderful game play and quirky humor found within. Gameplay:Players familiar with Sim-City style city building will be immediately comfortable with the Tropico layout. Similar concepts like connecting buildings via roads and strategic placement of buildings with resources are all present. Managing the economy is fairly straightforward although it took a few games to catch on to how the trade contracts enabled through docks affected the overall economy. Combat is thankfully mostly automated so it doesn't distract too much from city building and management and adds a slightly more dynamic negative event in addition to the random acts of God. The progression of a game through the ages and how the form of government evolves the criteria for success was a new concept for me and very enjoyable.SoundThe sounds and music of the game pulls you into the tropical islander themed mood and is more than sufficient to emerse the player in the era of game play. Very well done.ReplayabilityAs with any game of this type, most players will run through a few guided campaign maps to familiarize themselves with the gameplay and then jump into true sandboxes. Thankfully a random map creation mode is readily available to churn out endless scenarios built to your liking. This makes replayability an easy checkbox to check.OverallLosing in Tropico 5 doesn't feel so bad. It seems the game can churn out any number of hilarious scenarios under which you will get booted from power. Accidentally import too much and go into deep debt? Oops...you got voted out and no your cheating didn't help enough. Didn't plan out your initial governorship very well? Man those 4 years flew by fast. This game will pull you in and hours will fly by.			"

												A great addition to the city building/dictatorship genre. Graphically speaking, the game is very pretty. Gameplay wise, Tropico 5 excells in most areas than the previous installment, but in its prequel, there seemed to be slightly more upgrades avilable to buildings. Though, a great and much needed addition to Tropico 5 has to be the ability to fight invasions. This time around, when your island is invaded by a foreign power, you may use your military might and any foreign allies you may have at the time, as a formidable defense. I would give this a 9/10.

												this game is not as time consuming as other city  builders and still is very fun, my one concern is you get disliked if you kill a rebel, and if you loose an election you instantly get kicked to the games main menu and have to load to the last auto save, which could be a while before you lost. the cars in this game are bad, not like people will pay much attention to them anyway, they constantly run over millitary, civilians and will drive straight through a battlefeild. if you get any sort of road placement wrong, it will mess up your city placement and look sloppy and have no room for anything to be built. if you dont pay attention to small things and play right, this game is highly addictive.

Even if there is not a lot of changes from its predecessor (Tropico 4) it has a much friendlier interface and more overall logic, making it much more fun to play.Tropico 5 stays true to both the old game mechanics while introducing some new ones (not many tho, it's still the same game from 2001 when you think about it), so if you've played any of the previous Tropico games (and liked it) you should give this a go.8/10 "

I do not know really what 4 brought to the table, but five is super fun for me. The game is challenging, or you can scale it back to be just a casual island building game. As for multiplayer, everything is more fun with friends. Having mutliple people helping on one thing makes it a whole lot easier/faster. you could awlys just try to kill your friends and take over too.

												This game is much different from Tropico 1 and 4, with that so far it has its merits and a few things that I am missing from the series.Some of the changes:Much less banter like in 4, I really enjoyed some of the voice over work, made me laugh quite a bit.You play as your own character, I really enjoyed playing as past dictators in 1 and 4, unless I am missing something.Buildings unlock in 5 as you progress, in 4 you could place anything you could afford.  4 was a much more build oriented game with a nice story arch, there may still be a story arch in 5, but it is more multiplayer game than solo.Solo scenarios go very, very fast to begin, I am sure those extend quite a bit as you move farther into the game.I actually like the graphics of the building much better in 4.I preferred the direct quotes on the save pages in 4 vs. the dictator ""fun facts"" on the save pages in 5...I know nit picking :)Some of the things I do really enjoy so far with 5:The whole trade system is a huge improvement, its fun to direct and agree where your goods go.There are pirates, I like pirates.Using exploration to discover portions of your islands make a lot of sense, but so far no natives have killed my tiny explorers...I would kind of think they risk getting boiled in a pot, but maybe I have just been lucky so far.It does feel like I have to work harder to get my approval rating up and I have fewer choices to do so, especially early, I do like the challenge, but think more early choices would help the game.New music...and yes I know that's the Squirrel Nut Zippers on at least one song.I like that the building upgrades need to be researched and can't just be upgraded in 3 clicks like in 4, you have to work for those a bit more, not simply rake in money.So far, Tropico 5 does feel like a pretty big departure from 4.  I have seen 4 described as a fun city builder game with good challenges.  5 feels like it is going to be much more unpredictable and interactive as long as you get a good group of people you know to play along.My final recommendation on this is, grab Tropico 4, a great bargain now and a ton of fun.  I think Tropico 5 will continue to build on the series and this feels like the base of a new, evolving game.  5 is going to provide a lot of gaming enjoyment, but I think it needs more time to develop.  My biggest fear in buying the game was that it would be going online like Sim City 5 and have an EA-style launch disaster...it hasn't and so far as long as you have an up to date video card, Direct X 11 and a fast, newer machine, the game has not hit very few snags.  It is a good, positive launch, hopefully with much more to come.Check that a bit as there have been multiplayer server issues over the first weekend....we may have a collapse coming....lol.			"

												Probably the best Tropico yet. The new artwork is fantastic and the gameplay is amazing. I love the eras and the ability to reaserch rather than the timeline in Tropico 4 modern times. I like the multiplayer (have'nt checked it out completely though)			"

												The game was released in such a poor state with heavily cut down features compared to earlier installments, that it is really hard for me to comment on it with a straight face. Pathfinding is a joke and the combat is quite simply atrocious. I am glad I only paid 10 euros for it.Tropico 3 & 4 are superior choices.			"

												This one is not like 3, or 4.  It feels like a new tropico game.			"

												So far so good. It's similar enough to Trop4 to be familiar yet the dynamics are different enough to make it interesting. Would like to see more buildings but I suspect they'll come in future DLC. I like that the technology tree replaced blueprints which I found more annoying.One thing: I couldn't open my almanac while a dialog was open -- in Trop4 this made it possible to choose wisely if your options included lowering your status with a faction or foreign country. Now I had to try and remember whether I could afford to lose 10 respect with the Allies.			"

												Just getting into the game but I can already see it is vastly more complex in every area than Tropico 4. The first Tropico game I thoroughly enjoyed was Tropico 4, but couldn't get into the earlier versions because they simply didn't seem quite as fun to me. This game seeks to expand on everything they did right with Tropico 4 and go further, more in depth, and add Multiplayer on top of it. If you liked/loved Tropico 4 you'll definitely want to pick this up. MAKE SURE YOU GO THROUGH THE TUTORIAL before making any decision as to whether or not you think it's a vast improvement over previous Tropico's. Most of the Negatives were I'm missing this, or this certain menu isn't there anymore, etc. IT'S ALL THERE FOLKS, just have to know where to go. I will say the Interface is a bit clunky, but once you get used to it you're off and running. :-)			"

												Im hard pressed to say this is the best tropico. While im enjoying it alot I think combat makes it very odd and later in game the game punishes you for upgrading to the more advanced farms by putting all your non high school people out of jobs.			"

												Both rather different, and rather similar to Tropico 4.  If you have played Tropico 4, you will understand the basics of how resources, industries, and exports work, but there's a lot that is new.  I will probably be horribly addicted to this one too...			"

												Excellent like the rest. This game in the series does not disappoint. So far, it seems much harder than 4, as I have been invaded by the axis, and Lost my position as El Presidente to a 34 year old illiterate iron miner. That's just in the sandbox. If you're a fan of previous installments of the series, Definitely go for this one!			"
