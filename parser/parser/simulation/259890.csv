												Wow, would you look at all the negative reviews. Does that scare you? It scared me.I probably wouldn't have bought the game either, but I got it in a bundle with some other farm simulators. Despite my reluctance I decided to give it a test drive one day and see what all the hate was about.Ten hours later I came to a conclusion and can now tell you what I think about this unusual game. First of all, you have to be familiar with farming sims and understand how they are played. If you don't know how to operate the machinery then you are not going to have fun. That brings me to my second point: half of the reviews on here are from people who have absolutely no idea what to do and, instead of looking for help, they decided to nix the game altogether. The other half is from jokesters who jumped on the hate bandwagon because that is the popular thing to do nowdays.If anyone with the least bit of interest in the subject would have taken the time to learn the game then I think they would have appreciated what the developers have almost succeeded in creating here. I say ""almost"" because I can admit that it is not a perfect game. Yes, it does have lots of bugs; and yes, it is slightly underdeveloped. But no way is it the unplayable disaster that the reviewers here would have you believe. I have played games far far worse than this one.It helps to have some prior experience with farming, but the game itself is quite easy to learn. I have a rudimentary knowlege of the subject and still didn't know what to do. I found the tutorial videos from the main menu but they would not play. However, with a little bit of digging you can find the videos in the game's main folder and watch them from there. You can even read the subtitle files that accompanied the videos with insightful tips. Reading and watching those made the game so much more easier to understand and I have been having fun playing it ever since.My gameplay experience so far has ranged from average to great. It is a small game without a lot of replayability; so I can't see myself spending any more than 25 - 30 hours on it. But I am enjoying the game for what it is. It's a farm sim set in an historical period; and it's not trying to be anything more than that. The sooner you can accept that the less disappointed you will be.Maybe I am a bit biased for having such a strong interest in antiquated farming. I've tried recreating the same time period on the more popular farming games without success. Their antique tractors were nice, but in the end all it is is modern farming using old machines. But this game is so much more detailed. You actually have to connect implements by hand and get off your tractor each time you want to lower the seeder for planting. And the plowing itself is the most real I've ever seen in a farm sim. Instead of having ready-made fields for you to plow, you have to decide where you want to grow and start digging up the green. I spent hours on my first day outlining a field in my backyard and plowing a sizable portion of the yard. After cultivating, fertilizing and planting I'm now waiting for my first crops to show.This game also features the most animal interaction I've ever seen. You have to keep them stocked up on hay and grass. The bales can be stored in the barn loft and, just like any farmer, they must be thrown down to the bottom floor and placed in designated locations. Milk and eggs can also be collected and sold at the local market. Unfortunately the animals do not move much, but you can walk them to places you want them to be. You can also breed them for their offspring and sell your old animals. And make sure you don't scare the chickens too far away or they may die of starvation. The machine models, I think, are some of the best-looking in a game like this. They all look beautiful and shiny and historically accurate. There are a few different tractors you can purchase, including a John Deere model; not sure how they were able to acquire that license. The implements are varied and also look good. Antique plows, cultivators, seeders, balers, wagons and more have been perfectly modeled. Even the harvester is one of the old ones that is pulled behind the tractor; something I haven't been able to find in any other game.I plan to spend more time on this game because I am actually enjoying it. However I do wish they would patch it with fixes and added incentives. There is a gas station in the game, but you never run out of gas. Was this a planned but cancelled feature? Also you can sell logs, but no way to chop down trees? That's disappointing when you realize that the game could have been so much better with a little bit more work. But, still, it is not a terrible game.So far I have experienced no game-breaking bugs. There was an incident in which all of my animals disappeared, but I reloaded an older save and they returned. Some times the game does lock up when launching, but closing and relaunching usually helps. There are some minor physics issues, but the solution to that is don't do stupid stuff. This is not an FPS. Treat it with a little bit of delicacy. Why would you be doing silly stunts when you should be farming? The only real annoying thing that occured was when one of my pigs and dog became stuck and I couldn't move them. I drove the tractor through them and they returned to normal. Sometimes it's the simplest solutions that save the day.Even though I wish more work could have been done, I am still happy to have discovered this fascinating game. I would like others to enjoy it too, but I guess you can't please everyone.			"

												There will be no usual prolonged review. This piece of code doesn't worth it.Simply don't buy it, and if you did (probably via some bundle) - just don't try to start it.This project, in theory, had some pro points - like quite a complex assembly of farmer's tools, and some game engine that was almost working to portray some of farmer's activities... Well, the list of cons is bigger, and, just to start, you'll not get it to launch right from the box. You'll need to search for tweaks and fixes, or the game will be crushing right away! But even if you'll make it past this starting point, the crushes will be following you anywhere you'll go.Honestly, I've spent about 3 hours trying to start it, and after that - I was done with the gameplay in 15 minutes. So, as a final: I'd rather go and start digging and planting stuff myself, than play this thing any longer.Let us finish on this: this game is a bad charm which you can't just throw away once you've picked it up. So, just don't touch it. Let it be just +1 game in your pocket. It's best suited that way. Just Don't Start It. Okay?			"

												If you get this game you have to be prepared to overlook the bugs and issues that are almost certain to crop up. Despite this, it is nicely detailed with some good quality machinery models and some accurate history behind them. The game can get boring at points but overall is quite satisfying to play. For those of you who are familiar with Farming Simulator, this game has more manual labour involved in farming but is less of a game. A nice alternative to relax a bit and farm!			"

												It's pretty bad when the tutorial section of the game seems to offer less functionality or information than the game itself...which also offers absolute zero information about what to do or how to do it.  Given that I am not a farmer, this icomplete absence of direction is indeed how I would imagine it would feel like to suddenly wake up on a farm with chickens running hither and dither,  Thanks Humble.   Despite the extreme confusion, some portion of my $6 was worth the 15 minutes trying to understand just whatever this game is.			"

												My experience with this game was brief: I started it up, the menu was unusable until I knocked the settings down to lowest.I loaded into the game, looked at the relatively pretty graphics, the animal AI, wondered what to do, mashed buttonsEventually got into my tractor, excited, drove around the farm.Bumped into a wall. Tractor is now upside down, my head has clipped through the floor, and the graphics don't refresh: http://imgur.com/xwQhm6YMash buttons again, find that Q resets tractor. Buy some items to do farming things, try to connect them to tractor: item flies into space, tractor spins around a bit on the ground.If you want an unintentional Goat Simulator clone, get this game.

Game runs like ♥♥♥, controls are either extremely unintuitive or don't work. Only 2 maps. When you decide to run it in windowed mode it decides that windowed mode means still take up the whole screen and instead turn the resolution of your desktop to 640x480 because reasons.

TL;DRProsComplex, in-depth simulation; more detailed than any truck simulator. Complexity stems from scope and detail of farming operations rather than a huge exploratory world. Historical environment.Detailed objects.ConsGlitchy and buggy gameplay but then tractors do look kinda like buggies. No updates or patches; support links in the manual lead to blank webpages. Graphics options aren't always saved.  End Of TL;DR Read on if you want to know more.Efficient Graphics EngineRuns better than Professional Farming Simulator 2014 Platinum Edition and Farming Machines Championship 2014. Plethora of in-game graphics options compared to the above mentioned 2 other farm sims.Dunno why it runs in Windows XP compatibilty mode by default and i can't change it. Update 2016-Aug-01Found out that compatibility mode is set if launched from Steam's Play button.  After changing compatibility mode, create a desktop shortcut and run from there.Appeared to have some glitches but nothing game breaking yet. One glitch suddenly caused my first tractor to spawn a clone and they appeared intersected, like deformed twins at birth. Managed to separate them though. A good bug? Maybe i can sell the other one ha!Update 2016-Aug-02Cloned tractor vanish as soon as i reloaded the game so no chance to sell it. Other glitches like hens running through walls are true or run into the ground or stuck in 3D mesh are not game breaking; they eventually come out or free themselves, might need a little push or pull to rectify the situation though. It's still playable so far.End of update 2016-Aug-02Graphic and music qualities are excellent. Musical themes add to the historical atmosphere of the game.Complex In-depth SimulationGameplay wise, still trying to figure out how it all works. No in-game tutorial to help you along, only videos, html manual in the game folder and a pdf manual in Steam library. Steep learning curve; very detailed farming simulation. Farm buildings can be entered and objects within them can be interacted with.Manual Object HandlingLots of things have to be done manually. Object handling and interactions is essential. This aspect of gameplay adds realism of actually being in the farm. Almost like being in a farming RPG.SidenoteI suppose in keeping with the historical nature of it all, there's no in-game tutorial like in the good old days and so we have to RTFM!  Steep learning curve - too steep for some? Some people can't be bothered to read and so couldn't figure out how to get out of the tractor! WTF!  and so they think it's a bug?!Maybe there'll be more updates to this review as i get to know the game better. As of now it's a 6/10			"

												Table of Contents:- Foreword- Graphics- Gameplay- Sounds- Controls- Quality- Overall Experience-ForewordSo, this Review basically is a modified copy paste of the ""Agricultural Simulator 2013 Steam Edition"" one, since the game is just the same. A simple copy paste of the original game just with some fixes.-GraphicsThe textures themself were not too bad but required you to be in a range of 30m to even really see them. For example grass, road, tree's. Got fixed in the Historical Version.Btw. the field of view is like 50-60, which is insanely close and feels like sh!t too.I really liked the textures and graphics. The Level Design was insanely well. It felt soo great.Well, that doesnt help the game though.-GameplayThe gameplay is pretty bad. I've not played much because my tractor instantly fell over.There was no way to flip it up again, so i was basically ♥♥♥♥ed. To get into the tractor you press leftclick on that little thing that pops up, to get out you press y, whyever...There are like no GUI's, no HUD, if you aim on something like wood there are some little icons popping up which you can click on. I'm personally not a fan of that, but it obviously increases gameplay.Also the game gives you NO information on how to play at all. It doesnt tell you what to do.I was just there. Doing nothing because i didnt know what to. I like the graphics though x3-SoundsWell, the music was pretty decent. Not Simulator-like music. Well, its not really the type of music i enjoy though. Kinda reminded me of the game ""Barney"" (where you play that cow, i loved it x3).I didnt really listen to the other sounds, if they were bad i'd have noticed though. I just noticed that the tractor didnt have a motor sound when i got in first, when i got out and in again it worked though.-ControlsThe controls are pretty weird. There are like no GUI's, no HUD, if you aim on something like wood there are some little icons popping up which you can click on. I'm personally not a fan of that, but it obviously increases gameplay. (Sry for copy pasta)-QualityThe overall quality is pretty bad. The game feels insanely unpolished.Like in every UIG Game, it changes the OS-Resolution, even though it's autodetecting stuff to set your video options before starting. Well...The FOV is 50-60 as i said, im not a fan of it.Road only laods when you're in the range of ~30m, otherwise its insanely bugged. Grass does only load in a range of like 10m. Got fixed in this version.There is no HUD or anything, you just get extra menu's by holding TAB, C or other stuff which were pretty confusing.There is no way to flip your tractor, mine's fallen over like 5 minutes after i got into the game. RIP me.-Overall ExperienceDefiently one of the worst faming simulator games out there.There are so many games which are much better and more enjoyable.I would definetly not recommend the game to anyone.

												At a friends request and thanks to his generous gift I played a little Agricultural Simulator tonight. This game has got to be the biggest joke I have ever installed.* The stoned looking dog whom I can only assume was supposed to be my traveling companion constantly barked and his footsteps were always following me yet he never left his position by his food bowl.* The tractor was way too slow and was unsuccessful at running over animals, people or structures.* The fastest way to get around in the game was by running diagonal and although you could not jump you could get massive air by running crooked at the back of the tractor.* Whilst trying to see if I could open the door to a random pizzeria the game crashed.* The chickens were clearly ghost chickens that could pass through any object.But my favorite part was the bull that despite having access to an open gate decided to leave his enclosure by means of warp-glitching slowly through the fence.... Well at least he had realistic testicles.			"

Where's the mud?Well, you look around and find yourself in a farmyard that might have come from an old picturebook of the early fifties. You turn around and see your dog, running towards you. You see your chicken, your pigs... well and Bessy, the old cow. And then you see your old tractor and...No, I am not kidding, this is actually what this game looks like, but take care, you have to finetune the graphics a lot, if you don't you are in for some bad surprises. The game is... difficult to describe, it has some charm, yet it lacks a lot of important features. Actually you are quite in a freestyle mode, but without a lot of realism. Well actually, the graphics look nice and crisp but the game itself, it's lacking - and the game even isn't that realistical.Driving around with your tractor will give you the first lesson, there is no mud in Historical Farming, the tractor looks like out of the showroom even after heavy duty farmwork... You can enter the barn, throw hay and stuff down... but, thats about all you might do. There is a tutorial, yes, it helps you to get the game straight... if you want to call it game. I prefer the category, ""Glorified Walking Simulator""... Tuscany, Alps? Really? Well, at least that one the devs got right.Pros:Nice Graphic, if you know how to tune it down.Nice Idea.Cons:Even the graphic is nice, you need to tune it down, otherwise even high end GAs might find the game hard to swallow.The game could have been so much more, with some missions to get a first feel - and give an alternative Freestyle mode additionally.Crashes regulary - I encountered during gameplay some crashes.Soundtrack, though not bad, also not quite fitting to the game.Not RecommendedActually, though I do have some sympathies for the game and the devs, I really can't recommend the game. There is so much, that is left open to the wish of the customer, that it's really saddening. The game is a great idea, especially with the old models, but the realization is lacking. On a scale of 1 to 10 this game is a lowly four.			"

												I get it, it's supposed to simulate farming. Fine. But there's a reason (beyond the thousands of dollars of investment) that I'm simulating the process, rather than doing it for real - I don't Actually want to sit on a tractor for hours plowing a field.I guess my complaint is that it's a little too real, and not enough ""game."" Working the farm is almost entirely tedious work, and by no means play. There's no gorgeous vistas to distract you from the tedium, no array of music - not even the country music one might playfully expect. It's hard to learn the farming process, because you're spending such a vast amount of time doing the basic steps that it's easy to lose focus. Ways of skipping the tedium would be great - even if you could only ""skip"" a step by having the computer recreate your last attempt, down to the amount of hours, fuel, and total coverage you got. That way, you have to do it yourself, and you still get to do things in a remotely reasonable time - hours of tractoring, instead of days.			"

												5AMI woke up, after a nice cup of tea I got in my working boots and walked outside.There I saw this beautiful world. With country music in the background I hopped over the fence to check the lifestock. After that I saw my dog tailwagging in the distance, I walked up to her and fed her some fresh chicken. Bltches love fresh chicken.9AMTime for work!I unlocked my barn and checked the cages. Cages? Yes, cages. What is Historical Farming without slaves!In the back of the barn, one of the slaves was whining that he was out of water. Tyrone was his name.I broke his knee. No watermelon dessert for him tonight! 11AMLittle nephew came to visit my farm via multiplayer. I gave him a stick so he could poke the slaves. It's good motivation for them too!1PMMarket time!Bought an upgrade for my whip. Also got some new chains! Sweet!5PMTyrone was bltching again. Freaking Tyrone. He picked cotton 'till dinner.8PMDinner time!Gave my cows and sheep some hay. And got my ♥♥♥♥♥♥s some fresh slaughtered chicken. Sometimes they try to write letters with the feathers from the chicken. unfortunately ♥♥♥♥♥♥s can't write (Shhhh, don't tell them, it confuses them and makes them sad). slaves have to stay in good and healthy shape too, or they won't dance for you if you ask them. I gave them some watermelon dessert after. And gave everyone the rest of the evening off, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s were happy and playing basketball. Except Tyrone, I didn't let him out of his cage. Freaking Tyrone.8/10 Engine could be better, and the torture system a lot wider. Sometimes one of the slaves glitches out of his cage, and I have to whip him back in before it starts screwing my sheep. It's even worse at night, I can't see them. A stigmatise feature would be great too so I could recognise them better.If you're looking for a great, historical accurate simulation game. This is the one for you!			"

												Agricultural Simulator: Historical Farming, takes the Agricultural Simulator series of games on a time-traveling trip back to mid 20th century world of Farming. Using vintage equipment, you can create your own workable farm. Agricultural Simulator: Historical Farming also allows you to Co-Op play with a friend, so you can work a farm together. The game basically plays the same way as Agricultural Simulator 2013, but without the newer equipment, which makes it more of a challenge. This particular game does not appear to have a playable tutorial the way Agricultural Simulator 2013 did, but there are places online where you can download a free demo, so I would recommend doing that before purchasing the game so you know exactly what you are getting into before you spend money.I think as a simulator, this game is no different then other Agricultural Simulators and would probably have been a better DLC to Agri Sim 2013, as opposed to a standalone. In any case, it's not a bad game and should present a decent challenge to fan's of the Agricultural Simulator games.			"

												Enjoy being a farmer between 1950 and 1970 in the Agricultural Simulator – Historical Farming. The game takes you to the good old days and you will experience the charming farming of the 60's and 70's. Fans of nostalgia and history will be glad to work with original designed machines and to till a field with well known Old-timer Tractors. With the new feature – the dynamic ground Agrar Simulator – Historical Farming presents the first real furrows which will be left when working at the fields with strong machines. The furrows will have impact on the driving behavior of the tractors and guarantee pure realism. It is up to the player to decide in which region he would like to cultivate his farm. There are two amazing scenarios – idyllic highlands, valleys and woods in the alp-region or the fascinating Toscana region with measured climate.			"

												Like the concept of the game but crashes all the time or loads improperly. haven't been able to play at all. Locks up my computer and have to use task manager to fix it. Sometimes that doesn't even work. Don't recommend it.			"

												Do NOT purchase this.It will drain your soul and leave you empty inside. The value in this game is in chasing chickens. Get's boring about 10 seconds though.			"

												Game is straight up broken. Title is more or less of a scam. I spent more time messign with graphics options than i did chasing t blurry chickens. It certainly isn't a hardware issue. If I wan't to chase chickens I would play fable. At least I can kick the thing. FIELD GOAL IS GOOD!			"

												Don't even botherThere are major issues getting the screen resolution right and full screen to work. The tutorial video's don't work at all. And above all, it runs at 15 FPS with graphics from the year 2002, on a machine that can smoothly run Starcraft II and Planetside 2 on ultra settings. And they dare asking 15 euro's for this game.

												No. The tutorials arent working, the graphics are slow. And most important : That is not a simulator, that is an Farming FPS. Lol.Terrible.			"

												This is the same game, like: Agricultural Simulator 2013, but with old machines. Therefore, it should be DLC, not fullgame. Otherwise, game is bad.			"

												Won't run.  Went through all the suggestions on forums and none of the supposed fixes worked.  Worthless and a rip-off.  The fact that Steam has a no-refund policy in these cases is theft and I'm reporting this to my Attorney General's office.			"
