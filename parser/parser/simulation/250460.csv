												Bridge Constructor is a game that highlights the dangers of government privatization. It allows me to play as a slovenly, morally-void government contractor building really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bridges for vehicles for a nation-state consisting of several islands. They have really low standards as to what a bridge is supposed to do, just as long as a minimum of total vehicles get across. Did the bridge collapse after those two cars got across? That's fine, they've already cleared the check and the remaining budget goes right into your slush fund. Smarter contractors than I will take advantage of the game's really weird physics engine to launch cars onto the exit point, therefore saving time, money, and more money. The government finds this acceptable, presumably because they like a good show and will think you are some kind of bridge circus man or wizard. So if you feel like screwing the taxpayer, why not give this game a go?			"

												At first I thought this game might be very fun to play. I remember playing a bridge construction game back in middle school and was insanely fun due to the fact how the player can remove all restirctions and make any bridge, anyway you want. That is NOT the case with this game. There is almost no creative input by the player. There is pretty much one way to make the bridge on each specific level and the game will very rarely stray from the design the game designers had in mind, the smallest change will cause the whole bridge to collaspe. I just wish I had the ability to make a bridge the way I wanted to make it, be free of logic and budgets to simply HAVE FUN, but that is not the case with this game. One might find enjoyment in the way how you have to figure out how to do it, but not me. It's like having a bunch of legos but I'm not allowed to make anything I want to make and I'm not given any istructions on how to make something from a set. For all I know, perhpas there's is a reward of unlimited freedom if one beats this game, but I have lost all patience with this game and refuse to play it anymore.			"

												A really fun game, it have a lot of creativity on the levels, and a lot of challenging too, also pretty funny in some occasions, but dont expect realistic physics.ProsSimple mechanics.Challenging levels.Can result in really funny situations.Being limited by money and materials make the game more entertaining and challenging.Foments creativity.ConsLack of options make it seems like a flash game.Unrealistic physics system.The difficulty between levels is not consistent.

												I've played three of the Bridge Constructor games, and find this one to be the hardest, but not sure if it was the bridges or the insane physics.  This was the most frustrating of the three, mainly because a bridge may be successful one time in 10, but for different reasons - jumped funny, strange ramp effects, or tumbling incomprehensibly.There are two parts, the main continent and the unlockable slope world.  The slope world is the twist on this version of the game that salvaged the review, as the main continent was simply three bridge designs in different lengths, depending on what supplies you were granted.  Slope you have to think about it, and deal with the crazy physics.Bought in a bundle for about 75c US.  Played for about 18 hours, with 4 of that on just a couple of bridges (see my guide on the worst one IMHO).  NOT worth full retail of US$10, but if you can get it for 2.50 or less I think you will find it to be a pretty decent game.5.5 / 10			"

												This game seems to be balanced so that reasonable-looking functional bridges are too expensive to build for any given scenario. This might be in pursuit of making it a better puzzle game, but I thought it just made it irritating. I'd rather have a difficult puzzle and the tools to solve it (Infinifactory, as an example) than a simple puzzle that I have to kludge something together for because my tools have been taken away. Not fun past the first few puzzles.			"

												There are objects in the world.  Some fall under the category 'Games'.  Some fall under the category 'Art'.  But is there a category for an object that falls under both?  There is.  That category is called 'Bridge Constructor'.Perhaps you think, ""No! Bridge Constructor is not an art game; it is an engineering game.""  To which I say, ""Non Monsieur/Madame/Mademoiselle, non!""  Then I finish my thought in English because that is all the French I know.  Remember, you are not actually constructing bridges in the real physical world (apologies if you thought that this game might let you do that).  You are creating simulations, models, dreams of your inner self.  What you create on screen is you; you are what you create on screen.  I repeat: once you play this game, there will be bridges inside of you.It should also be known that this game tells the story of a world.  Do you wonder what drives the cars, the trucks, the tankers?  Wonder no more my friend: it is a race of little insect people.  Ants?  Bees?  Weevils?  I do not know: insects.  All I know is that they cannot fly.  If they could, they would not need bridges.-------------- The Story of JD7QW --------------Designate JD7QW buckled the seatbelt around his carapaced waist, its legs quivering as it did so.  It tried to hide its fright, but even from outside the tanker truck the Planner noticed.""JD7QW,"" the Planner said, its mandibles clicking furiously, ""this is no time for fear.  You are performing the function for which you were produced, as am I.  By testing this bridge we are expanding the reach of the Colony and celebrating the greatness of the Queen.  That is all we can do.  That is all we shall do.""Not daring to look at the Planner, JD7QW nodded while fixing its gaze straight ahead.  The bridge in front of it was very wooden and very straight.  It also appeared very fragile, like sunlight on water.  How could it hold the weight of the enormously flammable tanker?  ""I imagine that there are supports underneath?"" JD7QW asked, doing its best to hide its anxiety.  ""Steel?  Perhaps concrete?""""Such questions!"" the Planner snapped.  ""I will answer, but know that I will be filing a Protest when I return to the Colony.""  It shook its engorged head.  ""It appears that the Breeders are producing defective Designates.""Again JD7QW did not dare turn around.  Instead it looked up.  The sky was cloudless and blue, so clear that the ghost of the moon could be faintly seen even in the daytime.  I would like to fly there, the Designate thought suddenly.  Such wonders I would see!  But of course it couldn't.  Only the Queen was allowed to have wings.The Planner continued.  ""There is no steel.  There is no concrete.  There is wood and only wood.  But -""  The Planner's voice softened.  Surprised, JD7QW peeked over.  The Planner's mandibles had slowed, its multi-faceted eyes had grown clouded and dreamy.  ""- but oh, the design, the joins and triangles and descending supports, the interlocking wheels of pressure and release, the. . .""  Caught up in the Planner's vision, it allowed itself to think: Someday I shall be allowed to dream as well.Then the Planner shook its head.  Its voice turned to jagged stone.  ""No more!  You are impudent, JD7QW.  Drive now.  Go.""It stepped back.  Unwilling and unable to disobey, JD7QW depressed the gas pedal and the tanker truck rumbled forward.A short segment of paved road lay between the truck and the bridge.  It took both an instant and an eternity to cross.  Then JD7QW felt the wheels beneath him clunk as it rattled onto the wooden bridge, and right away it knew that it would not survive that day.The bridge was already beginning to sway, the surface to buckle.  A series of grand snapping noises echoed within the ravine, each one like the shattering of an enormous tree.  The truck began to descend; frantic, JD7QW pressed the gas pedal with all its strength.  The truck jerked forward, and for a moment the Designate thought that the vehicle might simply plow through the air to the other side, an invincible and impossible metal beast.Then the wooden surface below him imploded, and the truck fell in earnest.JD7QW barely had time to squeeze its eyes shut, to gag at the vortex in its stomach, when the fuel tank exploded.  Free of its burden, the cab of the truck shot up into the air, and the sudden reverse in sensation caused JD7QW's eyes to fly open in surprise.  And what it saw through the broken windshield was blue, endless blue, with the ghost of the moon traced far above.It knew there wasn't much time left.  With legs that were no longer trembling, it pressed the release on the seat buckle.The Designate shot out of the vehicle immediately.  Below him, the truck cab had already slowed and was falling back to earth.  But not me, JD7QW thought.  Now I shall fly.  I shall fly to the moon.  And it began to smile as it dreamed of what it might find there.----------------------------------------There is a JD7QW inside all of us.  If not for yourself, play this game for it.			"

												This game is awesome. It’s a simple premise: You build bridges. In reality it is a puzzle game with many solutions. Each level has a set of materials and a budget to work within, but it is up to you how you want to end up bridging the gap. That’s not to say most of your “solutions” won’t fail miserably. You are also constrained by physics and the properties of the given materials. In addition, it is not enough that your structure simply doesn’t collapse under its own weight; it has to be able to support traffic of different loads. I’ve lost count of the number of times that some trucks barely made it to the other side as my bridge built with spit and good intentions fell into a shattered ruin in their wake. This makes even the failures entertaining as you look what when wrong and iteratively adjust your design until it works. I definitely recommend it to the engineering-minded as it will occasionally force you to think outside the box to solve the problem at hand.			"

												I'm very glad that this game was greenlit. I'm not a specialist of such type games, but I remember that I spent nice time many years ago building bridges playing very old games. And this game gives me the same fun. Maybe it isn't the best game in it's genre and UI could be better but... IT GIVES ME SO MUCH FUN!One big disadvantage for me is that I thought that I will be able to play it on my tablet using touchscreen, but it's not the best idea.VERDICT:If you're a fan of puzzle games and want to try something different, try this game, this may be it.If you're a fan of bridge building games, you definitely should try this.Like this review?

												Bridge Constuctor itself is definetly the hardest game of the series.In the first moment it looks like Bridge Constructor Playground but it's quite more than that. 2 different maps, 8 different islands. One map has normal bridges, one has crazy bridges. Crazy bridges mean you have to build bridges with ramps and your test vehicle will fly through the air. When you have completed all this, then comes the freaky part. You'll get a little more budget. But now there is this super heavy tank truck. Damnit, I hate it when it explodes and rips your bridge off into pieces. If you like some challenge you can try to do some of the bridges just wooden. But at least at the tank truck challenge you must use every idea you have to get it over ...			"

												Bridge Constructor began its life as a mobile app and eventually found its way to Xbox One and PC. The object of the game is about as simple as it could possibly be. It's a literal ""point A to point B"" journey, but the road between these points, suspended upon whatever combination of triangles and wires you deem to be the sturdiest, is far more complicated. You're given a few tools with which to repair all of the bridges in the island nation of Camatuga, whose bridges were completely destroyed by a recent earthquake. Each level has a specific set of parameters and a budget that you must follow, limiting your options and forcing you to work with what you have.As all bridges are different in real life, as are the ones you must build. Some must be supported by pillars, others by wires, your job is to figure out which works best for each scenario. You start off with the simple material wood, and as you progress you unlock the use of concrete, steel and wires. You are limited to the amount of supplies you can use for each bridge, so you must be careful to not go over this limit but yet make a sturdy enough bridge, this is where it can be tricky at times. Now if you don’t feel like building bridges, you can have fun constructing ramps and send cars flying to the other side. This isn’t a very successful way to move forward but it is entertaining to watch.Realistic physics play a huge role in Bridge Constructor. The player must use different materials, geometric angles, and support points to create a functional bridge that can remain intact once cars, trucks, and semis start driving across it. Each material has different properties, strengths and weaknesses. For example, metal wires are great for dealing with tensile force, but not compressive force, while wood support beams have the exact inverse properties. Players must use all of the tools at their disposal to build a bridge capable of sustaining massive amounts of weight.This is a good thing, and no puzzle game should be easy. The only problem is that they're so complicated that you really need some guidelines for what you need to do. The game all too often will spring a level on you requiring a completely new type of bridge that you were previously unaware existed, or an extreme permutation of a bridge you've already made. Sometimes this works, and sometimes it doesn't.For example, one level requires you to build a suspension bridge to cross. While never explicitly stating this, you are given several clues that lead you to figure it out. The water level is too high to build the necessary beams underneath. You start to look for ways to support it from above, and notice that you can build some steel beams going straight up from a secondary anchor point on each side of the chasm. These two clues will likely lead players to realize they must use these steel beams to run wires to the actual platform of the bridge. These are what the best moments of Bridge Constructor are: moments of innovation, and not moments of fine tuning and tweaking.The biggest problem, in every level, is the allocated sum of money. Players have to build their bridge in a certain budget, and this makes things much more difficult. Not only has the bridge to be strong enough to permit traffic in order to advance to a new level, but you have to make it work by using as little building materials as possible.The controls feel very mobile game based whereas it is your standard point and click style building game. When looking at the screen, you notice white dots on the grid lines, these dots are where you can connect your bridges and support. Connecting them together usually grants you a stronger bridge.  Your puzzle solving skills get put more to the test the further you go, where towards the end, trying to build a successful bridge with a tight budget and small amount of materials at times feels near impossible.Bridge Constructor has pretty modest visuals and audio. Neither are bad and are perfectly serviceable and inoffensive, though the music could be better. The game begins with the music muted, actually, which I thought was strange, but after listening to it for a while I went back and muted it again. It started to get a little repetitive. The visuals have been remastered in high definition and though they are cartoony and simple, they're nice and colorful and get the job done. The water actually looks really good on some of the levels in the city. Bridge Constructor is a game that manages to provide a different kind of gratification than other titles. When you build something that actually stands, the feeling is quite unique. It's not like finishing a puzzle, but something more.			"

												Want to learn something about physics? Go ahead, but don't take it too serious. And please don't play it, when you are gonna have to build a bridge in real life. Especially the second world with all those funny bridges where your trucks literaly have to jump the gap.I was too dump to solve all the bridge on my own, especially when it came to the trucks. But there are a lot of solutions on the net.

												How come this game has been greenlit? I have played many bridge constructor games on Flash, standalone or mobile apps; not all of them were good but most featured better physics and playability/UI than this one.The physics really sucks: it's slow like it was slow-motion, moreover it's impossible to speed it up! So one waits for way too long for the trucks to cross a bridge. Even my girlfriend who knows only about Flash and casual games, looking at the game and watching the trucks fall off a breaking bridge, said it looks amateurish.Note to dev: scaling down the objects & world so that the physics simulation would run more realistically on Unity (which the game seems to be made off) is really no big deal!Some GUI textures are even 'optimized' with a 256-colors palette, like if our computers lack bytes of VRAM...Everything from the game system to the GUI feels mobile (which is an excellent thing... on small touchscreens), nothing seems to have been redesigned for computers... except the steep price!I played up to the middle of the second world; I wanted to give this game a chance. But it's frustrating and repetitive, and the appealing settings/bridges shown in the promotional screenshots had yet to come into play.This is definitely a bad game, boring and disrespectful to the players who are just treated as customers (what's this omnipresent 'Share on Facebook' on a single player premium computer game?!)Avoid at all cost.PS: This game is one more example of Greenlight picking crappy uninspired games (mostly from the genres/models the people already know) while disregarding many unique gems.

												Bridge Constructor surprised me, it sure looks very casual and is as easy to get into as you'd expect. For veterans of the genre who played some of the old hardcore bridge building games though, it not only has a nostalgic effect, but also kinda kicks yer butt in places if you get too cocky. If you have played bridge building games before, you will have an easy and reasonably fun time flying through the first playthrough of the main campaign, which only took me some 2.5 hours. The main campaign maps then open up for testing your bridges using the ""tank truck"", which makes things pretty tough and you have to solve levels differently (with some more budget) compared to your first playthrough! In the Expansion/DLC part of the game, you find some rather different and creative levels that at least to some degree challenge your engrained senses for the rules.So while the levels in the first run through the main campaign become very much ""seen that before"", especially if you're playing them quickly, I am still positively surprised by the game overall. If you like games like this and haven't played any in a longer time, give it a go! If you've played them all, then wait for a sale.Note: The game's difficulty often doesn't leave much room for errors or poor decision-making. Despite it's cutesy appearance, the game would potentially be frustrating for younger kids without guidance.			"

												I bought this game a while back and well. Money not well spent. The game just feels like a simple touchscreen game that one would play on the toliet.

I picked this game up as when I was a kid in primary school we used to have a really basic bridge building game on our PCs which prob ran windows 95 or 98. The game was very basic but I spent ages just building bridges then sending cars over them. That game was years better than this and thats why I cant give this game a positive score.			"

												Bought this a while ago on sale thinking it'd be an interesting to waste some time in. But it's not very fun, after a while the resource cap is the main issue. Also the solutions don't really feel like they can very that much so later on I ended up running trial and error over and over figuring out which wood beams needed to be replaced with metal ones. It really feels like a mobile game to me.			"

												A basic physics simulator, involving bridges, weight, stability and cars.There are only so many times one can construct a bridge before it becomes repetitive, and the task loses its meaning.Not the most enthralling game I've ever played.- If you enjoy puzzles this could be considered as fun, it's just that I don't particularly enjoy puzzles, and am questioning why I purchased it.- There are no outstanding visual feats here, so it's best not to expect that.(I like to imagine little people screaming inside their cars as they hurtle into air when I build an inappropriate bridge and it collapses.Or how many cups of coffee and sandwiches I have ruined for unsuspecting lorry drivers.)...Perhaps it's just me who enjoys imagining that.- Maybe if you have a crappy PC at work you could play this (if flirtatiously winking at the cute girl/guy across the corridor from you isn't working out.)Personally, I'd stick to the excessive eye spasms route.

												The game falls down pretty badly on it's simulation of ""real-life"". The math behind the game is flawed and over simplified. Also, you are constantly limited by money and materials, which heavily stifles any design flair you might want to express. Complex and interesting designs are out of the question, because you can’t afford them. All the time you are reduced to the most basic designs. Add to that the fact that there isn’t a analysis mode that allows you to understand the forces on your bridge, and you end up with a rather basic game, that can be somewhat frustrating and boring. It is still good fun to play, but with a few simple additions and new modes of play, it could have been so much better! They should also have allowed you to build larger bridges. Even the largest in the game is really quite small. So, recommended? When it's on sale, yes, it is fun, just don't expect it to be too real-life, and don't for heavens sake pay full price for it!

												On the surface, this game appears to be shovelware. Half-finished collision boxes and clipart menu graphics leave a bad first impression, but play into it a bit, and at its core are a collection of solid and well thought-out physics puzzles.My main problem with the game is that the physics are not consistent, which can be a severe detriment to a puzzle game (See Bad Rats), but here it doesn't seem to be a problem at all unless you're going for the ""Your bridge broke but you still made it"" achievement.I was surprised by the creativity of the puzzles. The first bridge that gives you a ""Checkpoint"", or a location your vehicles must drive through before reaching the goal, places the checkpoint almost directly below the starting location, forcing you to think up some insane motocross ramp to reach it safely. And it only gets wackier from there.Overall a thoroughly enjoyable puzzle game, if you like that sort of thing, with only a few problems that almost never seem to get in the way of gameplay.			"

												so there are a few annoyances with this game that prompted me to give this game a thumbs down- the bridge building physics are bad (you basically cant reinforce any joints with more braceing because more often then not trying to brace a joint will actually make it weaker because instead of diverting the strain elsewhere like it would do in real life the game reads it as there is now more weight on that joint and therefore the piece that was already strained is more likely to break)-when one piece breaks it doesn't matter if any other part of the bridge could or would be able to take the load, they all are suddenly unstable and brittle and WILL break- to compound on the inability to brace joints they also have very few ""braced points""(and or starting placement points"" in this game) which with only having 1 point on many levels on each side of the gap makes it increasingly difficult to make any type of stable bridge -the wood and metal beams must be made of a heavy paper because they can hardly hold up their own weight (bridges HAVE to be minimalist in function because of the weight of the materials is too heavy for their strength basically trying to have a huge bridge is impossible)- building the bridges has a few glitches, quite often like every 20th click when placing a bridge piece (not deleting it) it will delete any other pieces located in that area. about every 30th click your delete button will not regester no matter now many times you click with it until you then click on a available building materialso considering what i've complained about is the MAIN MAJORITY of the entire gameplay I would say even buying this for 3$ I am not satisfied and that I don't recommend it just wasn't worth the time "

												At a glance, it looks like a kids game, but it gets challenging pretty fast, especially if you want to earn as many points as you can. Every scenario requires you to improve on what you think you've already figured out. There's no one right way to solve each scenario, and so it's pretty much up to your own creative abilities.			"

												Simple little game you can enjoy on a rainy day when nothing better to do.You can design any style of bridge you want.That does not mean it will always work.Gameplay is simple to learn, and the graphics are nothing to write home to mom about.Graphics  can be clunky at times, especially when your bridge crumble beneath you.There are times where you will create a functional bridge, and the next day you cannot recreate it.Considering there are many similar games, on pc and phones, I find it hard to justify the price.However, if you have young ones, this may be something they will enjoy.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

												Bridge Constructor is a fun simulation game for all ages. It includes fun, challenging levels that are full of colour and life. This game really gets your brain working as use your imagination to create some of the most bizarre and unsafe bridges in the world! Watch as you fight against the laws of physics and the weight of vehicles to try to create your 'dream' bridge. Your ideas can be as imaginative or simple as you want but, will always get you thinking in different ways to suit each level.As you progress through the game, you are given stronger materials and a higher budget to make your bridges more unique.This game will keep you entertained for hours on end and is always fun to come back to after finishing it!

Simple But SolidThe game runs very well and the consistency of the materials is great. This allows players to easily figure out what is going wrong with their design through trial and error without any element of randomness. However, the game limits creativity as the design from the tutorial, that is the triangles, sets the foundation for all of the bridges for the rest of the game. However that being said this makes it realistic and an easy going game to play. It is worth playing if you just want to relax with a little bit of a challenge.			"

												8.2/10 - One of My Favorite Bridge BuildersI've played several bridge builders and this is one of my favorites. The game has a good variety of puzzles, lots of locations on the map and several levels of safety vehicles to test on your bridge. (car, truck, semi)Completed the first map which consists of about 40 bridge building puzzles that were challenging but achievable. There are other maps to play as well, so I’m looking forward to continuing on. I personally wouldn't pay the full $10; but there are tons of levels and I'm having lots of fun solving these bridge building puzzles. Look for on sale or in bundles!

												Bridge Construction Set (2002) by Chronic Logic is far more better in every aspect. They have trains, ships, and monster truck! You can even sit in the car and view how you cross (and might break) the bridge. You may also test for earthquake and control the light. It's the best construct game I've ever played.This game is bad, compare to that game.Not to compare with that game, however, this game is still bad. Most levels leave player no choice but to construct the bridge exactly same to the solution you found on web. There are too small test case, no run around for example. Speaking about arts, most of the time you'll force to build asymmetry bridge even thoug the envorionment is symmetry! And the most annoying is that the physics in this game is wrong, which degrade this aim-to-be-physics-savvy game to an electronic junk.			"

You will play as an architect and your job is to build bridges all over the country; a low budget bridge to let cars pass ( for those who don't want to put too much effort in the game), or an higher budget bridge for trucks and tanks ( for those who are ready to take the challenge ).

												This is a very entertaining game, even more so if you can convince a couple of friends to join in the fun and share their own wonderfully unbelievable screenshots and videos. Once you accept that the physics are mostly imaginary, a lot of the bridges become a lot more fun to figure out (especially when you're trying to get a nice explosion set up for the Perfect Screenshot). The second set of islands with slopes, that gives you access to tank trucks a lot faster, really strives to make you be creative both with your bridges and your explosions and was really enjoyable after making somewhat reasonable bridges on the first islands got a bit dull. I didn't expect to stick to this game for so many hours, the first few bridges definitely are addictive!			"

												Bridge Constructor is a brilliant game that puts you in the position of a builder constructing bridges across the 5 islands within the game. Each level tests your skills at being able to solve how to build a bridge in a means to get vehicles across. Anybody who knows of a program called West Point Bridge Designer will find this game to be quite similar, but the achievements and challenges presented will hook you right in. While you are able to build a sensible, well-thought bridge that will do the job perfectly, it's extremely fun to be able to build crazy bridges with massive jumps that still transport vehicles. The physics engine is so fun to play around with through each bridge design - launching cars off your ""ramps"" in the hopes of reaching the end - and the ability to do what you will when constructing bridges to finish each level is amazing.A game that I strongly recommend to anybody interested in purchasing this game.

But all in all, it's alright if you get it for cheap and want to waste a couple of hours putting pieces of wood and metal in certain places... ;)			"

												Bridge Constuctor is not a bad game. But there is so many bridge building games out there now its hard to choose which one is better. Personally I would say if you had to choose from all of them I would get Bridge Project. Dont get me wrong, this one is good but I think Bridge Project is just a little better.I would still recomend that if you like this type of game, get them both			"

												There is something really exciting about this game.If you like to build up and test right away and change again, then be proud of yourself when it works, you should try it.It is really fun, interesting, and give you at least 20 hours of construction.Definitly better than bridge-it.

												Decent game. Occasionally you will have to employ less than conventional approaches in order to successfully engineer some bridges.  More often than not 'common sense' engineering works.This game suffers from being an iOS/Windows Phone cross over. Has an achievement for sharing on Facebook as a result of it's iOS breeding. I have a dislike for games that include any level of Facebook intigration. That being said: Not a bad time killer, would play again.			"

												This game doesn't revolutionize anything, it's the standard bridge builder. But it's a nice game! I've seen some other reviews talking about bugged physics but I just finished every level and nothing weird ever happened.The definitely-made-for-mobile interface can be a turn off for some people, but it does its job very well, it's not a poor port. The fact that using the right mouse click is very useful goes to prove that, in my opinion.Some levels have a 'crazy bridge' sign, meaning you'll need to build some outrageous bridge to beat that level. These are very fun, of course, but the construction method start to feel weak in these levels. Feels like you should have more control over the building, like defining exactly what would be solid and what wouldn't etc (these things are automatically defined depending on the angle and adjacent pieces).While I do recommend this game, judging by the fact that it isn't anything new and it's fairly short, I'd say wait for a sale or something. At full price I'm not so sure if it's worth it.			"

												Played during an Indie-Game-Saturday event. So I have also officially played all three Brdige Constructor games. Overall, I really hate not recommending these games because they are fun, especially in a group (hot-seat style). I just wish that the developers would make better decisions (even with the material they have - not much more developing money would be necessary).Pros:1. Fun, wonky bridge construction that *mostly* follows logic2. Medium level of game contentCons:1. Music is SUPER repetitive - especially since these are puzzles that take time2. You don't so much learn to build bridges as you learn to 'play the game' or break the system lol3. Medium level of game content4. The game lacks overall creativity in challenges, levels, music, menu design, and basically everything. So much wasted potential here. "

												So after playing this game for about an hour I have to say it was fun at first, then it became quite boring after a while. Sure you get to build bridges and test to see if cars or trucks can make it across safely or not but after a while it gets repetitive.While building the bridges you do have a spending limit which makes you choose your building material wisely unfortunately you are not granted all of the building material from the get go which is fine. When you do finish building your bridge you get to test it with either a car, trucks or semi trucks. If your bridege can support the heavier vehicles you get a bonus added to your score. If it can't support the heavier vehicles you get to watch your bridge fail, you also get to watch your bridge fail if you did not build it correctly. Another thing you get to see when you test your bridge out is where there is stress. After seeing the areas that have a great deal of stress you can go back and redo that aree if you would like or you can leave it alone. I usually went back and tried to redo the area. Unfortunately I do not recommend this game at all.			"

												For people who love simulation & puzzle fans its good. You really need to find the mistakes and need to try many different solutions of how you build and with what. 54 Achievements are good, but its a hard fight to get them all, the game could have more achievements (each level would be amazing), but its fine. 5 Trading Cards missing. For hardcore simulation/ puzzle fans i give 75 % because its really tough to find solutions without guides/ help but most time you need 2-3 ways of how to build and only change them a bit to the level. For achievement hunters i give 80 % for 54 in 15 hours, 50 % for normal gamers, you like it or not. Last thing buy it with a discount 10 euros for 15 hours maybe looks okay, but maybe you stop gaming after 3-5 hours because you dislike it, so get it for 66-75 % discount. Thx 4 reading.			"

												Bridge Constructor is casual gaming at its best, I enjoyed it alot. You can play it in small doses, but the fun is there if you play it for hours, too. It's not a hectic game, you construct your bridge and press a button to see how it does when cars/trucks/tank trucks drive over it. Watching the physics simulation can be fun in itself, especially when the chaos of the collapse brings unexpected results. If the vehicles reach the goal even though your bridge is collapsing behind them, that earns you an achievement aptly named ""throwaway bridge"" and I got a broad smile when that happened the first time.If you want to go for high scores (build using less materials, in perfection often resulting in a ""throwaway bridge"" situation) or compare your score on leaderboards, this game has that, too. It encourages experimentation with the construction options you have. And getting the achievements is also fun and 100%ing is possible with some effort but without pain.The ""sandboxy"" character of the game shines when you unexpectedly finish a level because some weird accident happens and the truck gets thrown to the goal while your bridge collapses, or the explosion with the fuel tank truck happens in just the right way to propel its two parts across.For the later levels that are tricky and require some experimentation, I found it enjoyable to watch other people's solutions on youtube, often even after I solved that level myself.

												I think it needs to be said that the game does fail as a physics based puzzle game, in that I've had at least one moment where simply running the simulation a second time without changing anything achieved a different result than it did the first time I ran it (a part did not break at the homestretch of my bridge, netting me both the win for the level and the Pinocchio achievement).  I can only report this happening once because I instantly came here to point this out in a review, and before now I hadn't even tried such a boneheaded maneuver when things went wrong (I only did it this time to reevaluate what was wrong with the bridge!).  I'm having trouble recommending a physics based puzzle game where you can get different results by trying the same thing more than once (isn't that the definition of insanity?), so I will have to give this a thumbs down.However, I would also point out to prospective buyers that the game actually is a lot of fun, so I'm hitting ""no"" on a bit of an edge case.  If the game seams appealing to you, you probably should still buy this, it just cheapens the experience a bit to realize that there may be an (indeterminable amount of an) element of pure luck involved here.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												Wow. The developers for this game put certain things that should have been put off for another time. For example, making a new paid DLC pack. The problem? At the same time, no fixes for broken achievements, design flaws or bugs were released, and if the DLC contains the fixes, I am not buying it because we should not need to buy a DLC to make the game run properly. The devs spent 4 years making that cruddy DLC for this cruddy game and didn't bother to fix bugs? I don't even know how this has positive reviews. In 4 years, if I am functionally competent for that entire time, I can most likely make several hundred, or even thousands of Steam Workshop submissions. Hell, I could most likely make a short game with low-end graphics. But no, the developers had to waste 4 years of their life for a DLC that will most likely never be purchased, and if it does, it will immediately be refunded.			"

												!!!Probably not worth more than $5 but not worth more than $10 definetly!!!If you are looking to satisfy your urges to build bridges in this type of game this will definetly satisfy it but theres not a whole lot here. Theres only 4 matrials to build with (wood, steel, cable, and reinforced towrds) and not a whole lot of scenarios to go with.If you just want to see every mission and pass them using the bare minimum of work using cars only the games easy as picking your nose. But it becomes very very frustrating when trying to pass using trucks and the repatition of levels does get a bit annoying in addition to this.But its a very simple game with pretty poor but still workable physics simulation, but a problem results from these poor physics when stress points and failure areas sometimes change from run to run though by very small deviations, but enough to make you confused about what the solution should be.Its a bridge building game. These games are always casual fun and almost always stright forward. Theres a ton of these floating around too.			"

												Bridge Constuctor itself is definetly the hardest game of the series.In the first moment it looks like Bridge Constructor Playground but it's quite more than that.2 different maps 8 different islands. One island has normal bridges one has crazy bridges.That means you have to build bridges with ramps and your test vehicles will fly through the air. When you have completed all this then comes the freaky part. You'll get a little more budget but now there is this super heavy tank truck. Damnit I hate it when it explodes and rips your bridge off into pieces. If you like some challenge you can try to do some of the bridges just wooden. But at least at the tank truck challenge you must use every idea you have to get him over ...			"

												Left it on for a bit longer because I remembered that it had cards, but nope..Well, I remember back in the day I played a similar game called Pontifex. I remember enjoying that game but I can't say the same for this one. Much of the challenge comes from finding the right spot for triangle supports (typically around the whole bridge so that lone triangle supports don't break it) and levels seem very similar to each other. It gets boring after some time.			"

												The objective of this game is that, with as little budget as possible, car/truck/tanker can successfully cross the (incomplete) bridge you build. Yeah, you can build an ordinary triangle-shaped bridge and move onto the next stage, but the real fun is that you build an unconventional, yet cheaper bridge; you can make cars fly, make only one of two cars reach the end, etc. It's really surprising for palyers to do numerous things with just a simple game aspects, but with a great idea.

												I wanted to like this one, as it seemed like a fun little game to kill the time. But:- Physics are awful, and inconsistent.- There's a complete lack of tips, explanations or how to; you're left trying things again and again and again for no apparent reason. Which goes for everything basically, because...- There's a fair bit of repetition, and unwanted repetition at that: did you finally understand how the game wants you to use wooden planks when you've got noplace to lean them on? Great, now do it again a couple of times, with minor changes that you have to figure out yourself by failing again and again and again. And that's my biggest complaint:- It's limited. What you can construct is limited. What you can imagine is limited, down to minor details, and these details are so hardcoded into each level that they take away all the fun.Nope. Thanks but no thanks.			"

Fun for what it is, but not what it appears to beLet's get one thing clear: this is not a bridge construction simulator. This is a puzzle game that has bridge-building as its conceit. What's the difference? A bridge construction simulator will let you build boring, practical, realistic bridges, and then challenge you to cut corners and make death-defying monstrosities (or go to the other extreme and build over-engineered sky-ramping masterpieces).This is not that game. Bridge Constructor is a puzzle game, because it tightly limits your resources (funds, materials, and attachment points) to the point where a boring, bog-standard bridge is not possible on almost any level.Overall, I still have to give this a thumbs-up, because it's not a bad puzzle game. But it's not the bridge-building free-for-all sandbox you may be looking for.			"

												Never trust a bridge you find in Camatuga.  Go well out of your way to find a ferry, or go all the way around the river to get to the other side, but don't go across a bridge!Bridge Constructor is a game where you build bridges in the fictional lands of Camatuga.  Your budget, and sometimes your available supplies (wood, steel, concrete, and rope) are limited, which means that sometimes you have to get creative.  But beyond that, it's all about figuring out how you can build a bridge, on budget, that will carry across cars, then medium trucks, then tanker-trailers.While it may sound like a fairly straightforward physics building game, the wacky bridges you'll often wind up with and the explosions of wood and steel when things don't quite work out, make it hilarious.  The game is both a lot of fun by yourself, but also a lot of fun with friends, especially towards the more difficult later levels, where you can pass around the mouse and try your own approaches to building spans on low budgets.  Inevitably it will take a lot of tries to get it right, and laughter will ensue as unlikely bridges collapse - or occasionally prove just good enough to support the load, despite their ""I'd never drive across that in real life"" appearance.Among the Bridge Constructor series, I'd put this one and Medieval at pretty much equal for gameplay, as Medieval introduces some interesting new elements, but the three vehicles types per bridge extends the challenge, in a good way, of each bridge here (while not preventing you from moving to the next one as long as you have cars getting across).  However, this iteration gave me much more playtime before I'd completed most of the game, and they're the same price, so my recommendation would be to get Bridge Constructor, have a blast, and if you're still wanting more, picking up Medieval after that.

												Great game, got in a bundle. Didn't expect much, but it is way better than bridge project. Its almost as good as bridge it but lacking just a few features as far as I can tell. But its still great. Good that it has the finer grid mode so that you can make bridges more accurate just like in bridge it. Doesn't have hydraulics or interactive modes like in bridge it, but enough comparison, this game is great by itself. The world map going from bridge to bridge is nice. The physics are good enough for me. Basically Its nice to have a bridge game other than bridge it that does not suck (bridge project). I'm happy I have this game. Its simple but challenging. Its pretty easy to make a bridge that cars can cross, but when you get higher than that is when the challenge comes in. worth it.

												Little physics game that had consistent physics. It was nice to see you re-run the simulation over and over again with little to no variation - meaning your solutions were not luck based. Overall it was a fun and challenging game as you are forced to self learn different tricks and understand how the physics engine calculates the stress.Great little physics game 9/10!			"

												This is a great game that reminds me of the old Bridge Builder game they had in Elementry School. Use wood, steel, etc to build a bridge accross a span.

												I have to start off saying my first impressions of this game were not good. I'd heard it was a mobile port and the screenies made it look simplistic and overly cartoony which is fine but I was hoping for a more in depth bridge building simulator.I ended up getting it in a bundle and gave it a shot and I love it. It starts off very easy but builds slowly as you master building ever more complex bridges.

												This game has a lot of promise, but is both too frustrating and too annoying.Frustrating: I know this is a puzzle game, and I like puzzle games, but the game's only hint is 'use triangles', which is massively unhelpful. There's poor feedback about where your bridge went wrong, and sometimes the bridges seem to break apart unexpectedly.Annoying: If you want to exit, and goodness forbid you're building or testing a bridge when this happens, you have to go through 4-6 screens to exit properly. In addition, while you can turn off the annoying music, you can't turn off the annoying and quite loud sound.In conclusion, Poly Bridge is still early access, but it feels much more polished than this.

												Its a fun game, if you're into this kind of thing. My only complaint is that it is in some SERIOUS need of some new game modes or DLC. Namely, in the form of a campaign mode that allows you to earn money based on how much traffic your bridges receive. With the toll money you make, you could build new bridges capable of handling more traffic and larger vehicles, allowing you to earn more money. This game, however, has none of that. Sometimes, you are constrained by a budget that only allows you to build the most laughable of temporary throw-away bridges that crumble on the first use. It also limits your options for construction materials seemingly arbitrarily. It really limits the fun factor. I'm all for a challenge, but when you want me to build a bridge tp cross a 300 foot gap with no support columns in between made of wood that can support a multi-ton fuel tanker-all on a budget of 30,000 dollars-that's where i draw the line. All I'm saying is GIVE ME OPTIONS. Limiting the building materials and budget only limits my creativity. So despite all this, why am I recommending this game? Because you get to build bridges, fool! Where else can you do that, sucka!!?			"

												TL;DR it's a dumbed down, oversimplified, easier, and crappier imitation of Bridge It.The level design is extremely easy and extremely repetitive.  Only a few levels in the entire game, using the biggest truck (the tanker), actually took more than 1 try.   I found myself building almost exactly the same bridge a dozen times on a dozen slightly different maps.  Then I had to repeat each of those maps again with a bigger truck.   Bridge constructor has slightly more levels than bridge it but the levels are so repetitive that effectively Bridge It has 3 times more levels.The building materials are ridiculously strong, to the point that you can bridge a big gap with nothing but road layed in an inverted arch.   Also, there's less variety in building materials.When you mouseover beams it often highlights a different beam from the one that will actually be affected when you click.It panders to you with stupid achievements and crowd cheering sounds that you get just for breathing.   This is typical of pretty much every corporate game since Wrath of the Lich King, but still, it's really stupid.			"

												Yeah. It is fun at first.... then compulsion sets in and you NEED to make things work. I don't think the physics are too well done. My job is in construction. I like to think that after 10 years, I have a pretty good handle on construction physics. The arch means nothing to this game. The rest of the physics seem well done. You figure what the game wants to work, then mix and repeat, over and over and over. If you can grab this for $5, Go ahead! But...... I don't think that it is fully worth $10.I was spoiled with World of Goo. Buy that instead. If you already have World of Goo..... don't expect that from this game.			"

												This is not a good building game.First off, the controls. The controls are completely mouse driven, with the keyboard only being able to move the viewing area around the screen. The mouse also can move the viewing area, meaning moving too close to the edge makes the whole screen move, which just pisses me off to no end.If you want to place multiple pieces on after another, after you place on, the next one is automatically connected, which, while may seem useful, is not. It mainly gets in the way and makes red show up way too often.Second, the physics. The physics suck. Minecraft has better physics.Also, the wooden structures and wires do hit the road. if the top of yout bridge falls over, it falls through the road.Read other negative reviews for the physics. I cannot express my dislike well in words.			"

												Bridge constructor is something between a simulation and puzzle game. It's both, although decidely more puzzle than simulation. Wonky physics and a relatively grueling level of difficulty leave Bridge Constructor feeling quite challenging, mostly due to an overwhelming requirement of imagination. There are many different solutions to each level and they only grow in intensity as the game progresses. Overall, a good experience if not a little drawn out. After the first stage there aren't any new materials involved in puzzle completion - just different uses of those materials. Leaves the game feeling a bit tired toward the end.TL;DR: Yeah, it's good. Fun for a bit.			"

												Warning to potential buyers: This game has some bridges that won't be solveable with the only structures the game shows you, you'll have to make some weird sh** up and I know this because I had to look up the answer after failing some of the bridges over and over. The game does little to show you which structures you should be thinking about (other than triangles), and often you might not really see if something is working that 10% better than your other builds, and that's often a crucial difference. It also doesn't really explain what materials might fare better beyond the absolute basics of (steel is stronger than wood), and it would've been awesome if they did more to show how the rope can help to support tight budget bridges by connecting along the underside of your bridge from end to end. I only know it distributes weight better this way because some walkthroughs used it. Other materials can be a bit fiddly with load distribution depending on how you've arranged them.I have played through a bunch of this game and BC: Medieval and while I like both just for the physics puzzle challenge, I find the Medieval one's solutions end up making more sense than this one. It still barely guides you but at least those structures kind of make sense.In this version you can build diagonal roads (which might be the only way to solve some of these bridges, it's certainly the only way I could find for some) and they end up letting you hold them up with ropes from nonsense structures on the sides because the stone pillars are too expensive or not available.I still recommend it because I've enjoyed it either way, the physics are simple but pretty consistent, and it's a good little brain work out, but if you want a well-paced puzzle game with some actual help on what to do, this game fails a little on that front. I personally looked up a few answers and still enjoyed trying to figure the level out before I gave up.			"

												At first glance, Bridge Constructor might seem like another physics based puzzle game you would beat in one sitting, but Bridge Constructor is here to prove that building bridges is not as easy as one might think. Bridge Constructor eases you in with its first few puzzles, but by the time you get to the second zone you will have your friends and family huddled around the computer trying to fill the shoes of a professional engineer, but in a good way!

												This game is seriously fun.  It is very well made, and has beautiful graphics.  While it is a bridge building game, I'm not lying when I tell you it is intense and insane at times.  I have literally yelled at my computer several times when I was only a segment away from making my bridge work with trucks, but it was worth it. While it appears simplistic, it feels realistic.  Although realistic it provides the perfect amount of goofyness to the game to keep me relaxed after my yelling.  The goofyness does nothing to detract from the gameplay, and only adds to it.  I can not express how much I love to play it.Only downside is the musical tracks, which pretty much becomes ambient after a while, which really makes it not a problem.Overall I give it a 9.5/10 due to the linear/limited gameplay aspect of it, but other than that, very well polished and well worth the money spent.  I can dream for a sandbox bridge mode, right ;)?			"

You can run your cars through your would-be-bridge two times and the second might work.Also the UI is.. well, very frustrating to say the least. It does the job allright but somehow feels very outdated with all too much selecting, deselecting, dragging, dropping -- something out of a mobile game really.I got about three hours in and really it doesnt get any better from the first hour.

However, I felt as though there are games online that are free which replicate something such as this already.  The explanation of all the mechanics was slightly underdone.  I was confused on how to use the cables entirely and why they would be necessary to have on one of my bridges.Overall, a small and fun game.  Got it through a Humble Bundle so I didn't pay much for it.  I wouldn't expect anyone to pay over 5 dollars for this.

												Bridge Constructor is a nice and simple way to waste some time. The story in the game is very straightforward. There has been a devastating earthquake that has destroyed the bridges on the islands of Camatuga and the player is in charge of their rebuilding. The problem for the player is that the available budget for the bridge constructions is very tight, so it is not possible to make too advanced solutions or to use the more expensive materials as much as would be ideal. After building the bridges, they have to be tested by letting some cars and/or trucks cross and if the bridge collapses a rethink of the design is needed. When all bridges on Camatuga are functioning for trucks, the game opens up for tests using heavy tanker trucks on the newly constructed bridges, with an often sad and explosive result prompting a redesign of the bridges.Sometimes the statics of the bridge constructions seem a bit off with collapsing at unexpected places, but usually some engineering common sense and experimenting will solve the problems. It would have been nice to be able to play some of the levels with unlimited budget in order to test some truly exotic bridge designs, but the game is good enough as it is.This is not a game to spend full evenings with because of its repetitive nature, but it is a relaxing game to play for a couple of minutes now and then. Quite a bit like sudoku.			"

												a funny little physics puzzle game where the goal is too simply get the vehicles to the other side. though this gets hard to do when your on a limited budget and get materials taken away from you in some missions. This game gives you the weird feeling of having alot of freedom and very little at the same time.  You have your freedom of being able to complete each mission your way with your own custom made bridge but u also feel very limited because there are only 4 different materials to construct your bridge from and it's rare that you even get to use 3 of them at a time (2 in most missions).  but it can also be pretty humerous watching your little cars go flying to their doom or watching them desperatly trying to outrun the colapseing bridge behind them. If you enjoy physics based puzzles this is definentaly worth checking out.			"

												I have to start off saying my first impressions of this game were not good. I'd heard it was a mobile port and the screenies made it look simplistic and overly cartoony which is fine but I was hoping for a more in depth bridge building simulator.I ended up getting it in a bundle and gave it a shot and I love it. It starts off very easy but builds slowly as you master building ever more complex bridges. So rather than go on about it, I'll just say if you are the type of person that likes the idea of building bridges for fun, don't hesitate, you'll have a ball with it.			"

												This is a terrible bridge simulator with a frustrating interface.  There is no way to ""select"" and ""delete"" an individual element.  You must instead delete the design and start over!!   On the physics side, the simulation is entirely unrealistic.  Why do trucks fly UP into the air when a bridge fails?  Why do non-connected timbers fall and bounce in concert?  The physics engine is clearly 2-D only, and just adds on 3-D graphics.  (Other building games are actual 3-D.)  Last, why do cars that have fallen 25 feet cotinue to drive forward while under water?			"

And i rather thought that i had that going for me.  I also realized that i can squeeze the Charmin, and nobody would care.  So why am i telling you these two off the wall epiphanies.  Because i had more fun squeezing the Charmin, and i will never design or construct bridges.I mean i had so many things to say about this, but then my cat started to yak and i decided to watch him projectile vomit as my wife chased him around the house.

Overall this version results in a polishes experience that gets it just right. Sometimes it's hard to build a nice bridge, sometimes you can get away with crazy cheap designs. I enjoy it quite a bit.Slope Mania was fun as well, containing a mix of both hard and trivial challenges. It allows for some bridges that totally collapse while the tanker truck races downward and still makes it across.			"

												This has become one of my favorite games recently.  Such a simple idea, but a definite head scratcher with the limitations of build materials and budget.  You can be as inventive or conventional as you like with bridge designs, but only if the physics works out!			"

												This game has a lot of promise, but is both too frustrating and too annoying.Frustrating: I know this is a puzzle game, and I like puzzle games, but the game's only hint is 'use triangles', which is massively unhelpful. There's poor feedback about where your bridge went wrong, and sometimes the bridges seem to break apart unexpectedly.Annoying: If you want to exit, and goodness forbid you're building or testing a bridge when this happens, you have to go through 4-6 screens to exit properly. In addition, while you can turn off the annoying music, you can't turn off the annoying and quite loud sound.In conclusion, Poly Bridge is still early access, but it feels much more polished than this.

												Simple bridge constructing game with mobile game UI and bad physics. Offers entertainment for approx. two hours, and with its price at (9€) I can't really recommend it. If you insist on buying a bridge construction game, I would recommend buying Poly Bridge instead. (12€ atm)			"

												Nice little casual game to waste some hours. Gets harder slowly, had to look up one or two solutions since I couldn't figure out what to do. Solutions did not help me at all. Buy if you are really into this kind of games and just for a few bucks, not more than 3 or 4.			"

												So i made a startling realization today while playing this.  I discovered that i can't get by with life on my looks alone.  Thats right, it is shocking i know.  And i rather thought that i had that going for me.  I also realized that i can squeeze the Charmin, and nobody would care.  So why am i telling you these two off the wall epiphanies.  Because i had more fun squeezing the Charmin, and i will never design or construct bridges.I mean i had so many things to say about this, but then my cat started to yak and i decided to watch him projectile vomit as my wife chased him around the house. (BTW, not recommended, because, apparently, my good looks are also not enough to keep me off the coach.)Play on Google, avoid the fee, you'll be done after about 6 lvls anyway.			"

												If your an engineer and think this game will be fun, its not... some of the decisions you have to make in it clearly would never be made by engineers and make no sence...  Clearly designed by a bunch of computer geeks who thought they'd try their hands at physics. How do I know? I actually paid money for a box of corn flakes which happened to contain a piece of paper allowing me to be employed as someone who has an appreciation for steel structures.			"

												It was surprisingly difficult. This game is not for small children, despite the art style. I enjoyed it for a while but there comes a point where the tasks feel repetitive.
