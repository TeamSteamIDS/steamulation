												As a big fan of the genre, I gotta be honest, this game isn't very good.The graphics are pretty bad but I guess that's not a big deal for a tycoon game. Now if only the tycoon part was good.There are only a few rides that you can build, and while they are all very polished, most of them operate the exact same way. There is a huge lack of rides, shops and customization options compared with RCT, which came out years ago. Also, the maps are so small that you probably couldn't fit all the rides in your park. So in the end, all the park you will make will pretty much look the same.I wish I could find something positive to say about this game but I can't. Not worth the price,  not worth the time. Stick with your favorite version of Rollercoaster Tycoon.			"

												Wow, this game looked promising but boy was i wrong... The Rides: Just 21 rides... I immediately got flashbacks to Theme Park world, you got 20 rides per theme section. One thing: You got 4 themes so you've got a lot more rides...The Coasters: Horrible, just plain awful. The coasters just fall and go up, without any speed loss/gain. You can't even make loopings... No loopings in a Coaster Game... Even a simple banked bend isn't possible. What were the designers thinking?The facilities: The restaurant's are very bad designed and just plain simple. There isn't even a person standing in the stand.The scenery: There is almost no scenery, and the scenery there is is very dull. You can't even make simple buildings. I mean Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 from the year 2002 has buildings?!Path's: Just awful to lay down. Making a square (And i mean like a town square) is a very hard job. And serious: No queues. A Theme Park without queues sound like dream in real life, but it's just terrible that you don't have them in the game.The AI: Plain dumb, worst routing ever.Sound: There isn't any sound. No people screaming/lauging/talking. No ambiance, yeah some crickets/birds... And the music is terrible. There are only 2 songs and they repeat and repeat until the universe implode.Conclusion: Don't buy it. It's like i've been ripped off... 2/10			"

												Its was passable...until i wanted to build a coaster. The best bit about these games! But... that is so awfully done. Its drag and drop style, which seems easy in the steam trailer but its not. It sometimes does not allow you to build a certain part of the track. When it looks to be feasible, however 90 degree turns are not a problem!? on a coaster! When you're not happy with a part of the track there is no undo button. You will need to click on the demolish tool and use that. Your employees only work in a square sector where you dropped them... when there is nothing to do in that sector they will just stand still exactly where you dropped them down. Which looks ridiculous. The music is so out of place you'd expect relaxing music.. but its more as if you were about to go to battle or something. And only if you zoom in you will hear the crowd and attraction. The attractions have no queuing... yeah i have nothing positive to say about this game. ... it looks nice. Maybe even a bit better then RCT3, which is a better game on all aspects. Save your money or spend a bit more and get RCT3 platinum...oh wait thats even cheaper... GET THAT			"

												This game might be worth $5, if you want something to waste a few minutes with.  It is certainly not worth $30.  If you want something in this genre, you should go buy Roller Coaster Tycoon which is cheaper and still better in every way.  If you've already finished RCT and want a different experience in the same vein, take the money you would spend on this game, go buy some booze, and play RCT again at the ""Drunk"" difficulty setting.  You'll still have gotten more for your money than this crap.			"

The graphic may be nice and the people arent that ugly; but you have so less attractions and stuff to build. Have ever played RCT 1 or 2? You dont even have a quarter of all the stuff to build.I startet a free map and wanted to have every attraction (klicked an option). I opened the menu for it and thought: ""Thats it?

												Seriously... A wanna be Roller Coaster Tycoon that stopped updating a month after release... OH heres the real kicker, they planned to release new rides that you had to buy with real money... Wow. Get roller coaster tycoon, it has more rides, more themes, more crap you don't need, editing maps, a story mode that unlocks new rides, upload you own music to rides, Water rides, animals, I mean come on just buy RCT3 already. I think it has workshop too if Im not mistaken			"

Are you Old Enough? If you're old enough to remember the old Rollercoaster Tycoon games from the last decade or maybe even Theme Park (which was so long ago now I don't want to think about it) you'll be on familiar territory with Adventure Park. Familiar but slightly disappointing territory.Wait... This is a review for Adventure Park, Right?It is, but a little historical context is important here. Let me take you on journey back to 2005. We were listening to The Crazy Frogs Axel F on our I Pod, watching Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith at the cinema and secretly hoping that Santa would bring us a new Xbox 360 for Christmas. One of the other things that I found myself doing back the halcyon summer of 2005 was playing an amazing game called Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.Rollercoaster... of LoveA shiny new 3d graphics engine, terraforming, customisable scenery, Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 had it all and that's before you start building the facilities and the rides.You'd build a few shops, a few rides, maybe place a fireworks display or two. Employ some staff to run it all for you and tweak your prices to pay for them. Then you could drop back down into first person view and explore your own park, even take a ride on that huge rollercoaster you'd just finished building! Now lets go back... back to the future!So Adventure Park is Like Rollercoaster Tycoon?Yes and no..... mostly no. In the sense that you get to build your own theme park, rides, stores and all, then yes, Adventure Park is like Rollercoaster Tycoon.In the sense that it is executed as well or as much fun to play as Rollercoaster Tycoon then No, no it's not like the classic game at all.But it looks ""nice"" Yes, compared to the classic park games, it looks ""nice"". The graphics are fairly well detailed (if not pretty) even when you zoom all the way in. Then again, the hardware we're all running has come a long way since that Rollercoaster fuelled summer of                                    2005, so this is really a given.Bigger IS Better At first I found the tiny map size to be another hindrance to my enjoyment of this game. Then I began to realise that this isn't a huge issue as there isn't that much content to place on them anyway.Double Dipper The star attraction of any game like this is usually the Rollercoaster design itself. Unfortunately here, your coaster construction options are limited. Want loops, spirals, curved bends banking and twisting their way around the scenery of your park? then you're out of luck. The track design here is strictly an up and down affair.Hey Kids, What's that Sound? Whilst playing I began to notice that the game felt hollow, empty somehow.I gave up with the clunky controls and left my second ""upty, downy"" coaster half constructed to ponder why. Then it occurred to me, the reason this game was lacking any sort of atmosphere was down to sound, or lack there of.No people screaming as they hurtle around the (just up and down) track of your painfully built coaster. no chatter of people as they stroll between the burgerstand and toilets, no ambient sound at all, Apart from the occasional squawk from a stray flock of birds lost in the souless emptyness that is your ""fun"" park and some slightly irritating music, all is silent.Death by a Thousand Cuts There are many little annoyances in this game that by themselves wouldn't overly bother me, but taken all together they become a pretty big distraction. I could point out a host of irritations here but I think I can some it up with the example you are about to read.Why Can't I sit down? You can't sit down because you need to achieve a 3 star park before you can build benches.Benches! Wow, We need to get the R&D boys on that! oh wait, their is no R&D, just the star rating system to unlock objects. I know this is a game mechanic to incentivise continued play but benches.... really! Oh well, just keep walking...Rose Tinted MonitorFor me, it's the nostalgia of building a theme park again that attracted me to Adventure Park, unfortunately nostalgia can only carry you so far. After playing Adventure Park for a while I was left with an overwhelming desire to turn it off and play Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 instead. Enjoyment can be found here, you just have to look really, really hard to find it.( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ ) "

												It may not be fair comparing this game to Rollercoaster Tycoon or even Theme Park (World) but what do you expect?Adventure Park tries it's best to keep up but simply falls short on several key points;The graphics, while not horrible, simply do not look good and just misses the charm of the other two theme park franchises. The game and UI are not user-friendly. Whenever you build a ride, it does not automatically allign to the path, which makes it possible to place it over the walking path. Even something like; turning your ride around (so it's entrance faces the right direction) is frustrating to do. The rides look ok but since there are only like 20 of 'em you will soon be bored with them.Adventure Park is more frustrating than fun and comes with steep price. For that money you can get Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 (best thing is to wait for a deal, though) or Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 for way less than that.			"

												While this is a perfectly functional themepark game it has nothing that distinguishes it. Pretty much every other game in the genre is cheaper, has more content and some even look better. If this was offered at the $5 price point it might be worthwhile if you don't already own almost any other game in the genre. As it stands it's nothing but a low effort immitation. I think the devs planned to do more with this game but gave up, released it as is and asked a new release price for it. In addition to content it lacks polish and heart. It's not terrible mind you, it's decidedly below average and overpriced to boot.If you are waiting for new theme park game to be a worthy successor to any of the well knon tycoon series... Well... Keep on waiting, you wont find what you are looking for here.Edit: 2 years later and Atari is set to launch rollercoaster tycoon 4 and I have to say it paints Adventure Park in a better light. If nothing else I have to respect b-Alive's production values. It actually ""looks"" like a better game then RCT4 and is less broken. Still not a touch on RCT3 and the RTC3 devs are about to release Planet Coaster as a worthy successor so I still suggest giving Adventure Park a miss.			"

												I was really excited when I saw this game being released. I was a huge fan of Rollercoaster Tycoon back in the day, and was waiting for an updated version to try. This is not that game. The rollercoaster creation is very simplistic, basically just dragging around tracks clumsily. I felt the spaces were a little cramped, at least in the early stages. This seems more geared toward managing your ride and service placement, and the economic factors of the park, which is fine, but it gets stale if you can't build those impressive rollercoasters from the Tycoon series.  This game just got a little boring after a while, because I didn't see much else happening next besides just going to a new scenario to plop down some rides and manager worker placement. It just felt like something was missing to really draw you in and keep playing.The graphics are fairly outdated for a recent game. You can zoom out or zoom all the way in to street level, but nothing really looks good that close. It's also difficult to see exactly where the entrance is to some rides, which doesn't help when you are supposed to line all the entrances up to the paths. The music is what you'd expect, just some bland instrumentals.I'd recommend just going back to Rollercoaster Tycoon if you are a fan of that series. This will not scratch that itch for a new game.Grade: D			"

												Well, after spending hundreds of hours on Rollercoater Tycoons 2 and 3 I couldn't wait for Adventure Park to be released.  It seemed the answer to my theme park building dreams.  However, even from the tutorial the game seemed to lack any polish.  Basic things are wrong within the game.  There is a lack of rides and coaster building is unrewarding and difficult.  The grpahics in this game are the only thing that is an improvement on RCT3.  Save your money and buy RCT3 instead.  You can pick it up for under £5 with both expansion packs int he steam sales and even at almost 10 years old it's much better than this broken mess of a game.			"

												Recommended on sale as for 20€ there are more sophisticated games to play.Not that bad game, good 3D graphics, good idea with pirate rides but it is kind of all. Compared to other park building games like Rollercoaster Tycoon, controls in this game seems quite uncomfortable.Every visitor has its own budget, mind, preferences, each ride has its own price and statistics like speed, g-meter, etc., you can sell different things for different prices in each shop, set an entrance fee, set workers' place of interest etc. etc. etc. Everything seems standard, sophisticated. But if you played other games, something is missing. The detail, which other games have. Something that even if you do, you are not satisfied how you did that. And other games have theese details. Disadvantage of this game is that it's price is higher or same as of theese other games. And if you should pay 20€ for a game with all of details you feel comfortable or to pay 20€ for this game without those details, you make the decision.In short...it is another German-style game, this time by b-alive gmbh. All German games can look nice, entertain, have some good options while playing, but the controls and feeling is kind of hard.			"

												It's a really bad sign when the only positive Metacritic user-review was written by the developer.This game is $10 more expensive than Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and offers NON of the content. You're better off just watching the trailer, because that's all you really get. The gameplay itself is rather poor and confusing, with no way to predict how visitors will respond to price changes except for a message box that is the info-box equivalent of a broken compass.They only included enough content in this game to fill up the promotional material. This so called ""Game"" serves no purpose other than to legally steal your hard earned money. DO NOT LET THIS GAME ROB YOU! "

												What a complete load of crap. Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 is far far far superior to this terrible unfinshed pile of steaming hot turd. I've played a lot of Theme Park Simulation games over the last 20 years & I will say with no doubt in my mind whatsoever that this is the worst one yet. I would rather play Roller Coater Tycoon 4 on my mobile & have to wait 24 hours to place a plant than waste 5 minutes on this utter monumental piece of crap. The dev team who made this will hopefully have quit after they released this into the poor public. It litterally offends all three of my senses. Theres about 3 shops to choose from. 6 rides. Some plants. Thats about it. The paths are laid out for you. The levels are tiny!!! And I mean tiny. Theme park back on my Amiga 600 had level areas around 10 times larger. There is a very limited amount of customisation in this. Which is really dumb as thats why people want to play these types of games! So my overall best tip for this game is DO NOT BUY!!Go get something like Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 which is such an epic game. Don't waste your hard earnt money on this ♥♥♥♥♥.MASSIVE THUMBS DOWN!!

												No. Just no. I'm a huuge fan of the RCT series (played the original RCT for hundreds, if not thousands of hours) and everytime something new like it comes out I'm like ""Oh boy I gotta try it!"" so I picked this game up in a sale - I mean, did you SEE the price on this thing?? - and started playing it. I quickly shut it down after about 10 minutes. And the only reason I held out for that long is because of my loyalty to the RCT genre.Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised by a game. This time, however, the surprise was everything but pleasant. The control screens and mechanics don't work at all. The visitors in the park seem to get lost pretty much all the time and the unintuitive and buggy building tools make it impossible to get them to their loved rides more efficiently. And by rides I mean the 20 almost similar contraptions that you can plop down, along with maybe ten different kinds of restaurants, which are in fact more like unmanned stalls that magically give out stuff (Hey, I found a plus to this game: Magic-ghost-food-stalls!). The 3D camera handles weird and rotating is just plain awful. The music is noticeably ripped off from Pirates of the Carribbean and is basically a single loop that repeats every few minutes. The core game mechanics are faulty and don't seem to work most of the time. The interface is clunky and doesn't respond half of the time. Oh, and those are the best parts of the game.I'm going to keep it short since I've already wasted too much time with this game, but if you're expecting something like the RCT games but better: Give up all hope now and go back to the good ol' RCT2, which really was the greatest theme park building game ever.If, on the other hand, you're expecting a crappy, uninspired, ripoff game that's not even worth a tenth of what they're asking (I mean, how do they even dare to ask 30 bucks for such a crappy game!) then go ahead. I got this game in a sale and even regret paying 4€.This abomination will forever be a dark spot in my gaming history.			"

												Not pleased at all with purchasing this game.  There aren't enough maps or rides.  And the calculations for g forces on the rollercoasters are rediculous.  Building a rollercoaster that goes straight down then straight back up again with the highest drop possible and only getting 1.5 g's is terrible.  Could have been a good game but ended up not being worth the money.			"

												Glad I caught this on sale, but man, why didn't I see the reviews before? You seriously have about 20 ""attractions"" you can place. That's it. Theme park of your dreams? Yeah, right. There are two roller coasters you can build yourself. One is a metal one, the other is wooden. You have two options for the kiddie ride-ons (horse and alligator). Then a few select thrill rides. Three pirate themed, three space themed, one Egyptian themed. Oh, and the ridiculous animal rides! I get horse ride, I can even see buffalo and elephant ride....but triceratops? dragons? What? Also along the same lines, you can have a jeep ride, a helicopter ride, a blimp ride, and a tram ride. You can't even use all these unless you have the rides go in a tiny circle, because the map is TINY.Boring, and unimaginative. Stick with RCT!			"

												Roller coaster tycoon 2 is still better. There's nothing new to see here. The interface can be very frustrating since it uses edge-scrolling and margin buttons together. It feels like boxing with your computer and the constant unexpected re-orienting of the screen will make your eyes hurt.The missions are extremely MEH and offer little in the way of actual challenge. Some of the sets look nice but are mostly MEH and leave you wondering why they chose the pieces that they did. This is another one where your placed objects have some sort of poorly defined AOE effect on your park and visitors. MEH.MEH! Save your money. Roller coaster tycoon 2 is going to be the best-in-genre for a long time to come if the other upcoming entries are anything like this one.5/10			"

												This game is a generic theme-park title with one theme: pirates.I made up some videos on how to earn the 2-star, 3-star, or 4-star rating on my site because of how difficult it is to obtain these levels -- which are required to unlock bigger better content for your park.  You have to get a 100% like rating -- not 99% mind you.The NPCs are braindead and fail to circulate the park in a meaningful way.  They won't walk to the rear of your park; you have to pick them up and carry them there.The graphics are nice, but the programming is lazy and runs at less than 30 FPS on my computer -- one of the fastest gaming computers I've ever built -- at any graphics setting above ""low"".I'm a big simulation fan, but for me, this one was a pass.

												I thought I would give it a shot, because I haven´t played similar games and therefore could not compare it to them.However, sorry, but I cannot recomment it. It is difficult to build things, because the tools are not very precise. The visitors act unrealistically and there is no way to know how they will react to what you are building.

												While Adventure Park sits on a premise of continuing the legacy of popular amusment park building and management games, the software is built in a clumsy and handfisted way.  Do you have a PC that runs games in 1080p or higher resolution?  Then this game is not for you.Interface scaling at the (2015 is here, guys) level of 1080p or higher renders the text in the game unreadable and the game itself unplayable.  What's more it doesn't handle the Microsoft Windows operating system (introduced in the 1980's) - Alt tabbing will cause the game to hang. Don't buy it, if you got this in a bundle (a winner is you!), don't install it.			"

												Where to begin with this game...Lets start by writhing that this game is NOT like the rollercoster or themepark games of old, it's an ""ripoff"". Well you might think that's not bad is it? An ripoff of something great must make this game great also?Well you are wrong!First i tried to stream this game, after 15min I was bored to death and quit, but after some thought i continued to atleast try to build my first rollercoster, and the buildingprocess was awfull. The end result didn't look anything like the awesome creations i did in Rollercoster tycoon way back in the early 2000's.You can check our lets play here

												I really love this game. I don't see why it gets all the negative press! There's different maps to choose, you build a cool themepark which gets better over time - keeping everyone 100% happy for a month (in game) gets you the next level of stuff unlocked so you go from basic rides to heart-pumping rollercoasters which you can layout the tracks however you like - making the ultimate white-knuckle ride!There's themes - pirate, sci-fi, fantasy, western - or do a mash up or in zones... I really like this game... it's like them park world but better			"

												The actual tutorial, assuming you just go straight through it can probably be wrapped up in about 15-20 mins. You can however, continue playing the tutorial map as long as you wish.Also, while I try to be as objective as I can by providing examples, there's still a lot of subjective preferences and expectations here on my part, so keep that in mind if determining whether or not the game is for you based on my feedback.General InfoIn the tutorial you start out by buying staff to clean up an island you just bought to make your theme park. At this time there is only the gardner, cleaner, and 5 levels of technicians (different skills levels for complexity of rides). You'll end up learning about the finances, services, decorating, keeping visitors happy, missions, creating coasters, etc. You can rotate the camera, zoom up or down all the way to the ground level. While on the ground level you can ""walk"" through the park...see the park as your patrons see it.  You can also ride the rides by selecting the ride, then going to it's ""street level"" view. This has been done in a few other games, so it's good to see it here too. Screenshots posted. In the tut, the last thing you learn is how to create coasters. You select a specific coaster to build, then you lay down the tracks yourself. You increase or decrease the angle of track by holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse. It uses a waypoint system to make things easier if you like. Building the track is intuitive and fun, easy to do and you can make it as complex as you like, however, you cannot create loops which is a disappointement to many.As your park gets higher ratings more options become available to you. New rides, decorations, services, etc... Also, new challenges will appear in the mission list (create a ride w/ x g-force rating, create a 3-star ride, have $x monthly income, etc.).You also have the ability to modify terrain itself. You can elevate it, decrease it, flatten it, add water, etc... So you have quite a bit of control here.Game AssetsIn Free Build mode, you can unlock every asset in the game from the start (which is not the case with Campaign mode).  You have about 6 maps to work with, some larger than others, each of a different environment (forest, desert, etc.).Here is the breakdown of the available assets of the game:21 rides (includes all kiddie rides and larger coasters). This isn't very much IMO. Now you can completely customize the coasters with your own build (and name), and even add event facilities (tunnels, explosions, etc...), but still, there are only 21 basic types of rides.5 path types (stone, wood, etc.)30 plants/trees8 different fence types, each with their own style gate (including metal, wood, glass, stone, etc...)5 Entertainment Facilities - laid down next to the tracks (explosions, tunnels, etc..)13 Terrain types12 Service buildings (bathrooms, stores, food, etc). They for some reason include benches, but i make a distinction here since benches are free to use by the visitors where as well other services aren't3 bench types with about 20 variations (slight style change or color variation)2 trash can types, each with different color variations3 types of staff (Cleaner, Gardener, Mechanic). There are 5 skill levels of mechanics though, which correspond to the complexity rating of the ride.  There are no mascots or anything else. No animals, nothing other than these 3.34 decorations (torches, stones, skulls, rock formations, etc.)IMO, it's a little lacking. It could use some more types of staff, maybe more rides (DLC at some point?), fireworks system, more entertainment facilities, etc.It is enough to have fun with, but for hardcore players, it may not be enough. As more of a casual player, and one more focused on creativity than min-maxing, it's fine, particularly at the current price point of the game.  It is also an area where the devs could release some DLC to add to the game. I have no idea if they'd do that or not though.The GoodGraphicsGraphically, the game is nice. It is similar to, but not quite as polished as Sims 3 graphics. Not that S3 graphics are revolutionary, just that it works for the game style that it  is.You can select ""User Defined"" for graphic settings, and from there you have plenty of graphic options available (see my screenshot in the hub or my profile). I was quite surprised to find this actually given how seemingly simplistic the Settings Menu is at first glance. So from where, I can tweak as needed, to provide the best possible experience.I'm running with an AMD 6800 GT Series (don't know exact model, sorry) with 1GB vid memory, 8GB 3DDR, Intel i7920. I can play Sims 3 at max settings just fine. However, I have to tweak the User Defined settings a bit here to get it to run smoothly. I'm personally fine with doing so but you should know that the default setting may be a bit rough, so be prepared to tweak as you need them. StaffHiring, placing, and directing the new employee  is quite intuitive and a step up from other similar games that I recall.  Before I place the staff member and while I'm holding him (ala Sims 3 style), it shows the green border area of where he will be restricted to working. I can drop him anywhere,and he will stay w/i this boundary.  I can increase this area (simply by clicking on him, then on the increase area button) or decrease it. I can easily relocate him to a new area as well.  It's simple to do and lets me have decent control. See screenshot.""The Bad""In ""quotes"" because these are minor annoyances vs significant issues that negatively affect the game play experience. See the next section for that.The UII don't care too much for the Menu design nor the dialog boxes. It's very outdated IMO.  It works, it will not complicate the game unecessarily but it is a little distracting to me personally. See my screenshots (in my profile) for examples.  The building options are fine however. It's like they used 2 different ui designers. Quite odd.No Queue LinesUnlike other games in this genre, you have no control over queue lines.  What happens is that they go into the ride waiting area (which is a part of the ride build itself). You do see them standing there, waiting to get on the ride when it becomes available. To be clear, you don't  create an area for lines. The ride ""hub""  does that by itself internally. Setting Prices Not only do you price out admission, but each ride. OK...some parks still exist that do that (most large parks do not however). But pricing out bathroom use? Makes me feel like I'm runing a low end, small town, wandering fair or something.The UglyDynamic BuildingEssentially...it doesn't exist. Once you drop something...it cannot be moved. You have to sell it outright then buy another one to replace it (even if you only need to move the item 1 square over). I dropped a trash can in an area where later in the game it prevented a large ride from being built. I missed this by 1 grid square.  The only way to resolve this is to sell/bulldoze the trash can. I still needed a trash can in the area though...so I had to buy a new one. This is very unrealistic of course, and highly annoying. "

												This game is like most sim theme park games, where you build a theme park.  It seems unfinished, The garbage man seems to do nothing at all, at least I never saw mine move anywhere.  There are enough rides not to make it to overwhelming for new players so its a good intro game.  What the game does well is you can click people and walk around as that person enjoying rides going on roller coasters.  Normally TotalBiscuit does great reviews, Id ignore his review for this game simply because he played the game wrong.  Not his fault just from his video the problems are clear, most players are unsure how to set up a ride, such as where the entrance to the ride is.  How to guide visitors to rides.  My bigger problem was that the tutorial was very lacking and there is no help section making a management game with its own rules difficult to play without learning how to play it yourself.  Such as what is an adrenaline meter?  I have no idea, had to figure that out on my own.  Whats worse is the generic names making it impossible to google anything for this game, such as ""Adventure Park"", Roller coaster, safari ride, their so generic it makes finding any tips anywhere difficult.The game is fun IF you learn how to play it, which means for most learning wont be very fun.

												Hello everybody, my name is Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) and I'm the writer for a game review and article website known as Universal Gaming Reviews. This is my review for Adventure Park. This isn't the Rollercoaster Tycoon sequel I was looking for but it's the perfect game for young kids and teens to get into the theme park simulation genre. I've been a long time fan of tycoon games and Rollercoaster Tycoon was one of the first I ever got into. This game was geared more towards the younger generation and focuses more on ease of play rather than in-depth theme park creation and customization which makes it a great introductory game. For die-hard fans of tycoon games I'd recommend looking elsewhere however as there isn't a whole lot to keep you entertained for long. Thanks for reading folks and happy gaming!You can read our full review here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/2013/11/adventure-park-overview-review/ "

												What can I say that literally everyone else hasn't said? Potentially good game, ruined by abysmal optimisation, and uninspired gameplay.Pretty visuals, could have been a contender, but was evidently abandoned or simply went unfinished. Steer clear, not even a game to buy 'for the lols'.

												Yep, just as I thought. It is Wildlife Park 3 without animals and theme park junk replacing them. Same objects, same textures and same sounds. Except wait, the only sound is the ambient music. Game can be easily modded and edited, but no point really. Most of my play time I was afk while I waited for my money to build up to complete level. No where near as polished as WP3 and models are not even optimized. The ride models are nice and have good textures, but there is no fun in the game. If you don't know the rules of WP3 this game makes no sense. It should have been a DLC for WP3 not a game in and of itself. If you can get it for less than $5 it is fun to manipulate, but otherwise stay away from this DLC...er game.			"

												Severe performance problems, content is lacking, gameplay isn't really up to 15 year old games, you can't drown people by throwing them in water. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can swim.Can't recommend.			"

												Played this for all of 2 minutes, music sucks, sounds like you playing a war game, you have to constantly select the stalls to add items of what to sell, by this a long list of drinks for each stallReally disapointing			"

												Yep, just as I thought. It is Wildlife Park 3 without animals and theme park junk replacing them. Same objects, same textures and same sounds. Except wait, the only sound is the ambient music. Game can be easily modded and edited, but no point really. Most of my play time I was afk while I waited for my money to build up to complete level. No where near as polished as WP3 and models are not even optimized. The ride models are nice and have good textures, but there is no fun in the game. If you don't know the rules of WP3 this game makes no sense. It should have been a DLC for WP3 not a game in and of itself. If you can get it for less than $5 it is fun to manipulate, but otherwise stay away from this DLC...er game.			"

												Don't ever bother buying this. Not only it runs really choppy, even with a computer way above the requirements, it is incredibly boring, dull and poorly designed.Terrible awful graphics and poor sound effects.Can't even be considered a shadow of RCT. RCT3 is 100% better and cheaper!			"
