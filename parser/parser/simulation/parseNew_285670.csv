												Game crashed three times while trying to play it. That's as much as I plan to fool with it for a free game I was given in apology over another game. Can't say I got to play it too much because of all the trouble, so take that as you will.

			This is a awful game,this is a awful video and i would advise you not to watch for the safety of your own health		

Here's some video of what it looks like played if you're interested, or read the other reviews.Here's the error my Steam now has (going to have to reboot) where it thinks the game is still running but it's not. http://i.imgur.com/ytaqwi2.png It's not a huge thing - I just gotta reboot but it illustrates the issues.

												I've always enjoyed the 'Battlecruiser Universe' games. Sure they take some getting used to but the amount of depth put into them once you learn how to play they are immersive. Most complaints I see are regarding graphics and controls but they forget these games are made by one indie developer and the games are old now - but if you check out the king of space sims UC you'll see it's being updated and having a new versiion out soon with modern graphics etc. It takes time and not everyone has $20million of other people's money to make a game.Get yourself a joystick, the other controls you need are there in the manual. Just jot them down and leave them beside your keyboard.Just remember that these games are not games, they're simulators. True space sims. Definitely not for casuals.Anyway if you enjoy sims, depth and complex gameplay then ignore the haters and troll reviews and add this to your library. Personally I prefer captaining giant cap ships so prefer UC but this is still a blast to play and adds to the whole Battlecruiser Universe backstory.For Galcom!			"

												This is easily the worst piece of garbage I've seen all year.Arrow keys control your ship. Your ship looks like MS paint just vomited all over a canvas. The plot is horrible and whomever wrote it had a hard on for military terminology that he doesn't understand.♥♥♥♥ this game.			"
