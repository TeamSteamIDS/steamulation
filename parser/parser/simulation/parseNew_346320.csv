												Don't pay much for this one.  It's worse than using a web page.  It actually feels like a webpage.  It's like a crime simulator thing where you manage your little gang and try to take over the streets...  But it's just too simple.  You hire a goon, costs X amount of money, you give him a job, hit 'end turn', random event happens, either loses money or gets thrown in jail, etc.  Try to take over streets which just puts a little checkmark on that street, you at no point even see an animation.  You can see all of the possible images in the folder which the game installs to, it's basically a randomly generated set of faces, names are a text file, you see the sound effects..  Still with the ""action adventure"" thumbnails from where they were sourced..  It has to INSTALL to a non-Steam folder to run!  Wow!  AND IT ASKS TO RESTART YOUR COMPUTER.  It's the first game I have ever seen that recommends this.  I didn't restart, and it ran fine, I suppose it is for ""rare"" cases as the developer has said.  Sometimes I click the ""play"" button and it asks to install again.  I can reproduce it: even though the installer says clearly that we will be able to click the ""play"" button and it won't ask anymore, but if you are in steam's ""detail view"" and click ""play"" it will ask to install again.  Every time.  Just the overall quality here is non existant.  Would it be too hard to ask for a developer to make animations?  I honestly thought this was going to be a 3D game (but didn't think anything of it, since it was in a bundle) and when I boot it up it's basically a turn based text game with a few images on it.  The weapons don't even have images, they are just lines of text in a file.  If you WANT a game like this and get it for cheap (almost free!) you may enjoy yourself.  Personally, I wanted to leave a review so people don't buy it for $3 or whatever is retail expecting it to be a perfect game.  It's not.  It's sloppy.			"

												While there's potential here for an interesting simulation game, there's absolutely no reason you should purchase it at this time.When important information is cut off from the end user in a game critical on feedback, there's a major problem. There are no resolution settings, or even ability to change that up, so you'll be guessing half the time what it says. That makes interaction fail on so many levels, and really hurt the user in terms of what's going on. A lack of tutorial hurts this game immensly. There's help buttons, but they only give you a piece of the overall picture, and interaction is what games should thrive on.The enemy opponent seems too random. Randomness is good in a game like this, but to a point. Sometimes, within the first 10 turns, I could be attacked and be majorly hurt. Other times, the enemy doesn't want to do anything at all, even though my base is really open to attack.That also leads to not really having a lot of information about your opponents well being to make an informed decision. Is he gaining power? Should I search for him? What is my best option here? Again, there seems to be an interesting mechanic buried in here, but it's hard to get past those major points. Like really major. Games work with interactivity. Here, you're along for the ride more then anything else. While yes, you can see feedback at times and maybe keep track of things, it's really hard to get into the ""story' aspect of being a gang leader when I'm not really sure what my gang just did. I see values changing. Great, wonderful, I have no idea what they actually did to do that.The tooltips are nice I suppose, once figuring out they were present, that made information a lot easier to look at. Lack of resolution settings hurts immensly. While a game can be at one resolution, you can see the problem when I still can't see the text. Sorry, I'm going to hit that one over and over again: if I can't read what's going on: there's a problem.Can't recommend at  this time.More information and gameplay commentary here:

												I really wanted to like this game as it looked quite simple but had a good concept. Unfortunately the execution was so poor that it ruined the gameplay experience.First of all the game does not scale properly with enlarged fonts. All of the text in the game was too big for the UI and the only way I could play it was to change my Windows setting and rebooting which was very annoying.Also, one of the biggest annoyances is that too much of the game is based on luck rather than strategy. For example, the gameplay is based around recruting guys for your gang and in the first few turns in particular you need to gather some guys and send them out on jobs. If you get some bad ones then you'll start off losing money and your game is basically screwed.This wouldn't be so bad if you could just restart but there's no option to do that. To start a new game you have to quit out of the whole game and re-launch it.All in all I just found it really annoying and wouldn't recommend it, even at bundle prices.			"

												I wanted to like this game. The concept seemed neat, although basic. I ignored a lot of the hate, although I did pick it up on a sale.What I found was a game that started out alright, but then it just got stupid with its random events, and the in game hints are simply invalid. ""Have your guy do x, low risk, if he gets picked up it's a light sentence"" type thing. Two new guys, both get picked up and sentenced to life in prison for the lowest risk, least penalty type job they could do.Then I've a couple guys just die in random ""he got sick"" type events.It's not a game were you're a crime boss fight another, its a game where you're the most inept crime boss possible who has only the largest losers available for hire, who will simply die off from natural causes or get life sentences, or even be found guilty and fined, as it's apparently wrong for someone to guard my headquarters...Fully regret picking this up now.

												this game is very addictive for a text based gangs game!you hire your gang members then either have them make money for you, take over streets or defend your hq but they do get arrested at random but this adds to the thrill of what happens each turn, you can set difficulty settings to make more of a challenge when you get used to how the game works which is very simple to understand, the only thing i would have love to have seen was more difficulty settings ( i have played it many times and eventually defeated the harder settings and im longing for more!).once you get used to the game you can often finish it in an hour so if you are looking for a casual game while watching tv or when you dont have much time its perfect but it can take a few hours before you are used to how it works so a real bargain for its extremely low price!very recommended to anyone really and especially if you want an easy to grasp gangs game thats text based and excellent value! :)			"

												Note, I updated my review to clarify and address comments. Overall, I didn't really care for the game and I was getting frustrated at it by the end. The mechanisms of the game itself weren’t bad (thus the 2 hours I spent), there were decent challenges and the objective of the game was straight forward. But I had issues with the UI being hard to play with. I was getting odd bugs like windows sticking, issues with check boxes (if I unchecked a thug in the neighborhood view, I couldn’t check anyone else and had to leave and re-enter the neighborhood). I also had the gamescreen spill over on both sides of my monitor. Though that's likely due to the fact I have two monitors with different resolutions. The UI felt blocky and jerky, like it was made in VB using forms. The jerkiness may just be my laptop as it is 5 years old, though it has 8GB of ram in it.The UI could also be polished a bit more. I kept moving back and forth between windows to get information. (though that could just be ADD…) For example, when someone's arrested, I'd like to know what job they were doing at the time (or at least their face) because I don’t remember all the names that pass through my organization. Or I’d like to have the thug’s stats on the give orders window. Or I would look at the new recruit’s stats, then go in and look at my crew’s stats, then back out to compare them to the new recruit’s, etc. Having the new recruit in the crew page to begin with would simplify that.The bit of backstory we are given just didn't feel consistent with the rest of the story during gameplay. The backstory is that you are in a post-apocalyptic city duking it out with another warlord. But, in the game there’s police and courts, meaning there’s a functional government, and you rarely see your rival. So the story during the game felt more like a street gang. Which is fine, it just didn’t jibe with the backstory. The antagonist felt more like it was the police/courts than your rival gang. (Perhaps instead of police and courts, your crew runs into your rival's crew and they have to escape, etc) There were quite a few pieces I did like; the face generation was amusing, and I liked how there were explanations and tool-tips everywhere, that made diving into the game easy.Not a bad game, but not quite good enough yet for me to recommend spending money on it. (I got it as a part of a bundle)			"

												I'm changing my review from recommended to not recommended solely on the fact that the game is charging for DLC that is close to the base-price of the game that fixes some of the initial issues the game had.  It's extremely bad business to charge for what is essentially a patch, and the creation of this DLC only means that what is initially wrong with the game now has no hope of being fixed in the base game itself unless you pay more for the game.  Sorry, no thanks.  Append the new features to the base game and up the price by $2 for the base game for new customers.  I'll keep my original review below this statement.---------This one is a tough one to judge and where I'd wish there was a ""Yes but needs improvement"" button... from my hours played I'd say i've gotten my value out of it from the price tag, but it feels like it needs something more.  The lack of a tutorial is probably an hour of my time just trying to understand the game.  Thankfully when you hover your mouse over icons it gives a good explanation as to what does what.  One thing you will encounter is that in the early-goings you will struggle a lot, but if you manage to get some cashflow happening and recruits with decent hacking stats the game becomes a bit of a cakewalk where you can just bribe police every 7 turns, recruit all people with +10 hacking skill, send them on hacking, and get a few brutes to take territories over and arm them to the teeth.  If you get attacked around this time you will typically have enough resources to repair your HQ so it's not much of a hassle to worry about having people defending your HQ.  The game needs some proper balancing for early/endgame, a minor tutorial I can see benefiting many gamers who need some hand-holding and guidance.  Aside from those gripes at this price I got some mild enjoyment out of it, might play it again down the road if more content is added and different ways of playing to genuinely make each experience totally new.What I'd like to see:  Larger maps where you actually have to clear a path to get to different areas, starting in low-resistance areas that gradually branch out to high-resistance areas.  Actual AI opponents that are after the same goal as you, up to 1 to 3 and after X amount of turns if nobody has won the person with the highest influence wins.  Different territories giving different perks, such as giving blood every turn, cheaper/better weapons, etc.  Ultimately I just want a more enriching experience that makes me want to keep coming back again and again.

												Played a little over an hour. It was buggy, felt unfinished, and ultimately was very boring. But now, for the bug-fixes and a little more content, the devs are Charging people extra money! So, instead of fixing the game that people already bought, they add all of the fixes into DLC, that's almost as high as the original game! Huge regrets buying this one.			"

												Unimaginative time sink with an external installer despite its Steam distribution. Dated visuals and repetitive gameplay. May have replay value if original playthrough doesn't bore you to absolute tears, which it most likely will. Buggy UI, unresponsive controls. Plays like something somebody would make during the first semester of a four-year university computer sciences program. Calling this a game would actually be kind to it; there are many better free games in existence.2/10. Poorly designed and executed, and should not have been released in its existing state.			"

												Those of you familiar with the game, Chaos Overloards, will likely feel right at home with this game. Hire your gang members, tool them up with better equipment, give them orders (hacking, take over streets, defend HQ etc,), hire lawyers/bribe judges and search for the enemy trying to disrupt your plans. It has lots of replayability value as everything from available equipment to gang members stats to the location of the enemy you're trying to find are randomised at the start of each game, along with random events happening during each game it ensures that every time you play it will always be different from the last time. The developer listens to and responds to feedback, already implementing new game modes since release and a future update to the character models is in the pipeline. For the price, you can't go wrong really.			"

												To The Point:- A fun game, challenging enough, easy enough to learn, and great replayability due to random events/spawn/characters upon restart- Developer is active in forums (Single Developer, not a team, so well done for this game) and responds to feedback through discussion and updates as required- Strategy includes improving your criminal team' skills and equipment, influencing (or assassinating) the judiciary, and what crimes to send which criminals to commit. Also is the ever-present Nemesis who will thwart your activities if you do not take him out.- Great game for what it is. Casual play, with some strategising and reacting to events. - Good selection of challenges to enhance the game, or increase difficulty and length- Read the description in Store and discussions, it is either a game you will like or not, so read up before you buy- Very happy with this purchase, very happy with Developer activity/responses, very happy with updates, very happy with gameplay- Recommended "

This isn't THAT bad...But it's not that good, either. It is what it is. It's a tiny game, very simple, and there's no reason to play it for more than a few minutes. There's just no pay off, even tiny games more simple than this usually have some sort of fake psychological boost or payoff to them. A good concept does not make a good game, or even a decent game. This game manages to take a good concept and single-mindedly hammer it down until it's so basic that it's pointless to even play it.A lot of people complain about reviews that aren't really reviews. Sometimes, you just can't give something other than a negative review, because there's really nothing that stands out about this to make it playable. Boooorrrriiiinnnnggggg "

												Ok, so I've read some of the positive and negative reviews, debated about whether to get this or not, and it dropped to $1.70 or so and I decided, ""What the heck, let's give it a spin ...""The game is basically a 'conquer the city, street by street' game in what plays like a board game format, with some interesting twists.  I'll list here what I feel are some PROS, CONS, and some SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT that I feel might make the game even more interesting / challenging.PROS1) Semi-permanent, random events have effects on your gang's success / failure.  Some useful random events are: Police On Strike & Loyal Stand.  Some detrimental random events are: Religious Holiday, Flu Bug, Crime Tariff.  I've only played for a handful of hours so far, so I'm sure I haven't seen all the events yet, but I do like how they add some significant upside / downside to the game, & it's a good idea to keep an eye out for them.2) You can bribe the police, temporarily ... initially, this is a rather costly thing to do, as it can burn through your available resources fairly quickly.  But it can also help you greatly to get that initial toe-hold you need to get your crime syndicate up & running. You also get an icon that indicates 'bribe in effect' & goes away on the day that your bribes cease to help you out.3) Even bribed, the police aren't exactly your friends.  So, you have a deal with the police not to arrest any of your gang members this week?  Good for you.  But this week, the police decide to 'clean up' a neighborhood festering with corruption & restore it to the residents.  Nice.  Too bad it was one of YOUR neighborhoods of festering corruption ...4) Your main opponent finds different ways to pester & annoy you.  From things as simple as "" I stole some of your money !"" to things a bit more troubling, like ""I stole some of your resources !"" to things quite a bit more personal, like ""I stole one of your best gang members!""  Yeah, like the one I bothered to just equip with a nice shiny new gun & body armor, WTH, lol ...5) In a pinch, you can convert your resources to cash.  There's a lower $, lower resource liquidation option & a higher $, higher resource liquidation option.  This can be useful early on, but you can get a bit carried away with this ...6) Occassionally, random help shows up.  Maybe you've got plenty of cash, but resources are tapping out.  Or you need cash & can't burn down resources to get it.  Sometimes an outside source will make an offer to you that involves a swap of some kind.  These don't generally occur often, but they can be helpful from time to time.7) Pretty Much Bug-Free.  So far the one & only thing that I have noticed has also already been pointed out by others.  Whenever I click the desktop icon to launch the game, it will put up an install window.  Past the point of installing it once, you have to ignore this popup & then the game loads normally each & every time.  But it is a bit of a nuisance b/c it will show this each & every time.  But as far as game mechanics once playing the game itself, I haven't found any bugs at all.CONS (it appears I ran out of my max allowed words when describing the CONS, so I'll rewrite and be briefer, lol).There are a number of these, but I'm not without hope that at least some of them might be addressed, as the Dev appears willing to listen to constructive criticism & still appears to be adjusting the game to make it more challenging / interesting.1) My most serious beef deals with the judge/lawyer/bribe/assassinate/trial system that is set up here.  Quite a few issues with this.1a) Biggest complaint is that once your gang member is arrested, there is no description indicating which of the 3 judges in the city will be hearing his case.  This is largely baffling - how is it that a crime syndicate entrenched enough to bribe both judges & cops not capable of figuring out which of 3 judges is going to try their gang member the next day?  At least give me an option to 'incentive bribe' someone in a position to know that answer so that I can go from there.  This would help give me an idea if my lawyer (stats prominently displayed when you hire 1 of 3 lawyers) has a snowball's chance in he11 of dealing with that particular judge (those 3 judges stats are also prominently displayed, but don't help much if you can't do anything in light of it that might improve your chances of successfully defending your client).  Of course, if you have the cash, you could just bribe all 3 judges, which leads me to ...1b) 'Bribed Judges' still find your gang members guilty.  And not just guilty, but often 'bury them under the jail & throw away the key' guilty.  I get that hackers are dangerous, street thugs can be vicious, etc.  The game runs on quite a few turns passing before a full year goes by, so I guess some of these 'life sentences' could, in reality, be 10 - 20 year convictions (which would effectively take them out of any reasonable chance of you seeing them again in the course of your game).  But it'd be cool to see the number of years they got vs. hearing a life in prison sentence for something as simple as being arrested for guard duty at your hideout.  Yes, it does happen.  Also, if a 'bribed judge' is going to get indignant over being offered a bribe & then 'throw the book' at my gang member, I'd like to hear something back after the bribe was offered to that effect.  It might get me to consider sending someone his way ... which leads to another thing ...1c) Even if you guess correctly & knock off the correct judge, the trial of your gang member will take place first, & then the judge will get waxed.  As near as I can tell, there's no taking out the judge and stalling proceedings until a new (and hopefully more sympathetic) judge comes along.  A couple of other things about the whole lawyer/judge thing ...1d) You can't get rid of your idiot lawyer to hire a better one.  Your stuck with him or her until the 2 year contract runs its course.  Presumably, you get the one with the best stats from the get go, but one nice thing is that occassionaly, old lawyers & judges go out (in the judge case, often feet first) and new ones come in, sometimes presenting you with new lawyers with better stats.  This system could really hum if you could drop one lawyer for another from trial to trial, depending on you knowing which judge your member would be up against.  This would give you some feeling of say in the final outcome, even if it meant that you shelled out some more $ to rip up contract with one lawyer to pick up a new one.  At the moment, that feels like an area that needs some improvement.1e) Bribe all 3 judges, shoot the ones that don't toe the line, the new ones come in listing as bribed as well.  This seems like it's likely just a slight oversight.  I wouldn't think the judge would include in his or her last will & testament that their bribes be passed on for the good of the next judge to take their place.  It does kinda make me laugh a bit though whenever I see the new judge listed with 'bribed' already under their heading ...Okay enough with the judicial system, onto a few other cons ...2) Guns & armor dry up after you buy the initially offered items at the store.  While these do eventually get replaced, it can sometimes take many, many turns before any new weaponry or armor comes down the line to be offered to your gang. 3) Can't swap guns & armor from member to member.  Argghh ...4) Resources to cash but no cash to resources, unless you get really, really lucky with an outside offer. So keep your resources up. Or else.5) Only hacking & searching for your rival seem to grant resources. Chaos only seems to ever add money. Eh. Doesn't make Chaos a particularly useful tactic, then ...6) No base bonus pts for successfully defending the base. You can lose 'em but can't gain 'em.Word limit reached. Suggestions to follow L8r.

												It's a nice game, full of potential, and I think you all should give it a try. The developer is a really nice person, actually listening to what the community have to say, so you can expect improvements in this game. The price is nice and I think you're going to enjoy it.If i can suggest something for the future of the game, I'll say to add achievements, trading cards, and a tutorial. Those are important features			"
