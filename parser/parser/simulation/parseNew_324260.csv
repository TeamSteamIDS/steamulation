												Let me first start by saying this is a ""No, for now"", not a ""No"", as most of the issues I see are fixable and the dev team does seem to be involved in discussion.Simply put, despite lots of apparent customizations, they fall absolutely flat. There is very little point to choosing a class as you can easily get the starting skills/gear of one class with minimal playing early in the game. The skill trees fall into 3 catagories: offense/defense/make money; there is no unique skill to be seen for skill development besides the ability to see what ores an asteroid will give you before you mine it, flying bigger ships, and I'll even count driving in reverse at an acceptable rate. It's true that there is some playstyle choices to be made here as to whether you focus on combat or money earning, but at the end of the day you'll still need combat skills in order to defend yourself, so there's no incentive to go for one specialization over another besides ""I wonder if I can"" (yes, you can, does it make any difference in the core gameplay? no.).While character customization is flat, ship customization is concave. Choose from 1 of 4 weapon types, make sure you skill up the ones you want so you can use them, then find the 1 or 2 ship frames with decent stats that allow you to use them. From there attach passive items to fit your playstyle, and get the biggest shield you can. The stats from ship to ship are woefully similar, 95% of the time you're going to care about only 1 thing: does the ship support the weapons I wanna use? Armor, hull plating, cargo space, manueverability etc are for the large part similar providing it's a ship in the same class. It's not so much ""design your own ship"" as it is ""find the one with the right weapon slots and put stickers on it"".The quests are the largest downfall for me here. Most of your time is going to be spent in autopilot taking object from station ""A"" to station ""B"", then report back to ""A"", or ""go blow up this one bad guy and come back"". There are a few exceptions, the fleet combat story missions are particularly noteworthy, and there is a cute quest about ""hacking"" which relies on actual programming knowledge to get through (non-required so no real penalties for failing, but refreshing to see a ""click through"" quest break the 4th wall in subtle way like this). The hopeful part is this: There are ways to improve customization using what is already in the game. Expanded skill trees, class-skills (even if passives like aforementioned mining skill), unique story options are all tools that could be used to diversify character development. Ship customization can be expanded upon with additional content. There are already a few interactive bits of ship design with modules like the EMP, more active and less passive options would make it feel much more unique. More and far more diversified ship frames will open up design space and has potential to actually allow players to make meaningful choices about the paths they will take in the game. Some of these fixes are already or will be made available through modding. But I can't in good faith recommend a game that needs mods to deliver on its promise. So, ""No"", for now.			"

												This game has everything I like in it. Spaceships, free exploration, trading, mining, missions, and an optional story. If you liked Privateer and always wanted a 2d version of Privateer, that's almost exactly what this game is. And that might be enough for some people. Unfortunately, the game is lacking polish in many respects. There are plenty of weapons, but aren't enough ships, engines, and shields to really create the kind of ship that will work well in the game. I think that the devs figured players would create these assets using mods, but the only mods out so far are cheaty ones. The economy is a bit off -- ships are a bit too cheap for what they are. There's no ties between resources being available and stations having more products or anything like that. Piloting needs some work. Colliding with NPCs is far too easy (in fact, it's the only maneuver some NPCs know). Most player ships can't turn fast enough or move their weapons fast enough to target NPCs without themselves striking NPCs. XP and leveling needs some work. Right now, the only way to level up quickly and easily is to shoot things. You can't level up easily by trading, hacking, or mining, except at the most basic levels. That might be because there are ways to break the system at later points in the game, but that just means that the system is weak and needs polish. There are distinct periods of boredom in between being able to do things in game. You finish the first couple of missions at level 3 or 4. You can't take on the next storyline mission until Level 10, and can't upgrade ships until Level 15. To get to level 15, you need to clear approximately two low-level systems of pirates. That's a lot of pew pew pew. And it's only reasonable to gain that XP by going pew pew pew, even if you classed as a miner or trader. I don't know right now if the game will age well and develop a following and some decent mods that will fix these problems. I haven't looked too closely at modding yet. There's a ton of promise here, but unless you're really grabbed by the story, there's very little good reason to play the game past the initial few hours.			"

												The developer needs to finish this and create an actual game before I can recommend it.  Great engine, decent multiplayer netcode, lots of potential, and super easy to mod, but a SEVERE lack of content (almost as if the developer expected modders to  complete the game for them), and a completely asnine multiplayer mode that makes playing past level 10 pointless BY DESIGN.  I was so excited after the first hour I set up a dedicated server and began pimping it to my gaming community.  By the second day playing it I'd done literally everything there is in the game.  Definitely regretting buying this one in its current state.			"

												Good:  Relatively inexpensive game.  Fun combat.  Great visuals.  Good RPG elements.  Good autosave.  Good replayability. I beat it three times and I think there is still at least one ending I haven't seen.  Supports mods.Bad:  Crashes to desktop for me about one in three hours of play or so, not a huge issue because it saves frequently.  The story telling overall is weak, even though quests often have interesting options.  Combat appears hard at first, but late in the game it's too easy if you power up everything and fly the best ship.If you are fan of games like Escape Velocity or SPAZ then you need to play this.			"

												I loved this game. Although others weren't, I was impressed witht eh graphics, and overall story options. They even include free deicated server software. Each of those features is great. However, unknown to me, or my friends, the multiplayer is NOT I bought a four pack to play this game with my friends, which we did and enjoyed every second, until it abruptly ended. Not even four quests in, the game tells us that we've reached the end of the possible multiplayer quest and can continue the game in single player to experience the rest of the story. What? This is a multiplayer game, but only a percentage of the game can be played in multiplayer mode? And it's not like I can transfer my character to a single player game, each server/game is a fresh start. Overall, I'm incredibly disappointed with the game. Yet another unfinished piece of work released and advertised as a full game. For shame.			"

												At the risk of sounding a litle too ""me too!"" I feel obligated to weigh in on this game. It has the potential to be great, and I love the art style and mimalistic UI, but it doesn't have enough rich content yet. If you read no further, wishlist this title and check on it from time to time. I don't think my ""no"" will stick forever.For those of you with longer attention spans, I'll expound a bit. VoidExpanse is the type of game I'm really wanting to sink my teeth into, but can't. Similiar titles in the genre include things like Spaz and Drox Operative (definitely check both of those out for similiar (but different) experiences. VoidExpanse gives you a nice-looking sandbox to play in, but doesn't give you all the toys necessary to have a good time. The skeleton is all here, but the experience feels empty a few hours in.  There simply isn't enough breadth/depth to what you can do to (or with) your character. The classes and ship options are fairly one-dimensional, and the quests are still pretty rinse and repeat. I'd love to see more dynamic quests involving attacks on space stations, some kind of hacking interface/skill tree, true smuggling runs, more interaction (even the ability to join) with the pirate faction, etc. The game just doesn't do interesting things with it's own universe yet.I love this game for what it is, and for the price point I'm still happy with my purchase, I'm just hoping that they take this brilliant foundation and build something atop it. I know there are countless ideas floating around the community - let's hope some of them see the light of day.			"

												The game, is so well made, is highly moddable and the developers are, if the game is a success, keen on continuing development to improve their game.In addition to this, the devs have really listened to the community. Discussions have been ongoing on the forums and when an idea was found good, it was implemented.New patches were delivered on a frequent base which showed the community that they really wanted to have a good game.During the beginning I was very into the single player storyline. After almost finishing it I was able to hand over a big list of bugs.After that they changed the storyline quite a bit and I have been trying to hold off finishing the game until they do the Steam release.In the meantime the devs asked the help of the community to test the mac/linux version, the Steam version and to help out ironing kinks in the dedicated server.Having been Greenlit on Steam they still took their time to make sure that when the game is available on Steam, that it delivers quality.Instead of putting the game on there the devs asked for feedback on if the game was ready, most of the answers were no and reasons were given. A few weeks later a patch came out with the additions that people said were necessary to get it on Steam.If people read this review I want them to understand that if they buy this game, that they not only buy an awesome game but that they are funding a game developing team that really creates games that have value. By buying the game you will make sure that VoidExpanse becomes more awesome and that they can make more games!			"

												I found this game to be very good indeed. So much to explore, so many quests, massive amount of researching, upgrading is fantastic, leveling up is great, fighting is challenging, trading all over the different stations, alien technologies can help you, the factions are all different, etc. I started this game going in not knowing what to expect and the game just took me in by surprise. I recommend to anyone that likes space shooters with a twist that goes deeper.			"

												Great combat, but suffer a massive downfall of a lack of content. Most of the playtime is used mostly travelling between space station. The content is lacking massively and the quest is excruciating painful to play and boring.I don't see the point of randomly generated world where there is barely anything you can do in it. You can destroy a pirate station but it doesn't effect anything in the game world, like making it safer and such. The faction doesn't grow or decrease in size with your interaction. You can't help your faction to setup new station nor they can be destroyed. Faction NPC do nothing but sit in station and just give a scripted quest (just ONE quest then they are useless forever). The astroid is static and doesnt move or dissapear when you mine. NPC pirates randomly added into the world but just stay there or chasing an npc freighter and then return to their spawn point and stay there indefinately.Trading is badly simulated as there is NO production station and NO demand station. Just the station price just change randomly change without making any sense. If you go to the capital system with 3 station you can make 200k+ just by trading between those station. There is no point to travel to the fringe station where you expect the demand is higher, but its not, everything is same price with the station you were on. Its just pointless RNG. (~_~) This ""Meaningful trading system involving trade routes and supply/demand simulation"" is a lie. sad face. I was really looking forward for this.In short, the world is dead, cold and pointless, with very few interaction. Nothing much to do but to follow the boring fetch quest. Great tech demo, but very far from a complete game like space ranger or SPAZ.I like the combat tho.			"

												I can't really speak to multiplayer as I haven't gotten into it yet but my solo experience thus far has been a lot of fun.I started out as a fighter, I knew that combat was going to be prevalent no matter where I went so I wanted a little head start in that department. After taking a good look at the skill trees I decided that I actually wanted most if not all of them so throughout my playtime I have been carefully managing what I invest in next. The game can be a little grindy, especially if you've *chosen* to grind as I have, but it's always felt rewarding. Getting that next skill, being able to buy and then use that shiny new hull or weapon or ship upgrade is satisfying.A lot of zones unfortunately feel a little empty. Filled to the brim with pirates and aliens and in some cases more asteroids than you can mine in half a day, yes, but still empty as from a certain standpoint they're essentially just waypoints to your next stop. Hopefully in the (near) future we'll have more interactivity with these places if the game evolves to a point where we can actually claim and populate them. Extended main storylines to send you to more places would be great, too. All the same, if you're in need of exp or loot to sell it's easy to just pick a zone whose agression level is close to yours and have at it.Storywise it's pretty solid. You'll have access to a few missions to raise your rep with three of the factions before you actually join any of them. The main quest for the two I've seen are pretty short but well written and the difficulty in terms of how aggressive the zones you'll be visiting is pretty steep so your first playthrough with a new character will feel a lot longer as you level and gear up. There are also missions you can do for the commander at any station you visit. They're selected randomly from a preset list and it's totally up to you if you want to accept them or not. I found that fact to be irritating as I was only really interested in bounty and mining missions, thankfully loudent2 published a mod that allows you access to the whole list so you can just pick the one you want. Much more convenient and a must if you ever get frustrated at the random factor.There are a lot of items and upgrades to choose from at the beginning, which is awesome, but as you get into the higher levels (I was 146 at the time of writing this... yes I was lazy and copy/pasted my three day old forum post. Deal with it :P) you'll find yourself invariably with the same set of gear as most people; primarily speaking a dark matter generator, a dimensional fuel tank, and either a Hammer or a Death Bringer hull. And lasers. Lots of love for the lasers :).This is where modding really adds more life to it all. Last week I wanted a (much) shorter range laser that did more damage, I made one. It uses way too much energy imo but I made it, I use it, and so do a few other people now that it's on the Workshop. Then I wanted a rapid fire ballistic weapon that shoots fireballs, made that too. It's a little OP for anything under aggression level 70 or so but it's fun all the same. Got tired of shields, made new armor plating. So my modding skills are amateurish at best but more importantly I'm having a good time doing it, even learned a thing or two about XML along the way. Taking that into consideration, there are a lot of other people writing fantastic mods for the game and publishing them fairly regularly, it's been just over two weeks and there are 50 items in the Workshop already (albeit some of them are translations and don't really affect the core gameplay but I imagine they took a LOT of work and it's quite appreciated to a lot of players). It feels like there's always some cool new user made content to check out and maybe take for a spin. Maybe even share a few of your own ;).All in all it's a great game. Simple yet very well written, looks fantastic, controls are solid, great support and frequent updates. It has a lot to offer both in terms of content and expandability and it's a lot of fun, right to the point where I started playing one morning and actually forgot to eat anything until mid afternoon. Definitely worth the pricepoint.Can I click yes twice?			"

												It's a work in progress. It has a lot of potential, but it should really be an early access title. It's definitely playable now, but pretty much everything needs either more work or more content. Load times for save games and new systems are pretty long. Combat is really repetitive (and you'll get used to it because it's the only sane way to level up). There are few options for ship and weapon, there are quite a few but generally only one at any given tier so it's ""oh I can afford the next ship/gun up I better swap them out."" Modders are adding content faster than the devs, but the devs set up modding so that once you use a save file with any mod it permenantly needs that mod to load, there is no removing it if say you don't like it or it completely breaks the game. Back up your save files.I was a die hard fan of the Escape Velocity games when I was younger and I really wanted a worthy successor to them in this game, but although many of the same elements are there pretty much all the things the EV series did right this title fails at. There's no real feeling of exploration because the procedurally generated systems are all identical other than color scheme and number/strength of bad guys. The storyline missions are uninspired and linear. And there aren't enough options in ships and outfits to make it feel like an inhabited capitalistic universe.I have hopes that enough of the rough patches will get ironed out as further patches come out that I feel like my money was well spent, but I'm not going to keep playing it while they fix it, and I can't recommend that you do either.

												The basics are there but this project is still in its alpha stages at best.Pros:-Interesting concept (sort of like a more real-time FTL with ARPG-like elements)-Attractive graphics and music-Game works well within the 1st 25 levelsCons:-After a few hours in (or beyond level 25), you realize that the game has offered everything it possibly can-Progress suddenly becomes repetitive and any updates are really shallow-Lots of random crashes for a ""finished product"" and issues with reloading your last save.-I found myself playing mobile games while I waited for my ship to make the many jumps from system to system (sometimes, you have to make as many as 13 jumps which can take up to 10 mins even with a highly-advanced ship)-Wonky auto-pilot and path-finding algorithm that ends up killing you almost 50% of the time-And when the auto-pilot kills you, you're teleported back to the very beginning of your path so you end up spending another 10 mins playing a mobile game!-Poor combat system that I bet sounded good on paper. For good strategic combat, you're better off with FTL. If you end up playing as a trader or miner, be prepared for BORING REPETITION!-Can't really see any replayability since most quests are procedurally generated and different character archetypes don't really mean anything except for the 1st few hours of gameplay.It's an OK game for its price tag but it's got a long way ahead of it before it becomes as immersive and addictive as some other similar titles out there. Here's hoping the devs can iron out some of the kinks and spend some time crafting some more varied missions.			"

												This game is OK.  If you haven't played a top down 2D space adventure game before, try Endless Sky on steam, it is free.  I don't mind playing reading games, and this game has a lot of text dialogue, so be warned.  The story is not terrible, but it is not that great either.  The graphics are not bad, they are actually quite decent for this genre.  There are a lot of side quests, but they aren't interesting like Space Rangers 2 HD.  The combat is so so, but becomes pointless when you get a good ship, late game weapons, and high level combat skills.  This game turns into a drive around simulator, and I got tired of autopiloting through repetative star systems and fighting the same 3 pirate ships over and over.  I mean, 99% of the galaxy seems to be pirate ships.  It stopped being fun after a few hours.If you are really considering this game, I recommend waiting for a steam clearance sale of 75% off or greater.  Somewhere under the $7 USD mark.  Space Rangers 2 HD is better, and Endless Sky is free.			"

												Very polished and extremelly dull game. Let me quote some guy words:.. The combat is best described as two dogs fighting on an ice rink...you slip and skate around and awkwardly line up shots at way too close a range ..How is it possible to invest so many hours into testings, graphics, design and completely forget about gameplay? Multiplayer is absolutely dead and I can tell you why: game become boring after playing just few hours. Beauteful background, smooth animations and.. there is nothing to do. Yes, you do quests, you get levels and money, but it feels pointless. AI is too primitive, Ship's design.. kek.. I have no idea what guys were thinking, best trading/mining ship hes such an ugly weapon placement, I wish designer to have a car with 5 wheels.. one at place of driver. Weapon selection is not that broad. Loot is pretty generic, from start of game you can get right into best tech sector.. where is slow exponentional progression???Not recommeded unless it costs 1$ because it's the game for two evenings max. Not the worst evenings tbh.			"

												Note: People who are comparing this to Space Rangers are simply out of their minds.This game is one of the few Top-Down Space Shooters that I actually found the core mechanics (like combat, maneuvering, control scheme, etc) fun and entertaining. Don't get me wrong on my veredict - I really loved this game's core mechanics.However there's not enough content or variety, at all! The universe is dead, and you're the sole adventurer and explorer of a place full of pirate ships that are spread around like MMO mobs, stopped in place for no reason.Civilian ships are nothing else than rare cosmetic sights and don't add anything to the game.It's definitely worth to be on your watchlist. But playing it will comprise of long grinding sessions, and long travels just to get a little bit of money.It is a little fun once you get a ship that's strong enough to clean a whole system in one go - but playing the game feels empty and pointless at this point.I can only hope that the developers will make more content and make the game at least a LITTLE alive - because their base game is actually well made, but it doesn't look like a finished product at all.AtomicTorch - you have my support to make this game a real thing. Until then I'm sorry, but I simply cannot recommend it.			"

VoidExpanse is a top down open world space sandbox game. You play as someone from the Far Colonies who flees from a farm world on a civilian spacecraft, but who that character really is, is up to you. The plot of the game relies on the fact that the Far Colonies are abandoned, after a hostile alien race is discovered. Therefore, it is up to you to fight this threat, if you choose to do so that is. One thing that surprised was the fact that even though this is a simple, yet good looking 2D game, ti has a very detailed video options menu and separate audio sliders, which is a big plus in my book.Intro:Before being thrown into the procedurally generated universe of VoidExpanse you’re able to create your own character. The game offers a good variety of options such as, hairstyles, accessories and other facial characteristics to customize your character portrait You also have the option to choose one of 9 different classes such as Prospector, Trader, Rogue and Adventurer, each one having their own unique starting bonuses and preassigned skills.Upon entering the game, if you go on the Character tab you can see your character experience points and skills. Here, you can also access the following categories: piloting, combat, social, industry and engeneering. Each one of these categories has its own unique skill tree which is also affected by the profession you choose during your character creation. That said, I’d recommend you to take your time and examine these and determine which kind of role you want to play. You can be a pirate, a trader, a miner, how you embrance this open universe is entirely up to you. Different skills will have very different applications, some will allow you to persuade certain characters and avoid conflict, others will improve your piloting and mining skills, while others are just required in order to use better gear.Right next to Character tab, you also have the System Map which is very easy to navigate. It allows you to see the various planets on your current system, asteroids, enemies, space stations as well as jumpgates. It also allows you to set your own navigation points which you can use as destinations for your autopilot. Beware though, your autopilot isn’t smarth enough to avoid pirates and other dangers so make sure you’re actually paying attention to the game while you’re taking advantage of this very helpful feature.Next up, if you go on the Star System Map, you can see different systems connected by jumpgates and also see each factions territory. If you go to the Factions tab you can see what kind of relations each faction has with one another. There are a total of 6 different factions, including the neutral faction. Each one of these systems has their own characteristics and some might have special events such as gas clouds or debris from past conflicts. Here you can also see each system tech and danger level. The higher the tech level of a system, the better items you can find there and the danger level of a system will affect how difficult are the enemies there.Of course, as with any space sandbox game, you also have your lovely inventory. Here you can check what items you currently have and see what different modules you have equiped. Still, the only items that you can equip outside a space station are consumables, such as mines and repair kits. Modules such as an engine, generator and shield require you to be inside a space station. It is also on the inventory window that you can check your cargo, this is where you’ll hold various types of goods such as ores and food.Once you enter a space station you’ll be able to refuel, repair and check various sections of the station. On the hangar you can change your ship parts and on the shop you can buy and sell items. The type of items that are for sale on the shop vary depending on the type of station you’re in. If you’re on a military station you’ll get access to more military gear and if you’re in an outpost you’ll get access to more ships. However, the type of items you’ll find in these shops also depends on the Tech level of the system. Finally, you can also go to the station decks. Here you’ll find people from various factions and their reactions towards you will depend on your reputation with that faction. Most importantly, you can take missions and talk with them. You can ask them about the various different factions, about events and locations, thus gaining some background information on the events that are taking place or that previously took place.If you pick up a quest you can check it on your Journal. Here you can also see failed and completed quests. Any progress made within a certain quest will also be shown here as well as the dialogue and story behind it.Gameplay:The overall gameplay is really fun. You move your ship with W, A, S, D, Q and E and you aim with your mouse. Combat is in real time and hip movement and maneuverability is really important here, because weapons on ships have an arc of fire and so, you should try to keep yourself out of the enemy range. This allows for some sort of agile combat that requires you to keep both your ship moving and your weapons aimed towards the opponent at the same time.Flying around on your spaceship and fighting enemies requires you to keep an eye on some key things. Your ship has several meters such as energy, shield and structure, as well as fuel which is pretty self-explanatory. The shield bar obviously represents what percentage of shield you currently have on your ship, if this reaches 0 you’ll start taking structural damage and if you manage to not get hit during a certain time, your shield will eventually recharge. The energy meter on the other hand acts as if it is your stamina bar. Firing weapons and mining, for example, uses energy so you can’t just spam your weapons and have to time your shots correctly. That said, you’re also required to be at a full stop when mining, and the same goes for when you’re looting a container dropped by an enemy.Combat and movement aside, the game pretty much plays as you want to play it. You can attack friendly vessels, you can hunt down pirates or any other faction or you can just make your fortune by mining asteroids and selling the ore at a nearby space station. You can help characters and join a faction and help them achieve their ultimate goal, or you can just ignore everyone and just do your own thing. Verdict:Open sandbox world, choose how to play your own game. e.g. be a pacifist or a soldierNice looking visuals with 3D effectsTons of ship customizationMod supportFun combatChill musicDead multiplayerI HIGHLY recommend this game to fans of spacefaring, space sandbox and space sims. If you enjoyed games like SPAZ or Space Rangers I’m sure you’ll have a great time with VoidExpanse!			"

												""space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement""  -  Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Californication I remember fondly my days as a child, staring up at the stars, wondering what it would be like to fly through space in my convertible space craft (I know, please don't tell me about how I'd die if my spaceship was convertible) letting the wind blow through my hair (I know, space doesn't have wind... well wait a second, does wind exist in space?  No.. no I don't think it does) turning on my favorite tunes, (driving along in my automobile, my baby beside me at the wheel.. stole a kiss at the turn of a mile) and kicking back enjoying the sites... (ok the only sites will be a vast sea of darkness with an occasional tiny white speck...) Although my thinking as a child was quite flawed, who hasn't wanted to gallivant through space, snapping necks and Cashing checks, like Brennan Huff and Dale Dobeck?  The answer is nobody, because this type of fantasy is what makes young children tick, it's what makes them climb out of bed at 7:45 in the morning, put on their best school uniform and rush out the door, heading towards a class room ugh 6 or 7 hours of boredom.   WHY!!!  So that one day they can grow up to be the first man to discover an Alien race, and then nail it!!!!Well that escalated quickly, lets try to forget what I wrote... oh what?  you can't forget it..  That's fine, lets put it in a box, lock it and throw away the key..  here goes my review for VoidExpanse.   I have to say that personally I loved VoidExpanse, a open world space exploration sandbox game.  If you want to be a billionaire miner...  dust off that monocle, if you want to be a pirate hunter, than arg matey, have at it.  If you want to fight off the hostile aliens Independence day style, get that cigar out and be ready to smoke it...   You have so many options available to, you can mold and shift the game to suit your desires or ambitions.  The only limitations will be the ones in your mind. Gameplay The game is a top down shooter, you can move your ship using the W,A,S,D, or you can use the arrows keys, nothing too uncommon with that.  ProTip - use Spacebar to bring your ship to a complete stop, very useful for trying to pull in containers, mine asteroids  or port with the various space stations.  The combat is a combination of frustration and exhilaration, you'll be frustrated as the limitations of the game's combat system and the gliding nature of your ship, it can take quite a bit of getting used to before you master.   The exhilaration will come when you finally master combat, blowing up every enemy pirate ship or base you come across.   The rest of the game play is pretty straight forward, mine asteroids for ores, loot containers from ships you've destroyed or that have been destroyed by others.   Questing, experience, and levels, you can acquire quests while docked in a space station, numerous quest exist, delivery, rescue, destroy, etc etc etc.  These quest will grant you experience, although quests aren't the only way to get experience, you'll get it from just about every action in the game, from mining ore, to fighting ships, you even get experience for selling certain ores.   The experience is used to level up, each level will grant you points, which you can use on skills..  Skills are the life blood of your character, they allow you to shape and alter how you'll play the game.   Many different skill combinations exist, it's best to thoroughly inspect and decide what skills best fit your play style, loads of different combinations exist, will you be a smooth talker who gets his way with non violence, or will you decide to let your lasers, missiles or chain guns do the talking for you, the possibilities are endless.  Going right along with skill customization will be your ship, you can outfit your ship with numerous different parts, want to travel further without having to return for fuel... buy yourself a new fuel tank, want to mine more ore before having to return to port and sell... get  yourself a bigger hull.  Feeling tired of getting picked on and assaulted by pirate ships.. upgrade those weapon systems and wreck pirates.  So many combinations of ship parts exist, from your lowly civilian parts to high tech military grade items.  What kind of ship will you build? Pro's Huge galaxy to exploreLots of customization optionslimitless ways to play the gamehours upon hours of gameplay Con's Game is kind of empty (although this is outer space)Combat is kind of frustrating Recommendation I'd highly recommend this game, it's loads of fun, a great big universe to explore, many quest to complete, and so many different ship and skill combinations to try out.   I'd suggest buying it now, why wait, you have a very large universe to explore..			"

												This is the first game in ages to grip my attention for as long as this one has. I like its simplicity, the graphics are nice and the combat is pretty fun. For me, I find I can just relax and fly around shooting and selling stuff to my hearts content!While I do think the overall content of the game really needs padding, as there is a lot of repetition, this game has so much potential to be brilliant! I look forward to the next major patch to see what the devs come up with. Definitely one to keep an eye on if you're not willing to buy it yet!			"

												At first I thumb down because of bugs. The devs fixed these bugs. the game is pretty outstanding and has some great replay value. I do wish there was a few more ships to chose from and also some more lore would be nice.As it is, the game is really really fun to play. No level cap, bunch of skills to get. 1 kinda secret ship upgrade you can get. Oh yeah and black holes are a thing in this. Don't use your auto pilot near a black hole . . . just dont.Mineing space rocks is fun.Killing everything is also fun.10/10 a solid game to kill some time until the fall games come out.			"

												You gain experience when you kill other ship, complete quest and mine the astronut. You invest your skil point to the skill trees more than SPAZ. If you set the world to the most wide, there will be exatly 100 galaxies. You will through warp gate to go other galaxy like X3. One galaxy means just one map. You can't travel to each planet like X3. You have to through warp gate by your self or using the auto pilot. There is no jumpdrive like X3. There is no SETA (special funtion in X3), but there is cruise mode which move straightly very fast.There are 3 main factions, mitilitary, traders and religions. There are 2 enemy factions alliens and parates. Every factions share the raputation with all of the galaxies unlike SPAZ. You use W,A,S,D and Q,E to move your ship. You use mouse cursor to aim. You can set the specific mouse button for fire each weapons which you installed. There are three main type of weapons, energy ,ballistic, explosive, but each weapon types have many kind of weapons. You can install Engine, Thruster, Shield, Fuel tank, Weapons, Special devices such as mining device, Boosters with special function, Grasper (like tractor beam) to your ship.Pros.You can customize your own ship. (less variation than SPAZ)Infinite level up.There is huge skill tree systems. (much more than SPAZ)Various quest lines. (more than SPAZ)Various weapons. (more than SPAZ)Cons.There is few device tech. (less than SPAZ)There is no jumpdrive which means you will take too much time to travel. (imagine that travel without jumpdrive in X3, only use the SETA)Fixed turret species for specific hull. (less variaty to customize your ship)(e.g. hull 'A' has one of the energy turret socket, you have to install the energy weapon there, you can't install ballistic weapon on there. It means if you want to use energy weapons, you have to use hull 'A'. You may don't have choice) "

VoidExpanse is a hybrid sort of RPG/Strategy with bits of Simulation mixed in that takes place in a sci-fi space environment.  The level of different options available right from the start would qualify it as a sort of open world or sandbox style even, on a fringe sort of level, but nonetheless it certainly would qualify as such.ProsI've had a lot of fun leveling up.  The skills seem very worthwhile to get, and it's hard to decide on what I would like to work on next.  Level requirements of future upgrades can help in determining the order I want to go in though.I love the way the star systems are put together.  The combat is fairly easy so far, which I like.  Once I got some levels up, and better customized my ships.  Took time to get used to the ships too, but I am now able to use them fairly well, out of what I've tried thusfar.I enjoy the graphics and the music is nice as well.  I find it relaxing, and it doesn't get on my nerves like some games can tend to do after playing a while.Exploration has been a good thing too.  I'm still unsure how to progress, and which quests are more important for moving the story along.  They do seem to have symbols next to them in the journal.  Some of the ""filler"" quests are obvious, but they are good for the money and experience as well.  ConsI would like a little bit more variety as far as weapons and ship selection.  Maybe more can come about in the future?  There might be more I haven't seen yet as well.I think there are not enough types of quests.  You start to see the same ""filler"" ones appear again and again as you visit various star systems and base planets.I wish I were able to keep track of where things were in my storage areas in different star systems.  It's something I've had a difficult time retracing, especially in a medium to large sized system.I have seen a couple of small grammatical errors already, but they aren't too glaring, or anything so bad I cannot easily interpret what is being said, so I will sort of give a pass in that case.  Doesn't destroy the flow of the game, and I know I make my own from time to time, so not a huge deal.  I did notice a couple though.I'd definitely rather have several saves to utilize, and not a single one that autosaves often.  I like going back and trying different things, so having a single save per game is sort of a killjoy for me, personally.Early gameplay, and Other ThoughtsSo, I started my first game as a prospector, and got a few missions at the base it starts you at.  I destroyed a ship and got some crates, and I was pretty happy about that!  I venture a little further out, and I see several red marks on my radar, so I figure I would investigate.  Not Smart! I was toasted pretty quickly, so I lost some stuff, which was a letdown, but I had it on normal, as I wanted to get used to the basics of the game, so not a huge deal...  Just had to pay some money to get my ship back in working order, and off I went again on a different mission.  Luckily, this one was a straight shot with nothing in the way, and I finished it with no problems.  Level up!  Picked my traits, then while choosing what I wanted to level, I noticed I had some nice skills in my tree for mining...  So of course, the idea popped in my head, and I got a little tool in the shop to mine stuff from the asteroids, and started doing that.  Was getting decent experience from going out and back again, but I didn't  have much cargo room.  Still the experience plus the profit was a nice little side job to work on getting better parts, and so that became my focus for a little bit.  I'm glad there are different options like this for somebody to do based on where they are strong or weak after starting attributes.  A little over ten hours in now, and I've had a lot of fun leveling up so far, and the selection of various skills has really augmented my gameplay experience.  Some are pretty important, and others are more related to ones playstyle.  I don't sense a hard cap for level, but maybe there is at some point.  So far it's not very tough to level.  I wish there were more variety in what you can buy, and the variety of random filler quests could use a little bit extra quests, instead of running into many similar quests that you quickly begin to recognize.  I've run into the same ones many times, and I'd like to see more down the road.Despite having more cons than pros, the strength of the pros, and also the fact that I grouped some of the pros into multiple parts gives them an edge.  I am really enjoying this game!  I will probably continue on as neutral, and see where that takes me.  Maybe that has something to do with why I cannot figure out how to move along with the story.  Anyway, so far I highly recommend the game.  I enjoy the RPG system, and the other elements work well in conjunction with the overall gameplay experience.** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.  This had no impact on my rating** "

												I personally think for a casual gamer this is great.It reminds me of a top down basic version of frontier elite and freelancer. For a casual gamer this is great as you can dip in and out of the game with ease. Also having the open world approach means if you want to go off and do your own thing then you can and come back to the story later. Your not overloaded with stats and the customization element is still in the game. Its not got a steep learning curve and if I was asked to recommend this to someone who is a casual gamer then I would.I can't say I've spend a large amount of time on the game but so far I am enjoying this. Hope this helps as I have never written a review on a game before and thought I would for once take the time.Hint - you can wait near a jump gate and every second ship will be a pirate. The turrets will take down most of their shields which leaves you to destroy them to gain experience and their loot. I've got some awesome tech/components this way to get me started.Enjoy			"

												Reminds me a lot of an old game called ""Solar Winds"", but done in more of a Freespace 2 style in top-down.This game is a lot ""friendlier"" than the 'X' series of space sims with a much less brutal learning curve, although (at this time) you also can't expand as far as with 'X'... the difference is comperable to ""Terraria"" versus ""Minecraft"", both are great games and one is clearly in the spirit of the other, but they're also great games for entirely different reasons. This is an excellent little game for the price, easy to jump into and put lots of hours in, the combat is simplistic yet nuanced, the interface is simple but elegant, and there's plenty of exploring to be had.The game also has an active modding community that adds a steady stream of new content, with obligatory Star Wars and Star Trek ships (screw it, load 'em both and see for yourself which ships are better).  I'm not done with the game yet, but after about 10 hours I can say it was worth grabbing.  Highly recommend.			"

												A surprisingly fun and addictive top-down space-shooter. It initially reminded me of an age-old classic, ""Operation: Inner Space"" - a game which shares some things in common with this. Under the hood it is actually great fun to play. It has skill trees, levelling up, ships, equipment and all the things you would typically associate with a space game.The addition of multiplayer and mod support make this game shine - and is where the fun is at. You can host a persistent world and play with your friends for some fun and interesting space-adventures. You can become a hero or a pirate in a game world that is huge - and can be randomly generated to keep it fresh.In a nut shell, it is Operation: Inner Space meets Freelancer. It's also a great little game.Jimbo Rating: 7/10			"

												I'm generally a fan of this genre of game, notionally the ""privateer"" style game where there is space based action/combat along with RPG elements.  I played about 18+ hours prior to this review.   This game contains a bit more of the RPG than some, but it's presentation is extremely basic...a dialog screen that list who at a given location you may talk to.   Interaction is fairly straightforward after that.  There exists a very large skill web to populate, but not a great deal of content to use to level up...so its the same 4-5 quests (kill the pirate, get some ore, deliver a message, rescue some stranded civies, or buy and deliver some goods) over and over, or mining ore for cash and xp.  The music is repetitive, the AI voice (computer on your ship) becomes anoying fairly quickly, and the main quest requires digging through a good bit of text (repeated by a large number of ""characters"") to comprehend and follow.   There are a number of factions, and I've focused on one thus far (order).  The route planning is attrocious, and given the dependance on autopiloting built into the game, the route planner has gotten me killed MANY times, mostly due to the fact it can't seem to go around an asteroid, so that the most boring parts of the game require your attention.  Ultimately, this along with the repetitive nature of the other elements makes this a ""not recommended"" game.  If you're looking for a similar game, done much better, go play Rebel Galaxy.			"

The only change is the location, where you take and perform tasks. There are another types - buy and move some cargo, get some minerals (or just buy it on the station, where u obtained this task =\).-Main quest is like find 1 thing, that will give you the opportunity to go through the jump gates and go kill big boss. Over.-A half-empty system-Very little opportunity for customizationSo, this game is a waste of time and money. A kidna of parody on sapce rangers, but but much worse.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game in spite of it's shortcomings. It lacks polish, there's not many ship or items, and in spite of you having ""frigates"", all ships feel more like small fighters (no crew or significant size differences). No carriers and no (proper) fighters make all the units in the game feel more or less ""small"". The planets are totally unimportant, as you only interact with them if you take a mission, and then only to click on them and get XP.Unlike Endless Sky, trading is shallow and quickly got boring (for me).In spite of all those shortcomings, combat and controll are good, the interface is nice and the graphics well crafted. Also there's MOD support (not that many good MODS, sadly). I give this game a thumbs up, but there are better space RPGs out there (SPAZ, Endless Sky).Also, I appreciate the Linux support.			"

												A decent foundation that works well enough and looks pretty has sadly had little to nothing built on top of it, with a severe shortage of content, narrative, or depth. In addition I was annoyed by some bizarre design decisions, like not letting you transfer online characters across servers.Various examples of laziness/poor design put into this game:Tiny amount of ships, with half of them just 'V2s' of existing onesNo introductory cutscene or any voice actingThe proceedural generation leads to a lifeless, dull and repetitive universeToo hard when startingConstantly attacked by pirates, yet killing them gives no money and a pittance in experience, rarely do they drop loot and most of the time that sucks too. If you save a merchant from being killed by pirates they just fly off and don't even acknowledge you.All NPCs have the same dialog outside of specific quests or questions related to their faction.And so on. Lazy lazy lazy, doubt I'll play again, and on top of that it crashes semi-regularly. Do yourself a favour and get Space Pirates and Zombies instead.			"

												It's a good little space game as long as you don't expect perfection. By that I mean it has trading, but not a 'live' economy. Yet, it's still involved enough that a little planning is involved. It also has mining which is well worth doing. So, no, not perfect but still much better than some space games that add things like trading or mining as an afterthought. It also has rpg elements, exp and gaining levels. This part is very well done. All the skills are useful. I've gotten a character past level 60, haven't regretted any skills I got and desire to get the rest. There's no level limit as far as I know and I think it's possible to eventually get all skills. That takes time, though, but any decent space game is going to give you a good reason to spend time with it. Yet to complete the main story, but I want to. I usually spend too much time with all the other things to do. I've even jumped into an enemy system with a powerful ship and attacked their merchant ships and patrol ships for kicks. There's also aliens and alien ships. Those were interesting. I won't spoil anything. So, no it's not a perfect space game. But, to be perfectly honest, I have yet to see a space game that was absolutely perfect every area. If you like 2d space games well enough then VoidExpanse is well worth $15 in my opinion.			"

												Ah, Space... it seems like space games are having a whole new renaissance these days. VoidExpanse is one of those games that sounds very simple, and even looks very simple. So, you start up a new game, and start mucking about, and then realize what feels like half an hour later that you've somehow lost several hours. The skill trees, the different ship hulls that actually FEEL like different ships, instead of just looking like them, and the fun of the combat... I'll be blunt: This game isn't a shiny polished AAA title. It has some quirks, particularly in the dialogue. However, VoidExpanse gets it right where it actually counts: It's fun to play, and the developers have a love for the game and community that shows in their continuing efforts to constantly improve and even expand the game. Lurler and co at Atomic Torch have built not just an excellent 2D space sandbox, they've built a devoted community, and the beginning of a reputation as a stand-up group of talented developers that actually care about their fans. Putting the developer and community aside, though, let me explain the game, since that's what's actually being reviewed. Firstly, you won't play the same exact game twice, even if the main story(ies) don't radically change. VoidExpanse is a 2D space sandbox kind of game in the vein of Space Rangers, Solar Winds, or (to a lesser degree) S.P.A.Z. You start off customizing you character portrait with a number of options (which can be expanded via workshop), pick a trade/class which will allot your starting skills, and then start off in a low-tech backwater space base. The game has a pretty low learning curve, and piloting your ship will become natural very quickly.There are two primary things that will determine your playstyle: 1) your skills, which will establish everything from what kinds of ship hulls you can pilot, how well you can pilot them, what kinds of weapons you can use, how well you can use those weapons, the types of trade and dialogue options available, what types of equipment you can use, and how efficient everything from mining lasers to fuel are. 2) your ship hull, which will determine cargo capacity, speed, maneuvering, and types of weapon mounts.You can spend your time just following the main story, and only doing odd jobs, trading, or mining as needed to upgrade your equipment as needed, or you can bum about as a space miner and make your fortune hunting rare ores to sell to the highest bidder. You can establish trade routes, become a bounty hunter... it's up to you. Granted, the actual variety of missions can be limited, but there are a few standout side missions that are truly unique. If you like the idea of a 2D space sandbox, they don't get much better than this. It has some flaws, but it delivers a solid and engaging experience, and is just loads of fun to play.Oh yeah... and you can play online. Just saying.8/10			"

												A wonderful game that combines RPG elements, open world and customization with the theme of space. Void Expanse is a game that is worth the cost and time by using many simple but influencing mechanics to turn this game into an interesting bunch of gameplay!GameplayGameplay-wise this game definitely deserves some thumps up! It is easy to handle, the tutorial is well explained and the controls are easy as well. The way this game works is pretty much 'WASD' for movement and mouse for aiming and firing, similar to space pirates on zombies if you know this game.GraphicsGraphics are simple, not too much resource consuming and can basically be played on a toaster. I used my old laptop which sure is a crappy PC and the fact that the game ran on 40 FPS on low graphic settings is quite surprising.MechanicsThis game uses various mechanics like factions, skill-trees, customization and randomized generation of galaxies, some multiplayer functions, a story mode and a way to continue the story. Join a faction and play their story mode which gives you the opportunity of playing unique missions (though, the last few ones are the same as the final task always leads to the hive destruction). The skill-tree is well made and the customization is good enough for me to find a lot of combinations.final opinion&RatingGameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7.5/10Mechanics: 8/10Content: 7/10Final: 8/10A game i would play again once there is a DLC available :) "

												It's a fine game with space pirates, aliens and a story! I went through the first quests, got my ship, and saved somebody's♥♥♥♥♥from prison. But yeah, quests is not the only thing there is to do: you can mine asteroids, hack stuff, and (not my most preferable gameplay) get yourself a transport ship and get some money by trading stuff. And of course there's much fun of  killing pirates! and aliens! and pirates!			"

												Void Expanse is a nice game, maybe not ambitious enough but still fine. The developpers are some of the best and most active i've seen, really open to community, and they already did a lot according to players feedback. They will do more, as they intend to continue developpement, even if it's released already, unlike many others.			"

												Overall: Hesitant dislike.  Kinda fun, kinda meh, lots of grinding, very empty; overall lands on the negative end, if only barely.It's a somewhat fun game, but spread too thin.  In the end I had some fun, but many game sessions felt unwholesome because of all the padding and time-wasting that diluted the experience.  It's also begging for content, so I'd recommend checking out lots of mods to enrich the experience; I now regret playing the game in its original form.TL;DR: It's kinda fun, but a very thin and grindy experience.  If you're looking for a time waster, it'll be fine for that; if not, it will feel very frustratingly slow and underwhelming.  I still feel an awful, kinda gross, unsatisfied sensation, even after beating it.  Like the time was very poorly spent.  :(  So keep that in mind when considering a purchase!There's very little story, and very few actual missions beyond the random ones the base leaders give you (and those are insubstantial).  Most of your time is spent traveling, whether on unsatisfying fetch or delivery quests, or traveling across half the galaxy to reach your quest again after a death.  The last few quests I did had a ton of travel from one corner of the galaxy to the other; very boring, even in the alien areas where the enemies were actually dangerous.  I did a medium sized galaxy and I recommend you try a small, simply to drop that travel time padding.Combat is somewhat fun, but it does feel awkward.  You're fighting foes who have the computer's good aim, but you need to aim manually and this makes many of the weapons awkward and impractical to use.  You need to figure out how to move with your weapon to land even a fraction of the hits, and enemies don't appear to be limited in ammo like you are.  I also figured out early on that energy weapons are the way to go -- instead of a limit of 20 shots, you turn your entire fuel tank into ammo, and you just need a powerful generator to keep your energy levels stocked.  If I remember right, for solid ammo, the game is extremely stingy with refill items for some reason, so you'll have to return to base constantly to stock up again; this is bad for longer missions, mining ventures, etc.The skill tree is almost entirely made of tiny stat upgrades, making you turn or strafe or cruise slightly faster, or do slightly more damage with a weapon type.  A few skills unlock better equipment, and one skill (persuade) adds dialog options in quests, and the rest are tiny, incremental stat boosts; very sterile.  For that reason the skill tree feels very unexciting... yes you make your ship work better, but with my level in the 60s it was only about 25-50% better in a select few areas.  And I had to focus in those areas to do it.  The game begs for that tree to be stuffed with new abilities in combat, mining, and quests, differences in *kind* instead of just differences in scale.Also it's a little frustrating that the starting classes are not even -- some simply have way more free skill points assigned at the start of the game.  You should play the class that has the most skills you like, but also the most skills total that you plan on taking... and that means doing some google searching.That's one example of how the game feels like it lacks balance, polish, and content.Did I enjoy it?  Yea, it was okay.  But man was it a slow grind, and I feel like a different game might have done a better job.  I walked away from this game multiple times because I felt crappy after playing it, because the experience had been so grindy and empty.  It's an awful feeling.What's impressive is the good parts were just good enough to leave me nostalgic, and I returned to finish the story.  It actually feels like they were planning a bigger game, ran out of time/budget, released what they had with plans for later expansions, but then had to abandon it when the negative reviews rolled in.  And that's tragic, because there's a lot of potential here, but overall the experience is diluted, grindy, and unsatisfying.  :(Last of all, multiplayer: I played briefly with friends, but we drifted away from the game because if felt so empty, and didn't lend itself to non-combat playstyles.  Players who primarily wanted to trade or mine, for example, felt very disused.  I hear the game cuts you off after a few missions (you can only continue in single player), but we didn't get that far, so I can't say whether that's still the case.  Maybe worth a look, especially with mods?			"

												I've only played the game for a handful of hours in one sitting so far, but I honestly don't see how this game doesn't have better reviews.   Maybe a lot of the negative ones are older ones from early access.It reminds me quite a bit of Space Pirates and Zombies.   Better in some ways, worse in others.   Is it amazing?  Maybe not.It's only $5 on sale right now, even if you only play it once, it's a cheap bit of entertainment.    I've seen a lot worse games for sale for a much higher price.    Considering this game has sold relatively few copies and the devs haven't abandoned it makes me feel decent about supporting them, even if I only play the game a couple times.			"

												The game designer chose to make character progression unrewarding with tons of small upgrades that don't do much and so few points that the changes aren't large even over a character's career. The UI is poorly designed with lots of unnecessary scrolling on the character progression page and the gameplay is Space Rangers, but zoomed in super close and with fewer options. Plus, there is very little inertia (in space there is none, but sci-fi usually allows for nav-computers simulating some inertia with reverse thrusters to make gameplay less tedious). If you LOVE Space Rangers, then go play that again. . .  if you're bored with it, then okay, maybe you are the person who should get this. Everyone else should stay away.			"

												An interesting 2d top down space sandbox with elements resembling single ship space pirates and zombies, Eve, and a little system shock 2, replete with that new-car indie smell.You generate a galaxy, pick what class's skill package you want to start with, and are dropped in the starting system and offered a tutorial. There are a variety of ship types and weapon types to choose from, various techs to find, and a number of factions of varying difficulty to join.How you gain experience and money is up to you; You can visit stations and talk to npcs to try and get odd jobs,go around hacking old alien ruins floating around for stuff to sell/turn in for science points,go around fragging pirates randomly,trading goods between stations,or hunting down valuable resources hidden in asteroids.The combat has been harkened in other reviews to be like ""Ice skating motorcycle duels"" and that's KINDA true. It's more remenicent of 2d top down naval battles, where each of your weapons have their own arcs and you have a radar you can use to fight things off screen with guided weaponry, and you're sliding along space trying to avoid getting shot up too hard. It's ok.My only gripe is that it's easy to get in over your head, and dying isn't the end, and the game is very grindy.See, the game constantly autosaves, and you aren't allowed to make your own saves. The game is effectively ironman, so if you die then you die. You get deducted a small amount of money and are respawned inside the nearest friendly station. This may sound like a good thing, except for your super expensive investiture of a ship being completely gone for good as well as its contents. You have to buy up the (thankfully free) civilian junk and start from scratch. It's a lot like EVE in this way.Which has the major downside of runing into the grind wall that the game seems to be.  You get such a small trickle of money for the effort that you put into the game that it often is faster to just start a new galaxy and start from scratch rather than grind from a civ ship back up to where you died. There's also a few interesting mods on the workshop, most are russian with (mostly) english translation.			"

The game really shines with a few mods to add hulls, patrols and equipment. 30+ hours and still playing casually yet have never finished the campaign, I have spent most of my time creating new characters and doing my own thing.

												Really fun space RPG. Good if you want to kill lots of space badguys. Good if you want to kills lots of space goodguys. Good if you want to space truck and look at pretty space backgrounds while listening to pretty space music.The classes feel more or less unique with room to branch out of your chosen speciality. Decent amount of ships, especially with the workshop, same can be said about weapons and equipment. Not much in the way of story elements tying the quests together. The mainquest is to go kill the aliens over there. Despite the lack of fluff the game pulls of a great atmosphere. If this game had 10X more stuff in terms of story, quests, items, etc. it would be one of the best games every made. I hope it gets more love from the devs in the future.There is room for improvement. The multiplayer could be a lot better, setting up a server should be as easy as pushing a few buttons, and joining the servers of strangers often means the main quest is mostly done. Perhaps some sort of replayability mechanic for the open servers.Play it, love it, get your friends hooked.			"

												This game melds great elements of a Star Control II, Pirates!, and Space Rangers 2 experience. While it doesn't have the depth of any of the aforementioned, it still puts them all together into a solid, tight, entertaining package over and above its price tag.The RPG elements are simple but meaningful (the emphasis on a specific player and attributes is welcome and refreshing)The buying/selling/mining is simple but satisfyingThe combat is standard fare to a degree, but I do like the strong correlation between purchasing better items and seeing them *act* like better items on your ship. The pacing is strong (the tutorial/initial missions are not elaborate, just directed enough to teach you what you need to know in poignant and terse terms).For its current price, it's eons above other fare. I've heard it compared to Endless Sky, but I disagree strongly with the parallels. Endless Sky is a baby carriage compared to the Maserati that is VoidExpanse. "

												It's a fun little game. Surprisingly, a lot of games in this genre are incapable of doing it right as this one has. I have no idea why, as you'd think such a simple concept wouldn't be that hard to grasp. Apparently it isn't for a lot of devs. You get to fly a variety of capital ships in the game each outfitted with a different array of turreted energy weapons, gauss guns, missiles, or mines. Every aspect of the game, from running missions to trading goods feels enjoyable and not like a grind at all.You can build your character any way you like and there are at least a couple factions to join. That said, the factions available really suck and don't really offer much except a simple, cliched story. The factions themselves are written from an unlettered perspective in all honesty, but whatever, it's a game. While it would be nice to see someone well versed in academic political or economic thought writing for them instead of someone whose knowledge of these subjects doesn't surpass grade school, it doesn't detract from the gameplay.It's definitely worth a buy at full price if you enjoy games like Space Rangers, Elite: Dangerous, or the X series.

												Very enjoyable Real Time 2-d Newtonian Physics Space game.  After playing SPAZ to death and getting tired of the wait for SPAZ 2, I went on the hunt for other games in this genre only to be surprised that there really isn't a whole lot of new stuff.  A lot of old games, but not many new ones, the only other new one that is similar is Starfarer and it doesn't have nearly as satisfactory of combat.  This game isn't perfect, there are a lot of ""sameness"" in the levels and missions, but it definitely captures the lure of fast paced moderately deep combat with a lot of expansion both in character and in ship/weaponary.  The storyline is meh, but not really a huge concern here (Alien menance + Pirate menace + Factions trying to save humans seperately)			"

You pick a 'class' when you start a game, although you can put your hard earned skill points in any part of the skills tree regardless of the class you picked. There are 4 factions :-Order: Kind of a military dictature.-Freedom: Capitalists, traders, mercenaries,.. -Fanatics: Religious fanatics.-Pirates.You can travel freely in the game, doing quests lines or trading or mining or shooting. It's really up to you how you choose to earn xp and money. One detail (important for power gamers): there is no level cap.Other than that, it's pretty much standard regarding ship hulls, modules and weapons; with the exception of some cool equipments.			"

												I'm only 4 hours into this so take this for what it's worth. As an initial impression, the game doesn't feel to have significant depth. That said, I don't think that takes away from the overall game itself. This particular genre and playstyle is slowly becoming crowded but VoidExpands stands out on its own and is actually fairly enjoyable even if it does lack the depth and versatility of open world games. It's not going to win any awards for graphics but again, the game displays well and I see what I need to see to get the tasks at hand done. There is descent ship variations and different weapons loadouts. There are multiple factions to play with / against (I've only messed with Order and Freedom so far) but other than missions and random battles, there doesn't seem to be much to that (yet). The story is a bit weak and stereotypical - bad guys in space, save us (or destroy). Despite the basic flaws, fundamentally the game is complete and entertaining. It doesn't have the polish or glam of a AAA title but it's fun, I keep coming back to it in :30 increments (actually a plus, you can play for 15-20 minutes and actually do something) and the flexibility in how you earn money is nice. However the game does seem combat focused so while you can be a miner or fighter or freighter, the game seems mostly focused on blowing up those you deem your enemy.			"

												It's okay.  I feel like it is not complete.  Here's one example, the ship types:Light Frigate,  Heavy Frigate.  Light Cruiser. Heavy Cruiser. No Battleship?  No Carrier?  The entry ports on the stations are clearly big enough to fit much bigger ships.  I think they just never got around to adding them.Another example, there isn't a heavy cruiser with cargo size greater than 100(the minimum.  So if you were planning on leveling up in the mining or the trade skill trees, don't bother.  You either get a top tier ship or the ability to mine/trade.  But not both.  Adding a heavy cruiser class freighter just seems obvious(they have cargo ships for the other ship sizes) but I guess they never got around to it....And it seems like there are 6 booster slots in the interface, but no ships that have more than 4?

Introduction:VoidExpanse is a Top-Down, Open World Space RPG with a branching story line. With the ability to define how big your universe may grow, this game can take you quite some time to fully explore. As an added bonus, since the universe is procedurally generated, you will never experience the same universe twice in a row. The game has a beautiful backdrop which can make each system look and feel somewhat unique. The character portraits being randomized for non-key NPCs also add a refreshing new feel to each replay of the game. The ships have enough detail and varietie for this style of art to make them visually appealing as well. The sounds are fairly standard, but they work fine for this game.Gameplay:There are many different character options to choose from at the start of the game. You customize your character portrait as well as your starting Class. Starting Classes just give you a head start down their related Skill Trees, however as you play, it is completely feasible that you could max out every Skill Tree.Skill trees are the games way of locking you out of content that would otherwise make you too powerful to start with. Luckily, early on it is easy to gain levels so you can quickly unlock better ships and weapons that you may need to progress. This system does have a bit of a drawback though. When playing through one of the factions, I was told I had to destroy enemy space stations using a custom missile that I was issued. This is where a major issue occurred for me. Since this was my second play through, I had opted to play as a miner/trader who operated a freighter. My freighter was only a middle tier ship that had medium pulse lasers. My ship wasn’t designed to fight and didn’t even have a bay that could support a missile let alone a level 3 one. It was simply equipped to defend against a single attacker or a few lower class attackers while making its escape. I had almost maxed out my energy weapons, Industry (mining), Social (trade skills) and my Piloting (to enhance cargo space and speed) skills. This meant I had not focused anything on the other weapon types or heavier hulls. I had bought myself a very heavy beam only Death Bringer ship for making runs into the Alien space and the heavy pulse weapons for it… but didn’t have the skills to fly it yet, was still working on that. At this point I knew I was either screwed or I was in for one heavy grind. I needed to be able to get enough skill points to unlock level 3 Missiles, heavier hulls and the money to buy the ship and everything I needed to equip it properly. I had to do tedious filler missions given by the random stations while doing mining runs to raise the experience and money required. Days later, I finally had my heavy ship loaded to the teeth with everything including my missile. This made blowing up those Alien space stations even more satisfying because of the effort I had to put in to it. As mentioned, there are plenty of customization options for this game. There are quite a few different ships to choose from, each with its own loadout slots and statistics. It would be nice if there were a few omni-slot ships that let you customize it exactly how you want, but using the ones already in game works. There is an even wider assortment of weapons to choose from plus the critical ship systems and subsystems that can also be customized. The numbers of configurations you can make are almost limitless. This, along with the aforementioned procedural generation of the selectable size universe helps to make each replay unique. One feature I like is the fact that your character isn’t a miracle worker. If you find yourself a better weapon floating in the debris of the ship you just vaporized, you can’t just slap it on to your ship and fly off merrily on your way. You have to get to a space station and dock with it in order to adjust critical components of your ship. Really the only thing your pilot can do while out and about is to reload the consumable things such as hull repair or shield energy. This is a rather good decision on the Developers part as it adds realism to the game. It actually makes it a little more exciting to know that if you don’t survive the trip back to the nearest space station, your new found prize will be lost when you explode. Why might you want to replay the game? Well after the introductory area, there are three factions all looking to take you in as a recruit. Once you determine which faction you want to join you can seek out their recruitment officer. The recruitment officer of course doesn’t let just anyone join, you must prove yourself worthy of their cause. This is where the story lines diverge. Once you are in a faction you will have to stick with that choice until the end of the game. The end mission will be changed to suit the faction you are a member of, be it to blow the aliens out of their part of the galaxy, find a way back home, or finding a way to pacify alien hostility. Unfortunately, once you finish the starting area and do all the efforts required to join a faction, when you are really ready to get going, the game hits the home stretch and ends shortly after. This game relies on the fact you have to do the generic missions, hunt enemy (or if you are a jerk, friendly ships) and mine in order to gain experience and money. This works great early on but becomes a very heavy and barely rewarding grind in the later portion of the game. The deeper into the Alien territories you go, the heavier their resistance becomes. You will quickly find yourself swarmed with ships at a far higher level than you. Another issue I had is if you take a jump gate then look at your map too long, you will find a swarm of pirates zoning in behind you and almost killing you before you can move. Death is also unforgiving and what it takes from you is based on what difficulty setting you took at the beginning of the game when generating your universe.Another thing that pads out gameplay is travel time. Often you will find the mission provider and the mission system are separated by a vast distance. You then need to fly there with the assistance of Jump gates to link systems together… but unfortunately there is not usually a direct route. You will have to pass through each system that separates you and your destination dealing with any hostiles that may decide to attack you. You also need to watch your fuel levels or you will find yourself having to limp home at a low speed. Overall, there is plenty to do in VoidExpanse. It is a fun enough game that you might find yourself replaying it just to see how the story ends for each of the factions. Pro:Highly customizable ships, equipment, and weaponsProcedurally Generated Universe so it is different each time you playMultiple Factions helps enhance replayabilityPlay it how you want for the most part. Be a trader, a miner, a bounty hunter, a pirate or any combination of the above Cons:Must do introductory level each time you do a fresh restartA lot of grinding is required to survive late gameRepetitive filler quests used solely to help you level up and gain money. You find the same few quest types no matter where you go. Kill this pirate, rescue this crew, or deliver this cargoA lot of flying around between systems to get from point A to B then back to A again. Very time consuming and gets old. Would be nice if you could just radio in that you finished the mission rather than flying half way across the galaxy again just to turn it inAble to spend skill points in such a way it can mess you over later in the game. It’s fixable but you will need to grind to do it  "

												I ended up completing the campaign in about 16 hours. After that there was a 'New Game +' mode that didn't hold my interest for long. I considered playing through again with a different build but lost interest. So it's not a lot of entertainment, but an enjoyable diversion.Pros Fair amount of ship and equipment designs (more with mods) that are tuned to different playstyles Pretty well-designed missions that made good use of the engine Decent aesthetic, consistent and serviceable artwork UI was better than expected Several choices for which faction to serve, with different outcomes for them Engaging combat Mining is a thing, though not really fleshed out enough to be a real focusCons Could have been more interesting in every respect; every system seemed like it needed more depth and polish The game world is pretty small; definitely does not have an epic galactic scale Replayability was low for me; I felt like I'd seen everything significant after the first playthrough Could not play as pirate faction! This would have meant another complete playthroughIt was worth the money at full price, so if you can grab this during Summer or Winter sale, I wouldn't hesitate. I'd love to see what this team could do with more time and resources.			"

												This was a great game initially.  It was a good reminder of the old school star control 2 days.  But then eventually as I played a little longer, the game was a bit repetitive.  Space battles, didn't seem too challenging, and there were no plantets to explore etc.  Over all, I would give it a shot if it was on sale, would be solid 4-8hrs of entertainment before moving on to other items in the steam queue.

												A fun game that's essentially a mish mash over other games in the same genre. The graphics are nice and very clean. The game itself is overall enjoyable and fun, but suffers from two big problems there are both related: a lack of pacing and a lack of things to do. When you first start the game you'll already be able to purchase the equipment you'll be using for the vast majority of the game. All that's left is a grind. The games it was inspired by, like Space Rangers and SPAZ, feel a lot more like a stair step of progress - whereas this game feels more like one giant leap.It's an enjoyable leap, but mostly one that's probably only going to appeal to fans of the genre who are just looking for a fresh coat of paint on ideas that are not particularly fresh. That said this is also only for playing single player. This game in many ways seems to have been designed with multiplayer in mind, so if you're into that it may be that it significantly expands the horizons of the game.			"

												This game is currently great in the SINGLEPLAYER mode. Its very much like SPAZ(Space Pirates and Zombies) in the playstyle, and its always enjoyable to fly through space killing, stealing, selling, and upgrading your things.The reason I only recommend this game for singleplayer right now is because the multiplayer is (for the most part) pointless. Playing with other people makes no difference in your universe, save the possiblity of being raided. The game always has NPC ships flying around/fighting pirates, which makes it feel like you're never alone. Merchant ships that fly from station to station even actively trade goods, taking items you will see in the shop inventory away as you look at them, wondering what could have been... I personally wish they would add the ability to build your own station(s) though.As I said, this game is fantastic in SINGLEPLAYER, and hopefully with some updates multiplayer will be just as good.

												Good space game similar to but not the exact same as SPAZ. If you liked Space Pirates and Zombies you would probably really enjoy this game. For a while there was an issue with seeds being a bit random to the point where trying to get outside the tutorial zone could be frustrating depending on the levels of the zones that spawned around it. But when I mentioned this in the Steam forms it took less then a day for the devs to make some suggestions as to how they could fix this issue and within 3 days of the post they patched the game fully fixing that issue by making it so areas near the starting zone can not be mid level zones.It is nice to see dev's that actually care about the quality of their game and actually work on making the game better even after release that are not just bug fixes. The advanced controls are a bit hard to learn and I find myself switching between advanced and simple controls.  But all in all it's a game you can progress purely fighting or purely mining and selling and even purely just buying from one post and selling to another, the skill trees while mostly just % buff passives do actually make you feel like your makning progress and becoming better as you gain levels and has a fair share of starting sill set ups to start with. The part upgrades feel like there is both purely upgrades and also side grades (for example some generaters may generate power faster but store less power, and then sheilds there is shields that abosrb 100% damage but absorb less before breaking, some that absorb 50% damage but absorb a lot more, and in that same slot you might just install armor instead that constantly uses power unlike shields that only use power when recharging but reduces the damage you take.If you liked SPAZ this game has many similarities but does not feel like a clone either, at $15 I would say its worth it but not a must buy but if its ever on sale then it would easily make it be a must buy.

												Everything in VoidExpanse works well. It just needs more definition. (Video Below)The combat is reactive and vicious. The universe is appealing to look at. The ships are fun and customizable.Weapon choices are varied and upgrades are aplenty. Play styles defined with the skill tree. Fantastic Mod support and other great features. The only true problem lies in the fact this huge galaxy feels empty. Other then dang pirates which are around every asteroid.  It left me wanting more.I want to meet exotic races, run into strange anomalies or perhaps run through a blockade with my illegal cargo. I guess what I am looking for is more randomness or WAY more quests. Perhaps Mod support will fix this. Either way the framework of the game is there and its great. Its up to the players and developers to take it to the next level and make it amazing. For such a huge galaxy your choices are somewhat limited. You can either quest, go mining or kill enemy ships.(Usually pirates at the beginning.)It left me wanting more.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

There's plenty to do - questing, fighting, trading, mining, exploring - lots of variety, a good choice of ships and a good choice of components to equip to your ship that let you customise your ship further.

												Pilot/equipment/ship customization is varried and well balanced/implimented. All your RPG-like customization decisions have very relevent gameplay effects and you always feel good about skill points spent, or a new weapon upgraded.The factions and plot lines are simple, but interesting. Example:  A major alien nemesis has an original motive for a sci-fi series, which is not known to the player until some digging/questing happens The world is very much like the other gameplay elements, simple, but very well done and enjoyable. Having an effective auto-pilot to rely on is a fantastic quality of life feature in a sci-fi spacetravel game like this. I very much enjoyed the implimentation and effectiveness of the professions. Many sci-fi RPG games miss the profit/time spent mark with certain things like mining, or trading, but here you can max out credits and EXP by mining rocks exclusively if you wanted to.I've played about 20 hours now, and expect to play about 40 total before I'll be bored. All things considered, I give this game a 10 out of 10. It had a clear direction and goal, and hit the mark perfectly. If top-down sci-fi RPG's are your thing, you will certainly enjoy this.			"

												Really cool and immersive game! RPG-based, with tons of space ready for exploring and tech customization. It has a very neat progression and quest system, with multiple dialogue options and a very well optimised character-class system, each with its own unique abilities and set of skills/perks, which allow for a diverse gameplay.The UI is immersive, all the while keeping in theme with the arcade nature of the game. Also for the customization options, there's plenty of that, as the game offers a wide variety of ship upgrades, as well as useful consumables and other features, like mining lasers for extracting ore from asteroids. Furthermore, the tutorial is very explanatory, and there are details and descriptions following almost any action you make, that are sure to satisfy the lore-hungry gamers out there.Last but not least, there's also a combat system which is well designed and that (at least on the lower levels, before you ""master the stars"") will be sure to introduce you to the thrills of space warfare, which will add to the exciting gameplay.All around, i think this is a great game for fans of space exploration (like me). Albeit it's an arcade-ish game, it's fun and enjoyable to play. So, a big thumbs-up from me, and hopefully, from you guys too! :)			"

												This is quite a solid spacetrader type game.  I've been looking for this kind of experience for a while, and have been disappointed by titles like the X series, Elite Dangerous, EVE Online, and others.   Void Expanse offers a much faster paced game experience that can be enjoyed by people who don't have hundreds of hours to spend making boring delivery runs.What really makes this game shine though is an active development team.  I played the original version over a year ago, and just recently got back into it.  There's been major improvements to add new content, fix minor issues, and whatnot.  The developers weren't satisfied with making a pretty good game, so they made it a great game.  I'm confident that they'll stick with Void Expanse and make it an awesome game.  There's still quite a few new players to reach, right Devs?			"

												I play this game to relax. There are quests if you want to do them, if not, that's fine too. It has multiplayer and there's a few servers online. As far as I know there's not too many people on them, but I usually log in on one of them anyway. I just like to fly around, shoot some pirates, do some mining, make some cash and upgrade my ship. I am having more fun with this space game than Elite.			"

												This game is very addictive. Seems a little simplistic and the controls take a bit of getting used to. I crashed quite a bit until I got the hang of it down and I still am not very good at shooting down ships without a lot of misses but I have been really addicted to this game since I started playing it. Your a space ship captain and you fly around different sectors completing jobs, mining materials, and fighting bad guys to make money and upgrade your ship. There is a story line but to be honest I really haven't been paying much attention to it as I've been more focused on getting new ships and the best equipment for them. I've almost gotten the heavy cruisers, which is the heaviest ship in the game unlocked and I'm excited for it. I've found that mining is the easiest and safest way to make money and is almost always necessary as fuel to fly costs money so you can't just go from station to station without either fighting or mining to keep at least enough money to fuel your ship. Fuel is expensive so I recommend upgrading your mining equipment quickly so you can get the best materials so you an offset costs quickly so you have more money for upgrades. I definitely want to note that the developer is very active with this game. I happen to have started playing the day they released a patch that broke the game. I was stuck in the starting system and couldn't complete the tutorial to leave. They had the issue resolved in less than a day so while it wasn't the best experience, at least they are active and pay attention when issues arise. I haven't played multiplayer and probably won't as I'm more into the single player experience so I have no recommendations on how that works out but I bet it would be a pretty good time. I definitely recommend this game if you are interested in a game where you are given a ship and almost free reign to make your fortune and get the most powerful equipment you can. Only negative I can think of that I ran into other than the update issue is that sometimes you have to end up with issues because the game is so intense in regards to fuel. I ran into a few times where I got stranded because a few systems in a row didn't have any place to refuel. Recommend you keep some power cells handy just in case. Some people may also find some issues with the slow pace of mining as well. Each instance takes about 5 seconds and you are just sitting there. Doesn't seem like much but when you only get 60 pieces every time you mine, it can get tedius to fill a ship with a big cargo hold.... this is especially prevailent when you are going for a specific ore for a mission and are only getting 2 to 4 each time and you need 350 to complete the mission. Definitely a great game though and I recommend it for anyone that likes space ship games. Definitely not X2 as far as economy goes but its still a great game.  "

												Boring and empty.The game is a huge unbalanced grind. Why? Because every single piece of hardware on your ship is gated behind a level requisite, a skill level requisite, a tech level requisite on the station you want to buy it, a money requisite, an enegy requisite ( to be able to make it fonction without crippling other equipment use ) and for the weapons a weapon mount adapted to the type and size of the weapon.You will not get enough skill point to use more than one type of weapon too and two of them need to invest in ammo replenish to fonction ( without being that usefull either ). The weapons are ... lacking. Plasma and beam don't evolve in their use, just more DPS. Missiles and mines can use different attack pattern or number of projectiles shots but that's all.No real difference in the various items, they're either straight-up upgrades of each others ( for fuel tanks, radar or tractor grappling ), a huge shield with crappy recharge rate or a crappy shield with good recharge rate. You really don't have much diversity in the various items you can use, even when investing in the skills to use better items.The combat and exploration is meh. The map is really ill-designed with only one way to go to progress in the story ( usually forcing you to go through two or three maps way over your level ) without any kind of fast travel at all. Enjoy sitting in front of your screen for a couple minutes on autopilot because you have to backtrack to validate a quest. And if your ship isn't powerfull enough you will be blown to piece by pirates on the road. Unless you're backtracking manually.Seriously, no fast travel in a space game like that?I could say more things ( like how difficult for the threat level of the system some ennemies are for no reasons ) but the lack of real ship customisation, the various artificials gates that forbid you to use items and the ill-conceived map without fast travel are really things hindering any kind of enjoyement I could have found in this game.Yeah there is some mods for this game. But having to download tons of mods badly described just to find one that "" may "" correct "" the boring mess of this game is just too tedious. "

												Sandbox-esque space combatTop down space combat has been done before, lets get that out of the way.  From some of my earliest video game memories playing Star Control till recently with S.P.A.Z. this game follows a familiar combat formula.  But that's not a bad thing in any way.  Strafe, steer, and blast your way through your enemies with a bunch of changeable loadouts, ships, and different classes of 'hulls'  (the skeleton for the ship you'll use).  What makes this game great is the sandbox element.  It doesn't tell you what to do, but it does have branching quests.  Of course you're free to completely ignore them and just while away the hours mining asteroids if you so chooose.  Go to war with one of the factions in the game, or try to eliminate the alien menace that dominates a large chunk of the galaxy.  Ultimately it's up to you.If there's one big complaint about the game it's that it feels a little empty.  You hit a wall around your late 30s where the experience points seem to take a lot longer and the upgrades are much further apart then you'd like.  With some of them being only say, a 3% to your cruising speed, leveling feels pretty underwhelming after a while.  Thankfully you get experience for doing pretty much anything in this game.  Also combatting the emptiness is the modding community which already has full game overhauls, rebalanced skill trees, new hulls, new weapons, new quests, and more.  I'd like to see even more modding for this game personally, as more content can only improve an already great game.If you like this style of game, it's well worth the purchase price.			"

												Void Expanse is what I've been looking for in a space game. I'm so tired of seeing Medieval Action-RPG games. It's about time a space Action-RPG game is made that I can enjoy. I've searched for space games and I kept coming across nothing but RTS space games. Void Expanse is very similar to Drox Operative but it is so much better, IMO. I can choose what I want to do, whether it is mining for a little while to get cash, or deciding to test my new ship, weapons, devices, etc., or do co-op missions with friends. It is very fun and keeps me occupied for hours. If I choose, I can host my own dedicated server and have friends join in on the fun. Single player characters can be used in Multiplayer games as well. So a Single player character can be built up and continue to be built up in Multiplayer, back and forth. Very fun game! I highly recommend it.			"

												YES! This is what I was looking for! Open sandbox space sim where you choose your own path! Oh man I don't even know where to start, so I'll give a summary of my playthrough so far:I fired it up, set it to normal and rand-gen'd some bloke to play as (ended up with a guy with a pink mohawk and a hawaiian shirt. The absurdity has grown on me a bit). And I hit it right off. The interface and controls weren't too intuitive, but not too cryptic either. I had it pretty well figured out in under 5 minutes, and started working for the tutorial guy. And he taught me asteriod mining and mission running and trading and some basic combat and and then gave me a run down of what's going on in the sector then it was a pat on the butt and off you go. That's it. You get to kick it into high drive within.. 30 minutes? Of the game start. And the depth of the game is great. There's 5 factions, only one of which I know well, one I have a good idea of, and one that's a mystery to me, one's pirates and the last one is the EVIL ALIENS (TM). You level up and allocate your XP points to your skills, which go all the way from asteriod mining up to PEW PEW BANG and everything inbetween. And I mean everything. There's some really weird skills in there. Combat can leap between fairly routine to very surprising, depending on how high you keep your guard up. I was doing pretty damn well off the start beating up pirates and mining rocks, so I got pretty full of myself and headed into a fairly dangerous system to rack up some XP.Ha ha they beat my♥♥♥♥♥like a drum. I needed a bigger ship.Now, ship size isn't terribly noticable. I suppose because they'd have to zoom the screen out a lot to make a difference. It's basically just better hull, and better weapon placement. Which is a huge thing in combat. It's not so much the size of your gun, but whether or not you can bring it to bear! Some turrets point forwards, to the sides, out the back, etc! And also you have to match them up to their type of weapon. Energy/Kinetic/Missile/Mine. So, each ship has its own style of combat.Ship equipment is fairly straightforward. You want bigger and better, but you need to carefully manage how much fuel and power your fuel tank and reactor can provide. The thing I like is the fact you don't need to strip old ships for parts. No, your hull is literally just another equipment slot. You just swap it out and bang, new hull same equipment. Very enjoyable and challanging at times. It's going to see hundreds of hours from me.

I haven't got very deep into the main story yet but I've had fairly common quests from stations - resuce survivors, bounty hunt or trade, so I don't know how much more these vary later on.Such broad skill trees and seemingly plenty of different ways to build your character from their class.I haven't tried multiplayer yet.Single player alone I would say this game is definetely worth the price, and it's got such a cute visual style too!Surprise bargain!

												I want to love this game.  (and do for the most part)  But a lot of niggly bugs right now.  The mod interface is a total FAIL.  Partly to the Modders.  Every time I try to load a game from the day before, it will not load, most of the time from mods changing.  (this is not the games fault, but the mods fault)  Today one of the Mods version was rolled back because some one could not load the new one.  Well all of us that saves with the new one can not load because the version does not match now.The game has GREAT potential.  I am playing my current run with VERY FEW mods.  Hope to be able to load it tomorrow.Overall I love the game.  90% of the problems are from the workstop/mods.  The game could be great, if/when they expand on some areas of the game.  The Devs seem to be resposive in the Community.I recommend the game, but not the mods.			"

												This is a fantastic game with lots of potential. If you've been waiting for a space game for awhile, this one could really scratch that itch. Yes, as per the other reviews, it has some growing to do...but the devs listen to their fans and patch constantly. The older reviews are already outdated.Get this game if you want some unrestricted space time. You build the ship you want and play how you want to play. Want to be a bounty hunter? Miner? Merchant? Soldier? All of that is in the game already, with more on the way from what I've read.With the great scarcity of good space games, you'd be wrong not to take a chance on this title. It's cheap; it's got co-op; and it's fun. What more do you need?			"

												Not Recommended if you like playing through stories with other people.  Once you go through the quest to join a faction and really get into the meat of the story, the game informs you the only way to complete the story is in single player mode.  A friend and I bought this game to play through together because it's listed as a co-op game, and during our refund time seemed very much like a fun co-op game.  This only lasts long enough to get you past the refund timer though, as only shortly afterward you find out you're out of luck and have to do everything solo if you want to see the rest of the story and not just fly around blowing stuff up.  If they want this game to be worthy of a recommendation, they need to make the full story mode accessible in multiplayer.			"

If you like to have an easy non-addictive space travel the evening you get late from work - you should try this one. At least when it is ready. This is early access I believe.Faced several issues:1. Crashes. 2 times during 3 hours of gameplay. This game works like early access on my PC.2. Bugs with AI - weird behaivour of ships.3. Bugs with graphics - any time I look at a sun it kills the main app loop and fps is something like 1 or 2 frames per second.I think there are some content issues as well - the space does not look alive. Lots of pirates, some dummy trading ships and miners. I hope the developers would breath life into it someday.			"

												Void Expanse has consumed a lot of my time since I first discovered it, and I regret none of it!This Space-RPG has a randomly generated open world, with three distinct plot lines to follow, as well as a fair number of side quests and activities: e.g. bounty hunting, trading & mining. The world has a gritty, yet tongue in cheek feel to it. And cleansing the system of Xengatarn aliens will keep you going for ages!The biggest plus, though, in my opinion, is the availability for modding. The devs openly encourage it, and have built the game around this, making it one of the easiest games to mod.Outside of the game, the dev team are quick to respond to any bug reports or questions, listen to any comments, and are generally very helpful.In my opinion: money well spent.

												Word to the wise  - Autopilot is a little drunk at times.I'll admit the game feels very early access at times, with the amount of crashes and updates that have happened in the last few days, not just patching bugs, but dealing with content and balance issues.  Basically you are put in charge of a single ship of which can be minorly upgraded through various slots of boosters/weapons/otherwise.  There are a good deal of ships, all specializing in some area so it becomes a game of deciding what your play style is and attempting to find the right weapons/ships/addons to facilitate that. I'd started off a few times as an Adventurer, and found my focus exceedingly split between all the different avenues one can pursue.  Eventually I settled upon Prospector and that I feel gave me a solid base to build from (As it nearly maxes out the Mining Tree).  It doesn't though, seem to matter what class you pick as it throws you down the same funnel as everyone else - and nobody seems to comment or the game adjust itself for your choice outside of the points spent on builds.Factions are seemingly a big deal,  but having given a cursery look at what was to offer nothing really struck me as a place that is beneficial for someone who just wants to shoot lasers at rocks and collect things.  (There is no, straight up miners guild or anything - and of course you start out with almost maxed stats in that so in there isn't much further progression outside of spending into survivability) There are quiet a few space stations somewhat randomly laid out dependent upon your specific world seed.  Within these places you can gather quests which fall under the basic structures ""Go get this"" ""Go kill this"" ""Make sure this doesn't get killed"" ""Talk to this person"" ""Deliver this"" They don't seem to particularly care who you are as it just appears randomly when you ask the station commander (Sorta wish there was a job board instead)Outside of that, there is a story that you are trying to progress, and the day to day dealings of being within a space sand box . Of which, there are limited resources and enemies in certain areas, so in, you could go on a mission in faction controlled sections and wipe out every last dirty space pirate you come across.   I do find myself wishing there was the ability to do more with friendly NPC's (As basically you can only ask them the usual questions or attempt to buy fuel off them if you happen to be low). My limited experience with multiplayer has left me a little skepitcal on that front.  As you start out as a new player in every game you enter (No carrying a ship and progress over from place to place) You are basically at the mercy of a star system that very well might be almost completely devoid of enemies or I imagine ore to mine (As stated before, things can be limited).  The place I was in, I was hard pressed to find anyone in any of the faction sections, and the non-faction sections of space were basically slim pickings.Also, it should be known that if someone takes their game offline you lose that character and whatever progress/stuff you've accumilated. So in, seemingly less reason to tread in those waters but to hang out with friends and futz around. I've still been enjoying my time with the game so far - and while I'm not sure if they have loftier plans for the games future, though from what I've been able to gleam, they seem intent upon adding more (How much, only they, and I imagine the funds gotten from selling the game will decide).

												VoidExpanse is a superbly realised open-world, science fiction action-RPG set in deep space.


YouTube™ Video: ➜ A Quick Look @ 'VoidExpanse' 

			Views: 178		

			Massive Thanks to the Dev's for the Review Copy! http://store.steampowered.com/app/324260 I take a quick look @ 'VoidExpanse' - VoidExpanse is an clevely realised open-world, science fiction...		

The stories are great, the sound and graphics are top notch and the gameplay is what you would expect from this type of genre.  You take on the role of a spaceship pilot and navigate the vast reaches of VoidExpanse! Mine asteroids for valuable resources, trade to improve your ship, complete story missions offered by one of several factions with their own agendas, advance your character through diverse skill-trees -- and engage in fast-paced combat with hostile aliens, mercenaries and pirates in the rich and exciting Sci-Fi universe of VoidExpanse. But your journey doesn't end there: Create your own galaxy or persistent multiplayer worlds in sandbox mode to join forces with other players. You are only limited by your imagination!  - Recommended!			"

												Loving this game so far, it's like a 2D Eve Online, just drops you in and lets you figure things out. The interface is clean and polished and while I can think of a few things I'd add I can see it growing very organicly by the players. Running a dedicated server and while it has it's bugs I have to say the netcode is very lean and seems to do very well with 20+ players. Join us on ***NEXUS ONE*** and we'll see you soon!			"

												So lets jump right into it, VoidExpanse is tricky as far as controls but once you master them the game is a cakewalk and alot of fun although you will get to a point where once you get yourself situated and astablished there will be almost no challange to the game. I love this game so far its alot of fun and has alot of key elements that I have been looking for as far as unique and vast amounts of equipments and ships, alot of systems. Your skill points as some have said done seem to do anything but for me I wait till I have 40+ points to spend which is 3-4 levels and I will tell you there is a huge difference in the skills so you can notice improvement. Great game, fun, good music, alot of places to explore, tons of choices in ships and equipment, skills. Go mine, how about be a fighter or a trader? why not?			"

												For a 6 dollar game on sale, I am enjoying the crap out of this. I once played a game very similar and was always on the lookout for that type of game. FOUND IT! :-) Don't think too hard on a game like this. There is no epic story line. No insane graphics. Just simple fun like a phone app. Is it worth six bucks. Absolutely. Is it worth ten or more... meh.. maybe. But, probably not. I look at it this way. If I were to go to the theatre for a movie. I'm going to pay WAAAAYYY more than six bucks for maybe 2 hours (if I'm lucky) of entertainment. This doesn't count gas and driving time.I've already put in almost 9 hours into the game and I feel like I've definitely gotten the value for the cost. That could be 4-6 movies right there.

												All in all, a fun little game, but it has a few problems which they will hopefully fix.1. Terrible ""pathfinding"" (if you can even call it that) during Autopilot.  Your ship runs into things all the time and only occassionally flies around obstructions.  Once, while on Autopilot, my ship ran into a large asteroid and just continued to bump straight into it without ever changing course.2. Too few jobs and those available are terribly repetitive.2. Too few jobs and those available are terribly repetitive.  (See what I mean?)3. The reward for killing pirates is usually so small it is not worth it.  I don't mind the low XP, but the booty drop rate is only about 50% and when there is a drop it is often one of very low value.I'm hopeful they add much more to this game, it has great potential.			"

												So far I find the game developers very helpfull and quick to react toproblems.the game is fantastic! it has a lot of things youcan do and the world is busy full of pirates, miners, traders and more.The rpg element of the game is build very nicely to cover every part of the game from fighting to trading.the game looks nice and the controls feelright (once you get a hang of them).however the character creation has a very limited selectibility e.g having only 10 hairstyles with already preset colour. the game is easily modible and will havemany mods which have the potential ofchanging the game drastically and lettingyou enjoy a fully new experience!Overall I'm happy with my purchase.

												Im sorry. I really tried liking this game. I like the genre, but just everything about the progression and gameplay is too poorly thought out to be engaging in any form. There are many upgrades to choose from but its both heavily tier based and doesnt have much in the way of playing style strategy. On top of that its just an endless grind.The visual style feels more like a pay2win google play title or a browser game.After >4 ingame hours its left me with a sour feeling of wasted time. 4/10			"

												A friend bought this game for me since it was on sale.Simple, but pretty fun. Can't wait for more stuff to be added and updated. You have to be a certain level, but the only thing stopping you from getting the best equipment for your ship is money. Just rush to a system with a high tech level, and buy. Combat is a little wonky. The constant sliding around trying to shoot something gets annoying quickly. It makes spending skill points and money on increased maneuverability a must. There's also a quick spike in difficulty. Go to a system with lots of pirates/aliens and you'll quickly get swarmed if you're not careful and/or prepared.Overall I enjoy playing this game. Oddly relaxing to just sit down and fly my little ship, mining asteroids.			"

Earn income just by playing open game and mining if you want.  It is also multiplayer but Ive yet to do that.			"

												This game might not be perfect, but it certainly is an overlooked gem. I have a somewhat strange fascination with rogue-likes/lites. I also quite enjoy a nice space exploration game. I quite like this game and I keep coming back. Not all games get the formula right, but I think this one does. Some people might say that this game is too easy. I wouldln't know, I find it just right. I am playing it on Normal difficulty though so your mileage may vary. Graphically, it looks decent enough. It's 3D models and particle effects are quite beautiful with lovely backdrops. I would say though that perhaps the backdrops are a bit too colourful. Most of space is empty and black, and I find it hard to believe that you'd see this other huge galaxy in the distance. Sure it would still be millions of light years away, but isn't very realistic. That isn't to say that I don't appreciate them, I do. It makes it seem a bit less bleak than space normally would be.The music holds up, and gives your ears something to listen to although I didn't much care for the music at the start screen. I like the sound design. Although, the ships don't actually have that much difference in engines and the various other effects are the same if you have a Level 1 or Level 3 Laser.In my current run, I find that Laser Energy weapons are by far the best and easiest to aim. A lot of it comes down to the ship though. There are various types of those. I haven't tried Multiplayer yet, but when I do, I will be sure to comment on it.The story is the same, but the destinations are procedurally generated. There are various types of missions. Rescue, Mining, Delivering Packages, Intel, a few mini-games in hacking Enerak terminals. I discovered that running out of fuel wasn't the end of the world, but you travelled a lot slower, even whilst cruising. Without fuel, your ship is severely exposed and crippled. You have no energy for weapons or shields, but you can still live to fight another day.Is it a perfect game? No. I found a few glitches mostly to do with the autosaving message (it is a bit offscreen, I am playing at 4K. I also found that sometimes when you dock with the autopilot or not, the ship circles around the object a bit swirling closer and closer in and then eventually docking. Overally, I really like this game. There is something about exploring space, fighting pirates, mining, and buying parts for your ship to upgrade it. If you enjoy rogue-likes/-lites then you'll enjoy this.			"

												Void Expanse is the kind of game where you can just get lost in for hours and love every minute of it.I mean that literally and figuratively by the way. This game is so deep, and the universe is expansive (You can also scale the map during character creation if you watch my first look video the map I'm playing is set to the default which is half as big as the universe can get!) So you can easily just get lost, there's a lot of information to absorb. However, It didn't take me to long to get the hang of things and once you get going it's a game that can just get sucked into for hours.Void Expanse is an open world ship simulator with endless possibilities. You can choose your own path on how you progress. Want to mine asteroids for ore and sell it to the Federation? Go for it! Want to join the Order and fight the alien threat? Buy some weapons and start shooting rockets!Want to roleplay Sweden and fight pirates and stay neutral? That's also an option!There are many paths that you can take and with a deep skill tree you will get many hours out of this game. Here's my first hour or so with Void Expanse (It's actually two hours so look for the other video over at my youtube.com/earlyaccesspodcast channel)

I liked that it doesn't force me to do anything and I can just fly around, explore and destroy stuff. I'm quite tired of the games where you're forced to just go wherever they send you from the very beginning like on rails, so this one was a great relief from that. Of course, there's a storyline and whatever, but I'm fine with my pace and the game is fine with it too. So... I liked it.			"

												Although it's in its early stages, this game seems to have a very bright future. At present, the trading and diplomatic systems are very fun and intensive. The combat is more or less just a ""point-and-click"" fight where you just have to attack your enemies until they are destroyed; it's not boring, but it may be able to be improved. The AI can also be improved as well (for example, I witnessed an AI trading frigate crashing into the back of a space station for a solid 10 minutes because it couldn't pathfind its way around it). It's integration of Workshop is of course a big plus as well.The game's not perfect, but it's definitely worth the $15 asking price. The devs seem commited to updating the game and I find it very fun now, much less its future potential.			"

												A very solid space/trading/rpg. VoidExpanse, while I have some personal challenges with it, is a game I can sink my teeth into, and I think you can to if you like space trading, space fighting and rpg games with a bit of random number generation thrown in!   You start by creating a universe and a character. She or he will belong to one of a variety of classes, including adventurer which is a bit less skilled but has all trees available to develop. The tutorial certainly explains how the game works and how to play but will not dispense hints or strategies.   I find the graphics quite suiting and I personally love the music! I will want it in my media player of choice.  The only problems I have are ship piloting can be akward and combat feels inaccurate/clunky, since you have to spin your ship around a lot and also aim for your enemy. Getting swarmed is bad news. $16.99 is worth it for me! If you're still not sure, read more reviews and ask around the discussion groups, there's also gameplay videos online!			"

												I picked this game up on sale, as a simple space shoot-em-up. It's actually pretty good, in a happily retro fashion. Theres a small amount of NPC interaction, quite a bit of upgrading space ships and equipment, and the possibility of being fairly successful via trading or mining if you really want to. I went for what certinaly feels like the majority of the game, shooting stuff. User interface is simple, combat can be swift and brutal, and you can certainly tailor your ship and tactics to playstyle. I've seen some complaints that the character advancement doesn't make much difference. It does, but not a lot. By the time you finish the game one way or another, I suspect that you'll be using gameplay skills 30%, equipment 50% and character skills 20%. Still, a good game if you fancy swooping around shooting aliens. Easy to drop in and out of. Fairly addictive.			"

												Although it's in its early stages, this game seems to have a very bright future. At present, the trading and diplomatic systems are very fun and intensive. The combat is more or less just a ""point-and-click"" fight where you just have to attack your enemies until they are destroyed; it's not boring, but it may be able to be improved. The AI can also be improved as well (for example, I witnessed an AI trading frigate crashing into the back of a space station for a solid 10 minutes because it couldn't pathfind its way around it). It's integration of Workshop is of course a big plus as well.The game's not perfect, but it's definitely worth the $15 asking price. The devs seem commited to updating the game and I find it very fun now, much less its future potential.			"

												A very solid space/trading/rpg. VoidExpanse, while I have some personal challenges with it, is a game I can sink my teeth into, and I think you can to if you like space trading, space fighting and rpg games with a bit of random number generation thrown in!   You start by creating a universe and a character. She or he will belong to one of a variety of classes, including adventurer which is a bit less skilled but has all trees available to develop. The tutorial certainly explains how the game works and how to play but will not dispense hints or strategies.   I find the graphics quite suiting and I personally love the music! I will want it in my media player of choice.  The only problems I have are ship piloting can be akward and combat feels inaccurate/clunky, since you have to spin your ship around a lot and also aim for your enemy. Getting swarmed is bad news. $16.99 is worth it for me! If you're still not sure, read more reviews and ask around the discussion groups, there's also gameplay videos online!			"

												The graphics look really nice. That's about the good news, because I couldn't get any further than that. The game never ran for more than 5 minutes without crashing on my MacBook. Unplayable.Edit: apparently the game allows multiple instances to run at the same time, which is causing the crashes. Developers, you might want to look into this and fix it.The game is very enjoyable. I played it for several hours now and I want to see more. It reminds me of Wing Commander Privateer and X3: Reunion. What I like about VoidExpanse:- Simplicity: Limiting to 2 dimensions, a simple control scheme. It works and feels right.- Graphics: Thruster exhaust and explosions are a joy to look at. Most of the scenery looks nice as well.- Combat: I really enjoy combat in this game. It is a good mix of skill and having the better hardware. It might be too easy, but I don't mind that.There are a few points on which VoidExpanse could do better:- Ship design: I was never proud to own a ship because of its looks. Ships are like cars. When you look at them you should think ""I want to fly that thing!"".- Dialogues: This is by far the weakest link in the game. The dialogues are so shallow you won't feel the slightest empathy for the characters in the game. They're also quite hard to follow because they're spammed on the screen without any non-verbal communication.- Stations: Every station looks the same on the inside, and most of the actions on the station are performed through some user interface. It would be nice to see more of the station interior and to have more variety in station interiors.- Ship components and materials: They look very abstract, having only a coloured icon to represent them. It would be nice to have at least a real picture of the thing.			"

												Great game for the 1st 20 hours or so. After that it becomes brutally hard (in an unbalanced manner, not in a hard-but-fun Dark Souls manner), and as some have noted the mid/end-game is lacking in content. In mid to end-game your RPG skills/ship progression comes to a crawl as difficulty ramps up very suddenly (too suddenly IMHO) while remaining repetitive (combat becomes harder but there's not anything really 'new' to it - compare this to S.P.A.Z. which introduces a whole new combat dynamic (the zombies) mid-game, which keeps things fresh.) Combat at level 5 feels much like combat when you're level 40, it's just much harder. So after a while the game starts to feel like a real grind. This game is like a cross between a prettier S.P.A.Z. and a more action-oriented Space Rangers 2, albeit in a 'light' form. It feels superior to S.P.A.Z.  for the first 10-20 hours because the basic combat mechanics work very well - I love using mines, and it's fun to find just the right weapon combo amongst a pretty good selection of weapons. However VoidExpanse runs out of steam at about level 35-40. Some of the quests are interesting but a most of them get very grindy/cliche/repetitive fast. Still, production values are higher than with SPAZ or Space Rangers 2, and combat is a lot of fun, at least for a while. If the developers put in more mid to end-game content, more high-end ship components, and did more balancing in mid/late game, and added more features like the ability to hire henchman (sometimes you're given a henchman, but it'd be great to hire and manage them at will) then this game would be AWESOME! As it is, like I said it's fun for the first 20 hours, so for $15 I got my money's worth and I give it a thumbs up.			"

												I feel extremely mislead by all the positive reviews for this game and wish I had not bought it.It is basically a top down version of freelancer, that plays WAY worse than the game's mechanics that it is COMPLETELY RIPPING OFF - space pirates and zombies (which is a gem BTW) - with an  extremely weak/light RPG skill tree thrown on top of it.The combat/action is horrendous and almost completely unplayable. Spent ~8 hours trying to be an ""engineer/miner"" and 2 entire skill trees are basically useless. The ballistics weapons are unusable and you need the skillpoints put into mining/tech to make up for the insanely sloppy controls. The biggest game design flaw is that they made the game unplaable then only slightly better by unlocking aiming technology over time. AND You CAN'T RESPEC. Just frustrating and stupid.There is no proper controller support in what is effectively a top-down shooter. And throw in some crashes to desktop and saving glitches/bugs... Total fail - no idea how this game is getting positive reviews.Hopefully the devs will take some of the negative feedback seriously and make the gameplay tighter out of the box instead of penalizing players for not specing the right way.

												Man oh man where to begin. This game is a mishmash of so many great sci-fi titles I'm just going to hilight a few of the ones they took the best qualities from. First there's the combat which for oldschool guys will remind you of a modernized Starcontrol 2 melee battle right away with its newtonian physics and fast paced action. Then in 2002 there was this great little SHUMP called Starscape which I beleive to be the true spiritual successor to this title. Look it up on Steam and watch the trailer to know what I mean. It was a blend of the classic arcade game Sinistar that threw a touch of Wing Commander Privateer's exploration, commerce and ship upgrades into the mix. Now add in expansive multiplayer that can support up to 10,000 people per server, RPG dialogue, factions, character creation, player classes, and FTL's hypnotic space opera music score on top of all of that and you've got Void Expanse. You can focus on combat, mining, salvage, exploration, you name it. The learning curve is easy to pick up, controls extremely crisp and the multiplayer features allow for PvE and FFA PvP servers. There's even full steamworks and modding support.All in all despite the occasional crash/bug, this game is a total package and steal for the modest price tag.			"

												So far it's really incredible. Extremely atmospheric. The graphics are just gorgeous for an isometric game. The combat is really fun and intuitive.

What I can say though is that it's a great game for a great price and if you love top down shooters, this is a game that won't disappoint. Support these guys!			"

												First impressions, after about 6 hours of game, and level 30 character.While definitely worth the price, the game is still lacking compared to classics like Space Rangers, Drox Operative or SPAZ. It needs about 5x as much content as the current selection (5x as much mission types, module and ship types, random stuff happening, etc) to be a real classic. Still, the basics are all good, combat is fun, mining and trading is profitable, there is some danger in dying, so definitely a good start. Devs seem to be working on it with full steam, so that is also good.+- It seems to have a more strict ""storyline"", with some ""story missions"", and the universe seem to be very static unlike Drox or SR. It is somewhat similar to SPAZ in this regard.+- Visuals are okay, but nothing stellar. Personally I like this, but some people might want a prettier game.+ Some missions can be solved multiple ways, which I liked very much. Fight, negotiate, or just betray the questgiver all count.+ Mining is somewhat entertaining and can be profitable unlike most space games.+ A good selection of weapons, like mines, guided and unguided missiles, pulse and beam lasers, plasma, machine gun, gauss gun, etc.+ Fight is also fun, if you like realtime dogfights with active aiming and such.Negatives:- Ships are less free to change around. Ships come with weapon hardpoints, like 2 missile and 1 laser slot, witch you cannot change. You cannot install multiple shields on a ship or anything like that like in Drox. - There aren't much random mission types, just mine stuff (always the same type and amount!), kill pirates, escort stuff. - There aren't any random events (or at least I didn't found). No ""treasure maps"" or ambushes or such. - The game world seems to be a bit empty, despite having asteroids, wrecks, pirates and such - they just wander around aimlessly, instead of actively building an empire or something, like in Drox or SR. Maybe adding radio messages and such, showing what each NPC is doing, would solve this.			"

												The game could use a little more content and polish, but it is worth the asking price. I've only run into 2 technical problems, a pathfinding bug which is very minor, and the occasional crash (irregular, sometimes it crashes at launch, other times I can play 4-8 hours without a problem).Game uses an Asteroids (for those who remember that game) style physics system, which means that when you head in a direction, you continue to drift. You will stop eventually, but not quickly enough to warrant changing this description. Personally, I've never been fond of this style, but that is a matter of preference and hopefully a moder will give us a choice on it.There are several tiers of ships and weapons, and there is a decent amount of customization. Ship selection isn't vast, but it is enough to have a comfortable amount of choice, and its highly moddable with ship hull mods being the most common at this point (yt-1300, and star trek mods already out). Weapon selection could also use a little more expansion as well, but again, its enough to give a decent amount of choice.There are multiple campaign routes to take, one for each faction except neutral. Optional quests are sparse, but cover the basics, trading, mining, escort, courier, and bounty (mod available to allow the player to choose which they take).Game could definitely be fleshed out more, and a lot of things are underway, but in its current condition, it is worth the asking price. It doesn't blow me away, but neither do I regret buying it.Game does not support gamepads, or any other control method besides mouse and keyboard at this time.Also, since this is an issue to some people, you will have to make an account for the game. Doing so consists of giving a username that is not already taken, and nothing more. This is done to make multiplayer run smoothly, but multiplayer is purely optional, creating a username, however, is not. No personal information is requested.			"

												Let me start with this disclaimer:  Thus far I haven't put much time into this game. That said, I expect I'll definitely be playing more in the days and weeks to come.  At that point, my viewpoint may change but right now, I definitely recommend this game.The gameplay is simple, and it's easy enough to pick up and play.  For some that seems to be a turn off, which I understand, but in this case disagree with.The top-down play, along with the general atmoshpere of this game, makes for a relaxing experience (in a good way).  It's very pretty, but not in the ""Yeah, it looks good, but plays like poo"" style.For me, this game scratches the Wing Commander Privateer itch very well, even if it is a simpler title.  By comparison to that game, this one plays much more simply.This game may not be for everybody, but it's a thumbs-up for me.			"

												(played it before steam release, i have played for just over 10 hours)The game was amazing.. for the first two hours... After that it became a bit too repetitive.I started off with the idea of becoming a big astroid mining company, but at the this stage of the game you are limited to your ship only. So I just started mining with the idea of getting a freighter someday, but after a few astroids it was boring and repetetive. And because you need skills for almost everything you can buy the money i made was almost worthless.So i made another character and wanted to become a pirate. After killing a few merchants with my newly aquired canon, decided to join ""The Order"", because killing merchants was boring and repetetive aswell.After doing a few missions i was tasked to free the systems occupied by the evil alien race with the objective being ""free a system connected to the system containing the ""central hive"". I liberated 3 systems and got bored because I needed to  do the same thing over and over again without any real challanges.So i decided getting a better ship and after a lot of grinding (A LOT OF GRINDING) I was level 45, unlocked heavy cruisers and bought one of the biggest ships in the game and it felt like it was no different then my civ cruiser i got at the start...I stopped playing after that, at this moment the game lacks alot. It has an amazingly fun concept and I personally hope the game will lean more towards Sid Meier's Pirates in the end. At the moment the isn't worth it, but I think it's gonna improve a lot in the upcoming months			"

												This is still a very unpolished game.  I'm still experiencing a lot cases where the game crashes on start, and occasionally during gameplay. The combat system is OK, but there's few quests and the ones that exists are the tired old 'fetch me X number of Ys', kill this enemy, rescue this NPC.  Some of the faction quests actually involve dialog, and those are OK, but too few and too shallow. There's very little plot in this game. The backgrounds, planets and ships and space stations are definitely beautiful, there's no lack of pretty graphics. Issues with the Gameplay:Autopilot will run into stationary objects like space junk and asteroids.  It's bad enough that it plots courses through groups of enemy ships, but it's a space game. Even if you're only allowed to move in a 2D plane the autopilot could go under or over those obsticles, or just plot a course around. SWARMS of PIRATES EVERYWHERE.  There's just too freakin' many.  Tone it down, especially in space controlled by other factions.  I've had the game for 2 days, and I've already got all the best equipment in the whole game.  It appears that the rest of the game will just be an annoying grindfest and the tenuous plot isn't enough to make me want to finish.Also a recommendation, just one jumpgate per system.  That gate should be able to send you to the other connected systems. So when you get a fetch quest you don't get blown up while the autopilot crashes you into asteroids while a dozen pirates rain fire on your ship. Then you can reward curious players that take the time to explore a system by hiding interesting things in it (and no, the alien relics that are only good for science points don't count. Interesting stuff, more stories, easter eggs, etc.) And more plot...some of the faction quests were nice, but there needs to be more!			"

												Game time is not correct. I really have about 12 hours into it. This is better than Endless sky as the interface is much more intuitive here. Battles and overall action and space ambience is more interactive as well. However this is still far behind Space Pirates and Zombies 1. I really wanted this to love this game, but the best part so far is the soundtrack.I got worried when the campaign starts by asking the size of the game you want, and had a generated ID for it. Sometimes, like in SPAZ, the randomness is not such a bad thing. Adjusting the starting modifiers did little to change the actual game or my experience in it. The graphics in the HUD and outer space area is not bad. In fact the exhaust trail and weapons and shield graphics were more than acceptable. However, when at the space station store, items to buy and sell look hand drawn by an 8 year old. The change is jarring.Early on I tried getting to the first planet and got killed very often by pirates. I could not even get 15 seconds out from the main space station without getting killed. Eventually I found a few asteroids, mined for resources, found a pirate and either killed them, or died and lost all my cargo and $ for ressurection. Repeat that process many times and eventually I had enough money for better equipment. Not too bad, but repetitive and boring after a short while. The autopilot will get you killed. Pirate and AI combat is always the same. There is no way to shrink down travel time so just going from place to place feels tedious. After a very short while you see how shallow the game is. Pirates are everywhere, but loot is minimal at best. Player mods are great, but shouldn't be relied on to actually enjoy a gameThe worst part? Crashes. I tried mining an asteroid. Half the time it worked. The rest it would crash the game. Reinstalled and same thing happened. A save game got corrupted as well. I paid about $8 and that feels too high.			"

												The game gets boring very quickly...UPDATE: the newest update, v1.4, brings some new content. However, the biggest pain is still there: it's money and travelling. There is no problem earning money: you can hunt, trade or mine. It's extremely boring. Of course, money is needed to get better equipement to proceed with the quests. Travelling is boring, too. It is also needed and there is little fun in it and not much of a way to speed it up (well, the autopilot helps but it's stupid). On the other hand, the update brought some new content which makes the game more fun but does not counterweight the two problems at all.			"

												TL:DR;Grind. Terrible grind. Terrible, boring grind. Very few types of non-story missions. Very limited character customization - you can live with it - but you can't live with very shallow SHIP CUSTOMIZATION. Skills are limited and at max can give you like +50% increase. Boring story. Boring combat (is there just one explosion animation?).Verdict: No, not really. Even heavily modded with good ships, this game is a chore to play and simply gets so boring so fast.If you compare it to, say, Space rangers 2, it's like 1/5 od SR in terms of size, customization, quests and fun.I had very high hopes for this game seeing positive reviews, but it doesn't live to expectations.Also keep in mind no new updates in almost a year, despite the game being 2 years old and costing 15$. Skip it. You really will not miss much.			"

												Wonderful topdown Elite clone with RPG elements of a skill tree for your character and the customization of your space ship. The combat is similar to Subspace, not sure if anyone remembers that old space combat multiplayer game from the 90's.Your ships have hardpoints which can be fixed (you have to turn your ship to aim) or are turrets that turn a certain amount of degrees and you can aim that way.  Either way,  turning the ship around quickly is important and when things get more difficult your skill (not the skill of your character) of piloting your craft will make a big difference.  The fact that the combat is realtime and dependent upon your piloting skill can make the game more frustrating than for example Drox operative which is turn based and the combat is similar to SPAZ.I am 7.5 hours into my second campaign, my character is level 32 and I am enjoying the game immensely by just farming pirates. I have read some of the negative reviews and I agree that the game probably needs more content but otherwise it is perfect for me. I did encounter two crashes so far which is very annoying.Pros:- Open world ""feels"" open-RPG skills work for unlocking weapons/ships and make your character more effective. I would have been happy with justthe ""RPG"" system of upgrading my ship so the added bonus of having a skill tree is awesome- Combat is fun, I enjoy ploughing through  hordes of pirates/aliens- The different weapon systems and energy/kinetic weapons work well... seems balanced/make sense- Ship customization is fun, there are a lot of combination to try. The hull is just another equipment slot so you caneasily swap ships if you want to change from your combat vessel to your mining vessel with more cargo space.- Hunting pirates, mining, trading is easy to do.. all you need to do is find pirates, asteroids and space stations and you are off.- Mods, I can't wait for the game to be out longer and having more mods to install :)- Price, great value for $15 Cons:- Needs more content, under extras on the main menu there is an ""upcoming"" button which lists all the things the dev is planning so I think we are good... also the mods will help- Difficulty can  be frustrating sometimes			"

												VoidExpanse is a pretty fun game, if you know what to expect.  If you ever played Smugglers 1-4 and enjoyed the slow style, then this is a step in the more action oriented direction.  While this has the same mechanics, it is a top down action space game.  It is definitly fun for levels 1-25 but after that, it will get repetetive as you move towards the bigger ships.  I can see a lot more fun being had if you were online with a large group, and PVP was an option.  I played only single player for a decent amount of hours, and ultimately enjoyed it.			"

												I refunded the game after a fairly short time playing, but let me point out that its core gameplay seems solid. However, the simplistic look combined with the static nature of the galaxy make VoidExpanse basically just another top-down-view space trading sim. The game would be a shoo-in for a feature like dynamic factions and borders, but instead, even though the map is generated, factions remain static in their starting positions and never expand or fight. The leveling system is pretty well done, with fairly interesting skill trees, but doesn't really add much to a game that is, ultimately, very empty.Several years ago, this would have been a worthy competitor to Escape Velocity Nova and similar games, but with newer, more dynamic games like Drox Operative on the market, I feel that, unfortunately VoidExpanse doesn't really add anything that others don't already do better.

												I like it but it did get old for me after a while.  Be sure to set your auto-save to a shorter time period than the default.  I, like many others, had an issue with the game crashing.  The shorter auto-save really... well saved me in that respect.  The mods that are already available in the steam workshop really do make this games playtime potentially endless.  I have ventured into multiplayer a little bit and even on the lowest ping (50ms) I noticed quite a bit of chop that I didn't notice in single player.  That could partially explain why multi-player on public games is a bit of a ghost town right now.  Also the lack of transference from one game to another.  It's an rpg that takes hours or even days to customize your character just the way you want it... and then you get to start back at square 1 when you enter a new multiplayer game.Still as noted I do recommend this game, particularly on a steam sale.  You'll get a couple weeks of fun out of it, but the sun won't come up in the middle of a play session.			"

												I want to start by saying I realize this is a pretty new game and has plenty of potential for growth and details.  Putting that aside, this game is pretty polished.  Smooth backgrounds, lots of details and the ship controls make it feel like a space game.  The trading and selling options remind me of the bygone days of Spore space travels.On the down side, the character variety is underwhelming, the skill trees keep making me spend my points and have remaining points, which makes me wonder at the end of leveling up if I'll retain points that can't be spent and will be useless.  Some of the storage and carrying rules are a little excess as well.All in all, if you're a sci fi fan who enjoys technology, deep space and adding figures, this is fine game for you.  I personally would have prefferred more  character/ ship customization and alien race selection from the beginning.			"

												It had a lot of potential, but fell flat; a straightforward/simple plot that requires a lot of grinding.  It tries to have faction standings, but it amounts to only a single choice between 2 factions (freedom vs. military) early in the game, but both are fighting the same enemy (aliens); they're essentially interchangable.  Other than completing the faction admission mission, there's no way to join or leave a faction.I stuck through to finish it, but the ending felt rushed and tacked on; the final battle was no more difficult than the last dozen that I had to grind through to get there.

												I picked this game because I was looking for games similar to the old Cosmic Rifts game from SOE and Starscape from Moonpod.  This is exactly what I was hoping it would be and it's still early enough in development that it can only get better.  Gameplay is smooth for the most part and there's alot of situations where no matter how good you are you're going to eat it.  Avoid the escort missions as the AI will always just ram you over and over again till you're dead making them nearly impossible to complete unless you have fast enough engines to outrun them.  Otherwise a solid game.  The nearly 8 hours I have into it are in one sitting.  Oh, and ignore their forums if you have Chrome and avoid other browsers.  It glitches and locks you out then refuses to load at all.			"

Games are supposed to be fun.  This is a nice laid back fun without having to study for an exam to play.  Im going back in. Ive wasted enough time here.  :)Edit: spoiler alert.

												I don't really understand the negative reviews, but everyone is entitled to they opinion of course.I bought the game before it was released on steam, and I think it was totally worth it.In my opinion, this game is like Smugglers (which is terrible in my opinion) and Elite (which is great of course). It has very beautiful graphics (the shading is really great), it has good controls, it has lots of roguelike stuff and also some kind of cyoa storyline.Being 2D, it is easy to get started and get into the game. The multiplayer works fine (but not perfect). At this time of writing it mostly is a single player experience with everyone sharing the same space. You can't trade with someone or do missions together. You could of course help eachother out by helping with fights, but there is no shared loot or something. I believe though, that when you are in the same star system, everyone in your ""party"" gets your XP as well.Maybe the future will bring more multiplayer options. "

												VoidExpanse is an arcade version of Escape Velocity.  It's a much shallower world, with a larger focus on action.  Pirates/hostiles aren't an anomaly, they’re scattered across every map like koopas and goombas, they’ll jump into any fight even when they’re horribly outmatched.They have added XP for pilot leveling, and a skill tree to specialize your pilot, which is a nice improvement. Staying true to the more arcade feel, these rewards come fast and furious.  I’ve put in 5 hours (5 learning hours, so plenty of time reading tool tips and trying to figure things out) and am already level 35.The ship upgrade process is also streamlined.  The hull is just one more slotted upgrade (although it does change which weapon slots are available), and there’s no weight attribute to balance things out.  So you never need to decide how to optimize one ship, while saving for another, you just grab an upgrade for whichever slot you can.  Not a lot of decisions to make, you just get the next level of your radar/fuel tank/grappler, and if you happen to switch out hulls, they stay with you.  Like the pilot leveling, these upgrades come fast.  You never really reach the limits of your ship, and set a goal for a better ship, you’re just constantly upgrading everything before you hit the limit.  I don’t know that I need a new generator, but one’s offered, so you upgrade it. You don’t really have any sense of accomplishment.The factions are also very simplified.  There seem to be 6 total, and you're basically chosing between 2.  Pirates; Aliens that are trying to wipe out humanity; people that worship said aliens; neutrals; and then the two choices: Freedom or Order.  So far, it seems like progression of these quest lines are pretty much on rails.  Helping Order doesn’t seem to make Freedom like me any less.There’s a nice dialog system in game, where you can ask anyone about any topic you like.  While the system’s nice, it doesn’t seem to be very fleshed out.  Most everyone just repeats the tutorial for most options, and there doesn’t seem to be much of a reward for being thorough or going deep.Quests are fairly simplified, too.  There are bounty missions to kill one particular pirate in the system you’re in (and he’s marked on the radar).  You can do rescue missions to a piece of debris in your system.  Then there are escort missions and package deliveries, which go to different systems, but there’s no concept of time, so you can just pick up as many as you want and drop them off when you happen to get to the system. There’s a cargo quest I’ve been offered a couple times, but they warn you you need a lot of space (unspecified) so I’ve declined it.  The last generic quest I’ve been offered is a mining contract, which is always for the same amount of the same mineral.   Much like the dialog system, it seems like the quests really need to be fleshed out.In true arcade form, death is only a minor inconvenience.  Your body’s cloned (the cost is equivalent to about 1 quest reward) and your ship, it turns out, is fully insured. You lose your non-quest inventory, and that’s it.The ship to ship fighting has some interesting mechanics, different weapons having different tracking speeds, being able to assign different weapons to different firing groups.  I think it suffers for the camera being way too close.  If a ship comes in from the top of your screen, it’s already within range of your weapons, and is only ~8 ship lengths away. If things were zoomed out, so you could play with the edge of your weapons range, it opens up a lot more tactical dogfighting.To sum up, it’s Arcade Escape Velocity, for all the positives and negatives that “Arcade” brings with it. I’d appreciate a bit more depth at a more deliberate pace, but VoidExpanse really leans towards the arcade feel.  Hopefully they expand on the dialog tree and quest options as time goes on.  And maybe at later levels you’ll actually know you want/need an upgrade before you’ve already obtained it.  Last note: I’m playing on a 5k iMac and even after lowering the video options it gets choppy in cruise mode.  It also requires a monoframework package install, and I’ve had a few freezes.Holding out hope for improvements, but as is I can't recommend this game.			"

												I don't really understand the negative reviews, but everyone is entitled to they opinion of course.I bought the game before it was released on steam, and I think it was totally worth it.In my opinion, this game is like Smugglers (which is terrible in my opinion) and Elite (which is great of course). It has very beautiful graphics (the shading is really great), it has good controls, it has lots of roguelike stuff and also some kind of cyoa storyline.Being 2D, it is easy to get started and get into the game. The multiplayer works fine (but not perfect). At this time of writing it mostly is a single player experience with everyone sharing the same space. You can't trade with someone or do missions together. You could of course help eachother out by helping with fights, but there is no shared loot or something. I believe though, that when you are in the same star system, everyone in your ""party"" gets your XP as well.Maybe the future will bring more multiplayer options. "

												Game is pretty fun as single player, but horrible as multiplayer. I joined my buddies to take down the alien scum, but it turns out that in multiplayer - you can't liberate systems! After you join a faction you are literally stuck with nothing to do but mindless missions to make money for upgrades. And it is one purposeQuote from Dev:""This is done on purpose. Just imagine what would happen if you kill all aliens and ""win"" the game. What about the other players? So, in MP it is a pure sandbox where you can play with other players indefinitely."" So MP is basically a static universe where you can't change anything. It's a fun single player game but has no value as multiplayer.			"

												Eh.This game's pretty clunky. Everything feels sluggish: the weird compromise between dogfighting-esque inertia and the coasting you get from Newtonian flight models mires the maneuvering way too much. It really hurts the combat, too. And even if you decide to forego the combat for a mercantile approach, you're treated to a loading screen every time you dock or undock. Yet leveling up and inventory management happens in real time? Doesn't seem consistent.Hopefully this stuff gets addressed since I love the 90s FMV sci fi game aesthetic of the interiors. Gonna be honest, though: if I could get a refund, I wouldn't look back.			"

												*Review is based on my opinion on how multiplayer works (Or does not work for me)I bought this game in the hope that I could play multiplayer with a friend.Little did I know how much nonsense was involved with getting multiplayer to actually work. I followed all the steps on the wiki page, forwarded ports, tried different ports and IP addresses, checked firewall settings, everything I could think of...yet I could never make it work.And yes, I also searched for as many forum posts as I could about this problem, too. No luck.Why should I have to be an IT expert to get multiplayer to work in the first place? I cannot recommend this game. Why can I get any other game to work multiplayer but not VoidExpanse? I couldn't tell you, and that is why I must give it a thumbs down.			"

Its cheaper and combat is a lot more fun. Hell of a less grindy too. If the devs were smart they would pay attention to that games combat and make it more smooth. All in all not a bad game but also not a game to buy outside of a 75% off sale "

												 The game has some fun moments when you first start playing, however the MP experience which many enjoy is severely lacking. Very limited in terms of types of ships you can obtain, upgrades, and trading is very basic and the galaxy map is very small (Even on the largest setting).  The combat sytem is more of a fast paced arcade shooter and you feel like your flying a fighter ship, as none of the ships feel like bigger ships at all.  In it's current iteration, the game feels like just another attempt to make a decent top down space 4x game of some kind, but the updates are very slow and the most recent update didn't really add much. It's beginning to look / feel like another dev ""burned out"" on something that had potential.  There are 3 different factions you can potentially join, however 1 faction (Freedom) has a known bug issue that prevents you from joining if you mess up on 1 of the 4 required to join them. There is no 2nd chance, no added missions that will let you join later, just another example of how limited and basic the faction system currently is.  If your looking for a handful of hours for something fast paced and somewhat challenging (if you set up the difficulty), you might give it a try, but I would hold off until there was a sale on the game. I would love to see the developer become serious about their game and add in the much needed features, content, etc, and would be willing to review the game again and update my recommendation if they ever decide to do so.

If you enjoy playing games like Freelancer and don't mind a top-down viewpoint, then the decision to buy this game is a no-brainer.  The graphics are nicely done and there's a lot to do here for the $15 price tag, making it an easy recommend.

												What happens when a game developer treats the patience of the player as a resource? Eventually, players run out of patience and quit.What do I mean, treating patience as a resource? For example, consider a piece of equipment in this game called the Combat Thruster (or something like that). It gives all sorts of great combat stats, but wrecks your cruising speed, which is the speed the autopilot mostly uses... and boy, do you spend a lot of time using autopilot in this game (backtracking to turn in quests, etc.). So when trying to decide whether to use this item, you're really trying to decide whether you're willing to endure more tedium than you already are. How many decisions like that is a player going to make before quitting?			"

I can't risk trading with a freighter even in the lightest combat areas, beacause if i undo auto pilot, and barley tap a piece of space junk, I explode. And loose 10,000k worth of medicine. Twice. Not being able to save in different slots makes me not even want to continue my 6 or 7 hour game after a few huge setbacks. If they have a workshop workaround or if the change that, I'd change my mind.			"

												I appreciate the work that goes into an Indie title, but that doesn't mean I'm automatically going to recommend it because it's Indie and an impressive effort for that alone.  I don't regret the purchase simply because it's a 'value' title.  If I had to choose again, I would have saved the money and spent it elsewhere.Disclaimer: I have not beaten this game - but in 7 hours of play I did get to level 34 and have explored a large number of sectors.  I'm going to continue for a while and will revise my review if anything compelling happens to alter my feelings.The Good: Ships are customizable Open galaxy to explore Well planned character skill tree Attractive backdrops and workable graphics Devices make for some worthwhile combos - like mining for ore and using it for repairs Autopilot works well A solid Indie effortThe Meh: Weapons aren't well balanced and lasers rule combat Enemies don't aggro unless you're within a short range Enemies largely sit in one spot and wait for you to come kill them Missions and combat are extremely repetitive A fair number of possible ships and equipment to choose from, but only a few worth using Autopilot used extensively to get around - you watch the game play itself while you travel Levels come pretty quickly and end up feeling less important for thatThe Bad: The universe feels largely unalive and soulless - it feels like a paint the by numbers adventure kit Combat is soggy as you have to compensate for ship momentum and weapon arcs AI ""Allies"" are dumb as bricks and very much in the way instead of helping "

												NOTE: I edit my original view based on my disatisfaction at  the current state of multiplayer, and my doubt that there will ever be a viable multiplayer experience in this game. The game mechanics simply don't allow for a fulfilling multiplayer experience. If you are interested in single player, pick this up on sale. If your intent is to play with friends on a private server, go for it. If however, you are looking for an ongoing, stable community, that allows open sandbox gameplay as the game is designed to accomodate, don't buy. All servers are player hosted, subject to admin abuse, subject to server ruleset constraints. There is no dedicated server sponsored by the developers.			"

												Before reviewing, I will say this game can be good in the future.Right now, there is very little depth in stuff you can do. IT's all very simplistic... Itemization, ships, weapons, combat, mining.... It's very simple... I guess for the price, it's fine, but if they intend this game to be longlasting, it needs a lot of work. (I'm hoping they put in the leg work to make this a great game and not just mediocre.)			"

												I once gave this game a thumbs up and a must buy.  After I died for the first time with a very expensive ship in my inventory, I must say it's a no go.  I was not aware you lose all your stuff when you die.  Talk about a big waste of my time.  Sorry guys, but this is not a game for me.			"

												Had issues with a laggy loading screen and thought it locked up. Got into the game after a bit of futzing with the resolution to make it more responsive. Once the game loaded, I didn't understand what I was supposed to do. Already being slightly frustrated from the menu experience, I opted to just quit and get a refund before it was too late.But it looked like it could be cool.			"

												This is an amazing game! Lots of Quests ship customization, And now beging station management! If you like space games and Action, You will love this game. You can choose to be a trader or Combat or all of the above. There is a very nice skill system and you can learn to master everything. At anypoint you can choose combat or just to relax and do some simple trading. There is alot to explore Crates to hack for great loot. Anyways this is one of my all time fav games. Keep up the hardwork Devs ;)			"
