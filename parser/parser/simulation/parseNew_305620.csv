								Ok, I am in and alive for 13 days -  my best game so far. I've finally made a good start. I started slowly. Gathered supplies from the coastal area, made an empty home my safehouse. Hell, I had a fridge with 40Kg of food. I had so much food I was forced to stuff Chocolate Bars and Cooked Meat in Drawers... I even had a special Cabinet with Dog Food only. Then I had endless meds... my bathroom was a pharmacy, antiseptics, antibiotics, and so many bandages I could make a blanket with them.I also had a good trap-thing going on. Had snares all around the place, bagging game each time I went out scouting. Hares mainly. God, I had three shelves full of raw hare meat, ready to be cooked.I must have had 50L of water in the Freezer, and another 10L on me...I've fought wolves barehanded. Many wolves. I had gathered half the available resources of the game in one house.  MY safehouse. I could sleep and eat in the house for 40 days straight, without having to go out. I could get that freakin' achievement of surviving for 50 days just by sleeping and eating - I had a good thing going on.Today, I woke up early - 5:08 to be precise. Thought of going out for a walk, it's so peaceful at this early hour.As I watched the sun rise in the horizon, I heard a cracking noise below me.The ice broke.I died.			"

								Alright, ladies and gentlemen - I have just reemerged back into the real world, after almost 100 days (99 days 18 hours) survival in one playthrough. With that up my sleeve, I'll be bold enough to say that I know a thing or two about this game and ready to try and write an adequate review. So gather round, grab a cup of hot chockolate and have a listen to what uncle Chern's got to tell ya :)I'll split my review into three sections - pros, cons and things that are considered negative by some reviewers, but not necessarily are.Let us start with the cons, because this list is the shortest... and because I am grumpy old b*****d who likes to criticize. So...CONS:MAP - Map in the current version of the game is not very large. There are only a few points to explore and salvage from. So after you have visited them all (which can... and probably should... be done in the first few days of your survival), the game becomes a bit repetitive. Go find meat - go collect some wood - cook - eat/drink - sleep - repeat from step one. Saying that - it does add to realism. Real survival in the wilderness is far from glorious and comes down to just that - get food, cook, keep sated, hydrated and warm. But still it would be nice to have more areas to poke your nose around :)LOOT (sometimes) - Loot in the game is mostly random... which is a good thing and adds to realism and replayability value, but at some playthroughs it can get bloody stupid. Sometimes you may have enough ammo to get out of Canadian wilds, venture to Afghanistan and assist several ISAF operations, have three knives, 5 packs of MRE rations, ton of medical supplies and good gear. Sometimes it may be evenly and fairly spread-out - so you find a good bit of everything in moderate ammount... And sometimes it gets silly. On my previous to last playthrough i found 5 can openers, no MREs, no repair tools, one almost broken knife and ton of degraded clothing. I still managed 41 days and died of stupidity (went to bed while freezing, and hoped I'll warm up... I didn't), but be warned - never know what you might get and life isn't always fair :)LONG DARK - No matter what you do, in the end your character is goind to punch that snuff button and check out. That can be quite depressing, that after toughing it out for 2-3 months, heroically navigating through blinding blizzards, savagely fighting wolves for half frozen (and half eaten) deer carcasses, you still going to die. I know - it wouldn't be ""The Long Dark"" game if you didn't fade into the long dark in the end and it makes this game highly competitive among the players, but it would be nice if there was an option for some sort of happy ending to the game. Maybe they'll do it for story mode later on. FLUFFY - I am not going to spoil it for you. You'll get to know him as you play the game. Be afraid... be very afraid... and never let your guard down. Cause the very moment you think you're safe and relax, the cruel reality will bite you in the ***... literally.Other than that - there are no bad things about this game. I wouldn't even use a word ""bad"" to describe all of the above - there are no bad things, just areas for improvement (just please don't change fluffy - leave him where he is - we all love him really... ok, he's completely evil ***hole, but it wouldn't be so much fun without him). Now, that we are done with those negative waves, let us switch to the positive side and see how beatiful this game is :)PROS:REALISM - Ok,.. let's get this straight - no simulator will duplicate the real thing - ever. As an ex-marine and keen climber and outdoorsman, I could have listed countless things that can be added to this game, from the realism perspective. But, so far, this game is as close as computer game can get to real-life survival (if you know anything better - please feel free to suggest). It is not casual, it is not skyrim with most hardcore ""eat, sleep, drink"" mods, it does not hold your hand, nor cuts you any slack. It's simple - ""ok, you're in **** - get surviving""... and if you can't - hey, it's natural selection for you. So forget all the fancy Bear Grylls shows - no climbing cliffs, no running butt-naked through the winter forest and then trying to replenish your calories by munching on a squirell. Conserve your calories whenever and wherever you can, keep warm and hydrated, keep your gear in working order and adapt adequately to anything the wilderness throws at you - no heroics, no pointless wondering or taking chances, just timely well-planned actions... or it's game over.IMMERSION - The atmosphere of this game is absolutely marvellous. Nevermind cartoon graphics - sound, tension and your imagination (if you have any) totally do their trick. Howling of the wind outside at night, does set the mood in, whilst howling of the wolves at dusk, will send that tingle down your spine and motivate you to keep your rifle handy and get inside as soon as you can. And there is a really cosy and safe feeling, when you are sitting by the fire late at night, cooking your meal and celebrating your survival for yet another day. REPLAYABILITY - As mentioned before, the loot is pretty random. So every time the gear made available for the picking would be a little different and so will be your situation. Sometimes it will be bad and other times it will be just plain awful... Deal with it :)FLUFFY - Well, you know... :)Finally, let us take a quick look on things, that have been criticized by many players, but that are not entirely that bad.BALANCE - There have been numerous complaints from the players about calories ticking away too fast or equipment degrading too fast. It's a fair point, but guys - let's not forget that this is a game and players should be kept occupied. There would be a lot less to do if your equipment didn't degrade overtime and so the game would be just repetitive cooking and wood-foraging almost from start to finish. And that's a bit boring - don't we all agree?If we are talking realism, then how about adding the fact that your clothing will be soaking wet after couple of hours outside, thus will become a lot colder not overtime but right away and will require good bit of drying to become warmer again? Or how about the fact that your ammo may get damp and unusable, or your rifle itself will require good thorough cleaning regularly, or wood that also will require drying, before it can be set on fire with a match and paper? And so on, and so on... Full realism will make some things easier, but will make a load of other things the hell of a lot harder. So stop wimpering, fix those damn woolen socks with a bit of cloth, patch up can opener with some rusty scrap metal and get out there :)))WOLVES - To my surprise I've seen quite a few complaints about abundance of wolves in the game and the wolf AI. Personally I do not know why anyone would complain about wolves - wolves in this game are your best friends, right after your winter coat, rifle and knife. In fact you may not need rifle when you got those guys around. On my last playthrough I have run out of ammo, by about 70th day. I survived for almost 30 days more. Guess how? I waited untill some wolf takes down a deer, then scared him off with a flare or fought him off with my fists and hoooray - 8kg of free venison every time. All thanks to wolves... poor buggers - I owe them some beers. As to complaints about a wolf AI, I don't see what's wrong with it. Yes - the hungry wolf in the middle of the winter will try to have you for lunch - if there's no easier prey to be had, they will attack human (both in this game and for real). Once again - be thankful for ""non-realism"" and having to deal with lone wolves every time. In real life you'd have a whole pack of them on your ***. Do you feel lucky? :)It seems like my word limit is up... Shame :) Anyway - get this game and play it. It's 100% worth it. Thanks for reading :)			"

Early Access Review
								So my plane has crashed and I am alone, cold and hungry.   Sadly, I'm dressed for 4 hours of comfort on a routine flight from Anchorage to Yellowknife, not for days of wandering lost in the greater Canadian waste.Though it is late in the day, for the moment, fortune is with me.  As I orient to my surroundings I notice a frozen fellow face down in the snow.  Apparently, his name was Max.  He clearly wouldn't be needing his belongings anymore so I borrowed his hunting knife and hatchet.  Nearby, a hunter's blind held some meager food supplies.It was about this time that my luck ended.  Dusk fell and night was fast approaching.  As fate would have it, a monumental blizzard was closing in along with the dark.  I started treking in the dim dusk, seeking I knew not what.  As the wind and the cold clutched at me, I staggered on until i saw the dim outline of a building.  I was cold, tired and starving when I finally found solace in a small hunter's cabin.  It's meager supplies barely sustained me until morning.For the next 16 days I wandered the Mystery lake area in search of a rifle to fire the 30+ rounds of rifle ammo I've amassed.  It's the edge I need if I am to triumph over the unforgiving, wolf-infested wilderness.  I've fended off every wolf attack thus far.  In fact, it is I who stalk them.  They run off before dying but I generally find their frozen corpse later after they have succombed to the wounds my hunting knife left them.  I've lived well on plentiful venison, having stolen the kills of wolves after carefully trailing them until they make a kill. Though less adept at it, I also make my own kills with my makeshift bow.  I've trapped rabbits and I've fished the lake and I stand now, hearty, healthy and well equipped - high upon Mother Nature's  bounty.  The only thing I fear are bears which I carefully avoid.Finally the day arrives where I realize that I've depleted all of my resources.  My last arrow was lost in my most recent hunt.   I must now leave this place, or die here.  With some small amount of anxiety, I make preperations to strike out in search of new places to support my existence.  I gather my most crucial supplies, fully repair all of my best equipment and strike out for the coastal highway.For 4 days I trek.  Through ravines and over hills and down cliffs I go, until I come to a wide, frozen bay in the coastal region.  Cold, tired and hungry, I set out across the ice. I am being impatient, I know, but a promising group of buildings in the distance has allured me.  I am encumbered; I sought to bring as much to my new area as possible and have collected more along the way.  The sun is angling dangerously low in the sky when I realize the going has been too slow, I've consumed too much food.  Night and starvation are  both much closer than I had anticipated.And then the worm fully turned.  Fortune looked away from me, presenting me it's cold uncaring indifference.Only half way across the open ice, the winds begin to kick up.  The temperature drops sharply and before I have any chance to help myself, a blizzard sets in.  First in gusts, then torrents, waves of fine white dust combine with the encroaching dark to blind my sight.  I light my last flare but it's light is consumed in the gale.  I become disoriented, unsure of my heading and now utterly lost.  Numb with cold, starvation and bone tired, I desperately peer into the dark, almost willing my eyes to make out an ice fishing hut I had seen in the distance, before the storm had cast it's cloak over me.  Finally, with some releaf, I begin to make out it's outline.  But alas, Fortune has fled fast from me.  The outline was not a hut.  It was a bear.  Terror grips me as the foul beast decends.  Helpless, he mauls me repeatedly, shredding my carefully crafted clothes as if they were paper and lacerating my flesh mercilessly.  The cold has numbed the pain of the cuts but nothing can numb the sharp, grating ache of broken and crushed bones as the beast tosses me about like a rag doll. Finally, when it seems as if I must certainly die, the creature ceases his attack, leaving me all but dead.As the bear shambles off, I come to my senses somewhat, enough to fully realize my peril.  I've sustained tremendous injuries.  It is all I can do to stem the bleeding and stumble to the REAL fishing hut nearby.  Exhausted, physically traumatized, starving and numb from cold, I set about striking a fire in the pot belly stove commonly found in fishing huts.  The world spins about me as I evaluate my options.  I must eat soon and I must rest -- or I will die.  I clear the ice fishing hole and cast.  No bites.  I am desperate now.  I cast again.  I hear the agonizing sound of my line snapping.  I dig through my gear and find I have no more tackle.So I lie here, death slowly overtaking me.  I feel myself fading into darkness.  Thoughts of home, of my family, my world before this one, flying in my plane and the other joys I have experienced and I lament that it must all end like this. My heart sinks lower as my conscience fades.And then I see it.  The rifle in the corner.Through heroic feats of effort, I drag myself to the corner and I take it in my hands.  21 days I have spent in the Canadian wilderness.  21 days I've spent searching for a rifle.  And now as my lifeforce leaves me, it somehow calms me that I now hold triumphantly, that which I have sought.  A gentle peace overtakes me as I descend into the grey.And so, if you should ever find yourself stranded in the Canadian waste and if you should come to a vast bay in the coastal region, and while crossing it, you should stumble upon a small fishing hut, don't be surprised to find a wry smile on my frozen face as you pry the rifle from my cold dead hands.And may it serve you well.

Edit: I added a short response to negative reviews at the bottom - please read it.You know the warm/thawing feeling you have when you finally get home after walking through a snowstorm for a couple hours? When I stop playing The Long Dark, I feel exactly like that. Not really of course, but my brain believes it. The Long Dark is really immersive.The difficulty is also something to savour. You don't have to fight a single living thing and can still die an embarrassing death. Just today, I managed to walk in big circles twice. In a game. Jesus.I was also too afraid to go out at night because of big bad wolves and cold, but then I finally did go out. And the game stunned me with the sky. I wished I could just lie down on the snow and gaze.Then the music started playing. The beautiful soft music by the amazing Cris Velasco & Sascha Dikiciyan.I couldn't stay in one spot for too long, though, because I'd freeze soon. So I started walking when, on the horizon, I saw a house! With smoke coming out its chimney, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it was beautiful. Should be some food in it so I was definitely not going to die of hunger. At least not tonight.But then I realized it's the house I took off from. God dammit.Update: Two negative reviews have gotten to the top and they raise some understandable points with regards to gameplay mechanics and features. I strongly suggest you watch some gameplay videos to see if these issues might be game-breaking for you - you never know. The game cannot be 100% realistic in all manners and makes some adjustments to some of the mechanics such as durability of tools and clothes, etc.Personally, I really don't mind them because to me, The Long Dark still offers lots of beautiful experiences, great gameplay and immersiveness which I'm oh so enjoying. But, be warned, you might be expecting something a bit different from the game than what it offers and these might not be due to the game being in Alpha but simply a core aspect of the game itself - so read/video up on it and decide for yourself!

								After a geomagnetic disaster and a plane crash into the Canadian wilderness, in the barely habitable winter wasteland the only survivor is you. How long can you last against the wrath of Mother Nature until you succumb to the Long Dark?IntroductionIn The Long Dark, a survival & exploration game, the initial set-up is quite simple. You can choose to begin your story from either the Mystery Lake or Coastal Highway and then maintain your health (condition) by dealing with:hunger (as displayed by remaining calories)coldthirstexhaustionAt the same time you must explore your environment for critical supplies and beware of wandering too far from a shelter. In this game the worst threat won't be anything living but rather the general inhospitable surroundings. A roaring blizzard, threatening to put you to a cold shallow grave of ice, can be just as deadly to get lost in as to take shelter from in a cabin without any food, water or firewood.There exists a constant risk/reward status where you must weigh just what can you do and what you MUST do that puts you in a fairly stressful (and even frightening) situation.Survival mechanics 8/10After a few deaths and then surviving over 50 days, I can say the threats can be tough but are in the end fair. There are multiple ways to greatly enhance your odds of survival, namely finding better clothes and tools, but there's no substitute for exploration and familiarizing oneself to the surroundings. There are no maps or compasses so remembering landmarks is imperative for finding your back to safety...The balance of staying outside to scavenge, hunt, fish and get firewood for cooking, heating and melting&boiling snow for drinking water while also tending to your clothes, tools and potential medical conditions isn't easy, but perhaps one of the finest points is the slightly reduced need for the tiniest of micro management. Getting firewood, melting snow, fixing, sleeping and even harvesting can be set to take place for a predefined amount of time or quantity, which makes managing your ever-dvindling energy more straight-forward and makes organizing easier.There's also a day-night cycle and even if the sky is free of clouds, without a flare or lantern it will be all but impossible to see anything once sunlight's gone. During the night it will also be potentially much colder and also harder to spot the hungry predators. The sight of glowing eyes approaching is enough to chill your blood from a whole different reason than the cold...While it can be easy to survive for some time with scavenging alone, it will eventually be a near must to hunt for your meals. And even then the management of limited resourses like medicine and cloths will potentially either make or break your survival. Luckily you can improve your own effectivity at lighting fires, crafting tools and repairing items to make longer term sustainibility possible but long-term thinking is a necessity to survive.A bit of a heads-up so your not caught off guard, being in strong wind or a blizzard will wear down your clothes rather quickly even if you take windcover in a broken shack or the hut of an icefisher. Hopefully this will see a change in the future updates as it will limit your range to the vicinity of shelters that can be closed properly.(Oof a blizzard, I'll take cover from it in this hut with a furnace in it and fish... oops, my jacket, hat, shirt, shoes and everything just ripped from the wind wear in this OBVIOUS wind trap causing me to freeze to death despite a burning hot furnace next to me. -_-)Asthetics - (9/10)The Long Dark has somewhat stylized graphics, giving it a small pseudo-2D impression that plays very well with warm shades in light and cold shades during dusk. A lit fireplace won't light the surroundings as much as an open flame, but it has its own beutiful profile against an otherwise pitch black cabin. A very impressive view unfolds from high-up, overlooking the costal winterland.Also, even though there's no story mode, the sandbox mode contains quite a bit of lore on its own. Finding a frozen corpse, collapsed against a tree; an abandoned home with a cooked meat still in its oven or a run-down power-station share their own silent bits of story. There are also multiple named locations around the world, not only to make navigation a bit easier but also dwell futher into the lore of the environment you stroll in.Music - 8/10This game doesn't have an abundance of varying tracks but if one were to categorize them, they should be call mystical. The somber and somewhat distant-ish music serves as a great auditive tool that greatly supports an image of a seemingly unreal frozen world which might just be a dream. The cues inform you about a dawn breaking, a night approaching, a grievous end or perhaps about a dire situation among many other things that can only be found out by exploring this lonely world.If I close my eyes, when I wake up all the snow will have disappeared and the town'll look like nothing had happened...As a closing statement, this game can be surprisingly tense and stressful when fighting against all odds to keep you alive. I recommend this game to anyone interested in asthetics, mythical music and eager for a survival story in the now quite lonely cold world. The most successful survivors have lasted over 100 days. Perhaps there might be salvation if you last long enough...-This review is from up to v.166 early access and covers the sandbox mode of the time. The upcoming story mode and tweaks / additional features to the mechanics aren't.-			"

								I like this game.  I WANT to like it a lot more.  It's by far the closest I've gotten to a ""true survival"" simulator -- just you against the elements, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t zombies or getting insta-killed every spawn by naked dudes.  But as many (recent) reviewers have said after spending a few hours in-game, the ""realism"" starts to quickly fade.--Clothes do not fall from your body into tattered rags after four days of exposure.--Hatchets do not shatter after cutting up three pieces of wood.--CAN OPENERS DO NOT BREAK AFTER OPENING SIX CANS.  I still have the same can opener I bought 12 years ago and use it almost daily.  It still works.  It has not broken.--Fires can be rekindled from hot embers.--Boiling water you just boiled doesn't make it ""safer"".  You already boiled it, remember?--Falling down the equivalent of a few feet does not sprain/break one's ankle.  The human body can take more than that, or we'd all be extinct.I could go on and on but I'd just be parroting what others have said already.  The game WANTS to be an ""uber-realistic take on what IRL wilderness survival would be like"" but it consistently makes baffling and unrealistic design choices in order to ratchet up the ""hardcore difficulty"".  I'm not saying I'd do very well surviving on my own in a freezing wasteland -- just that my sorry, untrained♥♥♥♥♥would probably still be better off than The Long Dark's protagonist that has to deal with wooden things he can't burn, weapons he can't swing, and (again) METAL TOOLS THAT BREAK AFTER BEING USED, LIKE, TWICE.  I've used plastic sporks IRL that lasted longer than the STEEL CROWBARS in this game!Also -- fix the ♥♥♥♥ing wolves' AI or take them out of the game entirely.  Unfair, unfun, and the definition of unrealistic.  Or let me fight them off with the hatchet and knife I have on me.  ANYTHING except the inevitable attack and subsequent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mini-game to punch them off of me.This all sounds incredibly negative, yet I'm still recommending it?  Yes, I am.Like I started off saying, this game is still the closest thing to my dream ""survival simulator"" I've ever played.  But Hinterland?  You guys need to either focus on ""simulation"" or ""difficulty"", because they are not the same thing.  You might think it would make it more boring, but bringing the gameplay mechanics closer to ""realistic simulation"" instead of ""hardcore difficulty"" could be the thing that takes this from ""yet another survival game"" to ""THE most realistic survival simulator ever made"".  Which do you want to make?  Which would we gamers rather spend our money on and play?Don't buy this game yet, guys.  But definitely keep an eye on it.  It has potential out the♥♥♥♥♥ but right now it's just kinda.....♥♥♥♥♥I like this game, I do.  But I WANT to like it so much more. "

								I finally got the hang of this game. I fished, gathered wood and even made myself some deerskin boots! But after 8 days I still couldn't find the rifle. I packed my bags with supplies ready for a search of the ravine. Weather was fine and visibility was good.  A wolf soon catches my scent! With my flare to keep him at bay, I make a sprint for the Hydro Dam, phew safe! I hear scratching, I am not alone! I ready my final flare and hold it steady, confident I can repel whatever lurks in the dark. Fluffy comes for me, I ignite my torch... he attacks! I fight for my life and, wounded, the wolf retreats. However I am now left in a crippled state, bleeding. My condition is not good. I escape the Dam only to find myself in a blizzard, I can't go back, I must get back to my cabin! I forge ahead gritting my teeth, I am cold... so very cold. I soon lose my bearings in the whiteout, I'm down to 3% and my vision blurs, 2% I see the silhouette of a cabin, I make it to the door... yes, I survived! But whats this? The cabin does not have a fire! Now at 1% I really start to panic and before I can get out my bedroll I slip into The Long Dark... 10/10 for atmosphere. It really did have me frantic when I realised I was caught in a blizzard with low health.			"

								    I've played The Long Dark for almost 14 hours and I think I can really say that this is the most realistic survival game out there. This game drops you in all alone with little to no knowledge of how to live (unless you read a bunch of guides like me). The not knowing what to do part of the game is what makes this game the most satisfying when you finally get a couple days in. Ok time to stop writing this like a high school paper I'll make this review a simple bullet point guide of the pros and cons of this game.Pros- In depth hunger, thirst and cold stats in game- Beautiful Graphics (Not much of a machine hog either)- Immersive HUD (meaning almost no HUD except for little indicators for when you're getting cold or hungry)- Nice and simple inventory system- Perfect first-aid system- Time consuming crafting- Simple hunting system (Skinning and drying)- Nice weather system Cons- Wolf AI still needs work- Not many crafting options (I can understand why there isnt a lot but a few more would be better)- Early Access (bugs)There is not a lot of cons when it comes to this game but I'm sure there is a few minor cons on this game. I recommend this game to anyone who is sick of zombie survival  games and is looking for a nice hardcore in-depth survival game. (I don't write many reviews so some feedback would be nice thanks for reading)			"

Early Access Review
								At first I was only interested for the story mode to come, but then friends kept bugging me about how amazing the sandbox was, I wasn't biting it, it's just a survival mode in which you know you WILL die, looks like a fancy score based game to me, compare inches of ♥♥♥♥ by how long you can survive, but then articles kept coming, people still kept bugging me about how great the game was. Well, I decided to give it a chance before the final release to know what the fuss was all about. Man, it blew my mind.First of all, it's not a simple game of survival, watch meters and number dwindle down as you starve, get tired or dehydrated, although, there is plenty of that too. What's incredible is how contemplative it is, you're always on the look for something yes, you need to keep moving, keep exploring, the world isn't safe, it's dying and it wants you to join it, it feels sometimes the only true warmth you'll ever find is the embrace of death. Outside time leaps, everything you do takes precious time and sunlight, harvesting wood, exploring, getting from point A to B, you're always freezing or going hungry, but then you find shelter, and you like the character can rest.You still have to do something to be alive in a shelter, light a fire, cook food, boil water, but at least you can think, you can prepare your spirit for the terror outside. You have to survive, not because you want to prove something to anyone else, but out of spite, in a land that wants you dead, you want to rebel, you refuse to give up. But it's still respite, at a shelter you can think, plan your next day.In a way it reminds me of Hemingway's old man and the sea, it's about an internal struggle, even if nature gets the final say, you'll wont rest easy, you'll kick and scream and in that defiance you can have your final laugh.There is so much that can be said about this, even the play though that cemented my appreciation of this game could be a tale in itself, but for now it's enough, I wrote too much already.

Early Access Review
								There are more than two dozen ""Survival"" games on Steam, and The Long Dark is one of the limited few that does it right.My opinion of survival games has gradually grown increasingly disdainful over the last several years. It seems like there's a new survival game coming to Steam's Early Access every single month. The majority of these games are virtually identical and most have zombies, or something zombie-like. It's almost comical. This is exactly why a game like The Long Dark is so refreshing.The Long Dark is a survival game in the truest sense of the word. There's no zombies. There are no monsters. You don't start with a stone age weapon and craft your way up to an assault rifle. It's simply man versus nature. You must stay warm, find food, and stay hydrated. All while enduring terrible conditions and potentially deadly wildlife. You'll freeze to death. You'll bleed out after fending off a wolf attack. Maybe you'll find yourself wandering aimlessly, lost, eventually succumbing to exhaustion. The Long Dark is a cold, visceral game, with an incredibly absorbing atmosphere. It looks gorgeous and it sounds amazing. Everything about the game experience is engrossing and artfully designed. The Long Dark is one of the best designed, beautiful, and atmospheric games on Steam. And it's certainly one of the best survival games of all time.			"

Early Access Review
								*On a whim, for my newest run of the game, i've been keeping a ""journal"" of sorts. If anybody is interested, check my screenshots.*   The single most terrifying game ever made. And not cheap terror like a teleporting white guy in a suit that magically kills you no matter what you do. Not random jump scares. Not even with a monster or killer. Your own mind scares you. You're alone. You don't really know why, but everybody is dead, covered in frost and dead. All of the wolves are rabid and deadly, sure, (9/10 deaths will be to wolves) but they arent the scary thing. the cold isnt the scary thing. Nothing in the game is scary, and yet it's terrifying. It's the isolation. You. Are. Alone.   After a few hours in a session if you've got a headset on and no distractions, every bookself becomes a serial killer. The creaks and groans of the old buildings are a monster creeping up on you. You know you are safe yet you are terrified. You set up your sleeping bag in the corner of a building so nothing can be behind you when you wake up. You waste matches or lantern oil to see in a building you've already looted and know the route of because the dark is scary. The isolation is simply torture, and i love to dread it. 10/10 for atmosphere.   As for the game itself... well, you're in northern canada and there's no electricity, and everybody is dead. Don't freeze. Don't starve. Don't get mauled by a wolf. The game is fairly realistic, one killed deer or wolf can sustain you for a long time, their hides are warm, and the wolves aren't zombies. They run if you throw a flare or swing a torch. All the mechanics are solid and they still claim it to be alpha. It's worth a purcase now, and they still regularly add things - just imagine what it could become. If you are any kind of fan of indie games, sandbox survival games, or real psychological terror, then this game is a 100% neccassary purchase. Wishlist it, right now, or better yet buy it.    If you want to see some footage as preview to see if its worth it, i reccomend ""Splattercat"" he's an ex geologist meaning he knows a lot about how to not die when you're in the wilderness hours from a town, and so he mentions what makes sense and what doesnt. But seriously, toss these devs a bone, let's make them rich, so they can finish the game and go on to make more awesome games. These guys put actual heart into the game, and that's rare lately.*New Addition to Review* Clarification on the three ""difficulties"" the ""easy mode"" is minecraft peaceful, nothing to kill you but your own stupidity. not reccomended. ""Normal"" is wolves and bears, wolves rabid, bears cool as long as you dont shoot them - and you back off if they stand on hind legs and roar (basically them saying ""f*** off"") - they're cool and wolves even avoid them, so keeping one near your base isnt an awful idea, although killing one will sustain you for weeks.  Hard mode is zombie apocalypse basically. if you want to be mauled to death every five minutes, go ahead. All this review is refering to the ""normal"" mode, i don't advise either of the others aside from if you think you want a real challenge... of luck (If you find a rifle before you find 60 wolves).

								This is going to be a long review.I am by no means a survivalist extrordinaire. I wouldn't last 5 hours in Minecraft. But this game makes you feel like you can survive anything... until you run out of matches. For example, here is how I last died. I ran into the Trapper's Homestead, sprinting to get out of the freezing cold wind. I was looking for food; peaches, candy, anything I could get in my belly. I looked through the locker, the box under the bed, the first aid kit on the wall, but didn't find anything but an old can opener. Then I looked up, and I swear I heard a heavenly chorus, because sitting on a rack on the wall was something so much more valuble than a granola bar. As I took the old hunting rifle off the wall, I felt a sense of awe come over me. I looked at the nicks and dents and thought of all the stories that they contain, and how many more tales I would write with this pen of steel and wood. After looking around a little more, I decided to try my hand at cracking the safe I found next to the workbench. After several tries I finally got the code down, and lo and behold, inside was a box of 5 rifle shells. By now I was feeling like Rambo. I would not die to this cruel world! I survived by hunting the game that I saw in the clearing in front of the homestead that I had claimed as my home, and cooking the meat that I carved off their collapsed frames. I lived this way for about a week, until one very important setback to my otherwise flawless plan - I ran out of matches. But I wouldn't let that tiny detail stop me; I am the great VinyGroundhog! I will not succumb to the meager needs of hunger or cold! And thus my journey begain. I searched from house to house for those tiny life-sticks, but each and every one had been picked clean on a previous venture. I realized that there was only one place where I could find what I needed, one place that I had avoided like the plague. I was going to have to tackle the dam. As I walked into the dam, flare in hand, I looked for Fluffy the Terrible, Killer of Men and Crusher of Souls. I searched through the entire dam for this beast of legend, but nowhere was she to be found. Not able to contain my exitement, I set about looting the dam with a newfound vigor. I looked in the main room. No matches. I looked in the closet. No matches. I looked in the control room. Still, no matches. Soon I reached the conlusion that I was going to have to go downstairs. I walked down the first set of stairs, and as I rounded the corner, there was a nightmare standing in front of me. I stared at Fluffy, and she at me. We stood at a sort of stalemate for around thirty seconds. And then I ran like a coward. I made it up the stairs and Almost made it out when I was knocked down from behind. As I looked at those menacing jaws that I had fallen to so many times before, I knew that I was nearing my end. We struggled for what  seemed an eternity, and then I finally kicked the evil beast off of me, turning and sprinting through the door as fast as I could. By now it was night, and probably had been for a while. I struggled away from that horrible place, blood dripping down into the snow beneath. I looked around in my pack, and found nothing to treat my wounds. I walked along the train tracks, freezing, starving, dehydrated, and bleeding to death. I looked around and saw that I wasn't going to make it. But I refused. I would not die on the terms of a wolf, no matter that it sent me here. And then I thought of a way that I could stand up to the tyranny of the wolf. I sprinted to the logging area, and then I found the hill I was looking for. I started up the hill, made it a few yards, and subsequently fell off the hill and sprained my ankle. But I wouldn't let that stop me. I started back up the hill, limping this time, and made it farther, and farther, and farther without falling. And as I hobbled up the last few yards of the hill, freezing, starving, dehydrated, limping, and tired as anything, I saw the sun start to rise. I walked over to the edge of the hill, my vision rolling with every step, and sat down, leaning against a rock. And as my life reached its dusk, the world around me reached its dawn.That is what this game does to you. It puts you on a high, which lasts a not inconsiderable time, and then it takes away one thing, and you begin this slow descent into your death. And that's why I love it. It's an Emotional rollercoaster. Everything that happens in the game impacts not only your in-game effigy, but you, as a living, breathing human being. However, there are a few things that I wouldn't mind changing...Hinterland, If you're reading this, Please take note. The game world is easily the loneliest one I have every encountered. It even beats pre-NPC Minecraft. Please fix this. Give me a dog, or better yet, multiplayer! What I wouldn't give to either help or hinder other players in the fight for survival.Birds. Everytime I see a bird in the game, all I can think about is the potential meat on those hollow bones. Just give me a way to hunt them, or trap them. a shotgun would be nice. All things considered, this is a very good buy. It's probably my favorite PC game right now. 10/10			"

								Steam is telling me I've played 426.8 hrs of this game at the time of this review. As you might have guessed, I am very fond of the game. I've held off on writing a review because I just don't think I can do the game justice, but I'll try. So what do I love about the game to warrant such an embarrassing amount of hours in the game? I'll try to explain: The graphics. They are beautiful and with the recent upgrade to Unity 5, the graphics became absolutely gorgeous. The beautiful snow-frosted branches of the trees swaying in the breeze; the stark mountains against a beautiful sometimes stormy, sometimes cloudy, and sometimes sunny skyline; The beautiful, but scary nighttime with the aurora borealis, moon, and stars smattering the sky; the bright green, glowing eyes of the wolves...er wait...more scary than beautiful those critters are. :)The sound. The voice actors are Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale at the time of this review. Veterans of the industry, with titles such as Mass Effect under their belts. The beautiful stinger music that signals a change in weather or time of day. The haunting, creepy music when you discover a corpse inside a house sometimes. The music is not overdone, perfectly placed, so you don't lose that feeling of abandonment. The sound effects, the creaking and groaning of the trees, the wind, footsteps crunching in the snow, the lonely hoot of an owl, the ringing in your ears when you shoot the rifle indoors, the skin-crawling sighing and muttering when in the ""creepier"" locations, the snarling, howling, and barking of the wolves. The sounds and music in the game are one of my most favorite aspects of the game and it's hard to list them all or describe the feelings of immersion you experience. You must experience them first-hand to truly ""get it"".The game mechanics. You have to be careful, you have to be smart, you have to be patient or you die. I love this, it's the player in full control, how long you survive is based on the decisions you make. Plan ahead, learn from past mistakes. Unlike most video games I don't mind dying in this game. I don't feel cheated because I learn what NOT to do or how I can do it better. The saying ""you make your own destiny"" seems applicable to the gameplay. It's a sandbox, there's no linear path you are forced to follow, you can immerse yourself fully and explore to your heart's content. There are three modes of play: easy, medium, difficult. A fit for everyone- from peaceful exploration to death around every corner.The developers. The developers have always been very involved in the community on Steam and also on their own Hinterland forum and Reddit. They are AAA title veterans who know what they are doing. The updates to the game are frequent and fun. Hotfixes practically same day. They have a zero tolerance for bugs in their game and it shows in this quality product. It's hard to believe it's an Early Access title. I haven't found a more polished one.The best part? It's like a free gift everytime there is an update. More fun stuff to check out for free! Another ""best part""...the sandbox will remain available even when story mode is released for the people who enjoy it. I'm looking forward to the story mode, but I adore the sandbox survival.TL/DR: Get this beautiful, quality game. It's Early Access with a twist - it feels like a complete game already!I hope this review helps someone. If not, drop by the forums, you'll find a wonderful and helpful community.			"

Early Access Review
								Possibly one of the best examples of early-access done right, The Long Dark is a fantastic game that just keeps getting better and better.The premise is simple.  Your plane crashed; it's cold; the wolves are hungry; the bear is angry; no one is around to help; and you've got to do whatever it takes to survive.What exactly does that mean?  At first, it means following your standard survival game behaviors.  Find shelter.  Find food.  Find water.  Don't let the wildlife eat you as you scour the frozen waste for the things you need.  But what separates The Long Dark from other survival games is that, ultimately, it also means learning the skills to procure those things for yourself.  Want to eat next week?  Better learn to hunt, because the cans of pork and beans you found in that gas station aren't going to last forever.  Want to not die of exposure?  Better learn to tell when a blizzard is coming, because it turns out building a fire in the middle of one is damned near impossible.  Want to look like a rock star?  Better learn to tan a deer hide and sew your own leather pants then--because remember, THERE'S NO ONE AROUND TO HELP.In this game, you're facing off against Mother Nature one on one.  And Mother Nature may be beautiful (and this game is unbelievably, strikingly beautiful), but Big Mama's also got fists like brick bats, one hell of a long reach, and she's currently undefeated.  So settle in and get ready for a full twelve rounds, Champ.  'Cause you're in for a doozy.			"

								Day 1: Looked around and saw a hydro dam. Decided to go in, got jumped by a wolf.Day 2: Ran out of food, found a deer carcass with sizeable amount of meat left. Got jumped by a wolf after harvesting.Day 3: After bit of exploring, arrived on a camp office with proper beds and some decent items. Got jumped by a wolf on the wayDay 4: Set out to look for some supplies in the cabins by the lake. Got jumped by a wolf, no bandages...*fades into The Long Dark*Best wolf attack simulator. 10/10 would get jumped by a wolf again.Other than the frequent wolf attacks which aren't that hard to fend off, I daresay this is one of the best survival games out there. No zombies, monsters or cannibals, just you against the nature. Hinterlands did a great job on this patch. Can't wait for this to be full release			"

Early Access Review
								When it comes to a sense of place, and of being, I don't think I've been as fully immersed in a game as I have in The Long Dark. Here's how it works...You wake up in the snow after your plane has gone down. WIth no idea as to where you are, cold, shivering, you need to find shelter fast and keep a sharp eye out for predators. Once you've found a cabin or such, you need to start thinking about the basics of survival. Water. A warm place to rest. Food. Clothing that can survive the harsh blizzards. A weapon to fend off wolf attacks. To gain the answer to these problems you must explore. At first you'll find yourself raiding abandoned cars and houses, trying not to think about the dead bodies scattered here and there following an as yet undetailed catastrophe. But the cans of pop and candy bars and such you scavange are only a temporary answer. Soon you'll have to look to be self-sufficient. Survive the first few nights and odds are you can survive a couple of weeks. Survive those two weeks and you might survive a month. Survive that and... who knows? The genius of the game is that it perfectly balances risk, need, fear and greed. You can get carried away and suddenly discover that you've neglected something vital - something life endangering. Forget to stay stocked with fuel and you could perish from being marooned in a cave by a blizzard. Fail to carry bandages with you and you might bleed out from a wolf bite on the snowy wastes. Dehydration especially is a danger. (And no, like in real life simply eating snow will not save you.) It can be a punishing game at first. Nothing is explained. I didn't know how to make tinder plugs or melt snow in my first game and quickly died after I ran out of my last can of fizzy goodness. But I made darn sure I figured it out the next game. The more you play, the more you find yourself thinking logically and weighing up the risks. Which is all well and good until you become obsessed about getting a bearskin bedroll and end up dooming yourself to be a chewy snack for DiCaprio's growly chum. Happily there's an excellent forum at the Hinterland website, which is very friendly. I strongly recommend it if you have trouble sussing out the game mechanics. Lastly I want to talk about what makes this game truly special. It's the marriage of beautifully crafted graphics with to my mind the best sound design since Battlefield: Bad Company 2's War Tapes. At first glance the graphics appear simplistic. But you quickly come to appreciate them as being truly evocative, especially in terms of weather. Seeing the deep tread of your footprints as you hear the muffled scrumpf of snow underfoot. Watching a sunrise from the porch of your farmhouse in the morning; a hot cup of coffee a personal treat to celebrate narrowly surviving a blizzard the previous day, as you finally recognised the tell-tale signs of an oncoming storm. Looking up to see the high altitude trade winds carrying aloft the first wave of a fresh snow. And the chilly haunting fog that closes in as you return home in the late evening, a brace of coneys over your shoulder. Even simple things like waking up in the cabin and hearing the walls creak and the windows rattle as the wind blows outside... man, this game is the most atmospheric I've ever played.So sure it's tough. And yes, wolves are unnaturally terrifying. But as soon as you come to terms with your inevitable death. As soon as you begin to treat it not as a game but as a real question of survival for yourself. And as soon as you learn to let go of trying to max everything out and just enjoy... existing... in this wonderful world HInterland have crafted. Well, then you'll find you've made something really special. Plus you can keep a journal in game!Any gripes? Each map could do with a forge, and whetstones really shouldn't break after a couple of dozen uses. (I know, game mechanic, but it's unnecessarily cruel.) Also rifles should have a longer effective range and arrows should be more available. Some items, like the maple needed to make a bow, seem unnecessarily rare and tricky to find.) And there should be a little starter guide with a few early-game lifesaving tips bundled with the game in the main menu. And I wish my character would quit complaining all the time about being hungry! It's good to be ravenous and make supplies last!Despite these niggles the game as it stands at this point in Early Access really is something quite magnificent. It is a transporting game that will have you feeling terrified at times, proud at others and most of all have you feeling that the little farmhouse in the valley has become a place of your own, a place that you can call home in a hostile world. With a story mode to come this game only looks set to become better, but for now I feel that I've definitely got my money's worth on the entrance fee. Congratulations HInterlands for recognising that surviving the natural world can be more thrilling than surviving yet another rehashed zombie invasion, and that the simple joy of felling a deer and filling one's pantry with venison as significant a victory as saving the planet in a shoot-em-up from the evil Emperors RaxinFraxin and Dixdastardlax.9/10P.S: You can find answers to many of those early game vexing questions here: http://hinterlandgames.com/join-the-community/ "

Early Access Review
								Words can't describe how much i love this game. So i'll just give you the lowdown of my favorite playthrough (Of dozens of great ones) Day 1: Plane crashed somewhere in the woods near a frozen pond and a hunting blind. I found (much to my joy) two granola bars and a bottle of water. Walking through the cold, i picked up a few sticks and some lichen just in case i needed to start a fire. After about 5 minutes of walking i found an old logging camp with three trailer houses. I scavenged a promising amount of food, got some matches, and even found an out ski jacket to wear over my sweater. Exhausted, i spent the night. Day 2: I wake up rested and thirsty as hell. I pop open a soda and head out. It's early morning and freezing, but i need to find a suitable place to bunker down, and those little trailers werent it. Following the snow covered trail through the woods, i pass a forest overpass. It's a long hike up in freezing weather and deep snow so i decide against, moving further down the trail. Right as i start to wonder if i had made the wrong choice, i hit a small frozen lake full of Ice-fishing huts. I dot through them and find a good set of stuff before i decide to bunker down in one for a little rest. After a few failed attempts i get the fire in the furnace going. I hear the wind picking up outside, but thinking nothing of it. I lay out my bedroll by the fire for a few hours sleep. I wake up to what i was sure to be my death. That light pickup of wind was a precursor to a blizzard. A bad one. The little hut was shaking and creaking in the storm, the opening (there was no door) let in frigid air and snow, putting out my fire and freezing me to the core. I gather my things in a panic. The storm is so fierce it's picking up snow that had settled on the ground, whiting out everything. I culdn't see five feet in front of me. Knowing staying in the hut would be my end, i blindly push into the storm, assumingly towards some camping lodges i saw when i first arrived. The wind cut straight through my clothes and the snow soaked my jeans, shoes and socks. My body trembled uncontrollably as heat was quite literally ripped from my body. After a few minutes the ice of the lake gave way to snow and i was sure i was close to salvation. I keep walking forward, waiting to see a beautiful log cabin any second.Then i walk straight into a rock wall.Panicking and wondering how the hell i got so turned around, i follow the wall, hoping beyond hope to find something to keep me safe until the blizzard gave way. I wasn't going to die yet, not here. I willed myself on, even when i felt so tired from the powerful wind i was ready to just drop. Eventually the rock wall gaveway to a some kind of house. Nearly collasping from relief, i get inside and fall asleep immediately, no energy left for anything else.Day 3:Apparentely this used to be a park ranger station. It was obviously abandoned in haste, as plenty of things were still left over. The blizzard is still raging, but im safe inside, with a decent supply to last me a few days. I cut up some furniture for wood with the hatchet i found in the closet and get the fireplace roaring. A get some snow quickly from outside and boil it for water, then i eat a hardy meal of beef jerky and a candy bar. I stay up a bit to assess my gear. Somehow i don't have hypothermia, but my pants looks a little worse for wear. I pathc them up with cloth then call it a day, i'm still exhausted from yesterday.Days 5:I'm stuck in the ranger hut for another full day. Finally, on Day 5 since my crash, the storm lets up to beautiful weather. I pack my things and head out, the Ranger station now depleted of useful things for me. I crunch along fresh now and a warm sun for a while, reminded of why i used to love skiing in New Mexico. After a while i find train tracks and few wrecked cars. It must of been carrying aid to somwhere becuase scattered amongst the snow i found antiseptic bottles, bandages, a bottle of painkillers and 3 flares. I rest for a bit and have a snack and a sip fo water, and move on. A little past 12ish i find what looks like an old hydrodam. Knowing there could be emergancy supplies and food inside, i make a beeline towards it and walk in, shutting the old iron door behind me.The place is pitch black. I have to light one of my flares just to see. I look around for a bit, find a prybar and some other useful items including some workers old scarf (My new scarf now), and decide i'm going to spend the night here. Wrong decision.As i preparing to set my bedroll down i hear a growl behind. Spinning around, the light from my flare provides me a eerie and terrifying look down the nearby hallway, where a wolf is looking right back at me, growling dangerously. Slowly, i begin to back out towards the door, and he charges me. I panic and throw the flare at him, which seems to scare him long enough for me to fly out the door and across the snow as fast as my damn legs could carry me. I run into the train tunnel and slow to a walk, trying to catch my breath, thank god the weather was still nice. I come out the other end just as the sun begins to set, and find myself in a massive ravine. After some hopping and skipping and a scary balancing act on a tree that feel across a 50 foot drop, i find a sheltered area behind a old train car and set up camp. I start a fire and give it enough wood to last the night. As i eat dinner i watch the sun set over the horizon. The light reflecting on far distant snow creates a beautiful allusion of fire, as if the horizon around me was burning briliantly. When it sets i am treated to freezing tempertures and a starry sky. I crawl into my bedroll and shut my eyes, hoping to god the weather treats me well.Day 6:I was lucky, i woke up to a light snow and nothing else. Hardly any wind. No wolves dragged me away last night so that was also a positive. Thanking my lucky stars i pack up and begin my journey west, to the coast. From there i planto keep heading down south to warmer weather. After traversing a particuarly large and rickety wooden train bridge (And almost falling to my death twice) i go through another tunnel and break out into the coastline. It was a beautiful sight. The sun glowing over all that sea ice. I would have watched forever if i wasnt freezing. Crawling down the mountain, i find another small trailer house (For the train unloading crew, i presume) and rest there. It felt nice to be inside again after almost 2 days in the wilderness. Day 7:One week after my crash. Woo... Anyway, i woke up to howling this morning. More wolves. I headed further down the hill, another flare at the ready (I didnt even bother wielding an Axe, im not a swordsman). Sure enough, i run into one near the highway. It circles me before charging. I throw the flare at it and it runs away. Relieved, i walk over to pick up the flare when suddenly another wolf turns the corner, running after me full speed. I turned and ran like hell towards a cabin down the road. But right before i got to the door he grabbed my leg and i tried. In moments he was on top of me, ripping at the arm i threw up to defend my body. I hit him over and over until he finally let go, running away and barking angrily. Bleeding and hurt, i crawled into the cabin to treat my wounds, sure this was the end. I treated my wounds with antiseptic, bandged them up and took some painkillers. Then i slept.I survived, and made my way to a cabin on a small island across the frozen bay. On my way, a white out struck. I couldn't see anything yet again. Walking slowly in hopes of not opening my wounds again. I pressed forward. Little did i know i had long past walked by the island, and was on thin ice. As the whiteout cleared, I looked up. It was as if every star in the universe was looking down at me. Somewhere in my mind, as the cold enveloped me, i wondered if anyone was out there...Then I fell through the ice.			"

								It's as good as I expected, and promises more, even with no story mode (still Early Access.)I loved it from the first moments, and I indeed died quickly from Wolf attacks until I learned to avoid them.I love the artwork, I love the sound design.  After playing as MacKenzie a few times I switched to the female character and I was surprised how much better I liked the female voice acting.I've died from wolves of course.  From infection.  Falling through the ice.  From dehydration.  I waited until I survived 5 days in the sandbox before I wrote the review.  Very glad to have picked this up, and looking for more in future updates.  One of the better Early Access titles along with Prison Architect.Update 2014-11-10:  I killed two wolves today, one with a .303 round (Canadians love that Lee-Enfeld) and one with a hunting knife.  This yielded 10kg of meat, which I cooked over an outdoor fire in a train tunnel to get out of the wind.  I'm trying to get moving from Coastal Highway where I started over to Mystery Lake.I'd like to add a technical comment.  The game loads quickly.  It is responsive.  I haven't seen many bugs, except one time on the western island of Coastal Highway I found a spot while climbing the hill from the west where I couldn't seem to wiggle out.			"

								Alas, I died on the 45th day.After growing more desperate due to my dwindling supplies I decided going out in the wild to check my rabbit snares at low health. I spotted a wolf eating my trapped rabbits, So I attempted to scare it off with a road flare (bit of a gamble). Instead it attacked me and although I was able to fight it off I was In poor shape and bleeding out. Rummaging through my pack, I realized I had no bandages with me (idiot). Ok, create bandage from a scrap piece of cloth ... no cloth in the bag. Tear off my hat and rip it to shreds, then create a bandage. Bleeding is stopped, My vision is hazy from the loss of blood, and I realize to my horror that I am freezing (wind has picked up and the wind chill temperature is well below -30 C). I struggle uphill towards my camp in the wind, but there is no use. I die alone in the woods, my body ravaged by hunger, cold, and countless wounds.Best game I've played in a long time.			"

								- Another survival game - I thought -but this time without zombies (finally i got sick of zombie games ).What's so atractive about wondering in a freezing environment in a  snow up to your oxers ? Where I camefrom the winter season is really harsh and I never enjoyed it...So I got this game thinking this is gonna be disaster but than I started to play it .I ate some granola bars ,drank some soda and went for a ramble across the lake disobeying sing ""weak ice"" .The ice cracked and so did I.I Went under the freezing water and died of hypoterima.Hmm I said to myself ...will I try again ? And I did .This time I was more carefull and and I lasted 5 days!!!From this point onwards I can't get enough of this game.The survival instinct kicked in and I started to harvest meat from dead deers ,or wolfes ,grab their fur and repair my clothes and shoes (fun as hell !!!:)).I was on the roll : I set up few traps and cought some rabbits ,went to a cabin andstarted fire in a fireplace ,cook some meat and melt a few kg. of snow for water.15th day...This is my 15 th day and I have found a rifle and 1 bullet ...is this some kind of suggestion??? No ,I wont give up!!!Day 20th.I lost my way to the cabin during heavy blizzard. When I finally got there I was down to 600 cal and 1l of water .No more supply .Thank God I still got 2 bullets in my rifle ,I've found those lieing in the snow.Spotted some deers ,two of them to be exact .I kneeled down and hold my breath .First shot...misses,second one... misses two .The deers are long time gone.Down to 300 cal.I am walking like a zombie .Fortunately I spotted human remains half buried in a snow.I have searched it carefully and I have found one bullet...I am going back to that place where I saw two deers .They are back ,I am crawlling slowly inch by inch holding my breath again .I can not miss this one !!!.I fired a shot and the deer got hit and fell.I got to it as quick as I could and scavenged 6kg. of fresh meat. My back pack is to heavy now so I can not really run.As I was heading to group of log cabins a wolf sniffed me out .I lighted up a flare hoping that this scare it of...he went for me .It started biting me viciously but I've managed to kick it of me.Applyed some antiseptic and bandage .The cabin is near ...so near but the wounded wolf is coming back...The Long Dark is absolutelly fantastic ,  it's a new dimention of survival games that will keep you trying to go further and further ,just one more day ,just to be able to survive one more night and see sun rising.This is only early acces game but playable as ♥♥♥♥ ,and there is still more content to come .Don't miss it ,go and get The Long Dark !!!

								The Long Dark. It can and will catch you unawares, even if you consider yourself one of the most prepared.It was on my 79th day that things started to go horribly wrong. I wandered off from the gas station I had for the past 40 days considered safe haven. I had a gallon of water, a rifle with plenty of ammo, and enough food to last me a night should I get stranded. It wasn't enough.I always thought it would be the wolves that would get me. They had been traveling in packs of 2-3 lately; if all of them came at me, surely I would take down one, maybe two, but I knew if a pack came at me I would be wolf bait. I was wrong. As I wandered up the coast, it started to get cold, as night drew closer. I heard an eerie baying close by - a wolf. I prepared myself, searching in all directions. It came charging, snarling and snapping its jaws. I took it down, but then I heard more growling - its pack. I knew standing my ground was a death sentence, so I ran, and I ran. To my luck, I came across a sea side cottage, to which I quickly escaped the snapping jaws of death in its enclosure. I thought to myself ""I'll just stay the night here, let the wolf pack wander off."" I foraged around for food - there wasn't much. Some salty crackers, a soda, and some frozen cooked rabbit. I drank half of my water, and ate some of my cooked wolf jerky that I had in my pack and began to kip for the night. I awoke to the screaming howl of the wind the next morning. I poked my head out and surely enough pure white out conditions. It had to have been at least -40, and going out would be just as surely a death sentence as the wolf pack was. I hunkered down, sipped my water and gnawed the last bits of the jerky as I drifted off to sleep to the symphony of cracking trees and ice falling. I woke a few hours later. The wind had died down! It was time. I drank the last of my water, and ate the cooked rabbit I had retrieved from the freezer previously.This was a mistake. Not long after I finished the rabbit, there was the gut wrenching pain. I knew instantly: Food poisoning. I forced down some antibiotics I kept in my med kit, laid down praying for it to go away, or the release of a quick death. The wolves didn't sound so bad, now. I drifted off to darkness...I awoke several hours later, the sun was just rising. I was starving, thirsty, and the howling wind was louder than ever. I had no choice. I steeled myself, eating the last few saltines in my pack, greedily drinking the soda I had found before leaving the house.I immediately bolted. I knew with this cold, I had very little time to get to safety. I ran and ran, only stopping mere moments to catch my breath. I was soon freezing, and I had no idea how much further I had to go. Soon, numbness set in, I stopped shivering, my body was giving up. I knew I had to keep pressing on. Finally there was a familiar car in the road. I was almost there! I was exhausted, I stumbled past the car. I could see the feint outline of the gas station through the wind and snow. There was hope! A few steps from the door I heard a growl; I turned around but it was too late. I couldn't fight  the wolf. I was too tired, too cold, too numb. On my 82nd day, I faded out, into the long dark.The wolves got me after all.			"

								First time I played this game, I sprained my ankle running away from a Wolf. I got lost, it got dark and cold and I started to freeze to death. With no light source, I saw the silhouette of a cabin and ran straight for it, avoiding all the glowing eyes of lurking Wolves pursuing me. Inside, I fumbled around with a packet of matches, dimly lighting my path as I crawled to the nearest bed and collapsed from fatigue.Ten hours later I woke up, drank some soda and chomped on a few energy bars before heading outside to a clear, sunny day and continued my journey. I can't think of any other game where that set of events could ever possibly unfold. And if this is what's on offer in early access, I can't wait to see what they come up with in the final release.Full video review:

Early Access Review
								Rummaging through garbage is a long and storied tradition in video games. Players have been raiding shelves and garbage cans for decades now, and it's hard to argue the popularity of Elder Scrolls and Fallout games is not thanks in part to the immense amount of junk you can scavenge. The Long Dark feels like an entire game built around looting, giving your lizard brain tingles every time your progress bar is interrupted by a new item. That's selling the game short, and I'll fix that, but when you're on a somber trek through a featureless snowfield, aching for a dresser to upturn, you'll remember I said that.The Long Dark strands you in the northern wilderness of Canada in the wake of a mysterious geomagnetic event. All the people are dead, all the animals are acting weird, and all the electricity is out. You have four bars to manage if you want to survive: Temperature, fatigue, hunger, and thirst. Scrounging up leftovers and boiling snow will cover the latter two, sleeping in beds and not running everywhere will keep your fatigue down, but traversing the wilderness will freeze you fast, making warmth your most sought-after resource. The game offers a pretty robust survival sim, with many interactions between objects. You can break things down for materials to repair other things, craft tools like bows and fishing lines, and cook and store food. Just making a fire is its own skill, involving starters and fuels and accelerants and chances to fail based on all that and where you're making the attempt. A clean and slick menu interface keeps you from staring at lists too long to accomplish all this, which is some very welcome design.A big part of the game (at least early on) is indeed finding houses to loot and clicking on all the containers, while being mindful of how much you can carry. In between looting sprees, however, are journeys across the frozen wilds. The Long Dark does not screw around here, as getting lost in the woods or running into some unpleasant wildlife can very quickly be the end of you. You need plenty of daylight for exploring, and if you're lacking warm clothes you really cannot stay out very long. When one of your resource bars, such as temperature, bottoms out, it starts a percentage countdown. When that hits zero, you die. Just being outside on a windy day for an hour or two can take your bar to zero, so you have to plan all your actions carefully. Intensive activities like chopping wood or fishing are abstracted to take up to an hour unto themselves, too. The constant threat makes the game an intense survival simulator, but the barren wastes between shelters that facilitates this design can get kind of boring to traverse.There are three difficulties to play on, depending on how eager you are to have wolves snap your appendages in half. You can also start in different areas once you find the paths to them from the starter zone, which can change your experience dramatically. The maps are not randomly generated, so having a few hours of exploration under your belt will most definitely help you survive longer. It seems that the game is designed around scavenging and getting your bearings for the first few days, and then transitioning to hunting and foraging for food and wood in true mountain man style to survive further. It's a long road to get there, though, with a lot of traipsing across snowfields and forest paths, but the painted art style and minimalist soundtrack make the solitude meaningful, and give the game a somber, melancholy feel. If you have the patience for planning long, deadly walks through the wastes, this is a solid survival choice.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT: This review is indeed out of date! Hence why I included the date in it originally, part of the problem with early access. So take it with a grain of salt, and I'll certainly update it when I get back to it all for another peek.Original review:It seems ""not recommended"" reviews get downvoted to hell but I'll try my best to explain ASAP. Early Access review as of early January 2015:TLD has a very outstanding art style, reminiscent of Telltale's Walking Dead games, and is largely a PVE scavenging game. There's unfortunately very little motivation to go very far as it is. There's very little crafting, no building, and you're not so much 'lost in the wild' as you are just moving from house to house with some stuff in between, scavenging.I realize it's in alpha and there's more to come...but at the moment there isn't much there. However...what IS there is very good, the art style, UI, the world and levels, the mechanics behind the survival aspects like hunger and warmth, etc. There just isn't too much level interaction, creativity, and a lot of just waiting around. Lots of waiting. You don't actually gather wood, you wait. Cooking food? Wait. Sleeping, crafting, scavenging.. is all waiting.""Not recommended"" is NOT the same thing as ""this is a bad game"" or ""I don't like it."" It's just at this particular moment, I wouldn't say there's enough in there to really get it. Will edit my review as time goes on and mechanics change. I like what there is so far, and it looks promising.			"

								Writing a new review, because my previous Positive review was out of date due to several new updates and bugfixes. (And just editing the old one was just too much of a PITA...)For me- the game is a 10/10. A must have. But for recommending to others I will give it a solid 8/10, in it's current form.Pros-Challenging game, easy to learn but hard to master.  NO ZOMBIES OR INFECTEDS Super Community, on Steam and online- one of the least toxic on Steam (though Trolls exist everwhere...) Suspension of disbelief is relatively easy with this game. Some mechanics and content are not IRL realistic, but none are so unrealistic that you have to be muy loco to understand and work with them. Dedicated development Team and Studio. They are very active on the Steam forums and their own online forums, very open and transparent, as much as they can be without spoiling Story Mode and other end game content. Don't let the recent shill-trolling attempts to discredit Hinterland fool you. A few Trolls and their alts are doing a job trying to make the Devs look bad, much credit to Hinterland for not smashing them down, and handling it all very civilly. Multiple Difficulty modes to choose from, from ""relatvely easy"" to ""Insanity mode"" - Pilgrim, Voyageur, Stalker and Interloper. Each has it's own chalenges, and have you adjusting your playstyle to adapt and survive. Permadeath. All Difficulty Modes.  Every choice you make may be the one that gets you killed, or saves your life. For another day, at least. Immersive art style and music. Art is a watercolor painting, Unity style, that suits the game very well. Not overly complex, not overly simple. The somewhat stark feeling of the art fits the stark nature of the game well. The music is haunting, foreboding and set to locations and  events well also. It enhances the tension wihtout being overly loud and dramatic, like some survival games are. It's a personal and subjective thing. I love the art style and music, but your mileage may vary. Widely.  Cons-  Game can feel a bit tedious after you have survived for a long time. Especially if you ""play it safe"" and hang out on only 1 map, in one base, and don't explore and take chances. However, the game is not finished yet, and new content and Story Mode (when it comes out) should help with this. And the Challenges- (more linear, timed, and set goal-oriented , appropriately-named games are a really nice change of pace if Sandbox Mode becomes too drawn out. Updates have slowed recently, with new bugs that need fixing, as the game nears completion. Honestly, this is more a Con because of the recent plague of trolls on the forums trying to discredit the Devs. That is more troublesome and aggravating than the actual wait for new content, bug fixes and mechanics tweaking. For me, at least. The Trolls will say otherwise. And will downvote this review as soon as they see the ""Positive"" thumbs up icon. *SMH*All in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a real challenge, and is looking for a more realistic survival situation than the many Zed and moster based survival games on the market. But... it is still in development, still unfinished. But the game is becoming much more than was originally envisioned by the Devs, promising a much richer, more immersive open-worl Sandbox survival game, with a bigger and more pakced Story Mode to come. But patience is key right now. Some of us have it, others do not. If you don't you may want to wait for v1.0 and Story Mode to hit full release before you buy.For me it was worth paying full price for, definitely worth it if you can wait to get it on sale. Hundreds of hours played already, and I see myself playing hundreds more as new content is added, and after Story Mode is released. But your mileage may vary. "

								I bought this game over a year ago, and I've seen it grow and change. It's gameplay mechanics have been altered completely, completely new areas have been added, and I see bug fixes almost instantly. The one thing that hasn't changed, however, is the fear it evokes. The devs completely nailed atmosphere. The music is eerie, the sound of your footsteps crunching on the snow urges you forward, and when it's pitch black and you wake up to a lone wolve's howl, well, it forces chills down your spine. You either press on, or you die. Fire is your best friend. Your attentiveness to the noises around you may save your life. The art leaves you looking forward to the sunrise the next morning, or paranoid as shadows dance over every shape around you. The gameplay is solid. The hud is minimal. The little details truly make it an immersive game. The voice acting when your character is over-encumbered or thirsty, the descriptions of all the items you pick up, and the first-aid system are all lovely examples. The Long Dark is personable. It's uniqueness in atmosphere and gameplay leaves you utterly alone and terrified and willing to fight. This is the most immersive survival game I have ever had the pleasure of playing, and I eagerly await story mode.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game when it came out a few months ago and after reading through some of the reviews people have posted I wanted to mention a few things that no one seems to talk about (maybe someone did, I didn't read all the reviews).First off I know this is an early access game and is subject to improvement, that being said it has been over a month since anything has been added/changed to the game. The last major ""improvement"" to the game was the addition of a new zone.My problem with this game is that it is extremely limited in it's current state and it seems like the devs have drastically slowed down in their progress. In it's current state this game is worth about 5-10 hours of gameplay to most people. The problem is that after you find good clothing and a gun there truly is nothing left that this game offers. It turns into an endless cycle of forage wood -> melt snow for water -> kill a deer/wolf for food -> sleep. Sadly the only other thing there is to do is ""explore"" and loot, however the cabins and other buildings around both maps are quite generic. In the new map I exit out of the game after 30 minutes of running around and searching 30 drawers per house, because that's all there is to do.I'm not saying this isn't a nice game, it has a lot of potential and for the first few hours it is quite fun but I wouldn't buy it if you're expecting to get a lot of hours of gameplay. You'd be better off going for one of the thousand generic zombie survival crafting games because although they all basically do the same god damn thing and 95% of them aren't finished games, there is still 10x more to do in them than in The Long Dark.If the devs didn't quit on this game yet it can turn into something great, for now I would not recommend. Let the down votes begin, someone had to say it.***EDIT*** Feb.10/2015As per request I am gonna do a short update on this review. There was a large new region added a few days ago. This region doubled the sandbox size. Apart from the new region I've noticed you can now craft a few pieces of clothing that you can't get as loot, and some sort of medicine you can make using plants that you find. Apart from this the only new thing I've noticed is the addition of bears. Everything else is exactly the same, you forage wood, kill animals/fish, melt snow, and loot generic cabins and houses. As I expected this update simply gives a larger total sandbox size, yet does nothing to enhance the gaming experience.If the devs are reading this, you guys need to do something new. Stop working on generic maps that give you close to nothing new to do, finish the storyline cuz that♥♥♥♥♥♥sounds like it could be fun as hell. Work on a more complex crafting system, and in general start thinking outside the box because currently you guys just seem to be adding more of the same♥♥♥♥♥♥with the smallest of changes. It's just sad to see a game like this that has a lot of potential follow a one way street that is taking it nowhere. I hope anyone reading this review doesn't misunderstand me, I personally like this game and I am rooting for it. However, the way it is going it's just simply not worth the money, anyone considering this game should wait until it's fully released (comes out of early access).***Update on review***This is not an update for the game, just wanted to comment on all the feedback that this review has been getting. First off let me start by thanking everyone who contributed to this review, I am amazed at how much attention this has gotten! Getting to the point though, a lot of you have been posting stupid replies that in no way contribute to the effectiveness of this review. If you want to comment on my opinion, by all means. I will leave comments up here that disagree with me because everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but if you comment repetitive spam that does not contribute to this review it will be removed. Stuff like ""youre stupid man this game is awesome dont listen to him"" is not useful for people doing research on this game. If you want to dispute my opinion at least put in some time and give reasons as to why you think I am wrong, I will gladly leave those kinds of comments up.@Hinterland, all of your comments will be removed because this a non-biased review written by a consumer who supports your game and wants it to grow. That being said, it is unfair that 90% of other reviews, gameplay videos and stuff like that misrepresent what the average consumer will get out of this game. I suggest you take all the criticism you get from all of your negative reviews with grace and use them to further  the development of this game because the negative reviews are the ones that help you guys figure out what needs to be improved on.Big thanks to everyone for the support, you guys are awesome! :)			"

Early Access Review
								Update:6 months have passed since I wrote this review.The roadmap has been public for almost 8 months now and 23 of the 27 items in the ""1 - 6 Month"" category are still ""not ready yet"".A new update is mentioned that should be released soon and contain the clothing update.Maybe it will also contain the Steam Trading Cards that should have been released two updates ago. Maybe it won't.A very generous summary of the ""progress"" would be about 9 months for about a third of the things they wanted to address in 6 months and this describes pretty well the discrepancy between what Hinterlands keeps telling and what they keep delivering.Yes, they are still delivering updates.But at this pace all those things that were supposed to take ""1 - 6 Months"" won't be done before 2018.Original:I bought The Long Dark as an Early Access title in December 2014, because I liked the overall setting (Winter, Single-Player, Survival), the independent developer Hinterland introduced themselves as experienced game developers (""veterans of the industry"", ""AAA titles"") and the goal was to develop the first episode of a narrative story in about 3 months time, while offering a Sandbox as a playable testing environment in the meantime.The atmosphere and setting of the game are really great. The artistic style is consistent, fitting and most of all very pleasing. Hinterland have taken some liberties in portraying wildlife and occasionally favored game design over realism, which I find is nothing to complain about.But 18 months and three failed release dates later it is still in Early Access and without any released episodes of the announced Story Mode. It's difficult to tell how long it'll be until Story Mode is completed because Hinterland have stopped giving new release dates and engaged in a rigorous ""it's done when it's done"" approach.There are quite a lot of people who seem to be fine with playing just the Sandbox for all this time, stating that they don't want or care for the Story Mode. However, I actually bought this for the narrative story and Sandbox simply doesn't hold any interest for me anymore. You can't actually do that many different things in the current game and just trying to survive for one more day without achieving anything else than surviving for one more day is simply not my cup of tea. This is especially true since many of the in-game activities are represented by abstract progress bars that simly show the passage of time. You never actually see your character repairing, crafting, eating, harvesting or cooking. The maps are also static, so after some time you know the environment like the back of your hand.After having failed the most recent release window Hinterland published a roadmap for the future development in April 2016, containing development items categorized into ""0 - 6 months"", ""6 - 12 months"" and ""12+ months"".Unfortunately, Story Mode is not a part of that roadmap.The roadmap was recently updated, after 2 months had passed. It seems they are trying to put 4 of 27 items of the ""0 - 6 months"" category into the June update. The remaining items are in the same category as in April, meaning what was thought to be 6 months away in April is still 6 months away in June.So instead of one big change to the anticipated release date once a year, there are now several small ones. It might look better because instead of announcing a change to the planned release date, they are simply not updating the planned duration until completion, but the effect is still the same. With this approach I'm afraid the roadmap will take years to reach anything close to completion and Story Mode may not be coming for quite some time.While it might sound great that a developer is actually delaying a product because ""it's not ready yet"", I cannot recommend an Early Access title that keeps postponing its release on the sole premise of always needing more time.Sadly, it seems The Long Dark is following the poor tradition of broken promises and seemingly endless development phases that plague Early Access.

Early Access Review
								When people hear survival game, they usually think something like DayZ, H1Z1, Rust, and -- for whatever reason -- Minecraft. I like to think The Long Dark is the only survival game that does it right. Games like Rust have elements of hunger and thirst, but are also multiplayer games where stuff like that is hard to balance without it being unfair; they become afterthoughts and the real focus of the game becomes the interaction with other players (which, more often than not, just end up in being griefed and losing everything you may have worked for).The Long Dark is lonely, not because its a singleplayer game, but because of the environment it sets you in. The canadian wilderness, freezing and full of snow, is probably not the most ideal place to be if you aren't smart enough to survive. Within the first ten minutes of playing, your goal should be to find shelter to shield yourself from the cold and scavenge for provisions. Warmth is essential in this game, just like hunger, thirst, and sleep is. Achieving a delicate balance is hard because you are always going to be needing something so you don't end up catching hypothermia, or dying of thirst and hunger. Those aren't the only threats in the game, however. If you play on the normal difficulty, you'll have a nice grace period before things like wolves and bears start spawning and making it much harder for you to traverse the wilderness. The hardest difficulty has these things up and running right off the bat. Wolves are especially dangerous, because they are more than willing to chase you down to the ends of the earth unless they lose sight of you mid chase. Things like decoys help to distract them but you end up losing food as a result; rifles can also be used to take them out from a distance, but you end up wasting ammuniton which is a precious commodity.There are small details in this game that show you just how well they crafted this. Things like how the items you carry make different sounds, the way you can interact with your environment like harvesting shelves and tables for wood, and how the more tired you get, the less you can carry until you are well rested. These small things make such a big impact on how you play the game at times. For whatever price they are asking, The Long Dark is absolutely worth every cent. There is a lot of replayability with the different environments you can play in, and there will be more to do with every update and when story mode finally hits. If you love survival games, or perhaps this is the first time you are going to try one, its essential you pick up The Long Dark.			"

Early Access Review
The Long DarkThe Survival Genre keeps growing on Steam and it has become a difficult decision to put our trust in a game, even worse if it's still being developed after years without knowing a release date. Perhaps we find a dedicated team who is working non-stop on their project, but then we ask ourselves, what do they offer us unlike the other hundred titles?  The Long Dark captivated me since the first time I saw it. The art style looked unique in the genre, and Early Access was going well, so I decided to give it a try. The game starts with us selecting the mode we want to play (Sandbox is the only one currently available) and then we customize it by choosing the difficulty between: Pilgrim (Easy, meant for exploring and learning the basics), Voyageur (Medium, for intermediate players) and Stalker (Hard, for those who are well known of the game mecanics). Then we get to choose the Region, each one offers a different experience basing on the safe places and resources we can find. After we finished selecting all the options, the game starts. We are alone without any idea where we might be, there's no map and we only have a few resources in our inventory. We start feeling cold as we walk trough the snow looking for a shelter... and then we wonder if anybody else survived from the plane accident. In The Long Dark we need to take care of four main needs: Hunger, Thirst, Sleep and our body Temperature. But here's a new addition to the formula: Calories. These are bound to our needs and it will be constantly changing. We regain them by eating and lose them by sleeping, just like real life. They also decrease faster if we are out in the cold, and every action that we perform will cost us calories, such as running or destroying a furniture to obtain wood. But that's not all, there is also a  tab where we can check the current temperature and how it affects us, the percentage of Windchill, and bonus we get against cold depending on the clothes that we are wearing, among others. And then we have the Condition/Affliction tabs, and they will change if we get hurt or ill, from food poisoning or hyphotermia to name a few.In terms of Gameplay, there's always a sense of vulnerability when we are out in the open, and not just from the weather. Wildlife is a very important aspect in The Long Dark and it affects both Combat and Crafting. Pack of Wolves and Bears are going to haunt us if they get to see us. If we were lucky enough to find a rifle or a bow and we succesfully defend ourselves, the player gets food and fur, which can be crafted in clothes or even a bedroll. Also, the animals can interact with themselves and the player can use this in his own advantage. Wolves get terrified when there's a bear nearby, for example. There is a lot more to know about the Combat and the gameplay itself, but I'm not going to spoil the experience. I want to talk about what  The Long Dark creates around the player. The atmosphere is the best part of the game and something that shouldn't be left behind but get improved in Early Access. Both characters have their own voice with a decent voice acting and they often make a comment while they are performing and action or are in need of something. But what really shines about The Long Dark it's the Sound and the details. The game also has Music but it only appears in certain moments (And it does it very well). At first I didn't like this decision, but it really helps creating the atmosphere. Also, the sound of our surroundings is really important in the game.Finding a place to spend the night and hearing the wind crashing against the windows, starving in the middle of nowhere, hearing Wolves nearby when a few hours ago we fell from a cliff and we still couldn't get patched up, or lighting a Storm Lantern that shows to us a corpse in the ground. This is what the game is all about, our personal experiences with it and the constant feel of desolation and loneliness.  The Long Dark also provides the player with a tab that includes all Stats per day. How long we managed to survived, the locations we came across, the calories we burned and the percentage of how much we have explored. It also has a Notes section, and the player is allowed to write anything in it. It's a great detail for keeping track of details and locations we want to explore next, or just for writing our every day story. What are the plans for the future?	The Story Mode will be launched in Spring, and it's going to offer around 3 to 4 hours of Storyline. The remaining episodes will be released over the course of 2016. We will get to play as the bush pilot Will Mackenzie, and Dr. Astrid Greenwood, alternating between them and experiencing the story from their own perspectives. This content is going to be free for Kickstarter backers and players who supported the game during Early Access.

								The Long Dark, so far, is an amazing survival game. Survival games have been all about zombies or similar creatures, never the pure realistic struggle against nature. That's where The Long Dark comes in. It's not a friendly game despite it's soft art style, you will starve to death, freeze to death or die to exhaustion (not to mention wolves). It uses this kind of cell shading graphics yet it impresses for how much it feels real. The sense of clinging to life is always present when you constantly find new places, train tracks, trailers, a dam, makes you hold on to hope, for a better day tomorrow. There's a lot of potential.+ Fresh new take on survival games+ The constant need to keep on your toes+ Beautiful art style+ This is just sandbox Early Access, story mode should hopefully be great- The game can really be unforgivable so expect frustration (I fell on a ravine and got a sprained ankle, I had to walk for hours before finding painkillers to fix it)- The game needs to be balanced, for example you need to eat way too oftenFeel free to check my experience with it:

Early Access Review
								This is probably the best survival game ever made! Because it's so different from all the others, where you have to fight hordes of zombies, monsters or cannibalistic mutants. In this game the only enemy, you're facing is nature itself. Although it is an alpha-game and you only can play ""Mystery Lake"" in the sandbox-mode so far, it's still the best game I've seen for long. Also the graphics style very is different, but very beautiful, looks just like an oil painting.You're a lone survivor in the northern canadian wilderness and have to stand against the elements. Explore the (damn cold) area of Mystery Lake, find shelters and loot anything useful, you can find. But be aware of the hungry wolves scouting around as well as ""Fluffy"" , who resides in the dam. Try to use the found goods as best you can and try to stay alive as long as possible.As mentioned, it's alpha, BUT I can't understand people, who give this game a negative rating, just because It's alpha. Most of them say, they enjoyed the game, but it needs work. But when it's fun, why then the negative rating???In my 42 hours of playing, I had lots of fun so far, especially in my first try, when I met ""Fluffy"" right at the start in the dam, he bit me twice, got me down to 4% condition, I walked to camp office, froze me down to 1%, got to camp office, entered and died right in front of the potbelly stove after only 6 hours survival time.The next tries went way better, made 16 (!) hours in 2nd try and 37 (!!) hours in 3rd, but best one is my current run, in which I am currently at day 91, but with no more ammo.At the beginning, the most fun is, when you explore everything, find new places and loot anything you can carry, then you develop you own way of playing, make it better the further you get, of course make mistakes, but nevertheless it is huge fun. All the mistakes, that you make, will help you doing better next time and this is even more fun. Then, after maybe 20-30 days, you have a routine in the game, because you can't explore anything new and your days only contain hunting, cooking, melting/boiling water, eating, drinking, sleeping and foraging wood, maybe repairing, if you're lucky.But even this is kinda fun, cause you are just trying to survive as long as you can with less and less goods. You see the end coming and asking yourself: ""How much further can I go? Will I live to see the next day?""As I said, even though it's an alpha build, it's a huge fun to play this game and I can't wait for new updates, that'll make this game even better!			"

								I'm not into all these survival sandbox games, but this is what I can call a good one actually. It throws you into the wild nature of snow mountains  and all you have to do is survive by eating food, drinking water, staying in warm places and being healthy. It may sound easy, but believe me - it's not. There are a lot of different ways of dying and you never know what will kill you this time, so the game itself makes you feel nervous. The graphics isn't on a high level, but it's pretty stylish and accurate, sometimes it can demonstrate you some really good-looking sights, and its sound is just fine. A unique atmosphere of being alone in the neverending permafrost leaves a nice aftertaste. Will be waiting for the new updates.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought The Long Dark sort of on a whim. I had some money left over during the Steam summer sale after I had bought all the games I had planned to buy. After looking at the screenshots and reading some reviews I decided to try the game.I've played survival games before, but none really left an impact on me as I was playing and after I had ""finished"" like this game did.I started the game clueless, on a hill looking over a few trailers. I figured out the mechanics pretty quick, and was instantly impressed by the art style. unfortunately, I only made it ~30 minutes before I died, but I leraned from that first time.This game is made in Unity (the same engine as angry birds 2), but looks absolutely stunning because of the fantastic art direction. Everything in the game looks like it belongs in a watercolor painting. It is one of my favorite games ever, visually, even including 8th generation games. At night, the landscape is bathed in darkness, and in the daytime it's bright and vibrant. In the afternoon, the sky is bright red and orange, and looks magnificent. In blizzards, you can barely see 5 feet in front of you and looks and sounds menacing.The sound design in this game is also amazing. Aside from the often foreboding ambient music, you'll get used to only the desolate sounds of your own footsteps, aside from when you hear the growl of a wolf or the grunt of a bear.The gameplay is very good, and fairly challenging. You have to make sure you have enough supplies to survive, which means venturing out, where you could be killed by wolves, bears, or the cold. You're always making calculated risks, and if you make them well, you'll survive, if not, you'll end up as one of the frozen corpses you find in the snow. It's also very slow and tense. When the sun was going to set in 3 hours and there were wolves all around me, but I was overburdened, tired, and cold, every footstep towards safety seemed to take an eternity. But then, that's the point.I personally never encountered any bugs or glitches, aside from some VERY small graphical glitches. My experience with this game overall was phenomenal, but unfortunately cut short by a bad decision(shooting a bear in the♥♥♥♥♥,which is why I put ""finished"" in quatations).Overall, this is a game I would highly reccomend to just about anyone, unless you're not a fan of planning and management. The quiet intensity and beauty of The Long Dark make it a very memorable and exciting experince to play. (just don't shoot a bear in the♥♥♥♥♥, trust me)			"

Early Access Review
								Unique, immersive, atmospheric first person survival simulation The Long Dark is totally living up to my expectations. The tension of trudging through a blizzard while freezing and starving to death has never been so fun! If you are not interested in a fairly punishing experience of scavenging for food and shelter just to survive then this game is not for you. It is not exactly real life but it most certainly is on the simulation end of the spectrum. There are no supernatural or magical elements; they are going for real life so wolves not zombies. The screenshots capture the beauty of the stylized wilderness in TLD and while it does look good in game, realize that this is the Unity engine and not Cryengine so it is very basic and somewhat grainy and ugly at times. The music certainly adds to the experience and I am excited for the story mode which is acted by veteran voice actor Mark Meer and others. My largest disappointment would have to be the lack of different maps or a system for procedurally generated maps. In sandbox the loot and materials you gather to survive are random, however the layout of the map is designed for the story mode and so it is the same every time. This means that once you learn the map it informs gameplay as you know what items can be where, and you lose that sense of exploration. It's not the end of the world but it is a legitimate gripe however it is understandable for a $20 game from new startup studio who was crowd funded through Kickstarter. Perhaps it can be a DLC addition down the road if everything goes well. Despite this there are still many hours of enjoyment within the game, after only a few play sessions I have survived for around 8-9 hours and am looking forward to many more as the game develops.

Early Access Review
								Mrs. Tamigochi had survived 14 days without trousers...But - after surviving countless wolves and even a bear attack, that left her 2% from death -  upon entering pleasant valley she found herself exposed, at night, in a blizzard.With nowhere to shelter, the temperature fell to -40 degrees, the fire blew out, and she was forced to press on or freeze to death. In a desperate panic, she forgot her bedroll and, when the storm lamp ran out of gas, fell blindly over the edge of Heartbreak Bridge, twisting her ankle with a sickening snap.Suffering from hypothermia, using the torn pages of a book found in a car, a few sticks and lighter fluid, she managed built a fire that lasted long enough to burn the coal she brought out of the caves. Fate was smiling, as the light from the fire illuminated a fallen branch, that provided fuel enough to kept her warm until the sun started to rise.When the blizzard cleared, she laughed with overwhelming joy at the sight of a red building 200m across the field. At 30% condition, exhausted, she slowly dragged herself to the barn.The laughter soon turned to cursing, as a black bear appeared over a nearby ridge. She dropped all but her essential kit, swallowed the last few painkillers and sprinted for the door, the bear's footsteps thudding behind her.Here she was able to sleep in an abandoned pick-up, waking occasionally to chew cat-tail stalks and drink soda.24 hours of nursing later, she is fit to face the outside world once more - Eating the last of the dog food she found inside a tool chest, drinking dirty water, she resolves herself to find a new pair of trousers.-----Just as I thought this game was starting to get boring - Mystery Lake isn't very big - I found a door I'd not used before. Now there is 3-4x the game world, much more challenge and a reason to keep going on. The game doesn't want to let me go. Mrs. Tamigochi hasn't had such badass survival stories since Project Zomboid - this game is as good as PZ.I've not felt that I've overcome a certain death situation in a game since... Ages...I got it on sale, £8, after an email about wishlist sales. It is great. I am loving every minute.Not read a single guide. Posted a few times in the forums about glitch and tech stuff only.I'd advise NOT reading anything about the gameplay, watching any videos or looking at wikis or whatever - it would destroy the experience...Still don't know what rosehips are for (not for making tea, it seems). Took two lives dying of thirst to figure out how to melt snow. Can't use moss as tinder... Some pathfinding exploits are possible with wolves and bears... The trousers just broke for no reason when I was looking at them, 50% to 0% with a tearing sound... Haven't found any since...There are lots of survival games, most with zombies. I've played a lot of them - This one beats them all, I reckon. I hope it lasts as long as (Arma2) DayZ or Project Zomboid, because I still like to fire them up now.I love, love, love Fallout, but... I'm playing this instead of Fallout 4 right now.Really nice game - surprisingly immersive and totally absorbing. Hope it gets some kind of headtracker support, and not just oculus rift (who can afford that?).The most fun I've had without pants since last time my gf stayed over.(she loves it too).			"

								My goodness... this game.After surviving 54 days and counting, I figured I had enough knowledge about the game to write a review.First off... If you are looking for a survival game that follows all of the cliches (Zombies, Monsters, punching a tree with your bare hands to get wood, Etc..)  You've come to the wrong place. This is a more realistic approach to the survival genre.  This game pulls no punches when it comes to long term survival.  From the second that you are thrusted into this unforgiving enviroment, you simply have to survive on your own.  No tutorials. No microtrasnactions that give you a leg up. Just the clothes on your back and the will to survive. It's quite refreshing actually. Obviously there are some things that could be implimented to make gamplay a bit more enjoyable. (Its early access for crying out loud)- Co-op Multiplayer (even though the devs refused the idea)- More firearms- A bigger map- Survivor NPCs- More crafting recepiesBut with that said... The sandbox mode alone is worth the $20 pricetag. Imagine what future updates will bring.The devs have already promised a story mode, and the game is updated pretty frequently. Fantastic game even in early access. 9/10			"

								I thought about buying this game last time it was on offer... and the time before that. This time I actually did. WOW. This genre is fantastic. Survive in the wilderness. You think humans are top of the food chain ... until you meet a hungry wolf with only one bullet left in your hunting rifle (which inevitably misses). Then you pull out a flare to ward it off, but it's too late, the pack is now following you. 100 yards to go to the shelter, stamina is running out... time is running out. You close your eyes, knowing the wolves are about to bite at your ankles. Then ... silence. The wolves are gone. I'm safe! ... but there is a reason the wolves are gone...11/10			"

								I'm finally at a point to where I feel like I can leave a fair review for this game. I'll start with the day one scenario. You load into a world based on a few different spawn points. The weather will be random upon loading in, so depending on a little RNG - you might find yourself in a very bad situation. However, this is a good thing, this lets you know very quickly what your goals are in this game. You have to stay alive.The game doesn't hold your hand for the most part, and you have to be able to think on your feet, and make life and death decisions on a daily basis. You're contending with the weather, hunger, thirst, and your overall ""health"" - which can change based on injury and various other ailments.The only RNG I have really seen in the game is when it comes to weather, loot placement; which loot does NOT respawn in game, so you must use it wisely/strategically, and things that require a skill - such as lighting a fire, or repairing an object. The more you do a skill based task, the more skill you gain in doing so, much like real life. This is perfect because it means that you won't die simply due to RNG. There is plenty of content to see in game, especially with the added maps (for free!). The free maps they added also allow you to transition from one map to the next, you're free to go back and forth as you please. This gives you the ability to setup a base in one map, then move to a whole other map once you feel like you've depleted the resources on your first map. And there is a sense of wanting to keep your survivor alive for as long as possible. Death is permanent, and when it does happen, it's very upsetting - but it also leaves you retracing your steps that led up to it. You learn from your deaths, and you learn what mistakes to not repeat. I haven't experienced any game breaking bugs, and only a few minor crashes (2 in nearly 20hrs of play time). I have to recommend this game because it has everything; solid mechanics, good loot, nice graphics, minimal bugs, tons of content, and it's actually a survival game. I'm going to end this review with a little comparison if you will. The issue I have with other games in my library is that they market themselves as survival games, when in fact they are open world sandbox games with a couple survival mechanics thrown in. This game isn't about building fancy houses, it's literally about staying alive. You're not going to be crafting guns out of soda cans and a few nuts and bolts laying around. You won't be taming dinosaurs, or fighting cannibals with an Emergency Hatchet. You will be moving from location to location trying to gather enough supplies to keep you alive for another day. The balance is very fair, and there is a lot of realism to the game. Yes, it's still just a game at the end of the day, so they had to account for that with some elements of game-play (otherwise no one would survive a week), but for the most part they kept it as realistic as possible. If you're looking for a solid survival game, that focuses on actually surving - then I don't think you'll find a better game. If you're tired of ""survival"" games where you're stuck crafting up a tech tree, constantly building bases, and walking around with no purpose, then this is the game for you.TL;DRSolid mechanics.No RNG deaths.Several maps that all connect in game. True sense of survival. Highly recommended if you're looking for a real survival game.			"

								I like this game, but it brings back bad memories for me.We used to live in an old farmhouse that was poorly insulated and lacking central heat. Had to use a woodstove (much like the kind in this game) to keep warm. The house was too big and the stove wasn't big enough to heat the whole house. The wind would hit our house at a south-easterly direction with no trees to shield it. The bathroom, which was also the room where the main water line entered the house, was the first to freeze over. No amount of preparation would prevent our pipes from freezing. When the water inside your toilet tank turns into a solid ice cube you know you are in real trouble. We had to go back to mother nature and live like animals for weeks at a time. We moved our beds into the living room to be closer to the stove, but in extreme temperatures the warmth provided little comfort. I got real bad sick and couldn't work anymore. My wife had to haul firewood in from outside by herself because I was too sick to help. The cold prevented us from getting real sleep. Imagine sleeping fully-clothed and in a winter coat, four blankets on your bed, a raging fire next to you, and still being able to see your breath in the cold air.The pain in my chest and the coughing fits made it even worse. I was diagnosed with double pneumonia and spent a week in the hospital during blizzard conditions. I was thankful for the warm room the hospital provided, but at night I could still feel the bitter cold seeping in through the closed windows.We live in a better home now with reliable heat, but playing this game reminds me of those bad times. Therefore I have to rate this as one of the scariest games I've ever played. My wife can't even watch anything cold. Many people don't get to experience what real cold actually is. This game will help you experience that!Disclaimer: since we have obvious morons who don't know how to find other reviews on Steam I have to post a real review of the game. Here it goes, are you ready?You can survive, hunt, fish, and freeze to death! Best Game Eva! 10/10 Icy Deaths! "

								This game has given me a new hope for Early access games,I never thought I would say that,but it really does !!The Long Dark sat in my wishlist for 7 months and if I would've known how much enjoyment it was going to bring me I would've bought it then and saved the hundreds of dollars I spent on games that held my interest for an hour or two and were then deleted and the next new one played and put aside and on and on. . . .Very intense gameplay and omfg it's so much fun and what a challenge !!You can play so many different ways too,you can explore and gather everything you can find or you can try and hunt and gather to survive for the long haul,you can be just a hunter and try to live off of the things mother nature offers or you can set up a cushy home base and go out on re-cons to exhaust all the resources of one area and then move to another and on and on. . . .And thats just the start of it !! Hinterland Studios has kept their word and give us very regular updates and are always expanding the game,adding new areas to explore and new ways to do things and all of that is in EA !!We're waiting on the next update and hopefully it's going to be the new story mode I've been researching on the Hinterland forums,it promises to be something very special !!For now,we have around a 22 km of map to explore,survive in and if its your cup of tea(or coffee or soda) to exploit !!I cannot express enough in this review,how much pleasure this game has brought to me and it does it all without one single monster,zombie,evil warlords or any other catchy little thing most of todays devs are tossing into survivor type games !! It's all mother nature and her critters !!So,in a nut shell,buy this game if survival is what your into or if your into hunting or exploring,just buy the game,it's a 20 very well spent !!Thank you Hinterland Studios,for the best game in my library !!!AccidentlyReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

								You slowly awaken to the sound of wind whistling through branches and snow gently kissing your face, opening your eyes to a stark gray sky. Covered in almost 8 inches of powder snow. You wipe the newly landed snow off your face then get up briskly, shaking the layer of snow off yourself like a large dog, You take a moment to look around this unfamiliar frozen land to orient yourself. Towering trees and majestic mountains as far as the eye can see, with no signs of life in any direction.You open your camping backpack and check to see whats inside. Finding nothing except a plane ticket to Jasper, Canada, a bedroll and a cell phone which doesn't turn on. ""Of course my iPhone is dead when i need it"" you say with a smirk on your face. Surprising yourself that you still have a sense of humor in a moment like this. But that humor quickly dissolved when you realize you are alone, in a place that looks like something out of a national geographic documentary.Your instincts  kick in, ""The Sun rises in the east, sets in the west. lets head east."" It must have been 10 minutes before the snow storm cleared away enough to see a building not too far in the distance. It was a large metal structure covered in icicles. Trekking through the snow to the entrance door you start to feel your denim jeans get soaked, and boots becoming very heavy. This find couldn't have come at a better time, you grab the frosted door handle and turn it.You step inside the building and begin to close the door, only for the gale force wind to take hold of the door and slam it closed. The windchill is instantly gone. ""Is anyone there?"" you ask before taking another step into the lobby, your voice echos throughout the building. You notice opposite of you a room with a frosted glass window, a gentle ray of sunlight shines on the floor. You enter the room and begin to scavenge whatever you can. An hour passes and you find a good amount of canned soda, and energy bars, thinking to yourself ""Almost sounds like what i lived off with during college.""It takes another hour to scavenge the place finding a box of matches, beef jerky and a brochure with the writing ""Jasper Hydro Dam"" on it. you make your way to a large heavy door in the buildings engine room. You use most of your strength to turn the large wheel clockwise to open the door, only to see a man sitting on the floor face down. It Startles you to the point where you fall back, screaming ""HOLY $%*&"" landing on your butt. With the mysterious man frozen in place, you slowly approach and check his pulse. His skin was as cold as the ice and hard to the touch, this man must have been here a while. Next to him lay a hunting knife,  a bottle of painkillers, and note saying ""I wish i could've seen you on your wedding day, I'm Sorry - Love Dad"". The quiet room suddenly became even more silent as you grab the items and exhaled deeply in grief. You pick up your backpack and head back toward the entry door. As you walked into the lobby the window that had a ray of light no longer was shining, this would be your first night alone.It was then you decided to use one of the empty metal barrels to start a camp fire for the night. A spark dances off the match as you strike it, gently placing it on the newspaper youve managed to find in the structure. You knew this fire wouldn't last long if you didn't have some wood to keep the fire going. You foraged for the next two hours gathering reclaimed wood from the feet of chairs to shelves. ending up with a good pile of wood that would last you the night. You place the logs down on the crackling fire. I curl up inside my cotton bedroll on the floor which rested next to the radiating heat. You fall asleep minutes after laying down.The smell of charred wood lingers in the cold air as you wake up. Looking across the room, you notice the light in the window returns. You gather your belongings and head toward the entry door once more. You grip the handle and turn it, opening the large heavy metal door to a much more calm beautiful morning. You take a big breath of fresh air and let it fill your lungs with a refreshing coolness.You take a step outside, and another. Just as you take another step a deep loud growl pierces your ears, quickly looking in the direction, A large black wolf leaps into the air and lands on top of you digging its dagger like claws into your flesh and, its large teeth into your neck. tearing you apart. You try punching and screaming like a madman to fend it off but just don't have the strength.Just as everything begins to fade to black and all hope is lost, You quickly open your eyes to find yourself sitting in an airplane, next to a frosted window with the view of the aircrafts right wing, You touch your neck in relief and rest your head back.Suddenly the plane starts to have turbulance, a loud repeating beep, and a distant computerized voice saying ""Engine Malfunction...GPS Malfunction......Raise Altitude Immediately."" emmits from the cockpit. A flight attendant stumbles out of the cockpit, ""LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS, THIS AIRCRAFT IS GOING DOWN. PLEASE REMAIN CALM!""oh, the review.yes, i recommend this game.			"

Early Access  Alpha Review (6-21-16)I've always wanted a game that captured the exploration, crafting, and survival aspects of DayZ without the PvP, bugs, and awful interface. If you want a straight up survival game like that - also minus the zombies - this is what you're looking for. There are no other humans, and your main threats are starvation, freezing to death, bears/wolves, and basic stuff like falling and sickness. Don't worry, you won't randomly break a leg walking down stairs like in DayZ!I know what you're thinking, though. ""It's an Early Access survival game on Steam, so it's probably a buggy, broken mess that will never actually be finished"".  I was worried, too - especially after being disappointed by games like 7 Days To Die. But despite being labeled an ""alpha"", The Long Dark is one of the most polished games I've played in a long time. While more features and areas will be added in the future, the core game they've created as a base is almost flawless. I've never had a crash, I've noticed very few bugs, and it's well optimized (I'm running with maximum settings at 1440p/60fps on a GTX 760). So don't let the ""Early Access"" bit scare you off if the game sounds interesting.The current play mode is ""Sandbox"". Basically, you are dropped into a random location in one of several interconnected maps (you can choose which map or have it picked randomly as well) and left to fend for yourself. That means finding food, shelter, and water. Some of the game's activities include: getting firewood, avoiding hostile wildlife, hunting, laying rabbit traps, repairing clothing, crafting, fishing, exploring, and making sure not to get caught in the game's brutal, disorienting blizzards.How to go about surviving is up to you. I tend to move from place to place looting, but it can also be smart to set up a base camp somewhere safe if you can do hunting, trapping, or fishing there. The goal of the current sandbox mode is simply to survive as long as possible - the game records that as well as a variety of other statistics. The general backstory seems to be that something happened which caused most of humanity to die, and for the wildlife to turn more hostile. Your plane crashes, leaving you stranded in the frozen wilderness alone.You can pick one of three play modes, depending on what kind of experience you want. ""Pilgrim"" is easier and doesn't have hostile wildlife - a good choice for your first game. Then there is the regular play mode, as well as a ""Stalker"" mode which is the most brutal. If you're not sure about something, there is a good online wiki to guide you. I even found a Steam guide with a variety of maps if you'd like more help. So you can really customize your game experience depending on your tastes and skill level.The controls and interface are very intuitive. Normally there is no HUD minus a small interface dot and occasionally an icon displaying whether you are shielded from the wind. You interact with things in the game world simply by left clicking when they are in range. Pressing TAB brings up a little display showing how cold, tired, thirsty, and hungry you are, as well as an estimate of how much daylight or darkness remains (you generally want to find shelter before dark). SHIFT lets you run, though there is a stamina meter. ""I"" brings up your inventory, and SPACE brings up a radial menu for making fires and a couple other things like first aid. While I played with keyboard and mouse, the game also supports controllers.The Long Dark's Canadian wilderness is beautiful, desolate, and cold. The graphics are slightly stylized, simple and with what I'd describe as a ""painterly"" look to skyboxes and textures. The sunsets and weather effects steal the show, though. The snow and storms are the best I've seen in a game, which is fitting because nature is both the star and the antagonist here.Should you buy The Long Dark in its current ""alpha"" state? If it sounds interesting, I'd say it's a definite ""yes"". While more content and features will be added in the future - story mode, new areas, new stuff to craft, new play mechanics, etc. - it is a very polished experience and already has enough content to keep you busy for 50+ hours easily. It's very much worth playing right now, and is a great investment that will be worth revisiting over and over throughout its development.8.5/10 "

Early Access Review
								The craftsmanship of this game is good.  However, the design deserves some discussion: This is not a survival game, but an adventure game with a survival theme, and the design reflects that.These are just a few things that occurred to me while playing, from the perspective of a survivalist.  Some of these are due to the early development of the game, whereas others are design decisions which reflect the minds of the author. * Tools degrade in a matter of days; in the real world, they degrade over years or decades. * Tools, such as knives, can be repaired with wood and scrap metal; actually, you can make a new knife that way, but you cannot repair it in such a manner. * You cannot make knives or axes with wood and scrap metal. * Weather can destroy a large sailor’s coat; in the real world, even a hurricane is unlikely to do so. * The sleeping bag acts like a bivy, but looks like a sleeping bag.  A sleeping bag, outdoors in this weather, would freeze through with body moisture in short order unless put inside a shelter or by a fire, whereas a bivy would be safe.  I’m a bit confused. * Cordage is made only from gut; normally, cordage can be made from a great many things. * You cannot manipulate the snow to build a windbreak for a fire, or for yourself, or to build a snow-grave, or a quinzee. * Regardless of wood on hand, one cannot create either a lean-to windbreak shelter or a kennel-shelter.  The method is simply not in the game. * All of the trees are tall, old, and bare at the lower trunk.  Normally, there are many smaller trees in the area, especially near rocks, and many bushes. * The wind seems to be as strong in open areas, such as railroad tracks, as it is among many trees. * I’m not sure why the land is completely smooth; normally, you’re stumbling over rocks and logs, and chunks of burnable wood. * If you have newspaper, matches, kindling, and logs, you have a thirty percent chance of failing to start a fire.  I've never been that drunk. * Starting a fire is equally easy when one is warm or cold; normally, when hypothermia sets it, starting a fire becomes extremely challenging due to freezing fingers.  If you wait until frostbite starts to set in before you build a fire, you waited far too long. * Firewood is shown as cordwood; normally, I use deadfall almost exclusively, and can easily sustain a fire all night with only a half-hour to an hour of gathering. * There is no fire-tending skill; normally, tending a fire properly makes it last much longer, and allows for coal banking. * Dead fires do not make fire-lighting easier; in reality, there are usually lingering coals (especially if properly banked) and there is often charcoal to help ignite the next fire. * A fire cannot be put out to reclaim the wood; I do this often, to generate charcoal and to conserve fuel when I need to move on, and this allows me to leave behind fires ready to light. * Firewood takes hours to gather; even in snow, this process generally takes minutes. * A hatchet speeds firewood collection; in reality, this is only marginally helpful, given that most environments have a great deal of deadfall and standing deadwood that can simply be yanked down.  I rarely have to cut firewood; it’s just under the snow, especially under trees. * It is possible to freeze to death beside a large fire, or even in a closed (but open-doored) fishing hut beside a large wood-stove with a roaring flame.  This is not realistic.  * Dead bodies are shown clothed; there is no way to salvage their clothing. * There are many beds; there is no way to cannibalize the mattresses for cloth or to remove the sheets, nor can one lay one mattress on top of another and sleep between them for added warmth. * One cannot stuff one’s clothing with the batting from mattresses. * One cannot upgrade the insulation of clothing at all, despite this being a staightforward (if somewhat time-consuming) task in reality. * One cannot wear multiple sweaters or layer multiple pants.  I do this often in cold weather; one loses some mobility, but it works. * It is possible to fail to sew a piece of cloth.  I love my Jack Daniels, but I’ve never been too drunk to sew.This is a very good and fun game, but survivalists should not mistake it for a bushcrafting game, and should not try to use a real-world survival mindset to predict the game's behavior.Still, as video games go, it's fun, well-crafted, finely drawn, engrossing, and well worth playing.  I would recommend this game. "

								I have played a lot of survival games. For the most part, they all either start off great and end up stinking, or they stink from the onset. This game is different. For the very first time I can say that a survival game has nailed survival. It is doing so in the most elegant and streamlined fashion, which I can't even believe I'm typing. Years of games like Dayz have lead me to believe that survival games are supposed to be clumsy, sloppily designed, and painful to learn.Thankfully The Long Dark handles cooking, crafting and inventory with an ease and simplicity that throws a middle finger to almost any survival game I've tried.It's single player. I think, as of now, that is the only downside I would have for the game - but it isn't a downside. This game instills a very tangible fear in you for mother nature. You feel alone, but you are surrounded by beauty. Gorgeous forests, mountain trails, and of course snow capped mountains and icy lakes.The play area is massive, loot and spawn locations are randomized each new game, and the threat of harsh snow storms is only bested by the sight of a wolf, or worse, wolves... or even worse - a bear.Discovering books allows you to read up on certain things, like ice fishing, firearms, or building campfires. Finishing these books enhances those abilities.Finding your first rifle is empowering, and shooting a charging bear in the face 2 times before it mauls you is soul crushing.That was me; Just over two hours into my first playthrough, feeling confident, I wandered into the dawn. Outside of my vision, a bear had spotted me. By the time I turned to fire, it was too late. When the bear finished mauling me, I was shocked to find I was left hanging on to my life. I stumbled between some large rocks, built a campfire, and used almost all of the first aid I had. Still hopeful, I ate a meal and laid down in my sleeping bag to rest and regain my vitality.Little did I know that my injuries would claim me as I drifted into dreams. The game is complex, and yet every mechanic is intuitive and easy to learn. Exploration is exciting, whether it is a small lakeside cabin, an expansive network of caves, or an abandoned hydro dam. Often times the game evokes a sense of wonder, excitement and fear that I don't recall having since I first played Fallout 3.Get this game. It's the best single player survival game I've ever ♥♥♥♥ing played, and I knew it within the first hour. If it wasn't, then why would I have stopped playing just to tell you all of this? I am hopeful that one day a multiplayer survival title will take notes from this game. It would be amazing to play a game as silky smooth and devoid of zombies alongside friends and strangers. This is a title that would actually cause players to work together, because as threatening as the wolves and bears are - the world you must explore to survive is even more hostile.  "

								One of the most bug-free early access games to come out in a long time. As it stands, the game is well worth the price tag and has many hours worth of fun to be had but you can easily do everything there is to do in the game within a few playthroughs. This game has the potential to be a very amazing and robust survival game. The best part is... NO ZOMBIES! Yes, a survival game that doesnt involve monsters or zombies. I know, crazy right?With all that said this game has a lot of potential and the devs have been hard at work releasing update after update and its not even been out to the public for a week yet. I highly recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
								I've owned and played many Sandbox / Survival games with different stories and mechanics. I don't know when this started but somehow they mixed Survival with Zombies and whatnot. Of course i like ""good"" Survival Zombie games but there was still something missing in this Survival aspect (for me) and that was realism. Before i go further i want to mention that no game can be more realistic than the real life itself and if there were a game with such a realism it wouldn't be enjoyable at all. However in this case, Hinterland Studios did a really great job with The Long Dark. I would call this a ""real"" survival experience compared to other games. This game gives you a indescribable feeling about surviving. You're alone, you have to survive somehow and it's cold.. there are wolves outside so you have to hide yourself, find water, food, wood. You have to prepare everything everyday to survive a bit longer... no other survival game could give me such feelings like this one to be honest.I also never visited Canada before so this was basically like a sightseeing for me. When i go there I'll take at least my sewing kit with me. This game is still in Early Access and there isn't any story related content out yet but it's highly playable and enjoyable in Sandbox mode. I haven't seen a single serious bug while playing this game and that's really unusual for an Early Access title. The developers / team are really kind and nice to you if you have questions or suggestions.The only minus point to mention is the balancing currently. The Animals, Items and overall the whole system needs to be more balanced. But It's EA and they're most likely working on that.Finally i just want to say thanks Hinterland Studios for this game, keep up the great work.			"

Early Access Review
								So after much debate, (yes i am still banned for some reason) and a few requests i have played the game again after a few updates. And my verdict still stands.In survival you do anything and everything you can to survive. Ofcourse a game has limitations so you will be limited as to your options as to how well you can perform, however The Long Dark puts so many on you, its more about surviving the games mechanics and not the evironment the game puts you in. Also many ask why only a few hours in the game. Simple, its just not fun. Heres why:-Time passes far to quickly. Hinterland claims it doesnt. However go to a sunny area and just watch the shadows. They are moving incredibly fast as the sun is blazing through the sky. Nightfall in an area like this is almost a death sentence especially if there is a storm. There are not enough hours in the day to prepare for the night. Your already set up to fail here.- No layering of clothing. If i was stranded in the middle of a frozen mountain and found clothing. Id be wearing it. Regardless if its mens or womens, or a Hello Kitty beanie. I would be wearing it. First rule of cold survival is layering. They keep you warm, and as you heat up you can remove them to avoid sweating.You also come across several beds with blankets on them that you cant pick up and wrap around you. Another way the game has set you up to fail.- Update *Slightly Improved* Wasting of flares. Flares are incredibly useful in a survival environment. They can be used to signal, start fires, or scare off super fauna (aka bears.) If confronted by a wolf, a lone wolf mind you, if in the extreme rarity i would be attacked, all i have to do is make myself seem bigger and yell, why would i waste a flare? Wolves are incredibly skittish of humans and wolf attacks are more extremely rare, even when they are in packs. Unfortunatly ""The Grey"" which was a trash movie from a survivalist stand point, used wolves as the ""bad guy"". This couldnt be farther from the truth. This irritates me not only is it because its not realistic but also promoting a stereotype that is incorrect.- Update *Slightly Improved* Tools wear down far to easily. I have a hatchet from 20 years ago that still holds an edge and cuts down trees with the best of the new fangled fiberglass counter parts. 20 years. Hatchets in game can take a 10% durability hit each time you use it... per log. So 3 logs can cost you over a quarter of your hatchets durability (30% that is). Why? Its doing the job it was created to do. Same with can openers, and prybars. Each take durability hits that are simply unrealistic. Unless they are made of paper mache im sure they're going to last longer then 2-3 uses. This should be enough to make me say, ""Ok this game isnt hard, its just blatently unfair"". But wait. Theres more.- Update ""Some what fixed"" You can now choose what weapon before combat, but its still a button mashing contest. Combat. Or more like ""combat"". Sure you have a crowbar, a hunting knife, a hatchet, and wooden logs and sticks you could sharpen to a crude spear on you so you should be safe if attacked by a wolf. Right? No. You cannot equip them to defend yourself. Instead you need to wait for the wolf to attack you and then play a button mashing mini game to fight the wolf off bare handed. You essentially need to punch him to death. All the while why trying to fight off this wolf, your life is dropping like a college girl after 5 beers. So now they have removed the ability to defend yourself adequately.- ""Stealth"". Or lack there of. You can crouch to make yourself seem detectable but you move so slowly if your spotted, you then need to stand, and try to run. Ever try to outrun your dog? Not gonna happen. So stealth isnt really an option either.- No jumping. Wanna get up high to get a ""glassing spot"" (aka a spot to map out the terrain or spot landmarks) on the land? Or perhaps climb some rocks to get away from ol' Fluffy McAngry? You cant. Dying from a wolf  because you cant jump on a porch 4 inches off the ground and need to run around to get into a cabin can get old fast. First game ive ever seen that is survival based with no jump mechanic.- No means of long term survival. You are going to die. This game sets you in a relatively small area, that is sparsley populated with cabins, fishing huts, ect. However, once you loot them. Thats it. Your bullets will run out, your food will run out, and then you wont have enough strength to get fire wood, or boil water. There are no bird nests to exploit, no berries, roots, or wild vegatables. There is no extraction to a safe location. It will be game over at some point or another and it wont be because your a poor survivalist. - Harvesting wood. You now have a hatchet. So you would think harvesting is pretty straight forward. Walk over to a tree and hack some limbs off, or go over to that desk/chair and chop em up. Nope. You need to your menu and choose ""Forage wood"" then select your tool. Though it does seem in this patch you succeed more then you fail, its still a mindless mechanic of ""roll the dice"". Not only that but if you do fail, your hatchet still takes a large percentage of durability damage. Honeslty i can harvest enough wood in one day to set me for a week, by making a small fire in an enclosed area. In this game, you will harvest wood spending around 800 calories for 4 hrs of wood. Another way you are set up to fail.-Food poisoning from jerky, beans, and other pre prepared foods. Not sure if this is a bug or implamentation at this point but i have gotten sick from eating beans. Canned beans. If this is an implamentation then why cant I cook them first? They are in a can.  Also warm water, and warm food will raise my body temp giving me a better chance to survive the cold. Yet another mechanic setting you up to die.- Corpses galore, but you cant go ""Hannibal"" on them. Watch the movie ""Alive"" or ""The Road"". Meat is meat. You will find numerous corpses of humans that have died. Is it fun, or nice to do? No. Not at all. But this is survival. If im starving and Frank over here is a frozen dinner, yes. Im going to eat his chubby little arms and legs. Will i brag about it at work the next day. Probably not. But, anything to survive. Yet you cant. The game doesnt allow this. So much for ""How far will you go to survive"".- Water. You can find water in bottles, but youll mostly hydrate from snow. Which you need to melt (which takes a substantial amount of time and calories), but then you need to boil it. Boil the snow you just heated up and melted. Why not leave it in the container to boil? Why boil it anyway? White snow with little debree in it is usually safe to drink once its in liquid form. Dirty or discolored snow isnt safe and neither is ice due to the fact parasites and disease can live in ice for a very long time and reactivate due to the heat of the fire. You also cant leave the snow to boil/melt while doing other chores like chop wood, or forage. You need to babysit it. Another mechanic that just takes up time, calories and effort for no reason. - No fires indoors unless in dedicated areas. Appearently Smokey the Bear is still big during the apocalypse because you cant make a fire on a concrete floor (IE, the dam or bunker), and can only make one in a stove, or barrel. If your outside you can make one almost anywhere but its pretty useless without cover especially with a snow storm raging around you. The best places to make a fire, are the areas you cant make one. For instance a small enclosed area with ventilation. - Fuel issues. Kerosine and Accelerant (or lighter fluid) isnt interchangable but yet do the same thing. They can both fuel lanterns, and can both start a fire. Yet in this game they only serve 1 purpose each. It would be easier to remove Accelerant, and just let Kerosine do both jobs since in this game they both seem to be in liquid form.			"

								I really like this game as a whole. It's really hard, atmospheric and visually quite beautiful. It's completely unlike most other survival games: you can't build almost anything, you have practically no weapons (unless you, by some freakish accident, happen to find a rifle, which is completely useless if you don't also find bullets) and are therefore pretty much the weakest ♥♥♥♥er on the bottom of the food chain. You're like the rabbits, except slower.  Learning to survive in the game takes a while: the first few times I played I died within 24 hours or so (couldn't find shelter). I started out with the Mystery Lake map, but  I suggest trying Coastal Highway first, because it appears to be more newbie-friendly.What sort of bugs me are the wolves. Don't get me wrong, I like them because they make the player super paranoid when walking outdoors, which is absolutely great. The problem is that once the wolf is attacking, it will not give up, no matter how long it takes: I had this one incident when I was on top of the lookout tower in Coastal Hightway, and a wolf down on the ground spotted me. It attacked, but since I was in the tower it couldn't get to me, so it stayed at the bottom of the tower, running around and waiting for me. This went on for a day or two. Finally I went down and managed to beat the ♥♥♥♥face up, but another two took its place almost immediately. After another day or so I tried to escape the tower but was eaten. This isn't technically a big thing, but it can be a major annoyance. I hope it gets fixed.But, all in all, I wamly recommed this game if you like a bit of challenge and don't get frustrated easily.

								!!!!!!! EDITED 2/11/2015 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!pros: deep crafting system (almost perfect, not too overwhelming without lacking much)amazing atmospheregreat art styledifferent game modes (easy, medium, hard, basically)Runs SO smoothly, obviously it is well-optimizedgood voice actingamazing sound qualityone of the best survival games I've played in a while (no zombies or monsters)amazing weather patterns (visually pleasing)it's really relaxing to play when you do Pilgrim mode (easy mode)devs care about the game and as far as I can tell, the userbasemaps are very funcons: wolves are too small (opinion, they seem a little too small to me!)tweak the lighting JUST a bit when insideas far as I can tell, only one save slotas a survival game, it's GREAT; but it feels like it's missing something.ideas for the game:-different interiors for houses-able to use the axe to break down boarded up doors-generators / electricity (not sure how it'll work but it'd be a pretty cool addition)-marking (mark trees, the ground, raise flags and build fencing) so you don't get lost from your base (There are footprints, but I guess if you have eye troubles that would be difficult to see)-a map (it would be good but it would ruin the realistic feel of getting lost in the woods. So maybe a rare drop on a corpse or in a house?)-more corpses (maybe journals and diaries so you can see a little bit of story behind them)-more save slotsTHIS GAME IS VERY ADDICTING! When you die, you want to try again, and each time you're more knowledgable of what you did wrong and you last longer.I re-wrote this review on 2/8/2015 and the game is just getting better and better. I look forward to the storymode!			"

								Update 07-04-2017: Is it actually getting both worse and better at the same time?Update 28-11-2016: Little changes, tools are a bit more durable, few new maps, still nothing to do and no change in arbitrary game mechanics.TL:DR;Game is evolving from decent, user friendly survival experience into something else entirely. I do not like it.Mainly, because I do not like poor design choices aimed at slowing down player just because. While I would recommend it 6 months ago, right now it is becoming not so fun to play.Longer version:I will not bother you with trivialities like graphics and sound of this game. They are decent and do not annoy.Problem with this game is that developers appear kinda arrogant people who are following their vision of the title at the expense of the game actual playability.The list of failures this game presents is kinda long, ""The Long List"" of poor design choices and arbitrary mechanics added only to obliterate any fun from this game you could have.I will point few most annoying things that you should be aware when considering purchase.- Nights are pitch black. Any person who spent winter somewhere where it snows will tell you right away that this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t - full snow cover reflects so much light, that if there is a moon you can actually see very decently. Furthermore according to game lore there should be brilliant auroras in the sky, which should add to brightening the area. Not the case, you are likely to stumble in the pitch black environment, where even light from a fire will not illuminate it well enough.- Items, including solid steel prybars are running out of durability at such a rate as if they were made of plastic. This problem is so pronounced that it is really hard to believe anyone would consider it a good design choice for a gameplay balance.- your character when fully rested and well feed will loose half of your daily stamina after fixing your clothes 6 or 7 times. So after 2h of morning sewing and patching you can basically go to bed for a next 5 hours.- humans can survive without water for days, weeks without food. Here you die after 5 days of hunger. and the amount of calories you need to consume if you plan on doing daily work is equal to half deer weight.- really no melee weapon. can't chop a tree to get wood. cant make a sharpened stick. torches can now be only made using finite resources (gasoline and reclaimed wood) and they last few minutes. extinguishing them now eats 25% if below 100%. Doing that for a second time destroys torch completely. You are again left to stumble in the dark as both the matches and lanterns use finite resources.- crafting is limited AF. you can barely craft anything useful without actually finding plenty of stuff before (not even a damn sharp stick).- biggest flaw of this game, totally unrealistic animal behaviour, so much in fact they added explanation in a start screen for it (basically, we did it because we wanted).- your character does not warm up doing physical exercise or while running. Running is extremely limited because your stamina replenishes soooooooooo slowly. This was done on purpose to slow down player exploration and progress- very little containers in bases, can't build the bases up in any way, you need to drop stuff on the ground where you stand, can't rearrange it around. - can't jump. seriously, a fallen tree that is like 30 cm high, you can't jump over it, you need to go around.- sickness, sickness everywhere. - fighting a wolf instantly places you on the ground and having to defend rather than giving you a chance for a decent combat.Conclusion:Absolutely not buy as it is now. It has become totally unrealistic and is no longer survival against environment, but a borderom survival against very poor design/balance choices. Damn, it looked so good 8 months ago... :(			"

								Here is my end feeling of this game as it stand on Nov 16,2016.  I’m no survival expert, but I’m an adult male with 20+ years of camping and hunting experience.  I would say this game is doing a good job although there are several things that aren’t realistic.  I like that it’s hardcore in that you die the game is over.  I’m going to put together a list of things I think the game is lacking. 1. Can't move/remove old camp fires.  In a tight windshielded area this is a major pain and unrealistic2. Can't crouch while using a bow to sneak up on prey.  Unrealistic3. Can't break up furniture or pallets without a hatchet. If i'm gonna die of cold I'm just gonna burn the whole thing.4. Can't harvest deadbody clothing for cloth or string for fishing. (I assuming the empty ones are naked and you just don’t want to show naked bodies laying around. 5. Can't harvest some larger furniture for wood/cloth etc.6. Can't convert cloth to string.  Would be nice. String from gut does seem to be abundant though.7. Wetstones. 5% per use?  I have been using the same wetstone for 20+ years.  5% per use really makes we think twice about using my tools.8. I should be able to use a knife on a large branch.  I could press the blade against it and hit the back with a rock etc.  slow, but possible.9. I should be able to use electrical cables for fishing line.  Again line is pretty abundant.10. IF I was this guy the first thing I would do is sharpen a stick and make a spear.11.  Sled.  I found my self making a lot of useless trips while I relocated my ever growing stash.  IRL I’d fashion a sled and drag it to the next area.12. Traps.  I like rabbit trap, but what about a trap for he wolfs, deer or bear.Lighting fires:I've seen 50% chances fail 4 times in a row.  I realize that each instance is probably random, but 50% chance to light a fire in a potbell is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.   I’m level 3 with fire now and it’s much easier.  I think it’s still too difficult.Lighting fires take 0.30L of oil. That's ridiculous. That’s almost a 12oz can of soda. Getting oil from fish was a nice touch.   I’d like to see a Swedish torch or a Dakota fire added.  They are much more efficient.Can’t light fire with a flare. It’s not my first choice, but it should be an option and it should be 100%. If I’m about to die of cold. You better believe that stack of lumber in the lumber yard is going up in flames first.Unrealistic Survival Scenerios:I found myself on a shoreline with 10+ pallets a small camp fire and no hatchet.  IRL I'd just drag a pallet over and enjoy the bonfire. I'd like the option to drag a pallet or atleast the ability to break it down by hand.  I got so frustrated I restarted.  Maybe let me drag large branches or pallets?Unrealistic death.I was in the watch tower, I had a fire going. I was exhausted. I wanted to reclaim the bench for more burn tile while I slept.  While breaking apart the furniture I passed out and died.   Similar to researching.  This should have just told me I'm too tired to harvest the furniture.  IMO any time you might die while the auto timer is running it should cancel out.Strong winds take all your wood:I killed a black bear and spent a while collecting wood to build a 10hr fire while I skinned it and butchered it.  When I hit harvest, the fire was blown out by strong winds and I started to freeze so I hit cancel.  All my wood was gone?  IRL the wood would still be there.  This is a very frustrating mechanic.

""The Long Dark"" ReviewI am a sucker for survival games, but with the oversaturated market it gets tough to find a good one that presents a challenge. The Long Dark, abbreviated herein as ""TLD,"" is one of the exceptional ones.  Objective  Survival is the name of the game here. You have a backpack with a fairly large capacity, and clothes that won't keep you alive for long. Much like ""The Forest,"" TLD requires you to find sticks, branches and fuel to craft fires and new items. Unlike most survival games, you may see the world as somewhat familiar to you - at least, it was to me. If you have experience with survival/adventure games, you will love this game, and coming from other atmospheric games, TLD is the ideal survival game for me. Many Challenges This game is easy. This game is hard. This game is everything in between. Each ""region"" of the world that you play in has its own difficulty; some have prebuilt shelters for you to keep warm, and others are nothing but desolate wilderness. You can find yourself stranded on a frozen lake, or sipping coffee in the log house. The more you play, the easier you will find the game in general to be, regardless of the difficulty of the region you begin in. For instance, it took two playthrough attempts for me to realize that for some odd reason, the water in toilets is considered potable. Huh. Sleep is key in this game; oversleep and you will burn too many calories, but undersleep and your health will decline. If you are skilled at balancing different aspects of a character, such as hunger v. sickness and agility v. pack size, you will have no trouble with starting on at least a moderately difficult region. Audio, Graphics, and Performance This game is, in one word: atmospheric. From the calming to somewhat-creepy background audio to the smoothness of the main character's voice, the audio in this game is absolutely fantastic. I would highly advise you to wear your best set of headphones/earphones when playing this game, as you will notice a difference.As for the graphics, well, I'm simply amazed at the simplicity yet the spectacular attention to detail in this game. I actually purchased this game solely for the visual quality, and after playing I knew that it was the right choice. Surprisingly, this game is made with UNITY. Yes, you read that right -- Unity. From screenshots, most might say that it looks like a Source 2 engine game. In that regard, I feel like the devs did a great job pushing Unity to its limits to make this game.One of my personal favorite areas in the game to explore is the forest house by the Coastal Highway and Log Yard area. It's very home-y, and although I was definitely creeped out when I first went upstairs and came across a corpse, it's one of the more calm locations in the region. Outside of shelters, one of the very unique aspects is something that usually goes unnoticed: footprints. I love the fact that your footprints stay in the snow, and maybe it's just me, but I feel that it definitely adds a lot to the game with just one added detail. I have not noticed yet whether the footprints will stay for a certain time duration or if it is based on basically a graphical asset limit, such as 100 or 150.Speaking of Unity, let's talk about one of its downfalls: performance. I play this game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M card, and I do get a steady 60fps. However, at some points textures glitch out and frames drop. My GPU/CPU are not throttling, which leads me to believe it could just be a bug or the result of Unity's poor optimization. It's definitely not the developers' fault. My system does run hot when playing, much hotter than while playing titles such as CS:GO and Saints Row 3/4, but at a similar temperature as when I run Metro 2033/Last Light Redux. If you have at least a 700 series card and proper cooling and ventilation, you'll have no issues. Value At this stage of the game's development, I feel that it warrants a price tag of maybe $15 instead of $20. Having played it and seen fairly fast development progress, this IS an early access game that you do want to cash in on because, as many other Early Access games, the price will go up.  Aspect Rating   Originality High 9   Difficulty Options 9   Graphics 10+   Audio 10   Value 8   Overall 9  Final Points on the Game TLD is glorious in its appearance, unforgiving in its challenges, and sensory magic at heart. Don't miss out.Be sure to check out any of my other reviews on my profile, and please upvote if this helped you, I hope it did!

								Despite being early in development, I was really surprised by how addictive and fun the sandbox mode has been. This is definitely one of the best survival games I've ever played and the Gnu/Linux port is very well done. I haven't encountered a single bug and it's probably the best optimized unity 5 game on Gnu/Linux thus far.Game Highlights:Very good voice artist work, though it is minimal as of yet (until the story mode is added).The audio production is top notch, makes all the difference having well produced audio and ambiance, snow crunches, flares sizzle, wolves howl to send chills down your spine, etc.Art is stylized (not photo-realistic) but it isn't a negative, I think that only adds to the character and experience. Unique survival mechanism and so on..Game play:It can be brutal and punishing! Which I really like, the second time I played it started me in the middle of a fierce blizzard in pitch dark with only one flare to try and save myself - I did manage to find shelter in the Carter Hydro Dam (after a night in relative safety, I made my way to the Camp Office located on the western side of Mystery Lake). Sometimes you get a nice easy start, sometimes a nightmarish struggle to survive what seems like the impossible! If you fail, there is no reloading a save you've simply got to try again (but you can quit any time and continue on another sessions if you have not perished - so a save of sorts).I really like the change of pace from all the usual gaming fare, this one makes you think about what you need to do to really survive in the game. Supplies are always in the back of your mind, do you stay put in a comfy cabin with the supplies you have - or risk the outdoors to be proactive in your scavenging to prevent a situation where you could starve or freeze to death? There are no zombies, ghouls, or other such fictional monsters - just you versus the brutal arctic and occasionally a wolf or two (best to avoid them if possible).Tons of fun if you love a challenge and an open world to scavenge up what you can to survive. I can't wait for the campaign story that will be added later in development - going from the current experience it should be amazing!I can full heartedly recommend The Long Dark to all of you who are interested in the survival genre.

								I had a strong playthrough once. I made it to around day twenty, having gone through three of the available areas at the time, and I was doing good, but it was not long lived. My resources were dwindling as I made my way to the last supplied area at the top of a mountain, a lone radio station secluded from the rest of the map. It was starting to get dark, and my body temperture was dropping fast, so I lit my lantern and started to run. Out in the darkness I heard a howl, followed by another that seemed much closer. I put away my lantern and took out my rifle, aiming it towards the origin of the noise. I heard a growl about ten feet away, so I fired a shot. A whimper pierced the whirring of the cold winter air around me, then silence. Not taking any chances, I lit a flare to see what was around me. Five feet in front of me was a pair of wolves, one was bleeding profusely from his gunshot wound, while the other was preparing to leap onto its would be prey. Being only fifty feet from the radio station, I decided to make a break for it. I threw the flare at the wolves face and sprinted away. The rapid stomping of my feet began to slow as my stamina quickly depleted. No heat for miles takes a toll on the body, and I was slowly dying just feet from my salvation. I heard fast taps on the ground behind me as the wolves closed in for the attack. I was almost there, just a few more steps until I could get into the station and shut the door, then the wolf pounced. I was on the ground, hacking it apart with my axe as it took gnawed on my half frozen flesh. It was a bite away from ending my long journey, when I took one last swing with my hatchet and killed it. I got up and limped toward the door, just barely making it into the station before the other wolf had a chance at killing me. I made it. Inside was much needed health supplies, and much needed food. I started a fire and cooked some venison, all the while warming my body temperture to its original state. I then went to sleep in the nearby cot, gaining health, yet also gaining thirst and hunger. My supplies were low, maybe a few energy bars and a few cans of soda, definitely not enough to last a voyage out into the unknown, so I decided that my journey had come to an end. I quit the game and said goodbye, for I knew that if I continued I would surely perish. I couldn't watch my character die, after all we had been through, he didn't deserve to fade into the long dark. So I let him live in that save, untouched and undying, until I decide that it's time for his journey to come to a close. Until that moment, I will always cherish my adventure I had, and I hope that one day I will have the courage to once more venture out into the unknown, making my way through the barren landscape, and surviving the long dark.

Early Access Review
Alright, the Long Dark. I'm guessing you have some questions for me about it.Indeed. We want to know how good it is.Fair enough. Let's get started.First off: what is it?It's a first person survival + exploration simulation, with mild walking simulator and horror elements, in which you're stranded in the middle of the Canadian wilderness, struggling to preserve your life in the bitter environment. Most of the time you find yourself lost, confused, and unsure of where to go.So pretty much Life Simulator 2014.How does the gameplay compare to the other profuse survival games nowadays?Although there are many survival games that could be dubbed similiar to the Long Dark, nothing is truly like it, and most likely, nothing is as good as it either.One of the main differences is the environment. It's set in an Artic wasteland. Little shelter. Few supplies. Most survival games are either deciduous forest, or zombie based. This fits into neither of those categories.The weather is brutal, with harsh wind and immense temperature drops at night. You can fall through ice, get attacked by wolves, and fall off cliffs. But if you're smart, you can survive it.Another thing that I really love about the Long Dark's gameplay is the exploration. Granted, in the most challenging difficulty settings there is little time for exploration, but the beauty of the world is truly captivating, and it's a joy to wander through the treacherous landscape. Ironic, isn't it?Finally, the last major gameplay element I'll mention is how incredibly realistic this game is. You have to worry about everything. EVERYTHING. Wind. Temperature. Shelter. Hunger. Thirst. Fatigue. Broken bones. Infections. Hostile wildlife. Giant man eating ducks.Okay the latter poses much less of a threat than the previous ones but I think you understand what I mean. They have a calorie counter for crying out loud, what else could you want?How do the graphics stand?The Long Dark may or may not be a huge troll. And I'll explain why.The developers set you up against very difficult challenges, inside a cruel and unforgiving world, but they make it so beautiful. It's like they show you how beautiful the sword is, before they chop off your head. Irony, you see.But, really, the world is gorgeous. You're not blown away by the realism of it (like you are by the gameplay, more irony, you see), but it sure is stunning. I have the sceenshots to prove it. The lighting is phenomenal, the textures are masterfully constructed, and the landscape is truly a work of art. I also really like the almost hand-drawn feel of the visuals. Feels kind of rustic. I also should mention, though it's not visual based, the sound design of the game. Absolutely brilliant. The sound mixing is astounding. The way that the sounds of the wind and the distant wolf howls and your foot prints on the snow and the opening of your backpack all blend together so fluidly and dynamically really adds to the experience.One of the biggest complaints about Early Access games is their bugginess. Does the Long Dark glitch much?Firstly, I don't think that stereotype really is fair. I've played a decent amount of Early Access in a decent amount of games and have not run into very many bugs. And this needs to be said: I have never run into any glitches or bugs in the Long Dark.What more needs to be said? It runs stably and has never crashed on me, even on my horrible laptop, and I'm impressed.Is the Long Dark worth the $20?I only have 5 hours on this game, and I honestly don't know why. I think I could spend hundreds of hours on this game. It's got so much room for learning and exploring, especially with regular content updates being released so often. I would say yes, it is worth the money. Especially on sale. But for the full price, I would say it wouldn't hurt for you to know you like survival games, as you may be frustrated by the brutality of it.Does it have any replay value?Well, as of yet, it has no campaign. So I can't really review that yet.But I can say that I am drawn to continue my game after I survive long enough to actually have to save it and quit. That doesn't happen often. The game is addicting, despite it's difficulty, and will draw you back in to continue, or more likely, try again.So after all these questions, what's the verdict: is the Long Dark a good game?Yes.It's phenomenal.There's a reason why it has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam, it's absolutely fantastic. A fresh breath of air from the numerous, and mostly far less well designed, survival games out there.The gameplay is unique and innovative, the graphics are artfully designed, the sound mixing is exceptional, it's not that expensive, and, get this, it's not even done.It's in Early Access. There's a whole new game mode yet to come out.I would say buy this now, and watch it grow into it's true, colossal potential.Then you get to be a hipster: ""I liked it before it was cool!"".Take a break from Call of Duty, and play this masterpiece. It's worth your time.~ caleb4est			"

Early Access Review
								Innovation is almost always a good thing, especially in the relatively saturated and homogeneous survival genre. Procedurally generated post-apocalyptic worlds, need wood get wood, build block-based houses, form groups with other human players to survive, these are elements that are as overused as the faded tighty whities that I continue to wear to date. And who can forget the zombies.It's. Always. Another. Bloody. Ugly. Zombie.And that is why The Long Dark feels like a drop of pristine water on a wretched pair of lips. Its art-style is bold and deliciously refreshing in a game that is intended to simulate survival in the harsh conditions of the Northern Canadian Wilderness. Its rogue-like elements, such as permanent death and a finite amount of loot in the world, shifts the player's focus from spending hours upon hours developing a character and his or her humble abode, to spending hours upon hours replaying just to beat a previous personal best in terms of the number of in-game days survived. And instead of surviving against zombies, players in The Long Dark are tasked to survive against Mother Nature, which manifests in the form of biting windchills and harrowing blizzards, as well as the wolf denizens that perpetually roam the snowy terrains. The sound design of The Long Dark is also extremely well done. Everything from the crunch of your soles on snow, to the groaning and creaking of wooden floorboards as you scavenge a log cabin for much-needed supplies, to the resounding bellow of your hunting rifle as you fire it at a menacing wolf sounds engaging, immersive, and realistic.Yes, realism is The Long Dark's home address. Being caught outside while there is a windchill can be devastating, but hiding behind rocks sitting in the path of the direction of the wind can provide temporary relief to slow down the onset of freezing. The game's hunger system is also caloric based. Foods that you may loot from the environment have calories similar to their real-life counterparts (albeit scaled up slightly). Since all activities, including sleeping and standing still, burns calories, in order to survive your character has to consume a certain amount of calories each day. In addition, he or she also has to drink at least 2.2litres of water a day to prevent being dehydrated. On the other hand, innovation can be a two-faced ♥♥♥♥♥. If taken too far, it can detract immensely from a game's production values and amount to a gigantic waste of a developer's time. Reinventing a tried-and-tested wheel, or removing core gameplay elements of a particular genre for no apparent logical or worthwhile purpose, are typical examples of taking innovation one step too far. As much as The Long Dark is a unique game that stands well apart from the rest in the survival genre, Hinterland Studio has adopted a couple of gameplay design choices that are difficult to comprehend, and for lack of a better word, paradoxical.The biggest culprit lies in The Long Dark's surprising lack of player interaction with the environment. Besides interacting with the game's various containers that exist in the form of drawers, lockers, cupboards, stoves, starting a fire, and the occasional shooting of a wolf or deer, there is little else that the player can do to change or manipulate the environment. Necessary activities such as the cooking of food, harvesting of meat from an animal's carcass, or the boiling of snow to make potable water, are reduced to dull and meaningless loading bars that signal the progression of an activity. There is no farming, there is no fortifying of a prefabricated house to better ward off the cold or wolves. I could think of a hundred more things that a player, as a survivor in an icy wilderness, would be expected to do to survive better. Sadly, players in The Long Dark are robbed of those options because the game limits the ways in which they can interact meaningfully with their environment. Why this should be so in a survival game is bewildering. It metamorphoses an otherwise open-world survival game, one that should be a suitable platform for the inception of personal survival stories, whether heroic or tragic, into a linear game of repetitive choices.This is not to say that The Long Dark is bereft of player-made choices. In spite of the game's limited player-environment interactivity, players still have a good amount of decisions to make that dictates how well or how long they will survive in The Long Dark. For example, constantly traveling in the open when there is a strong windchill will result in your character burning more calories as he or she freezes, thus requiring you to expend more of your limited food supply each day restoring those lost calories. Similarly, being greedy and attempting to carry all of the loot scavenged from your most recent exploration trip will also result in more calories burnt as your character shoulders the heavier load. Making a second trip on another day to carry the remaining supplies back to your stronghold may be a better strategy. Finding a way to make the most out of your limited supplies is an obsession that will occupy players, especially the compulsive ones, for many hours on end.Nonetheless, the negative effects on the game's longevity as a result of its decision to eschew player interactivity in favor of simplicity and ease of uptake are manifest. Despite The Long Dark currently sporting 3 different maps for players to explore in sandbox mode, the relative constrained size of each map and the finite number of prefabs for players to loot means that each map can support at most 4-5 hours of proper gameplay. Beyond that, the game starts to devolve into a tiresome cycle of hunting for deer or wolf, foraging for wood, cooking meat and boiling water to sustain your character's physical needs, and resting in bed. There is nothing else to do. You cannot build, you cannot farm, all there is left to do is to wait for the inevitable end. A most unfitting conclusion to a game with so much potential.At its current sale price of USD$19.99 on steam, The Long Dark is barely worth a buy. My suggestion is to wait for a sale before spending some of your hard-earned money on this game. The Long Dark will most certainly become a better game with time. On the other hand, you are also unlikely to regret if you choose to invest in this game now. It is one of the most polished and interesting early-access survival game that is currently available on the market. And if you enjoy a rogue-like survival game that challenges you to do better in each successive game that you initiate, The Long Dark is capable of providing an almost endless number of hours of enjoyment. I am therefore giving The Long Dark the thumbs up.			"

								Once you have stepped  into ""The Long Dark"" not only do you emerge  yourself into a world of color and wanderlust, you step into someones incredible art. Its almost like wandering the mind of Lawren Harris (Group of Seven). through the beautiful everlasting snow. With every sunset, sunrise, blizzard, light snow, cloudy, full moon or just clear skys the game has a way of changing the scenery around every corner. Truely as an artist i cannot help but take endless screen shots! The gameplay is extreamly addicting for sure. Not many games out there add such detail to elemental survival. You will DIE a lot on your first several runs, but no shame in that. I would recommend playing on the hardest difficulty.The game will break the player and force him to become patient. One wrong step or latenight travel could be your last! One of the best survival games out there, VERY easy to get lost into ""The Long Dark!""The game is early Access but shows true promise to 100% completion of game.THIS IS THE ONE EARLY ACCESS GAME IM GLAD I SUPPORTEDI would highly recommend especially if you have an artistic mind.Visual Master Piece In The Making!11/10 Beautiful GameLove Canada!

								I usually don't like to recommend games in alpha to other people but although The Long Dark is in an early state it is incredibly fun.Just to be clear, you will die a lot. Wolves will hunt you, you will starve to death, you will freeze to death, you will jump down a stone and hurt your ankle and die because you have to sleep outside at night.You will face snowstorms and loose your way to shelter, you will die because of food poisoning and whatelse.But I'm drawn into this world and eager to just make it one more day. Or maybe two?You will never know because the things that happen to you in Sandbox mode are random. Most of the time, when you think: ""oh well, now everything is running fine for me"" something happens and you are confronted with problems of surviving. I was seeking shelter in a container home because the sun went down and it got late and all. So I repaired some stuff and went to bed, having some food in my inventory. I woke up at around 6 o'clock in the morning, opened the door and a big wolf jumped at me. I merely made it back to the shelter. So I just thought it might be a good idea to sleep another two hours, maybe the predator would be gone then. I woke up hearing the wind making some shivering noise and when I opened the door I was in the middle of a snow storm. So I had no other choice than retreating into my ""home"" again. At this point I had nothing left to eat. I went to bed again.When I stepped outside again, the storm was over and the air was clear. I was starving and thirsty but I was alive. On my way to my food storage I saw a wolf far away.  Not to cross his way I took a shortage over a hill, missteped and fell. I hurt myself and could barely walk. I made it to my other shelter, and fell to bed very exhausted. The next morning I felt better, had a full belly and melted some snow to drink. the weather was not as good, it was snowing, but without wind and again I had nothing to eat so I decided to make a short walk. It was misty and I couldnt see very far. I went around a small group of trees when I heard that wolf gnarling behind me. I tried to shake him off but I was still to weak. This is just one of a lot of different outcomes that are all random, nothing scripted in it. The only limits right now are the limits that influence your survival and the map size. :)I really love this game right now and I'm looking forward to the story mode.			"

Early Access Review
								310 hours dedicated to this game so far and growing! This game has been one of the most entertaining and immersive games I've played yet and this is just the sandbox. I can only imagine what the final, released version will be like with the story included! This review for now will focus on the early access version of the game.I can't think of any other games like it. A quiet apocolypse has taken place, technology as we know it is gone. The lights went out, never to return. How long can you survive against nature and everything it has to throw at you? There are no zombies. There are no mutants or aliens. Just you, nature and the need to survive. Scavenge what you can from the abandoned regions, hunt for food and find a warm place to spend the night. Just be aware that beyond the safety of your fireglow, green eyes flash in darkness, waiting for you to give them a chance to send you into the long dark. No one is coming to save you, so you'd best be ready to save yourself.Features:=======+No Zombies, no supernatural, no aliens, no occult! Just nature, and it's brutally unforgiving.+ A gorgeous art style fairly reminiscent of the Group of Seven. Iconic, refreshing and engaging, it's a nice break from photorealism and proof that games can be beautiful and immersive without being overly heavy on realism.+ Four modes of difficulty with vastly different challenges for all types.+ Crafting of the basic survival needs, like torches and bows, and animal skin clothing+ Survival simulation with a unnervingly believable feel. Monitor your temperature, hunger, thirst and energy levels. Think carefully about your food choices and plan your routes carefully. even a small injury could lead to much worse if left ignored.+ Challenge modes for those who work better under pressure. Added in the newest update, these challenge modes give seasoned players a few scenarios to complete. Originally there were only 2 but it has since grown to 5.+Comfortably playable with Mouse and Keyboard or with a controller.+Extremely well done voiceovers for the basic sandbox characters.+An out of this world sound experience. Every little sound you hear, from the wind in the trees to the clattering of old shutters, has a purpose and has been meticulously planned. A crow flying overhead may alert you to an approaching storm, a strange clang or clatter in a whiteout can point the way to safety. A growl in the darkness can sound your doom.  All of this atmospheric and immersive sound is punctuated by music tracks that serve to elevate the feel of the moment. Rather than play constantly in the background, these short musical interludes kick in to emphasize something and just as quickly fade out again. (The coming of night, the sun rising, A particularly lonely place, or a Change of weather.)+The game offers no hand-holding. You are dropped in the world and left to figure it out. You will die many times before it starts to make sense, but each time you fail, you get a better idea of how you can apply what you've learned to the next run.It should be noted that the only real drawback aside fomr the learning curve to the game is the fact that death is permanent. When you die you start again from the beginning, but even that makes for good compelling gameplay as it pushes you to be more careful about how you go about your survival.Early access means the game is still undergoing serious developement, but even in this current form, it's hard to believe it's an alpha. It's polished and professional with smooth gameplay and challenge that's well worth the full price. If you like sandbox/survival games, this is a great choice. If you like to simply play the game at your own pace and observe the quiet apocolypse, this game is still a great choice. And when story mode releases, I am certain those who like to play games for the storyline will also love it too. Hinterland is making a great first impression with The Long Dark.A solid 8/10, most likely a 10 once it hits release.			"

Early Access Review
								Not yet.(see 2nd paragraph for my real review) This game has plenty of potential but for now it's simply too lacking. Do you find yourself freezing in a cabin surrounded  by wooden furnitare and yet unable to find anything to burn? Why not break one of the chairs or the table or perhaps even the counter? But this game says no. Have a Jerrycan filled to the brim with karosen? That's great!  It's too bad you can't use it to start a fire. Find a dead deer and want to drag it back to your cabin? Nope, can't do that either. How about those pesky ever-breaking can openers; god knows I go through 15 of them a month... Or the breakable and weak hatchets and pry bars. Every summer I must spend $15,000 replacing all of them I break. Skinning an animal with a knife? watchout that knife will break into usless shards after four uses... How about using 3 coats to repair the one you're wearing? Nope, better cut those coats up into 1 scrap cloth peice each while needing 2 peices to add 15% more durability.Review: For a game that is focusing on realism it falls short in too many areas. The game sacrifices realisim for difficulty. The elements and lack of food should make the game hard enough; however, the game sees fit to give you a hatchet and hunting knife that you're not allowed to wield in defense; so you better punch that wolf lungeing for your jugular. The game also surrounds you with logs and wooden furnitare that you're not allowed to burn nor are you allowed to re-ignite fires from active coals from a recently dead fire. And don't even get me started on how quickly duribility on things like you clothes goes. In a matter of days(in-game) you'll see your equiped clothes lose duribility. There are way too many things that need to be fixed and added before this is remotely enjoyable / playable.			"

Early Access Review
								So. I first bought The Long Dark during the 2014 Christmas Sale way back when because I saw a video from a YouTuber saying it was good and had far, far too much money to waste. (which was all wasted in that very same sale. DAMN YOU GABEN.)On March 8th, 2015, I finally decided to make my first attempt at playing this game. I had been binging on a number of other games recently and finally decided ""Eh, I'll see what this whole thingamabobber is about.""Now, I was essentially going into this thinking ""indie survival simulator"" and getting terrible flashbacks of all the BAD attempts at the same genre that the indie community (and even the professional community) have made in recent years. Yes, the screenshots looked pretty and stylized, but I wasn't about to judge a game by graphics alone; if I did, then most entries of Call of Duty would suddenly jump above everything else from the very bottom of my list.I was going into this expecting to laugh my♥♥♥♥♥off at a poor attempt at gameplay and quality and tension in general.I was so, so, SO wrong.This game. This. F***ing game. This game is AMAZING.My first sandbox playthrough lasted about a day and a half, at which point I had run out of resources, was stuck in the middle of a blizzard with no firewood or starters, and was freezing my♥♥♥♥♥off. I decided to go quietly, laid down my bedroll, went to sleep, and never woke up.In that moment, I felt a part of my soul die with my character.This is not a game to be laughed at. This is not a game where you play it and look for all the bugs and errors to make fun of. This is a game that, within the first half-hour, will have you so incredibly and undeniably hooked that you care about your character in such a way that the game over screen reads like a gravestone of a close friend.Three pieces of advice for new players:First, expect a challenge. Even on the lowest difficulty where the wolves DON'T attack you, this game is punishing for your mistakes. As stated above, my first playthrough lasted about a single in-game day because I failed to account for resources properly. My second playthrough has lasted about five days, but I still don't see myself living past fifteen. This is not a game to mess around with: make EVERY MINUTE COUNT. Otherwise, you won't last very long at all.Second, expect to be surpised and stunned by the visuals. This is not a game that has ULTRA-REALISTIC 3D where EVERY SNOWFLAKE IS RENDERED AND DRAWN DOWN TO THE ATOMIC LEVEL. No, this is a low-poly, low-res-texture game, even on ultra graphics settings. And yet, despite ALL of that, the style alone makes up for it. During my first playthrough, one of the very first things I did was climb the tallest mountain I could reach. I made it up there at sunset and... well, I just stood there. I broke my very own rule of making the time count, because I was so shocked at how GORGEOUS this game can be. In my second playthrough, with even more time to explore, I have had my mind blown over and over and over again as this game delivers stunning view after stunning view. Despite not having AAA ultra-complex graphics, I can easily say that TLD is more beautiful than any AAA game on the market.Third, expect to become attached to your character. Seriously, you WILL come to care about your character. And THIS is why I truly love this game so much. In my ENTIRE GAMING CAREER, there are less than five games to EVER make me shed a tear. But when my first playthrough ended and my character passed away in his sleep, I did indeed shed a tear. I shed MANY. This game forges such a strong emotional bond between player and protagonist that I simply can't praise it enough. You have to play it and EXPERIENCE it to understand.So play it. For the love of every god I can think of and/or name, fictional or otherwise, PLAY THIS GAME. In an industry filled with parody games and vanilla, generic copies of old classics, The Long Dark delivers such an original, strong, and emotional presence that it simply cannot be ignored. So, to Hinterland Studio Inc., I applaud you for creating an experience unlike anything else I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy.You will not be wasting your time playing a poorly-concieved indie game here; you, as a living being, DESERVE this game. Do not deny yourself this experience. Enjoy The Long Dark in all its frozen glory.Now, with that said, I'm going to go back inside my fishing hut and eat some more delicious rainbow trout.			"

								Best athmospheric and balanced survival game ever. Never boring, just a little repetitive, this lonely adventure (sandbox) is wonderful! Cell shading graphics is very good in order to make the game feel alive (and sometimes to make you feel totally lost). Sounds are just great and weather effects (not just graphics one) awesome! Maps are really big. Even wild animals seems just little bugged. This game rocks. Personally this is the best survival experience I have ever had in a videogame, thanks also to HelixMod that let me play it in 3D Vision 2 (and it's perfect!). It has few ""secrets"" too, very nice to be found.Really recommended. 10/10.			"

								Full disclosure this is a VERY biased review...So, I consider myself to be a bit of an outdoorsman and as such I regularly daydream about what I would do if everything went to hell. My shower musings regularly involve which stores I would loot first in the event of a worldwide natural disaster and where I would hole up to ensure my survival. On that note, I absolutely LOVE this game. It has just about everything I could want from a survival game. Cabins to loot, wildlife to ""interact"" with, basic crafting, and what most survival games ignore, weather. Not just pretty cloud effects but actual weather that actually influences your character.As the game exists at this point (in alpha) it is still a game I would regularly come back to and see how long I can survive and from the dev blog releases it looks like it is only going to get better. I would recommend this game to just about anyone and I am VERY excited to see what the next couple of releases entail. Thanks Hinterland for making a game that feels like it was made specifically for me.			"

								Now this is a game worth talking about. Finally a survival game WITHOUT zombies, ghosts, beasts or anything horrific or supernatural. just man vs natureOnly having played the sandbox mode (story mode still in development) im hooked. having only the clothes on your back and the vast expance of a seemingly destroyed canada at your front your only task is to survive. its a rather simple game, you have the normal hunger, thirst and energy bars that must be kept full, but in this game you also need to brave the elements. snow, water, strongwinds and precarious ice shelfs. never once have i been so engrossed in finding and looting buildings, not knowing if i will be able to replace the jacket im wearing thats in a beyond repair state or even finding a pair of climate appropriate pants.in this game the weather is more dangerous then any animal or any beast you will come across in this game or others.mother nature is a cruel mistress. i recomend this game to any survival genre fan for this is a unique and beautiful take on a genre i belive to be overdone and over played. well done.EDIT: i wish i could change my review to in the middle. the gme is great BUT 3 years and no story mode. come on.

								The Long Dark is a thought provoking exploration-based survival game.  You find yourself stranded in the northern Canadian wilderness with only the clothes on your back and a few meager supplies that will last you for a short time.  The game's intersting hunger meter (a calorie counter) provides you with an accurate measure of your character's craving for food that makes you feel more determined to actually try and endure the cold.  Speaking of cold, the weather varies from absolute blizzards that can get as cold as -55ºC to crystal clear sunny days where you're lucky enought to get a temperature that's right around the freezing mark.  Just like most people in real life, you need to have clothes warm enough to bear the freezing weather if you plan on making a trek outside for a long period of time;  that is, unless you'd rather slowly freeze to death.  As an additional way to combat the cold, you create campfires, light fireplaces, and even use kerosene lamps to warm you if you are getting too cold.  An ever growing issue in this game is your thirst.  Water can either be unsafe or potable.  Clean water can be found relatively easy as it is  prevalent in the world (Ex: drinking out of toilets).  Unsanitary water can be boiled over a fire or fireplace to clean and be made drinkable.  Soda can be found in most abandoned homes, they contain both calories and help quench your thirst.  Coffee and tea can be made as an additioinal source of liquids as well as containg special properties that make them slightly better than water.  If you're ever unable to find any of these and you have the materials needed to create a fire, you can melt snow into clean water.  Your fatigue is an important factor in determining your survival.  The longer you go without sleep and the more strenuous the activities you do are, the more lethargic and slow your character becomes.  This can be remedied by taking a nap.  If you're lucky enough to find a weapon you can defend yourself from the wolves which are your only real predator in the game.  Wolves are a surprisingly terrifying adversary in a game such as this.  Ammo for your rifle (which is the only firearm available this early in the game) is scarce and you are required to conserve and effiectively use your ammunitions for hunting deer or other smaller game or to protect yourselves against wolves.  Flares are also an effective recource to use in defending yourself from animals.  The Long Dark is overall a great survival game.  This review was written during the alpha and I'm sure there are many more features to come.  I'd easily give this game a 9/10.			"

								This is one of those games where you sit down to play for fifteen minutes and the next thing you know it's 2AM and you've been playing for four hours.If you are experienced with real life survival you MAY get frustrated by a few things but the game even says right in the startup that they've taken certain liberties to make the game more A GAME.  For example in real life wild animals will rarely attack you.  However they could easily add something to the game that the event that caused the protagonist to crash or get stranded may have also effected animals behavior?  At least that's what I keep telling myself and it's good enough for me.I do wish the bow in the game had a little more oomph as in all honesty I find it to be useless but that could simply be I'm not good with it.Also the rabbit snares don't resemble anything close to life as real ones would be put between live trees and not set up in the open.I would also like to see a challenge mode that generates random terrain.  Once you play the game enough you have an idea of where items tend to appear and where to get around.  If things were random it would be a real survival situation whenever you start a new game.I would also like to see seasons.  For those of us who have a game 100-200 days long you might expect some more warmer days.  But, again, lets just assume the world has changed in the game as we don't know what is going on.  Or maybe it could be in some high altitude mountains for all we know.ALL THAT SAIDI love the game.  I think it's outstanding and get excited whenever steam updates it.  I can't wait to jump in and see where it's been updated.The music is wonderful.  The graphics although stylized are more than satisfactory and seem to improve at every update.  The controls are fluid and became second nature almost immediately.  The menus are hit and miss.  I've been playing for long enough I've seen this change a few times.  Sometimes they improve although in my opinion the survival menu was a bit easier to understand before while now it has a kind of HUD thing going.  Personally I preferred the previous menu but I'll give it time.  I may grow to like this one.It may sound like I'm complaining but I'm simply pointing out some minor issues as the core of the game is outstanding.  Considering this is an unfinished game that's already quite impressive.  Bug-wise once in a blue moon I'll have the game crash but I can count on one hand how many times that's happened and I've had the game for months.It's a very good, original outstanding game.  I HIGHLY recommend it.  It's one of my favorite games, possibly ever, no lie.  I just hope they keep building on it.			"

One of those games where you get caught gawking at the enviorment because its so damn pretty... not many bugs at all and the ones that are there get fixed fairy quickly (good devs updating constantly) and apparently theres a movie coming out based on this... seems strange to base a movie on an unfinished game but eff it, mayzell...

Early Access Review
The Long Dark is a 1st rate survival game, with a back story that already speaks; even while the game is in Alpha. Currently, you only play the game in ""sandbox mode."" This amounts to an open world survival experience, where you spawn at one of a variety of points on a predetermined map. A geomagnetic storm brings your small plane down in the Canadian wilderness. You are unprepared, and it's freezing cold. As if that weren't enough pressure to get you moving your worthless tennis shoes, you soon find you aren't the only creature slinking along using the hills to break the wind as you hunt for shelter before darkfall. Choosing Apocalypse: Though everyone is talking, and gaming, the demise of modern civilization, not everyone agrees on the possible scenarios. If you prefer an end like that described in the book The Road, by Cormac McCarthy, where you wander the beautiful countryside, quietly chronicling the passing of an era; you may choose the Pilgrim mode to sure starving and freezing.  If you subscribe to the idea of a countryside ravaged by wildlife gone mad in a frenzy for food, as in the book The China Pandemic by A.R. Shaw, then you would probably choose the Stalker mode. This is described as a punishingly challenging survival experience in the menu. There is a good middle road for those like myself who want a challenge that is somewhere in the middle. The Voyageur mode is described as equal parts hunter and hunted. Wolves and bears stalk you as you try to scavenge for food. This is the only mode I have played, as the Stalker seems a bit over-challenging for me right now. When you go out to find food, you are stalked by the wolves and bears. You try to hibernate as much as possible, but this won’t last long. Blizzards arise at any given moment. You don’t know when you leave your base whether or not a storm will appear, so you have to choose carefully what you will take with you. If a wolf is stalking nearby when you plan to return, you may not be able to get back to your base. This is the middle choice. You have been warned if you choose the Stalker mode. For the purposes of this review I will describe my 100 hours experience in the Voyageur route.Saving your hides: There is no forgiveness in this game. You will go out to find food with tools and weapons that you find. The shotgun takes a learning curve. The knife and axe are trusty. You can harvest meat and hides from carcasses you find, or you can kill your own meat. But, the game does not allow saving. It saves automatically when you enter the door of a building, and when you sleep in a bed, or fall into the Long Dark sleep of death. It’s too late when you are staring into the fangs of a wolf to use the alt-tab function and return to the last place you entered a door or slept. That route must be chosen before the wolf grabs you.Survival methods in this game mirror real-world survival methods. First, I load up for a trip. Then I go outside the door, and immediately back inside to initiate an autosave. While I was out there, I made a quick recon of the area to be sure no wolves or bears were nearby. Then, having good info, I make some final decisions about my trip, and I am ready to venture out into the unknown in search of sustenance and survival.  Crafting: Unlike many other survival games, TLD uses a more realistic crafting system. You must lay your collected hides out on the floor to cure them for an amount of time, before beginning to craft clothing. Then, you complete the crafting in your spare hours over a number of days, just as you would really make your own clothes. You must repair all your clothing and tools frequently, as they degrade in a realistic manner in the arctic cold winds. You are able to choose and change your clothing by degrees of warmth provided and by weight. Your stats are adversely affected by heavier weights over time, and your character is worn out by carrying too much. You must choose carefully or die sooner. You will die. But, it is better to survive and die, than to have never survived at all. NarrativeThe Story mode is not finished as the game is in early release. But, I believe from dev comments that it is almost finished. In the year I’ve had the game, they have made frequent updates. I am very excited to see the actual story, which is already “showing through the cracks” so to speak, in the sandbox. The achievements, as well, pull in stories of their own, and provide a sense of accomplishment that is unparalleled.Graphics & Sound: There are several new maps in the Sandbox mode, and each one features the most surreal and hauntingly lovely nature scenes, in an art style that is screaming for an artbook in the final release. I only hope they go all out with that idea, as the art is phenomenal! And, speaking of final release... the story mode is nearing completion. I've already spent months on end in Mystery Lake's map alone, so I can imagine the hours of game play the story mode will provide. Graphics are done in a realistic art that looks hand-drawn. The view is splendid from anywhere in the game. The music is great for this genre, as it doesn’t get in the way of game play, and yet appears at points of high-drama, like just as you near starving to death.Genre Comparison: I bought this at the same time I bought Stranded Deep, and a couple of other intensive survival games. The Long Dark far exceeds every other survival game I've played. Where you find a lack of resources to build anything substantive in SD, The Long Dark keeps you immersed in crafting weapons, curing animal hides to craft deerskin clothes, finding bunkers, exploring ever-changing scenery, and a realistic survival experience that promises to define a genre.There are many survival games. But, there is only one Long Dark. Where games like the Wasteland series and Sheltered come across slightly cheesy, (not to mention often clunky mechanics) TLD is realistic in concept and execution. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a good game, with a great story, but it has more sci-fi elements to it, where TLD lives within the realm or today and tomorrow. And, some of those are not presented in life size action like in TLD’s silent apocalypse. Savage Lands is life size, and appreciable for its own unique crafting, and somewhat medieval look. Yet, I found it somewhat unbelievable that you would run-up to an unmoving deer and slay him on the spot. In TLD you must stalk your prey, as in the real world, because they will run when frightened. I think that sums up the effect: the wildlife AI is responsive to the player.Pros: * Unmatched Survival Realism* Dynamic Weather * Hibernation Simulation* Stats react to loads carried and the weather conditions* You craft your own meds and heal yourself* Ice Fishing, rabbit trapping, and hunting with bows that you craft* You can recycle tools and weapons to repair or build new equipment* Frequent UpdatesCons: *The cook stove or campfire interface is “locked in” and you can’t perform other tasks while cooking.  *The same locked-in interface stalls your view of the countryside while ice-fishing. I only hope they will improve this, but it doesn’t affect gameplay. * ATM, there is no ability to map your area. But, there are links to maps in the community hub. These are possibly created by the fan-base, and differ in degrees of accuracy.I recommend this game for those who enjoy a challenging survival experience with complex components. This is no simple game. Firing the shotgun takes a learning curve, and trial and error. But, once you learn to fire it, you find yourself bringing in multiple animals in one hunt. The more challenging achievements require you to survive without firing a gun, and live off the land. One simple mistake leaves you facing the fangs of a wolf, or freezing to death. This is definitely a game you won't want to miss.			"

								The Long Dark is a lot of things, but most importantly: it's not another unfinished game on Early Access. This game is going places. The Devs work really hard, and this game has been virtually reinvented in the time I've owned it (about a year). Hinterland has laid out a roadmap for where they want the game to go in the future, and those ideas are being regularly implemented in updates every three to four months or so. What are in the updates? New features and additions to the Sandbox mode, the best part of the game at this point while we wait in anticipation for Story Mode. The Sandbox is amazing. The wildlife simulations aren't perfect, but the whole weather systems and the places you can explore (mountains, lakes, mines, dams, scenic overlooks and seemingly endless forests) and the things you can do (kill deer, wolves, bear, craft items, balance cans of soup on the corpse in the camp office of mystery lake) are what makes this game great. The sunsets are surprisingly beautiful at the end of the world.			"

								A few of the many things I like about this game so far:- Extremely atmospheric environment and especially weather effects (wind, snow, fog etc)- Beautiful graphics, the lighting in particular (you don't often feel the need to spend 10 or 15 minutes enjoying an in-game sunset)- Nights are actually dark, there's no mysterious illumination from nowhere to help you get around as in most other games- All kinds of neat realistic touches: the more you carry the slower you can move; walking into a howling gale is slower than walking ahead of it; you can hide from the wind behind tree trunks; accidentally walking into your own campfire results in a burned foot (doh)Very absorbing and often quite tense despite the lack of conventional ""action"". It's easy to find yourself completely lost when the weather turns to fog and snow, changing a nice sunny stroll in the woods to ""Oh crap it's -35C and I need to get a fire started ASAP or I'm going to freeze!"". Interested to see where the story mode goes when that is complete, but the sandbox mode is worth paying for already.			"

								It took twenty days, five hours and fifty-six minutes before I stared death in the eyes one final time. It happened slowly, painfully and has stuck with me since it happened forty-seven minutes ago. It started in the afternoon of the twentieth day. I hadn't had a thing to eat since the morning before, and the Canadian camp-site office building offered nothing more for my famished stomach. The fishing lines had broken and I had no rifle, yet I had twenty rounds of ammunition. With that being said, it was time to take my chance in the wilderness again. I took one step forward and planted my sockless feet down into the snow.I wandered down the traintracks until I encountered a wreck with two carriages. I snuck into the the first, wary of the several wolves patrolling the local area. By now my health had dropped to around 80%. I knew the risks of entering the carriage with a wolf so close by, but I would have done anything for a granola bar or the like. Unfortunatley the first carriage yielded nothing. As I left, the wolf howled and began chase. I immediately backtracked and sprinted roughly a hundred metres before running out of breath. He caught up, mauled me, and my health had dropped to 12% before I could fend him off with my hunting knife. I patched my wounds but the painkillers and antiseptic wouldn't bring my health back - only sleep would. I limped back from which I came, snuck past the wolf that had bitten me and the rest of his pack and continued up the train tracks until I discovered safety - a dam nestled between two snowy peaks.I entered with 6% health. It was looking grim, but I hadn't been here before so there was a high chance I would stumble onto some food. It was also dark, with visibility at a minimum. However, the torch at the entrance took care of that almost immediately. As I made my way further into the complex, I discovered what can only be described as a gift from God - it was a granola bar. 300 calories into the system, slight warmth from being inside - things were looking up. It didn't take longer than a minute for all my dreams to be taken away from me, however, as the devil himself decided to crush what hope I had left. It started as a growl, and grew into a nightmare as a came face-to-face with a wolf that seemed almost as large as I was. A wolf? Inside? Impossible. For a moment I thought it was a trick of the light, possibly a trick of the mind, but not a second later my doubts were gone as I felt the warm saliva of the beast as it tore into my throat and left me for dead in the dam, on a cold and frosty Canadian afternoon.9/10, a little performance upgrade possibly, (or maybe that's on my end) but this is one of the best survival games I have ever played. It felt complete, and I completely forgot it was in alpha. What these guys have now is a complete game, so whatever they decide to add will make it incomparable to anything on the market.			"

								I was running across a frozen lake having just stocked up a few various shelters in the area with supplies. I had made it eleven days at this point. Food was plentiful, supplies were more than I could carry and I had a nice rifle and half a dozen rounds to go along with it.It was four hours from sundown. I was just a stones throw away from the base of the hill where my main shelter was. It was a glorious two story, wood panel cabin with a bed with my name on it. I could see it at this point from where I stood on the lake. But between myself and my gloriously warm bed, right at the base of the hill, crept a bear. It was a big, overbearing giant. It was easily three, even four times my size. But it was also a source of majestic food. Food, pelts and guts for curing.I lowered myself into a crouch and slowly approached it. Rifle drawn, crosshair as best I could place it with my shaky hands, I got within twenty meters of the beast. I slowed my breathing as best I could, placed the crosshair center mass and pulled the trigger. The crack echoed in the eerie cold silence, ripping the air apart as it reverberated. There was nothing at first. No movement, no accompanying growls or grunts, just nothing. I stood up, chambered another round and took aim once again. I approached the lifeless corpse hesitantly, still aware of the potential danger if it weren't to be fatally wounded. I got within an inspecting distance and peered at it. Still no movement. It was truly dead. I...this cold, hungry and very frightened woman shot this great beast with one measly round and killed it?HA! TAKE THAT NATURE! I WILL PREVAIL!With just over three hours of sunshine left I dug straight into the corpse, carving hide from flesh and tearing flesh from bone. There was so much it was just incredible, I mean the food alone could easily last another fortnight! I'll harvest as much as I can so the wolves don't take it. After all, the cabin is just up that small hill there. Hours ticked past and all the hacking and cutting was slowly tiring me while the sun slowly dipped further past the horizon.I wasn't even halfway through it all when I realised the sun had completely dropped from the sky and the chills of night had crept upon me. Its icy fingers had slid its way into my clothing and all down my extremities. My vision was numbing and my pack was too heavy to run with. I started the short climb towards the cabin with my lantern in front of me, my vision starting to fade. Suddenly, the snap of a twig, the howl of a wolf. He's just meters away. I drop my lantern and pull out my rifle. BANG! The bullet whizzes past the wolf's head and he squeals, turning heel and running the other way. Phew. I won't be that lucky again. I continue the short walk to my cabin. It's just up there. I can see it right ahead now. I can just about touch the doorknob, smell the fireplace. Then a loud growl and a sudden impact and another wolf is upon me. With my very last bit of energy I put my arm in front of myself and watch as the wolf rips into my throat and severs my jugular and sends me fading off into The Long Dark.  "

Early Access Review
								I have been playing The Long Dark for several hours now daily for the last several days. I think it is fair to call this game a ""singleplayer survival experience."" Here's what I find relevant to share with the Steam Community as of now:AboutThe paralleling concept of this game is based on the premise of you, a plane crash victim, surviving in a number of environments abandoned by humanity. With the object of survival /obviously/ in mind, you spawn in a random place on the map and must scavenge for food, water, shelter, and other assets of survival for as many days as possible.ImpressionsWhen I first dropped into the game world, I died within 17 hours. I was really edgy and tense playing this game for the first time, expecting wolves at every corner. I played with the lights out, and sure enough, I got a jumpscare when a wolf tackled me and tore my character apart (yay for wolves tearing characters apart!) My second game has been a lot better and I have survived just over a week so far.Time in the game passes slowly, a day in gameplay is almost a full hour. So with this game, you are guaranteed a great deal of hours that you can spend in the action.The graphics, as far as indie games go, are pretty good. Textures are occasionally just ""O.K."" But what is to yell about is the art direction. This said, the overall scenery and ambience that makes up this game is stunning. The sunrise and sunset is beautiful, the snow is pretty, the lighting of user-usable items is realistic and alludes well to the general game world. It is relevant to acknowledge that unlike some games in the ""Survival-Adventure"" genre title, this game is not procedurally generated. Meaning: it's not a new map everytime like games such as Minecraft. Despite this being so the case, the game has felt seemingly infinite. After playing a rather decent number of hours, I know I have only scratched the surface of the exploration on the map. Will I like it?Though it IS an early access title, I think many people will be very pleased by the definite unique style the game brings. It is a nice break from the generic multiplayer gameplay introduced and obviously found in games like DayZ and Unturned. Though it is a neccesity to acknowledge that these games are both fine titles, it is equally fair to acknowledge that their gameplays involve a number of crude dynamics turning other individuals, the environment, zombies, and other things against you in a constantly regenerating world. In the universe of ""The Long Dark"", once things are gone: they are gone, they will not come back. The realistic experience of limited resources and materials can only be broken by a number of actual renewable resources in the wild. The differences are fair and don't really subtract anything from the gameplay. If anything, they add a great deal of intensity and action to your experience.It's very fair to say that your only enemy in this game is how slow you move. Failure to keep moving means definite death. You will either certainly starve, freeze, or be torn to shreds by the wild wolves of the wilderness.Final WordsOverall, you will like this game, but only if you're up for taking long treks across big chunks of open world, exploring, potentially being attacked by wild animals, and playing with many basic survival game dynamics. At this point, as the game lies as an EAG, I would give it an 8/10. They've done a great deal of work to make this game a wonderful experience so far for myself and hundreds of others, however, there are certain things that could definitely be added, changed, edited, or completely removed.I look forward to seeing the future development of this game. I will refer back to this review as development progresses to update users here of the changes (game-wise, personally/opinion-wise, etc.) Shouts to Hinterland Studio, and best of luck!Thank you, hopefully this review has served you well. See you on the dark side!			"

								Fantastic survival game!No zombies, no enemy soldiers, no aliens or vampires. Your adversary here is the cold and scarcity of food.A wonderful expansive environment awaits your exploration if you survive long enough to find/craft some decent clothing.You'll feel the panic rise as you get totally disoriented in a heavy snow storm.You'll feel elation as you snare your first rabbit.You'll feel terror as a bear charges you.You'll feel relief as you make it home to your warm cabin after a long day scavenging carcasses.This game is so brilliantly balanced that you never feel cheated, but survival is tough. You need to plan your outings into the cold, and make the most of the daylight hours to attend to your immediate needs, when things work out it's hugely satisfying, and when they don't your situation can become dire, but there are plenty of resources to aid you if you're determined to live.The UI works untuitively and quickly whilst leaving the screen uncluttered, I play with an xbox controller and everything is fast and easy. Mouse and keyboard works well too.The Audio is worth special mention -   The distant cries of wolves, the howling wind, the creaking of your cabin and the crunching of the snow are wonderfully rendered and the immersion and atmosphere created by the soundscape is really something special.The game is 'Early access' and things are being added, the devs seem to care very much about their product, are open to suggestions so I believe the game will only get better, but just as it is now is worth your pennies.Buy this game, you'll love it.

								I had survived for five long, cold days. At dawn I exited the little cabin by the lake and walked out onto the ice. This frozen expanse had provided me with valuable resources, so I made my camp in the lodge across the way. As I began to make my way back to camp, we spotted each other. A very large, very angry bear stood to my right. We locked eyes and everything stopped. I raised my rifle as he charged and fired. Direct hit, but still he came. As the remaining three bullets did little to slow him, I realized this was it. He hit with the force of a runaway truck. Teeth and claws thrashed and ripped by clothes and flesh. The attack lasted mere seconds, but the damage was done. I pulled myself, bleeding and bruised from the ice and administered what little first aid I had. With the last small ounce of adrenaline left in me, I began to run. Straight across for the lodge where all of my extra supplies, firewood and food were. The black crept into the edges of my vision. My staggering grew worse. I couldn't walk straight, but still I pushed on. After what seemed like a lifetime, I pulled myself to the door of the cabin and went inside. Slowly up the stairs, vision all but gone, I crept. Finally, I lit a fire with my last accelerant and a few books. Water, food, rest and pain killers pulled me back from the brink over the next day. When back at 100 percent, I ventured out for more ice fishing, only to be surrounded by wolves and killed; overtaken by hypothermia and blood loss. I survived six days, eight hours.			"

								The Long Dark has come a long way since I last reviewed it. It strives to offer a unique realistic survival experience, but falls just short. It requires some balancing and is still lacking some content, which I really hope gets added before being considered finished. In it's current state I would recommend it on sale, but not full price. I will not be discussing the ""Pros"" in this review, because there are enough that do that already. For the record, this is all subjective and based on my opinion of the game in its EARLY ACCESS STATE, but I think many will agree.--- Lacking Content ---There are not very many craftable items yet(?) and as you play, you can't help feel that some are missing. Like literally needing to forge arrow heads in a furnace instead of rigging some using scrap metal, flint or even just sharpening the arrow shaft to a tip.You can find and read survival books that surely would teach how you to make and use a bow drill to start fires (while it is challanging, it's still possible) or pieces of flint.I know in Canada your options would be limited in terms of out door shelters, but you should be able to build a small temporary lean-to out of pine branches to protect you some from the weather while you harvest an animal.This is a minor complaint, but maybe another weapon or two? like some form of common pistol or compound bow, just to add some diversity instead of finding several identical rifles.---The Balance---Your chance to start a fire is too low for being indoors with an actual stove. Having matches, tinder and wood in those circumstances, should result in a chance of no less than 75%.You eat too much. Your character is suppose to be an average person I presume, but eats as much as an Olympic athlete. Frequently eating an entire wolf, entire deer or several 2lb fish in a day? I think that's excessive. Should get more meat from animals or burn less calories to balance that out.Tools break unrealistically fast yet and are repaired too slow.---Other---I understand not being able to chop down a large tree with a small hatchet, but I think you should still be able to break branches off with it?Not sure anything can be done about this, because of how the games mechanics are implemented, but it's frustrating to waste a precious 2 hrs watching snow melt or water boil. You should be able to put it on the stove and do something else while you're waiting like fishing, crafting, fixing items, harvesting, etc. - - - OUT DATED REVIEW - - -EARLY ACCESS REVIEW: Simplifying this review, because some people, apparently, didn't understand what I was saying.This is not a bad game, but it has a few problems that prevent me from recommending it, at the moment. It will likely improve over time.I'M AWARE THAT THE GAME IS NOT FINISHED. With that said, lets get down to business. . .You are not rewarded for critical thinking or your knowledge of the wilderness.Survival in this game, seems to be a matter of luck an learning to survive the games mechanics.Things break unrealisticly fast (e.g. Your clothes will break and fall off from walking). Want to craft a weapon, like sharpening a stick to defend yourself from wolves, like Liam Neeson in ""The Grey""? Can't do that. . .  yet? Have to fist fight them with your bare hands (You lose). There is a gun, if you can find it and equally important, ammo. It's the only weapon in the game so far. I've plundered about 15 structures in my 2 hrs and didn't find it.It seems like there will eventually be some sort of crafting system (via work bench), but its definitely not finished.Plan on being hardcore and surviving the unforgiving canadian wilderness, by living off the land or out of a cave in a realistic way, without stealing supplies from people? No chance. You are FORCED to break into random structures and steal supplies.It's fine if you want to do that, but be aware, there is no way around it. I can only assume, based on the way everything is currently balanced, that there are no plans to support that. If it bothers you, as it does me, you may want to wait on purchasing.I'd like the option to survive off the land, because while thats impossible, I hardly consider it a survival game. You should not NEED to rely on buildings and the contents inside them. It's rather new, so most of these problems will likely be fixed over time, but as of now, I just can't recommend it. I'm not trying to bash the game, but give useful criticism to the developers so they can improve the game and to you, so that you know what you're buying.			"

								Only in its alpha stage and already The Long Dark is the best survival game I've ever played.  Every choice you make matters.  Every second counts.  What I love most about this game is all the different elements that are combined in determining how long you can withstand the fight to survive.  There's the standard health, but that's really the least of your worries.  In a game where you can literally freeze to death, the thing you should be most concerned about is the unpredictable weather.  On top of that is the ever-present threat of hungry wolves and bears.  Sure, there's deer and rabbits, but if you're willing to downgrade to dog food as means for sustenance, then you can bet those wolves and bears won't even stop to think before trying to take a bite out of you.  Next on the list is the matter of shelter.  You're not always going to be able to hide away in cabins (and for those lucky enough to find them, bunkers).  No, there are going to be times when you're going to have to try and find somewhere to camp out at when fatigue has run you ragged.  The great thing is that fire isn't really an issue.  You have a multitude of options when it comes to making yourself your own little bonfire, and it's not all that hard to do.  Now I'm going to circle back around to that standard health deal.  Water?  Yeah, it's your lifeline.  You can survive a little while when you're starving, but dehydration will kill you swiftly.  Your source of water is melting snow at the fire.  However, just that isn't enough.  You need to boil the water to make it safe, or else you're at risk of getting sick.  Are we having fun yet?  You might be thinking, ""This game has way too many factors working against me.  It's not even worth it.""  Not entirely true (as far as the first part; the second is up to you to decide).  The funny thing is that food isn't as big a worry as you'd think.  Remember those deer and rabbits I mentioned earlier?  Sometimes you'll run across the frozen remains of a deer and be able to harvest some meat.  When you do find shelters, then you're guaranteed to find some kind of food (and no, not just dog food).  And if you get desperate enough, you can always eat cattails you find along the edges of waterways.  Of course the level of difficulty plays a big factor in just how hard it is to survive.  My favorite is the difficulty setting in where wolves and bears won't attack you!  Unless provoked... it's not that easy.All in all, this game is really just wonderful.  There's no such thing as too much praise.  The most exciting thing?  This game is still in the alpha stage, and there's still a story mode to be explored!			"

								Weak Ice... I thought it's the name of the area. I had tons of food and supplies.. all of those drowned with me. 10/10 I'm stupid. :'(I recommend this game because I've enjoyed it so far (although I've only managed to survive for over 4 hours). It's challenging. You play the role of a pig, hungry every 5 mins and would drink water from the toilet. Every positive review already mentioned why they recommend the game. Great atmosphere, graphics is beautiful, sound effects are perfect. This is a must have eventhough it's still in early access. Can't wait for the full release. I hope they add more content to it. :D			"

								I fell in love with the game's storyline when I saw this little project on kickstarter.  A small team of dev's wanted to make there mark as a studio.The storyline was so good I backed it right away. Right now there is only one map with the sandbox mode and you can play with voice acting by Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale(Geeking out there).With Early Access build the UI has been super-sleeked up. This team amazes me with every update. With about 90 hours on the game clock and navigating a 50 day then a 72 day run back to back I never even got bored once. Every decision can result in live and death. Buying into this game now is the best investment you can make on steam right now. Big AAA companies put out cookie cutter games every year with $60 dollar price tags and bugs day one. I assure you in all my years of gaming have I never met a company that works as hard as this little indie team. I know my review will be eclipsed by ""Ran into wolf, peed my pants"" 10/10 but I give my 100 percent endorsement of this game as the Current all time King of the Long Dark.Why are you still reading? BUY ALREADY!			"

								When I first began playing this game, I absolutely loved it.That was three years ago, the game is still in early access, and the promised story mode never materialized.  I suppose it's possible that in two more years, they might actually release the game I paid them for, but until then, it's just a giant pointless sandbox.  If that's your thing, go for it. The survival elements of this game are the best I've seen.  As for me, I can only play an open-ended sandbox for so long. I frequently check in to see if the story mode has a release date yet and am always disappointed. If they ever release it, I'll give it a shot, but at this point it would have to be absolutely amazeballs to justify this wait.			"

								I'm writing this while we are at Alpha v 0.183, so some things could change for sure.I bought this on a whim because it was on sale for $10. I was initially kinda turned-off by the graphicsbecause they seem a bit cartoonish. But as I've played, I've seen they are quite sufficient i.e. servethe purpose. A lot of people at this point are complaining about the wolves being too hard. There is an option nowto play without them if you wish. But seriously, they are only hard till you learn by dying a bunch of timeshow to handle them. It's a steep and harsh learning curve. Survive or die trying! It's hard to put my finger on WHY I love this game so much. I think it's because it's a lot simpler than a lotof other games. I like Skyrim, but I had to read up on it for two weeks when I started. There is not much tolearn with this game as the interface is quite intuitive. How to handle the wolves is maybe the only thingyou will want to google. I think it appeals to the prepper in me to survive another day, clawing and grabbing against horrible odds,whether it be a blinding snowstorm with no shelter in sight, or being nearly out of food with a wolf outside.You CAN handle the wolves. I've learned to avoid them from experience. On my current run, I am 53+ daysin and only fought one once or twice at most. Most of the time you can outrun them. Don't let the wolvesdiscourage you.I also have to mention that the audio is stunning in this game. The creak of tree branches, etc.Bottomline is that you might be surprised how this game stirs you at a deep level to keep trying to beatyour previous record. Try it! Rise to the challenge and say up-yours, Mother Nature!!!			"

								What  a brilliant game.You start in the middle of nowhere, in 4 foot of snow surrounded by trees with nothing but your clothes. You trudge into the unknown, get attacked by a wolf and die.New day, new life. Again, In the middle of no where, but now there is a blizzard, and you can't even see the trees, you head off, with no idea where you are going, and a few hours later, you die of exposure.After a few episodes like this, finally you stumble on a small cottage, it has candy bars!! And soda!!! and a prybar!!! Happy and prepped, you set off to find some fire wood and freeze to death.The feeling of isolation is overwhelming and complete. You feel the cold, you feel the hunger and most importantly you feel the desire to keep playing and beat the odds, to give the cold harsh landscape one giant finger, and stubbonly keep bashing away at it. I don't know how they have done it, but the game gives you a real will to survive and keep playing. It's brutal and unforgiving, and that's it's charm.I have never played a game as utterly and immediately immersive as this one, and it's still in alpha.In a game genre littered with alternatives and repetitive mechanisms, The long Dark manages to be refreshingly original, and beautiful. How do you manage to make the frustration of getting no where so addictive and fun? Ask Hinterland.Well played.			"

								After encountering hundreds of 'survival/craft' games, one thing remains constant. That is, the game's tendency to make things easier over time, to the point where you feel a little OP. Not with this little gem. you're character never adapts, only YOUR mind as the player. each waking day is a constant battle of survival. In other games, wolves are the weakest of enemies. But in this game,they are a terrifying monsters alone, and impossibly cunning deathbringers in packs. this is a game that brings survival back to it's root.. you dont sit and build 10 story wooden forts, you dont build firearms and armour, you scrounge what you can together to make a bandage, or repair a torn jacket. cos without that, you'll bleed or freeze to death. permadeath and random spawnpoints create a unique story with each playthrough. You end up feeling for your charachter, willing them to make through another hour in a blizzard, or with only a few candy bars. As much edge-of-seat excitement as a brilliant novel or tv series with it's atmospheric music and sound, and it's constant near-death experiences. and the final blow comes when your little survivor finally succumbs to the cold whilst lost in a blizzard, or is ravaged by a wolf that has stalked them for days.. your only memoir that they existed.. their journal. detailing where they went, what they found, what their state of health was and what finally ended thier story. collect enough journals of survivors that never made it and you get a sneak peak into the final days of a few desperate individuals as the harsh, gritty wilderness swallowed them all up.

								Was bored on a Thursday night, scrolling through the scarce amount of games that were actually made to run on Linux, when I came across The Long Dark. It was already on my wishlist for some reason so I just bought it. Started playing at about 11:30PM, walked around until I found the dam. Spent a good amount of time there and developed the idea that this was a safe space. It was warm, food and drink everywhere, and plenty of resources. I eventually left, unhappy with the mere 5% of the world I had explored, and sure enough, I died within a day of leaving the dam. Next playthrough, I spawned somewhere I hadn't been yet, on a large lake with a lot of fishing huts. I liked the dam but this was even better, supplying me with more tools than the dam had. So I set up shop in the camp office for a day or two, then set out exploring again. Figured I'd better stop by the dam just to stock up on supplies before heading into the unknown. I was happily greeted by my two crates at the front door, spent my time with all the lockers in the first room, then made my way to the safe on the first floor. I was listening to music because the game sounds are a bit off putting at 2 in the morning, but I had to pause this in order to crack the safe. Got it open, dissapointed to find only more forsaken newspapers. I turn around to continue looting, when a deafening growl penetrates my earholes, startling me and making me try to light a lantern with no oil in it. As I look to the door I see two little beads floating mid air. After a second I realize it's giant ♥♥♥♥ing wolf, in my ♥♥♥♥ing safe space, and in the midst of trying to climb back into my desk chair and put my headphones back on, then trying to figure out how to light and throw a flare for the first time, the thing flies across the room and tackles me. I manage to fight it off, not that that really does anything except delay the enevitable. I try to make my way to the door, as my safe space has been tainted and I wish to never return. I throw as many flares as I can everywhere, assuming the beast will just go back to wherever the hell it came from. I'm exhausted and carrying twice the appropriate amount of weight so it takes me a minute to get to the door, and despite the several flares creating what I thought was a shield around me, it returned and attacked me right as I was approaching the door. I died a few hours later of the several ailments and lack of clothing caused by the wolf.Nowhere is safe. Wolves in this game have thumbs. Worse jumpscares than Amnesia/10. Only play when intoxicated.			"

								I've only played for a very short time, I just loaded it up to make sure it ran on my laptop. The moment I started playing though, I recognized that sound. The sound of undisturbed fallen snow, that's been there for long enough to have a crust. That familiar crunch sold me immediately that I liked this game, so I figured I'd play a bit. The wind started blowing, that harsh, cuts you to the bone wind I remember from my childhood, and I started walking. I started off towards a red shape in the distance, noting a deer that ran away as I drew near, and heard what sounded like a wolf howling in the distance. The sun was still bright and my character was already complaining about the cold, so I moved on to find some overturned train cars and a dead body and a deer corpse. There was no shelter like I'd hoped, so I looted everything I could and hurried on down the path, burning precious calories. The sound of wolves was definite in the distance, making me nervous about the very obvious trail of footprints behind me until I finally stumbled upon a lumber camp. I went in the first building and realised with dismay this trailer would stop the wind, but I was still cold, and no useable food (just a can of peaches). Then hope came in the form of an object on a shelf across the room. I've never been happier to see a can opener in my life.On a more technical side, my 5 year old laptop handled this game remarkably well on moderate settings. I love the style of the art and the sound design is, well... it reminds me of delivering papers in the snow, and the crunch of knee high snow as I pushed my way to doorsteps, hoping to get done before my fingers went completely numb or too much snow reached the bottom of my boots. As I play more of this I may update but first impressions are very favorable.			"

								Made the mistake of leaving the Gas Station an hour before the sun rose.  Could barely see a thing and before I had a chance to light my storm lantern, I heard a familiar chilling growl, followed by abrupt barking.Instead of making the clever decision of turning around, re-entering the Gas Station and waiting it out til dawn, I began to run blindly through the pitch black whilst the wolves took up pursuit.I stumbled across a car and now I'm stuck in it, surrounded by a pack of three terrifying black shapes who are on constant patrol.  They keep walking by the windows.  They know I'm here.And I'm slowly freezing to death.I love this damn game.			"

								The deep atmosphere of the game is incredible. Even if it contains only a sandbox mod I enjoy it so much. I have to play multiple saves because I am scared that something bad happen and I would die with the character.There are many survival games but this one is different with its realistic principles. You don't fight with any zombie or other people. You fight with weather, hunger, thirst and yourself. The solitude and the vastness of the world makes the strange feeling you have all the time while playing the game.It is a lot about making decisions and about learning from own mistakes.There is no similiar game like this yet and I highly recommend to play the game.

								The first game I played... I died on the first day.  The second game... I died in my sleep the first night.  I've now played for 30 or so hours, I've only explored 18% of the game, and I've found this game to be well worth the expense and time.  ""The Long Dark"" has a wonderful learning curve.  However, once you get the hang of it, you find yourself in fewer dire circumstances... especially once you start crafting and get yourself established in-game with the proper gear.  However, I still have moments where I'm fully tensed, stalking some prey or approaching a tight bend in a path, and nearly jump out of my chair because of what waits for me around the corner.  This game has incredible atmosphere and good mechanics.  As has been stated in many other reviews, this is not a reality simulator, but rather a very fun survival and resource management game.I did not realize how much fun this would be.  I was merely intrigued by the theme.  However, this early-access game is incredible and does not feel early-access at all.  I fully recomend it. "

 Important advice when playing The Long Dark Hi guys, This is not a typical review, but it might give a very important hint to someone who is new to The Long Dark, supposed one wants to have the most possible fun and challenge when playing a game and I think this should be the claim in every game, isn't it. Please excuse my style of writing in English. It is not my native language but I wanted to do this ""review"" in English as I think it is important for everybody who is new to TLD. I supported TLD and bought it because I think the guys from Hinterland deserve it and I am really looking forward of getting much more out of this game. OK, I suppose you are interested in TLD or even played already a first round and tried your first steps.Now, start by asking yourself, ""What do I expect from this game...?"" It's obvious, TLD is a different kind of computer game. It has nothing to do with the common shooter type, hunting for enemies and zombies or similar kind of more or less realistic wild west style of games. And yes - the graphics are average compared to what is possible today. And to make it even worse, TLD is a single player game in times when in the gaming industry the economic success is mainly coming from games, which are programmed to be multiplayer or even MMOGs. I mean we have all seen complex games like BF and alike and know what's in fact possible. Sure I know that Hinterland as a small company is in no way comparable to DICE or the other big game producers, but at the end of the day, it's the  game user who decides what to play for a similar price.So you might ask yourself, what's the use of spending time in TLD? Well, TLD is in the alpha phase with only two playable maps so far and there are still a couple of bugs. But important as this all may appear, it's not if you know how to handle it and why you want to play this game. TLD is different, it's an indie type of game with the flavor of an exploration and survival simulation. You are a pilot and a victim of an airplane crash somewhere in the northern Canadian wilderness. You don't have much with you, nothing to eat or to drink, no weapon and especially no compass or gps or something what tells you, where you are. The only thing you know is, that you are in a huge forest. Your task in the game is to survive as long as it's possible. Why all the people you will find around are dead but not the animals is unknown. Maybe the storyline will bring this up one day and may even bring you back to the civilization, but for now just accept it, it's a fact in TLD and increases the suspense. So far, so good. Now, there are several ways how to succeed in this disquieting situation. I will not go deeper into this, as there are a couple of fine guides out there from some committed community members and there is no use for me to invent the wheel twice. Please refer to these guides, they are important for a new player in TLD and really help a lot. But you will also find some guides here and there which offer maps of the TLD landscape. And here it comes, my most PRECIOUS HINT: By all means, DON'T USE MAPS in The Long Dark or you will spoil yourself the most interesting part of this game. The idea of TLD is NOT to check a map, running to these known spots, finding all the stuff you need to survive, and at the end (hahaha)  complaining that the game is ""easy, crap and boring"".If we are really using maps to walk around and to find all the hidden secrets - I mean don't let's be ridiculous, that's kindergarten and as I said, not the idea of the game - why playing it then when there are others around? Try to stay honest to yourself, just stay the brave adventurer who crashed in a plane and play your role. Find yourself lying in the snow underneath or near a rock after spawning, not knowing where you are and where to go. Be bold and decide the direction where to go next and you will be fine after a while. Maybe you find the sun in the sky if the weather is favorable enough to allow it, this gives you at least a certain idea about the time of day. Never walk into the night or in a storm! Learn how to prepare food and drink. Just allow yourself the suspense of being lost in the wilderness, lost in the cold and really try to find your way through the game. After a couple of sandbox trials you will know better and find your path anyway, since the playable maps are still small. Beware of wolves, stay away or surpass them, they are really dangerous and can end the round in seconds. At this point there is even something of a simulation in the game. Just feel the situation, feel the idea of this game and it will be YOUR game. This is the little secret for me and those who love The Long DarkYou will soon see, it's not rocket science to find the first cabin or even a house and it is much more fun to play this unusual game as is instead of just looking into an offered community map, only to see that the next house is just around the next hill. These guys from Hinterland are still developing TLD but offered us the sensation to already being part of it. So, my advice is, if you really want to have most out of TLD, don't use maps - ahh - by the way, our pilot doesn't have maps neither, they all burned down in the crash :-) He is smart enough to find his way alone, will you also do it?  See you out there and lots of fun in The Long Dark ;-)   "

								Finally, a survival game without zombies, monsters, or aliens.Short VersionIs it worth $20?Abso-freaking-lutely. I invested much, much more than $20 over a year ago, and don't regret it.The game mechanics are constantly being tuned. It will only get better.Long VersionThe Long Dark makes you focus on the things that are vital to a person's personal survival.Food, Thirst, Warmth, Energy.This game is hard. Make no mistake. But survival is not easy. You are always battling having enough food and water, having enough materials to maintain your core temperature, and having enough energy to complete the tasks to provide for the aforementioned needs.The Long Dark captures the concept of this perfectly.Are the menchanics 100% realistic? No. Of course not. This is a game. It has to be fun and challenging. Despite what you see on TV, Survival is not fun. It's a lot of time consuming monotonous tasks. I would not want to play a game that requires me to only need food once a month, drink once a week, wait 20 mins for water to boil, etc. etc.So the game requires a bit of suspension of reality.  That being said, the focus on the core survival elements is spot on.One of the chief complaints is that you burn too many calories.I suspect those doing the complaining are trying to maintain 100% condition.In cold weather, the body needs 6000-8000 calories to mantain condition.  That's a crap ton of food. When's the last time you saw a well-fed survivor?In the game, if you eat nothing, and take care of everything else, you'll live for 4 days before condition drops to zero.  This captures the real-life aspect. Sure, you're hungry, but you can push on for a while before it serioulsy affects you.In real life lost survivors are never at 100% Maintaining 100% condition is not the goal of the game. Try this next time you play... take care of everything else, but don't worry about food until your condition drops.  Then feed yourself, ensure all other needs are met, and rest.I could drone on about this, but you get the idea. The Long Dark is not like other games where you can simply eat a snack and restore your health. It's much more real then that.About the DevsThe devs are all industry pros, and The Long Dark is their full time job, not something fly-by-night.They are constantly engaging the community, and putting community feedback into the game.Bugs are logged and fixed at blazing speed. (For example, a steam user reported a mouse sensitivity issue, and it was hotfixed within an hour)There will be a game. Baring a geomagnetic global event, or world war 3, Hinterland has guaranteed a game release.The only thing you need to ask yourself is, do you want to be part of developing this great game, and making it better?I hope so. I didn't regret it. "

								This game is amazing!  I cannot believe how much I enjoy this game :)  I had never played a Survival genre game before, and had less than 5 hours experience in any first person game--yet The Long Dark became one of my favourite games almost immediately.  I was absolutely hooked by a desperate search for a knife or hatchet, and every small success felt monumental.  Perhaps the game intended for me to die in that first week, but I survived a wolf attack without a knife (and my stats later revealed I had killed that wolf bare-handed, but I had no way to harvest it anyhow).  I finally found a knife and mostly survived on wolves and rabbits afterward, but things became dire.  Refusing to die from starvation and in possession of a rifle, it was time to shoot anything that moved.  I spotted a wolf and stalked it a few metres to get a better shot--I'm not good at shooting because I've never played an FPS.Everything went bad in an instant!  The wolf attacked and I mortally wounded it, but as it ran away, I saw a bear coming right at me.  I shot it directly in the chest and ran the opposite direction, but the bear caught me and mauled me.  I somehow survived the attack and got a brief glimpse of the bear walking away--bleeding heavily himself--then my character immediately died from blood loss.  I was sad, but I knew I'd taken down two apex predators in the last moments (I just bled out before the bear did), rather than die from starvation.  I think that's a good death!I survived just over 14 days, and I started a new adventure right away :)  You've really got to try The Long Dark!			"

								TLDR: Move on people, there is nothing to see here. Release presumably in 2020.The sandbox is fun in it's current state, but I would consider it not even a half finished game.As year after year passes by, this seems to be another developer that does not understand what makes people get into Early Access in the first place. It is not some convenient option to get secure funding in advance and then ""maybe"" work at your own pace. The game was released in 2014 and accompanied by a kickstarter campaign but is still nowhere  near finished. Meaningful updates have not been released since December 2015 after the last new map was made public, then communication ceased to roadmaps that are highly unrealistic, given that milestones in the first slot (1-6 month) have not been adressed in over 12 months, and then in 2017 communication seams to have stopped entirely.From the TLD roadmap ca April 2016. http://hinterlandgames.com/the-long-dark/roadmap/We now have April 2017 and almost nothing has changed. Concerning ""near windows 1-6 months"", at the current rate of progress I would substitute that with ""1 -6 years""Because Steam only has those 2 options and nothing in between I have thought hard if I will now click ""recommended"" or ""not recommended"" and finally decided on the latter. I will gladly change that if the game ever gets finished before I die. So far I can only say that I enjoyed the parts that were included, but would not recommend giving another developer a free pass for not fulfilling their obligations.Synopsis: If your not prepared to work on all cylinders then don't go to Early Access. We all would want a fixed income to finance a secure tech life for us, but gamers are currently running out of time and goodwill to finance YOUR laziness and lack of commitment.			"

								So this game is amazing and so god damn frustrating at time of writing i have just lost one of my best starts i have ever came into i had a nice secluded cabin over 20 kg in food i had guts and hides and maple branchs along some birch cureing and on the 4th day i went out to set up a snare and i had been having a reall good couple of days before i had bagged 3 deer 2 wolves and a rabbit and so on this 4th day i go out and set up my snare and i do that turn around to head back to my cabin a 5 min walk roughly so i creast the first hill and there was a single wolf maybe 30 feet down hill so im like well i do like having a nice comfy surplus of food so i kill it and skin and this was at roughly half way so im going over the next hill and i hear the pitter patter of what i thought was a deer so i crouch down and start scaning the surondings looking for said deer and see jack♥♥♥♥♥♥so i figured i scared it but as i get up i hear a howl then running i turn around and sure as hell there is a wolf and it jumps on me and proceeds to maul me but i wound it but not before it knocks me down to 13% hp and i turn and im like ♥♥♥♥ this im running because i heard another howl so im running the last of this distance bleeding throwing flares and shooting my gun in a last ditch attempt to scare off whatever the heck was chaceing me so i get inside and imediatly go to my first aid kit and start taking everything out AND BY THIS POINT IM AT 2 DAMN PERCENT and i bleed to death before i could get into the first aid menu so thats the story of my last run and keep in mind none off this was scripted but all of it at one point literally had me so paniced i was bitting on a pencil screaming like a baby and when i finally died i jumped up and slamed my desk and yelled out ♥♥♥♥ this then proceded to write this and even though im fumeing right now i still must say that while this game is not for the faint of heart it is something that an hunter, survivalist, or hardcore gamer should play and now if yoll exscuse me im off to go get my face mauled off by wolfs again in this glouris game called the long dark			"

								Let me share a story with you before my review. It's quite long, but it really was one heck of a ride and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.>Crash plane in probably Canada. Cold as hell>Run down a hill trying to find shelter, fall and sprain various limbs. Limp towards a cabin. Find some stuff.>Keep walking forever until I see a logging camp. Find more stuff, keep walking. >Find a ranger outpost, find a few bits and bobs but not much.>Make a fire for the night and try to sleep under a train bridge. Wake up cold after my fire goes out during the night and I'm getting cold.>Wander until I find the enterance to a dam facility. Dark as all night inside. Remember I have flares, use one.>Find more flares and a lamp with fuel. Spend my night scouring the facility for supplies, find some useful stuff.>I need to find supplies so I don't sleep. Wander until I eventually find my way outside to a balcony of sorts on the other side of the dam.>Walk down the snowy path to a frozen river. Figure something must be nearby so I walk along it and eventually find a cave with some wood. Getting really, really tired but it's daytime and I don't want to waste daylight, but I sleep anyways. Wake up with a few hours of light left.>Keep walking until I find a cave system. Figure it leads somewhere, it doesn't. It gets dark so I spend the night there with a fire made of wood I found and chopped in the cave. I toil the hours away sewing my clothes, cooking meat I found on dead animals, melting snow. >Come daylight I'm ready to roll. Wander until I reach the end of the river. I can't find anywhere it leads to. Nothing.>Keep searching for some buildings or something, but can't find anything. Getting cold so I decide to backtrack to the dam and try my luck on the side I came from.>As I ascend the slope to the balcony it gets dark and I get sleepy. A blizzard starts to set in, but I don't think it will be an issue. >I see another balcony across the dam, so I cross the small ledge of the dams' wall to it. Find some palettes for firewood. >I start freezing to death. I make a fire, add the wood I found and figure it will last 5 hours like it says it will. >Tired, so I try to place my bed roll down. Not enough room on the ledge so I move it a few feet away into an alcove in the wall.>Think I'm close enough to the fire so I sleep for a few hours.>Wake up suddenly. I'm freezing to death. My vison is blurry and my movement is lurching. Frantically make a fire. It fails so I try again. It works. Maybe I won't die after all...>I heat some soup and make some snow water. Unbeknownst to me, my fire is dying and I'm still barely not dead from the cold. Fire dies. I walk over (Trying my best not to fall to my death) and chop a palette into wood. Takes 45 mins and now my vison is getting blurrier.>Run to the fire and add the wood. Watch it all get eaten up in a matter of seconds due to the cold. Panic and run towards the door to go inside the dam. >For some reason it won't let me open it when clicking. I think maybe somehow it's too dark for me to find the door and open it? I don't know what's going on. I frantically chop some wood and try to make a fire. It fails. Too windy. Light my lantern, but it doesn't help. Poof lantern dies. I click on the door like a madman, but to no avail. >I try to make another fire, it fails. I decide there's only one thing to do. I make my peace. The door has bested me.>Fling myself off of the dam and fall to my death. RIP. In conclusion, those 3 and a half hours were the most frighteningly intense and immersive I've ever experienced in any game. I felt the emotions as if they were real. Fear, desperation, hopelessness. I heard this game was good and it was on sale so I bought it. Nothing could have possibly prepared me for how great this game is. It is an absolute masterpiece. The art is beautiful, and the world feels believable. The gameplay is nearly seamless, and it's insanely fun. If you're considering this game, but it right now. I promise you'll love it. It's worth every penny. MY ONLY ISSUE- I would like to see an option for reviewing and/or saving your journal upon death. I kept a very detailed journal of my ordeal and I was sad to have it dissapear after I died.			"

Early Access Review
								Yeah I like this game but... It isn't very replayable imo- at this point of early access. Some people can play this for thousands of hours, I think most of us would be bored after our first successful run, which probably won't take you that many tries to figure out- unless you play stalker mode (not recommended). I personally have probably something like 100 combined hours so far, from this account and other sources.While The Long Dark is great fun to newcommers it has some serious cons that hurt the replay value.REALISM?People chime on about how the game is soo ""realistic"" but that's nonsense- here is some fine examples of that ""REALISM"" in TLD they defend.A wolf strong enough to chase us down and kill us, would not have only 15lbs of meat on it.And a deer strong enough to run away from us would not have 10lbs of meat on it.Wolves respawn quickly in the same locations no matter how many times killed cause #realism.So do deer.rabbits...Meat in such a cold climate would not spoil in only 2 days.Candy bars, jerky, and soda would not go bad for ages in about any climate.Rifles in good condition do not break in only 50 shots- even if 10 below outside.Solid steel hunting knives do not break, about ever, period.Who stares at a stove for 3 hours watching water boil? Our Character can't put a pot of snow on the stove and go do other things? Walking to a fish house and back on the lake ingame takes 2 minutes of real life time, but ingame like 2 hours passed, and loosing a lot of sleep, hunger and water stats.The character doesn't know how to swing an axe at wolves, and can only fight them by letting them pounce us first taking lots of damage to health and clothes.It takes the character 5 hours to get a couple of logs that burn for 2 hours- in an environment packed with trees and wooden structures.#REALISM NOOB!There is nothing realistic about the long dark... period.It fails at realism in almost any sense, yet I seen white knights justifying some bad design here under the false guise of ""realism"" such as claiming clothing wears out fast cause you are running through forests and working hard everyday.I grew up in the woods, in snowy climates... clothes do not break down this fast. And though I am not Paul Bunyan, even with a simple hatchet I am able to cut enough wood in a few hours to last days of continous burning in a stove.and the worst thing about all this is....All these cheap unrealistic mechanics to keep you busy and distracted from realizing, there isn't much to this game at all. And the reason you can't swing an axe at any time by pressing left mouse is probably cause the devs, despite bragging about how many of them were former AAA game devs, can't be bothered to animate the swing. So you kill wolves in a cheap quick time event animation, and you cut wood by a menu option and waiting for time to pass.This feels like a cheap engine and game cause it is, and the development, has managed to go very slow about this since launching the game years ago, though I've seen worse.                                                 -THE LONG DRAWN OUT DEATH-I loved this game the first few plays, but indeed once established, there is suprisingly little to do in this world but try to prolong your life with the few things you can do.... so you can... erm... just die later anyways... kinda saps any reason to play then doesn't it? No matter what you do, you will eventually run out of materials and die if you were wondering. A couple hundred days you can survive if played well... why anyone would want to though? It gets pretty boring to do with how little there is to this.              -IF YOU DON'T WANT US RUNNING, REMOVE SPRINT THEN-You can run, but it makes you so sleepy so fast you really shouldn't generally, so have fun slowly walking through miles and miles of landscape, making many trips cause of a low carry weight limit. Soooo boring after a while! Sadly it used to not be like this, and the game was much more fun when it first came out then it is now IMO.This game needs so very much more to it, but probably won't ever see it, and development has been crazy slow. The new maps make their fans happy but not me... it's just more of the same, the game needs more TO IT.... to the experience.. More maps won't help much.                                    -MODDERS TO THE RESCUE?!-Sadly this is the least moddable sandbox I know of.Seriously I could even not find mods to improve carry weight at all, and it needs it...Our character knows how to make a furry bear costume, but can't make a simple wooden sled to haul stuff on? We'd be overpowered if we could carry more? How so? Oh right, cause that's half the gameplay if not more, just hauling stuff to your safe house of choice. Thrilling...Trying to go anywhere is such a pain cause you can carry so little, everything spoils crazy fast, the character can't afford to carry much water yet somehow cannot drink freshly melted snow, which is nonsense! You don't need to boil snow in real life, it's safe enough to drink after melting. So many bad designs that hurt the fun, and are only there as a type of gate and grind to hide the fact here just isn't really that much to the long dark...                                                          -NOT ALL BAD-EVEN SO! The game is really fun when new to it. I know my review is quite scathing of their designs, but TLD was fantastic the first few days I owned it, I don't regret buying it. The exploration was intense, the graphics are simple but very appealing, and it was fun figuring out what to do. Definitely worth the low asking price, even if it doesn't have the best replay value, and has a lot of annoying design. Challanges and the coming story modes should help in the future.                                       -DEV TEAM- REPLAY VALUE THIS!!!-Just understand as you figure the game out, it erm... doesn't have the most sensible endgame design, nor does the replay value benefit from this design IMO. I have tried to startup new games every now n then, but just can't stick with it... all that slow walking with the run nerf, just to endlessly haul supplies with a low carry weight so I can sit around the farm house waiting to die isn't thrilling anymore.I never imagined when I bought this game 2 years ago or however long ago it was, it would have done so little and actually become less enjoyable to play. Hopefully in another 2 years I don't end up with the same opinion. Good luck Hinterlands, and please change your company logo from a fox to a turtle. =3			"

								UPD: Please just please make the character wake up from blistering cold if he's healthy. I know some drunks die at night but only since they're so intoxicated their brain cant react properly. I hate losing another perfectly healthy and warm character by sleeping in a warm bedroll for a few hours. it's only logical to make a person wake up. Make him sick, give him pneumonia or whatever. Dont just kill himI absolutely recommend this game.When you're walking down the snowy road during a massive storm, cold and hungry and close to being dead, but suddenly find a dam just to your right, so you hurry inside. Happy yo be alive, you're starting to lay down your bedroll when you hear a growl. Quicly you pull out your rifle, which has only one bullet inside. In an next to absolute darkness you point your gun at the doorway, waiting. Sudden movement. You shoot and miss but the wolf was scared for a moment so you grab your bedroll and quickly get out in the hurricane. There's no way out. There is a little tent right next to the building. As your last resort, with the world blurry, you collect some sticks and make a fire next to the tent. You lay down the bedroll and go to sleep being absoultely sure you won't wake up. But you do. Sick,frozebitten and hardly alive, you wake up and continue surviving. Amazing atmosphere, rare gem of a game.Still there are some problems.-There is still no storyline yet which means two things.   + It adds to the grim atmosphere of an inevitable end.   - When that feeling is getting old, it's difficult to be motivated to play non-stop. - The survival system is harsh. You're supposed to keep track of things every second, which ruins the discovery aspect a   bit. You get hungry, thirsty and tired - There are dumb rules like you can't start a fire indoors, but you can fish and do other stuff until you die.- The cooking system is poor.- The loot is still rather poor in quantity. I get the same items all the time.-  Why can't I craft an arrow head straight away or just sharpen one end? Seems dumb.- Why is there no mapping system? It would be great if you could make a map in-game.			"

								Bold and realistic gem.  So glad I found this game.The Long Dark is a first-person sandbox about solo survival in extreme condions.  Every other human in the game world is dead, and for yourself it is very difficult to effect sustained survival, especially at higher difficulties.  But you do get better.  I say YOU, because what I like most about this game is that the player must learn and get better to succeed.  Kind of reminds you of, i don't know, that golden time when games took a fair measure of skill to beat.  Instead of a linear story with pre-planned power ups, instead of just a character leveling up to being practically untouchable, the player must learn to balance protection from the elements, water, food, and stamina, and keep respecting that balance for the entire game.  It doesn't matter how good you get at it, the world can still kill you at any time.  The game is VERY, VERY immersive.   It really gives the illusion that you inhabit your avatar's body and are truggling to survive.  For example, you might get attacked by a wolf before you have good weaponry, get the better of the wolf with your hunting knife, then you are chasing it down like a madman, following its blood trail, hoping it will bleed out where you can find it because you know this might be your first chance at meat and having a half-full belly in hours of gameplay.  You lliterally begin to think, feel, and act like you are some starving man in the woods, never mind all that lasagna you just ate!You might get lost in a blizzard and end up going in circles because you can't see 10 feet.  You just went out for firewood, but now you're lost in a blizzard!  You might find you are in an unsustainable location, realize a slow death is only a matter of time, head out in the middle of the night, go on some crazy multi-hour odyssey, and fist pump/air guitar when you at last stumble on some hunting cabin frozen, starving, with injuries and 5% of your health.   This game is well worth your time and you will end up making time for this game, trust me.  Shout out to the developers on such an outstanding product;  a true work of art.			"

								Fantastically immersive solo experience. In a world where every developer feels obliged to include a multiplayer, The Long Dark proves that it can be done otherwise. No griefing, no unreachable servers, no social obligations. It's just you and your trusty knife against everything that nature can throw at you. Oh, and NO ZOMBIES!			"

								After 20 days of surviving, I want to write a steam review. This game is the most polished ""survival game"" I've ever played, it is the only game where you can really feel the cold, the thirsty, the hunger. I took a LOT of pictures, because the world environment is so wildy and beautiful at the same time. I want to point out how in this game you can see wolves engage rabbits and other pacific animals. They try to escape of course. I want to say this because this is the first game after Stalker series, where you can see in action a real I.A. in the world. All the objects stay in the ground, so the game is a bit cpu bounded, but it's really playable with a decent PC. In Italiano: il survival game più rifinito di tutti, un gioco in cui ti senti veramente braccato dalla fame, dalla sete e soprattutto dal freddo. Gli ambienti sono bellissimi nonostante un motore di gioco non all'avanguardia, stai sempre lì a scattare foto per quanto è bello il tutto. Succedono un sacco di cose, ero ad un passo dalla morte, caviglia slogata, con 100 calorie in corpo ho trovato una casa con il caminetto acceso che sbuffava, credevo fosse un allucinazione e fortunatamente non lo era. Fenomeni paranormali a causa della tempesta geomagnetica, mondo di gioco credibile con la fauna che si comporta in modo credibile, tra predatori e prede. Mi sono veramente innamorato.			"

								First of all: This is a mildly negative review.My first impression when playing The Long Dark was overwhelmingly positive. The first few hours of playing the game are amazing and if you are the kind of person who is satisfied with getting about 10 hours of entertainment out of a game, it might be the perfect purchase for you. But the more time you spent, the more you familiarise yourself with the mechanics of the game and the longer you survive, the more the games inherent, irreparable flaws become visible. What flaws you mean? I will provide a short list of the most glaring issues below, but let just preface this with a quick disclaimer about the way I approach survival games:To me, survival is all about realism. ""It's a game, not a simulation!"", you might interject, but no, I disagree. A survival game is always a simulation, otherwise, lacking the link to real-life survival, there would be no basis for immersion and identification with the survival situation. When you are confronted with a situation in a survival game and out the real-life solutions to this problem only a tiny fraction is available in-game, it just ends up being frustrating and disappointing. And here's how The Long Dark disappointed me in this regard.- you cannot sleep without a bed or bedroll; not on the floor, not on a couch, not using ""old bedrolls"" - you just can't- you can barely interact with your environment; you can't reclaim wood from buildings, piers and most furniture (e.g. containers), only from designated recyclable objects that then serve no other purpose. You can't even combine several beds to make one warmer bed.- you cannot move objects before interacting with them; you have to butcher deer where they died, even if that is just a couple of feet away from your warm and cozy home, you have to break up branches and limbs where they are, you cannot move chairs, crates, etc. to store them for disassembly later, all you can move is what you can pick up and carry like inventory items, but you should be able to drag larger objects around.- there is a severe lack of crafting recipes that are far more reasonable than the ones the game does offer; curtains, towels, even upholstry could all be turned into makeshift clothes, almost everything could be turned into a makeshift melee weapon, a whetstone and any bit of scrap metal could make a makeshift knife, etc.- with wildlife being as aggressive as it is in the games, there would be innumerable ways of luring them into traps- the game creates artificial scarcity in a number of ways:..- you need more food than would be realistic..- hunted animals yield hardly any meat/calories..- tools wear down at ludicrous rates..- several items are unnecessarily scarce (materials for bows/arrows, cloth)..- you cannot freeze food (!!!) to keep it fresh or conserve it any other way [Edit: apparently leaving food outdoors makes it more durable, but potentially exposes it to wildlife]..- fires are incredibly short lived and hard to maintain..- time passes way too fast in relation to how fast you can move / act in the game (and don't argue with map scale! stepping outside of the house to take is leak shouldn't take half an hour and going down to the lake from a lakeside cabin shouldn't take up all morning)- you cannot jump, which makes you take silly detours all the time because of less than 1 foot high obstacles- you get injured very easily when walking (!) downhill- animals respawn randomly rather than existing and reproducing in a realistic way- you cannot do more than one thing at a time (seriously, who needs to watch water boil for two hours straight?) This is probably the worst flaw, when you have to spend hours frying one steak at a time using massive amounts of firewood.Most of these, or at least the more important ones like interacting with the environment, moving objects, time management seem to be hard-wired into the game without any hope of them being addressed or changed as development progresses.Therefore, unfortunately, I cannot really enjoy this game as much as I would like to.

								Even at this early stage in development, this game is brilliant. I won't deny that it can get boring fairly quickly, but that doesn't matter in my opinion. The few hours you spend playing the game before you get bored are magnificent.I start a new sandbox game. Mystery Lake. I know a few locations, but I don't know the map. I immediately begin exploring, hopefully coming across a jacket to ease the icy chill in the air. The weather isn't too bad, so I'm able to relax a little. I follow the train tracks, making a few slight detours when I spot a wolf skulking around. Eventually I come across a derailment, red cars toppled in front of me. The winds picked up now so I think it'll be a good time to huddle down and get warm for a few hours before continuing to find some decent shelter. I step into the train car and stare into the corner. A frozen body is in the corner. I quickly check his inventory, feeling slightly guilty, but I'm going to need whatever he's carry more than him now. Discovering an energy bar and a soda, I retreat to the opposite end of the car with my prize. Huddling down out of the wind I study the body. Will this soon be me?There's a snow storm outside now, and not even the car is protecting me. I need to move or die. I stumble out into the arctic temperatures and blindly pick a direction, praying to come across some decent shelter. Suddenly, I hear a howl. Black shapes materialise out of the snow and pad towards me. Wolves. I sprint now, the snow storm the least of my worries. I'm getting tired, hungry, and thirsty, but I can't stop. To stop would be suicide. I continue onwards, my vision starting to get blurry. My movements become sluggish. I'm going into the long dark.Suddenly, I see it. Almost right in front of me, a hut on a small hill. Hope flares inside me as I try and sprint up around the path to the front door. I can barely walk now, I know my conditions frighteningly low. But I made it. The Trappers Hut. I'm safe. Until the food runs out.			"

								The game's systems are too simple and the meaningful choices you have to make are to few and far between for the sandbox to hold any long term enjoyment.  The game is either monotonously easy, or frustratingly difficult, with the difficulty coming from the restrictiveness of the mechanics and a lack of the ability to improvise, not any actual challenge.  I rarely feel like I've made good decisions because there are virtually no decisions to make.  The majority of the game boils down to- Is there anything I can use here? and-  Can I safely travel to the next place with something to use yet?The lack of meaningful choices due to the simplistic nature of the gameplay kills any long term enjoyment because there's nothing to do or strive for in the sandbox mode.  You're either playing on a difficulty where everything falls into your lap or entire houses will have a single can of soup in them.  The problem with the higher 'difficulty' is that the simple systems don't allow for any improvisation.  You either have the item you need, or you don't.  Here's a fun example-I'm attempting to transition to a new zone while playing on the highest difficulty because there is only the aformentioned single can of soup, single pair of mittens, or single box of matches, etc for each individual building, and I'm starving and freezing to death just sitting around an empty zone.  Traveling to the next area requires me to traverse a cave system.  My only light source is 8 matches (because that's all I could find in an entire town).  Sure, I have a bunch of twigs, a few pieces of reclaimed wood, plenty of newspaper, and some lamp oil, however, I can't IMPROVISE a torch out of any of these things.  I'm 0.02 L short of lamp oil to be allowed to craft a proper torch.  I can't just light the newsprint or any of the wood on fire for a lower quality light source.  I'm not allowed to start a fire 'indoors' in the cave.  I can't start a fire outside in the raging blizzard to pull a flaming brand from.  So I'm left using my only firestarting materials, my matches, as a terrible light source because that's all the game allows for.My choices are needlessly restrictive despite having plenty of flammable items, but this follows through to virtually every other system in the game.  Want a knife?  Well, you better find one (which you can't on the highest difficulty, at all, they don't spawn, you must craft one) because there's only one place in the game you can even make one.  Got a hacksaw, scrap metal, some wood, a whetstone and access to a workbench with a vice?  Oh well.  There's no way to say, sacrifice some extra time and calories to make a makeshift knife.  You need the one forge in the game in order to make metal sharp.  And on top of that you need specific items that serve no other purpose to do that.  Don't have a hammer?  Well, there's no way to improvise using something else at the cost of time or effeciency.  Want a torch?  Better have the one type of allowable wood and minimum amount of oil required.  Want to open that can of soup?  A hacksaw capable of sawing through metal shelves is incapable of doing it.Want to craft a coat?  Only if you have wolf pelts.Want some gloves?  Only with rabbit skins.Improvise a scarf with some house curtains or a towel?  Not happening.Use a blanket, pillows, and sewing kit to make a bedroll?  Nope, gotta find one. (Also, it hasn't happened to me, but I'm fairly certain you can die from not being able to sleep due to not having access to a bedroll or bed, despite being satiated, warm, and indoors.  ""Sleep on the floor?  Like an animal?!  I'd rather die!"")Want a prybar?  Well, you better find one, because there's no way to cut any of the metal shelfs into something resembeling a makeshift prybar (nor can anything else substitute for a prybar.  I can reduce a metal shelf to a pile of scrap with a hacksaw, but can't use it to get into a metal locker.)There's no meaningful choices to make.  There's no improvisation to be had.  Sacrifice your extra coat so that you can use a sewing kit and some free time to make gloves you can't find?  Nope.  Risk damaging your hacksaw in order to open something that requires a prybar?  Nope.  Spend extra time and calories to improvise a knife out of scrap metal and a whetstone?  Nope.The systems are too rigid for the entirely sandbox (at this point in time) nature of the game, especially for a survival game.  It's too frustrating to be a drop of oil and the wrong type of wood away from being able to make a source of light not to mention any of the countless other ridiculous scenarios you'll find yourself shaking your head at.A few other gripes, there a now perks which after having ran for 10km or survived for 100 days give you stat bonuses to make the game easier.  Wut?  You'd think by the point you've done any of those things, a minor stat increase is borderline pointless.  Seems like some grindy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to attempt to keep you playing.  Tons of new clothing has been added as well, however, none of it adds to the gameplay.  Clothing is either better than what you currently have, or it isn't.  Again, there are no meaningful choices to be made.  There are stats like mobility and damage reduction, but they occur in 1-3% points and a virtually negligble.  I didn't even noticed them til looking at the wiki.  There's nothing that provides a meaningful choice like a big heavy, waterproof jacket that I would bother to carry around and change into only in certain weather.  You're just going to wear the best clothing you have available.  Nothing exists with meaningful trade-offs.  Again- THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO MEANINGFUL CHOICES TO MAKEDon't get me wrong, I've wrung 160 hours of gameplay out of the game, but there's either no challenge or a rigid brick wall of not having the EXACT thing you need because the item spawns on the higher 'difficulties' have been reduced to virtually nothing.  You're supposed to be an experienced bush pilot surviving in the wilderness, when in reality you play a simpleton incapable of lighting a rolled up newspaper on fire.If you've made it this far, I'm not entirely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the game, in fact I've gifted two copies of it to friends.  The game just hasn't had any of its gameplay sastistfyingly expanded on, despite 2 years of development.  Once you've seen all the areas, there's nothing to do anymore but settle into a boring routine of surviving (or dying on the higher difficulty because there are no items).   If I can be set for life with all the best equipment on day 20, why would I continue to play for another 80 game days?			"

								After two days of foraging the woods around my trapper's cabin, I was running low on food and decided to strike out. I had uncovered a windfall of about 2kg worth of venison from a wolf kill the day before, and though I wasn't dressed for the weather, I needed to find any sort of food. On day three, I made my way over to the train tracks where I noticed a train that had derailed. A blizzard kicked up shortly after I arrived and I hear howling in the distance, so I lit a fire and huddled down by the derailed train.The howling came up again and I heard the sound of running. A wolf was right behind me! I grabbed a torch from my fire and ran away from the wolf. Unfortunately, I ran through my fire and burnt off my pants. Fleeing pantsless through the trackless wastelands, I ran across the railroad tracks and over a railway bridge. The wolf must have caught my scent again, or maybe it was one of its packmates - I noticed a wolf charging at me down a hill. I brandished my torch with all the fury I could muster whilst wearing my long underwear and then fled further afield.This is when I found an old dam. It happened to have two boxes of rifle ammunition, seven knitted wool caps, and no pants to speak of. Realizing that if I wanted to cover my junk, I would have to make my own pants, I loaded up my hunting rifle and set out for vengeance. Against mother nature herself.11/10			"

								Okay, to start off, no, it's not as hard as people make it out to be.The thing about TLD is that you cannot really have a place to call ""home"" because often ""home"" ends up too far from civilization (or...another camp, in this case.) and that means that you have to cover more land to find food every day then come back home, when you could just go in one of the houses, start a fire, and spend the night there. You should get a quick grasp of the map based on your spawn points, seeing as they're for the most part pre-determined, if you don't know where you're going and plan ahead of time, your life will be miserable. Your character requires a lot of food and water, but getting it isn't hard, so long as you have an axe to harvest firewood (or move around a lot, like me.) you have to play very nomadish in this game because in order to get by you need to keep moving, every precious second can mean life or death, and I believe people hope to see the scenery too much and not focus on the main aspect, survival, and that makes people think ""oh this game is too hard because I can't do this or that."" It's not like that, it's a fun game, but you have to play in a way where you're a nomad, and always have a plan in case things don't go as planned (and that happens a LOT in this game.) make sure to use flares to your advantage, as well.Now what's the point of this review? Don't listen to the people saying the game is ""too difficult"" because it's NOT THAT HARD, you just have to have a plan for what you want to do, and from what I've seen, people aren't very good at planning ahead of time (really, go watch some of the youtube videos...) you have to expect nature to throw everything it has at you, and you have to be ready to have multiple routes if for any case one of them is blocked by wolves (which is not uncommon) you can't rely on only one plan, you have to have multiple, you have to know what you're planning to do, get a very in-depth understanding of your surroundings, make sure you have flares, bandages, and anti-septic. If for any reason you notice you're running low on food, you go out the next day, even if it's extremely windy (I literally ran through a blizzard to survive, you have to be ready to do anything to survive.) and make note, any mistake you make, can (and most likely will) cost you your life. A wolf is your worst enemy, if you get attacked by one, it's not unlikely you'll be brought to below 50% condition (health) so be ready for the worst of situations, and hope for your own sake that nature doesn't ♥♥♥♥ you over...or you can just bring a flare.Now onto the rating:Gameplay? I'd give it a 7/10 for now, it's all I want in a survival game but it's really lacking on things to do, but keep in mind it's early access.Sound? 8/10, they're realistic, they're not annoying.Music? ???/10, I have in-game music disabled, I feel it kills the atmosphere.Overall?: 7.5/10 for now, it's a good game but it really is missing a lot of things (not to mention your character eats and drinks like a god damned bear before hibernation, but hey, as long as you plan what you want to do out it's not too bad.)Note, SPOILERS below, if you want to find things yourself, DO NOT READ THIS:You'll need a game plan if you want to get far in this game, my usual game plan is to find the Trapper's Homestead and hope the rifle is there, if not, well, atleast scavenge up what's inside and go back out (granted that you're not freezing, if you are then take a break and get it together) I usually go from there to Max's Last Stand, and then to the trains (be careful of the wolves, there's often a few.) there's a camp office near there, and around there there's about 4-6 buildings which can all be looted, some have dead bodies, some don't, from there I usually head toward the big mountain to scale up it (by this point, if you have a rifle, you should have enough food to survive at least 3 days.) inside there's plenty of things to help you, can openers, food, water, medical supplies, and of course.. a fire place. Light a fire and hang out for the night, if there's a blizzard or heavy wind, don't go out the next day. Sleep until it blows over. Then you just gotta well...scavenge, you have enough food to go for quite a ways by this point (so long as you made sure to go over every place and grab things.)			"

								TL;DR - I'm giving a negative overall review to TLD mainly because the development of the game has not moved forward consistently towards a v1.0, and I feel like the developers are not up to the task of producing a finished version anytime soon. [As context, I backed TLD through Kickstarter on October 14, 2013.]Let me start by saying that I really love the game! The devs have created a rather different, yet encompassing, atmospheric experience I've come to enjoy, and that I think deserves it's current followship.On this review, I'm not going to delve into realistic vs. arbitrary game mechanics, real-life vs. artistic graphics, or any other of the gameplay issues mentioned both positively and negatively on these threads. I will focus exclusively on the implicit contract between gamers and developers that inexorably arises when supporting Early Access (EA) games.I've played TLD on and off for the past three years, starting when there was only one map (Mystery Lake) and rather limited and unbalanced game mechanics. Reviewing my logs, I backed TLD through Kickstarter on October 14, 2013!Back then, the state of the game was beyond my wildest dreams, especially for an EA game. There was only one map, but it was large, and gorgeous, and functional. Gameplay was still green, but you could see why and how the developers were going to benefit from the community's input. It really felt like I was given the chance to get in early, help the development of the game, and brag that I've known and played the game from the very beginning.And I was not alone. The game and team earned some positive accolades around this time, like ranking #9 on Gameranx's list of The Best PC Games of 2014 among other similar mentions, and allegedly raised over $260k from nearly 7,000 backers on both Kickstarter and Paypal. (Source: Project Update #30, October 16, 2013.)Everything seemed on track, from the constant game updates, to the energy and demeanor of the communications from the dev team, all the way to the enthusiasm of the community...But 2014 came and went, and then 2015, and just recently 2016, and there is still no finished game available. New content has been added in the last three years to the sandbox, but it has been only 5 new maps and very few gameplay additions.Moreover, the developers have announced that v1.0, or storymode, will be released by episodes as part of ""Season One"", on yet a future undisclosed date. The game currently available guarantees access only to this Season One. The first release, consisting of two episodes, apparently will account for only 6 gameplay hours. After the initial batch of the five episodes that will amount to Season One (and honestly, only adding insult to injury), devs are already planning the next installment as a new game that will be marketed separately. (Source: Story Mode Progress — December Community Update, December 19, 2016.)I feel like after 3 years from funding the game, plus any development done prior to that date, all the feedback and help provided by the community, and the additional funding the company has gotten from selling the game on Steam and other similar platforms (all this in addition to the initial funding mentioned above), should have been more than enough to produce a working v1.0. And it hasn't.Sad as it may be, I've decided to stop buying EA games...			"

								Great game, looking forward to story mode! I survived 67 days, then died. I was starving, injured and freezing to death, stuck out in a blinding storm, out of supplies. I couldn't see where I was going, too windy for fire, health below 20%,  I figured I wasn't going to make it. Wait...A Cave! It has a backpack, finally found some supplies....food YAY!....medicine YAY!....wood and a shelter to start a fire YAY! Perfect timing because my health is now below 5%. I start the fire to start warming myself, health now at 3%!

								I was out in the open and had a bear approach straight on. Shot it in the face from 50 yards away and it charged. Shot it again, maybe not so much in the face at 10 yards and it mauled the frak out of me and left me for dead. Got up and finished it off with a 3rd round and am at 10% health and on deaths door. Patched my wounds and went to harvest this beast. While mid harvest got notice that it was ""colder"". Looked and found my wolf coat, rabbit mittens, cargo pants and deer skin boots were all ruined and offered no protection from the cold. Storm blows in at the same time and had to abandon the carcass and run for shelter. Died 3ft outside the barn after 29 days survived. This pleasant valley is not pleasant, it is harsh. Would/will get mauled by bear again! 10/10!			"

								An absolutely stunning experience, the game was a blind discount purchase just for the hahas, and now I can't force myself to turn it off. Over 33 hours played and I think I just only start to fully enjoy the game world.Cons:- No maps! Guys I badly need the maps! Of course, I can find them online, but it would be cheating. I think it is quite realistic when a lost man FINDS some maps in a car glovebox, desk or wherever. I personally believe that having at least fragmented (torn, burnt etc.) region maps would only make things more interesting. Otherwise, the signal pistol challenge is sooo unforgiving.- Some actions are often quite schematic and overly simplistic (especially behavior patterns of the wildlife and wolf atacks). But it's a game, not real life, so with all the following pros these two cons are utterly forgivable.Pros:- Really thick atmosphere, so thick you can cut it with a knife (if you ever find it, of course).- An unforgettable feeling of natural awe and helplessness when things go wrong.- Variety of weather conditions. It all depends on the weather, like they say!- Absolutely great maps and locations. I really enjoy all of them, Pleasant valley being the best!- Automatic and quite boring actions and processes suddenly become really interesting (I could never imagine I would love so much to collect firewood or sort-out bad chocolate bars by a campfire).-The skill improvement system is decent. It adds another dimension to the gameplay. Not an RPG, of course, but the idea that you can progress makes you feel even more aggrieved when you finally die.- The graphics are better than I expected. I really love how they did the lighting thing and the blizzards!To sum it up, The Long Dark looks like a really promising game for now, and it's already 100% playable (although being in Alpha). I wonder what the campaign mode will look like. And I really would love to have some extra content too (more new regions and please introduce the map orientation challenge too!)     :)			"

Best day/worst day:Found 25 rife bullets, freezer full of soda, 5 things of beef jerky and 10 candy bars. Next day got chased by 2 wolves, hide in a car for 30 mins then made run for a garage, found an hunting rifle. Charged out of the garage thinking I could take them on then found that there where 5 wolves waiting out there for me, then I got messed up (I got the last laugh though because those candy bars where chocolate)    Best game ever didn't want to walk outside in a snow storm for a few day. 10/10 Best snowing simulater ever.Please add the ability to jump :)			"

I'm in no condition to fight!""So I kept running.And running.And running.I panicked: ""There is no escape!""Nevertheless, I kept running.Then, in the dim light of my storm lantern, I could barely see the silhouette of a small cabin.I ran to the door.I made it.I survived!...Five days later, I died from blood loss.But that is another story._______________________________TL;DR: Although there is only you and the wilderness, this game can surprise you with some very intense moments.

								Probably one of the best Early Acces games survival games I've ever played.I love walking around exploring the wilderness while looting houses, caves, buildings, the game doesn't really have alot of bugs either, when i think of it I've only found two or three of them. The game is really fun, you can challenge others for example with how long you survived, there is three different locations and the map is fairly big in my opinion, alot of places to explore and things to do and see. There is alot of content added already and the developers is one of the best ones I've ever seen for such a game, they always keep on updating and bringing new content to the table. This game has NO zombies instead your worst enemy is nature itself, the weather can be really dangerous but so can the bears and wolves, just be careful where you walk and try not to get their attention. So far there is 2 ranged weapons in the game there is a craftable Bow and a lootable Rifle. You can find loot almost anywhere in the game but the best clothes you can obtain is the craftable ones. Now It's up to you to survive as long as you can, i will give this game 9/10			"

								""POST CRASH LOG DAY 5:My sleep cycle got messed up while exploring, and I was forced to leave my shelter at 4AM in order to pace my fatigue and hunger with my distance from a safehouse. So I leave the trailer I had shacked up in, walk out into a foggy, dim haze only to slip off a slope and land on the ground below, suffering a sprained ankle. Even worse, mere yards away was a (presumably) cold and hungry wolf, growling and looking me dead in the eyes. The wolf approached, and with my ankle injured I wasn't able to outrun. With the wolf approaching more and more rapidly, I hastily take out my nearly broken hunting rifle, load it with the only bullet in my bag, and just as the wolf pounces I pull the trigger, hitting it right in the head, an instant kill. With the wolf dead, I calm down a bit, only to realize that, in my panic, I had run outside in -20 degree (celsius) weather, and I was suffering terribly from the cold. With no way to see through the fog, and a sprained ankle, no weapons, I was bound to die. Yet I brought myself to start limping forward, slowly. I slowly began to weaken, my condition getting worse and worse as the minutes passed. But just as all hope was lost, I faintly made out the shape of a tall structure. AN ABANDONED WATCHPOST! I crawled up the winding stairs to the top, and collapsed upon a shabby bed in the corner. After regaining my senses, and warming up a bit, I threw a log in the wood stove and warmed up with a can of beans and a much needed drink of water. There was still a long day ahead.""I've had my eye on this for a while and I decided to give in and try it out. The game is early access which I've had 50-50 opinions on, due to buying into games that have still not really delivered.When I dropped into the sandbox mode(Only mode available so far), I felt a bit uneasy about this game as well. Highly stylized but low realism, it just seemed like another walkabout. But then as I figured out the mechanics, got mauled by wolves, froze to death, and walked off a cliff shattering my ankles, I REALLY got into it.The atmosphere is FANTASTIC. Once you start playing for a while, your mind goes into overdrive trying to think up a survival plan, looking out for danger, managing your vitals, and deciding if the space in your bag will be filled with food or materials. The gameplay itslef is not at all exciting, but the mood shifts from calm, to panic, to dread, to fear, back to calm in the space of a single minute.Fantastic, and it's still being worked on and improved. Definitely recommend, even in early access.			"

								Not knocking i know this game is still under construction but its needs some adjustmentsits a decent game. but for something that bases itself about a realistic survival game it has some holes in it, for one defending yourself from wolves shouldnt be so complicated, Weapons shouldn't be so difficult to find either. once you find the hunting knife you should be able to craft a spear from branches or other wood you find in the wilderness. the weight limit on gear you can carry it should increase as time goes on if you are maintaining enough calories your strength would naturally improve and your body would adjust to what is demanded from it. fading into the dark? ok developers you have 3 days you can live without water and your body can last 3 weeks without food. if you're in a bad situation you shouldnt fade away in your sleep unless you're freezing to death.so some adjustments to be made *death by dehydration is after 62 hours of no water or food consumed that isnt dry, canned goods and meats all have some kind of water content or juice that will help with hydration, even if you drink the blood of a fresh kill.  sounds nasty? its survival.*death by starvation in real life is 3 weeks, if you keep it to the same amount of time as dehydration {62hs} then you wont get any complaints from me.*corpses everywhere but you cant move a single one. ok no im not going to suggest canabalism though it would take the game down a darker path. but no, in a obvious fact if you find a place to use a shelter longer than a few hours to shake the cold off and  search for supplies when you find a corpse you should have the option after checking him to drag him outside number one reason being corpses stink and if youre using the stove and heating the air inside that cabin over freezing then he will thaw and continue decomposition which will eventually cause your character health issues. *fashion weapons from what you have around you branches, scrap, bones. you gave us tools now we just need to be able to use them.*wreckage, you're a bush pilot that went down in a crash safe to say he didnt parachute out. majority of small aircrafts do not carry them. so if before you start your search for shelter you have to treat a broken bone sprain or injurty that would add to it but wreckage and depending how damaged the plane is you should be able to go through it fine parts you can repurpose to help survive pull fuel from the tanks. or even use the plane as temporary shelter.i like it and the concept but some of these issues are just driving me up the wall			"

								The Long Dark is a first-person survival game. A geomagnetic event has caused your character's plane to crash somewhere in the snowy Canadian wilderness, and armed with only a small handful of supplies, you must do what you can to stave off death for as long as possible. Unfortunately, death comes in many forms in this game. Due to the fictional geomagnetic catastrophe in-game, the weather has gone into a permanent winter, with random snow, fog and winds which vary in intensity from ""mild"" to ""I literally cant see 5 feet in front of me"". The event has affected wildlife as well, and some- especially of the 'wolf' and 'bear' variety- will attack you on sight. --BASICS--The elements arent the only thing out to get you. In The Long Dark, you are basically tasked with survival, and to do so you must satisfy 4 ever-decreasing statistic bars: Warmth, Sleep, Hunger and Thirst.""Warmth"" is affected in a number of ways. First, there is 'temperature', as well as 'wind chill'. Im not 100% certain how one affects the other, but needless to say, the lower the numbers, the faster your ""warmth"" meter will decrease. You can add 'warmth' by means of clothing (which some can be layered for additional temperature increase bonus), standing near fire or heat sources, eating hot food/drink, or going to an interior, closed location (in a cabin, etc). Sleeping will add warmth, but if the surrounding temperature is cold enough, you will still wake up freezing if you do so outdoors. ""Sleep"" stat will slowly drop as the day goes on, and can be hastened by carrying too much weight, thus making you tired earlier than usual. Sleep is possibly the stat with the least amount of worry involved with it, as you can pretty much sleep anywhere (so long as you have a sleeping bag, and you begin the game with one). It may not always be SMART to sleep, depending on circumstance, but it is about always possible. ""Sleep"" can be restored by... well, sleep. Hot tea can be consumed before rest to increase the effectiveness of your rest, and hot coffee can be consumed to reduce the rate at which the bar depletes. ""Hunger"" stat naturally drops as time progresses. In this game, hunger is represented by ""calories"". At the maximum 'full' level, your character has 2,500 calories. Items which you eat will replenish calories, and depending on what the item is, the recovery value will vary from 0-1000 calories per item use. If you eat something which would put your calorie count above 2500, the number caps and the remainder of that item will stay in your inventory, so you can eat the rest later. You are not going to be able to survive forever on the junk food you find in cabins, etc, so ultimately you will have to find a way to harvest those delicious animals running around the map.....""Thirst"" depletes as time progresses, or if you eat something salty (IE, a box of crackers). Not certain if it drops faster with strenuous labor. Water in this game is a commodity that is everywhere- literally. Your character's main source is from the snow itself, and while you have a fire built you can melt snow into water, then boil it for safe consumption. Water can be found in a number of places including bottles of the stuff and from a toilet bowl...and all can be consumed, but if you do not boil non-pure sources before drinking, you can stand to catch disease and die without treatment.Once any of the 4 stat bars reaches 1/4, an icon will appear in the corner letting you know it needs attention soon. If a bar reaches ""empty"", a percentage will appear next to the appropriate icon. It begins at 100%, and if it hits 0 your game is over. Multiple bars can be reduced to 'below empty' at once.--SURVIVE!--You dont begin with very many supplies, there is no map in the game as of yet, and the odds are stacked against you... yet you still have a fighting chance. Your first few games will find you learning the ropes, and-- due to the fact that the game is still in ALPHA and has no much-needed tutorial-- this will either involve you dying a lot, or referring to the Wiki a lot, which spoils a lot of the surprises to find. Once you have gotten a good feel for the game and begin to remember certain details of the maps (""if I follow these train tracks it'll take me to a bunch of cabins in a lumber yard!""), things will become much more fun, and you can concentrate on exploration rather than figuring out how the game's rules work. Find all sorts of gear to help you survive, from oil lamps, axes, knives and even a rifle, to clothes, food, firewood, medical supplies of all types and more. You can 'harvest' these items for basic materials to repair your other gear, or even to make new items altogether at a 'work bench'. No firewood, and youre indoors? Chop the tables, chairs and shelves up and burn em. Hunt for wildlife-- and then eat them, gut them and turn their skins into wearable coats, warmer sleeping bags, ETC. Loot corpses of other explorers who didnt make it. Pull a torch out of a fire and use it to swing at attacking wolves to scare em away. Find a hut on a frozen lake and do some ice fishing! Stagger blindly through a white-out blizzard with your stats all nearly bottomed-out, thinking youre about to die, when suddenly you see the shape of a house in the distance.....--THOUGHTS--The Long Dark could REALLY stand to use a tutorial, but seeing as how it is technically still in Alpha it can be forgiven. Other than that, the game feels very solid and is quite addicting to play. The elements against you and your meters constantly draining put an urgency on you to make progress in the game, but never to the point of it making the game obnoxious to play. Sometimes your stats may be struggling and there is tension in trying to 'beat the clock' before you die, but thats part of the fun. Will you make it?? *IS* that a house you see in the distance..??*YES!!!* .....is exactly how you will react when you DO find one. My favorite aspect about this game so far is the act of DISCOVERY. After staggering through the harsh wilderness for hours up to days, fending off animal attacks, cold and starvation, it feels extremely rewarding to find even the smallest of cabins dotted around the maps. Every one of them is loaded with goodies, and item locations/ ""drops"" are random in every playthrough so you never know what youll find, but you always know itll be good stuff. The graphics look nice, especially the skyboxes. Ive taken a number of screenshots of the game and for a title with ""white snow everywhere"" its amazing how much color gets packed in there. Weather effects look great- the snow will actually blow with the wind currents, spiral off rooftops and get sucked into the breeze... its nice attention to detail VS 'randomly falls from sky at various quantities'. Maps are massive and packed with things to see and discover, lots of interesting locations, and a widely-varying topography that will make you FEEL like youre standing on the top of a mountain, or at the very base looking up at one. Sound is very well done and is plenty convincing, from old panes of glass clattering in their window from howling winds hitting them, to the roar of a bear before he eats your face. Music is intermittant, but always pleasant to the ear. It sounds cool and mysterious, much like the game itself. Controls are solid, and the little bit of aiming which takes place is pretty accurate. Overall, I'm hooked. Its a lot of fun, presents a reasonable challenge and- most importantly- is still being worked on/updated by its developers. I purchased this game for $5.00 during the Steam Holiday Sale and it was totally worth it, but with 50+ hours already into the game and Im barely beyond map 1, I'd be willing to have paid full price. If you like survival sandboxes give this one a go!!			"

								This game is great! It really gives you the feeling that you are going to die. Lots of great effects and game mechanics. The devs put alot of care into the survival aspect of the game. There are plenty of things to be careful aboot. like spraining your ankle and getting lost in the cold dark fog of night as the wolves that smell your blood get closer, and closer and closer then BAM!!!!!!!!! GET OFF ME WOOOOLFFF AAAAAAHHH....GRRR ARRR GRRROOWL arroOoOooo...WHACK WHACK WHACK!!!! YIP YIP YIP!!!! TAKE THAT YOU SOB!!!! After such an encounter you look down at your invisible feet and see your blood staining the cold white snow...You find an underground bunker...Thankfuly theres a bed, some beans, water and a first aid kit. You patch yourself up just to squeeze some more time in your pathetic lonely life. You can hear the wind howling as you huddle in your bed and go to sleep. Its 7:47 a.m. Time to get moving. What a nice day! I should go find some more supplies. You stumble upon a watchtower that overlooks a frozen body of water. you find a rifle and a box of rifle rounds. Great! now I can defend against predators, Is it getting windy again?You WILL die! you WILL get lost...Oh boy will you get lost. There are 3 areas that connect to each other and lots of dead ends. I give this game a cool canadian 9/10. Will give 11/10 if they add ALOT of stuff. The devs have skills and they need to add as much as possible to this game. If you like suvival games you should buy it. I challenge you to try and make it 10 days on the hardest difficulty :P You will feel like survivor man but you will want to cry when you die! Get this game!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Its Time to update my review! April 03 2015. I wrote my first review after some beer so it was a bit silly. Now I would like to make a better shorter review.First thing I'll say is the devs are very good at what they do. They care about the community and respond fast to bug fixes (barely any bugs :D) They recently updated the game giving it a really nice boost. It has become apperant to me that the game will grow at a happy and consistant rate. This game and its devs definitely deserve your support. It always leaves me wanting to go back to it to continue my playthrough or even restart if I fail to survive. I could go into detail about why this game is so good but I dont want to spoil anything for you. Just know that if you like survival games the $20 is 100% worth it.			"

								You can find yourself in some pretty nasty situations in this game. On my first trip to Pleasant Valley, I arrived exhausted, over-loaded, and the sun was going down. The wind started picking up, but I ignored it. My character was too busy checking abandoned cars for candy bars and matches. Before I knew it, he was in the middle of a ferocious blizzard. He hopped into the nearest car and tried to wait it out. The temperature dropped lower and lower as the storm persisted into nightfall. The wind howled all around, and my character began to freeze. Holy cow...he's going to die out here... I realized. I'd helped him survive for over 100 days, and I was about to lose it all. He lit his storm lantern to try to stay warm. He curled up in his sleeping bag and took little naps. The night crawled on, and his condition grew worse and worse by the minute. By the time the storm finally abated, hypothermia was setting in. He crawled from the car and used one of his precious matches to light a small fire with some sticks he had collected. He huddled beside that fire and fed it one stick at a time while the wind did its best to blow it out. When dawn came, he abandoned the fire and staggered along the road looking for better shelter - a shack, a house, a garage...anything.It was hard to see with his blurry vision, but he found what appeared to be some kind of an abandoned farm house. He made his way inside and stumbled around the house. Upstairs he found a bed, and crawled gratefully beneath the blankets.He slept on and off all that day and the next, and bit by bit, he recovered enough to leave the house and collect some kindling. It was a nice sunny day, and he was able to save the last of his matches by starting a fire with his magnifying glass. He melted snow and boiled enough water to stay hydrated for a few days, then decided he'd better do something about food. Luck was with him, and he was able to lure a wolf away from a fresh kill. As he leaned over the dead deer and pulled his hunting knife from his belt, I thought, alrighty - everything's falling into place. Looks like surviving in Pleasant Valley isn't going to be that tough after all. Five minutes later, he was dead. Another blizzard rolled in while he was breaking down the deer, and I was fiddling with my cell phone. I looked up just in time to see him fading into the long dark, and that was that. I stared at the screen in horror. There's no save to revert to... no retry button... no Phoenix Down to tickle his nose with. GAME OVER.That's The Long Dark in a nutshell. This isn't a game in which you frolic about the hills, or hit the save button just in case what you're about to do turns out to be as stupid as you think it is - but you want to try it anyway...There are no safety nets. No second chances. You have to constantly be on the lookout for danger. You relax, or get distracted… you die. So you listen to the wind. You keep an eye on the sky. You check the temperature. You look out for fallen trees you might be able to clamber up just in case there’s a hungry wolf over the next ridge. You hear one howl in the distance, and you crouch and count your bullets, or ready a torch and hope it’s more scared of fire than it is hungry. In the easiest mode, the wolves and bears act like they would in nature. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone. In the normal and hard modes, a geomagnetic event has made them loopy and aggressive. In Interloper, the hardest mode, the game is out to kill you however it can. There are far fewer tools and resources. The weather hates you, and the wolves are absolutely deadly. In their eyes - you're just a sloppy joe in pants - if you still have pants by that point. A few other points:- The graphics are stylized but attractive.- The community's pretty good. Most active players are helpful and friendly.- The developers are communicative and active. They still monitor the board to weed out jerks.- You can craft and cook items utilizing natural resources. - It’s a lonely, melancholy game.- After surviving for long periods, you can get stuck into routines. Fortunately there are six different regions at this point. You can travel to another region if you get tired of the one you’re in. Each one has its own personality and challenges. Also there are several challenge modes that are engaging, too.- Each game is different. You may have found a hatchet in a dilapidated little hut on your first run, but on your second run – there’s nothing there… Sometimes the cabin you squatted in last game is just a pile of burnt cinders in the next.- You rarely spawn in the same place twice. In Stalker, you may spawn twenty feet away from a wolf while it's still dark outside and the temperature is well below zero. Or maybe you get lucky and spawn in the Trapper's Homestead and find a rifle hanging from the gun rack. You never know.			"

								There I was: day 2. I had finally made it to the hydroelectric dam. I was stocked on food, water, and had plenty of tools at my disposal. All I had to do was search the dam for some supplies. I was gonna do it; I was gonna survive forever. I had already been through not one, but TWO wolf attacks. I had sprained an ankle, but got right back up. Blood loss? Yep. Infection? You bet. All in just one day too. I was a master at survival. I had been to the dam my first playthrough and it proved to be very resourceful, and it was a very safe place too. I could imagine starting up a life with a wife and kids here. No joke it really was that safe--or so it seemed. As I was meddling around looking through the locked lockers (which I could open because I was prepared and had a prybar) I notice something move in the shadows. I was scared initially but then I remembered reading about this game having A.I survivors and was hoping we could help eachother out. Maybe this was even the wife I imagined having a life with here. As I turn around to introduce myself and try some of my world famous pick up lines- I am unpleasantly greeted by the ugliest goddammed wolf I have ever seen, I hope for a flash of a second that it hasn't seen me. Nope. It saw me. I scream. I run. The wolf catches me. I'm thinking: It's all good I've survived two wolf fights befo--Mauled by Fluffy the UglyYou survived 1 day 3 hours and 50 minutes. 11/10 I will avenge myself			"

								The first few attempts I made at surviving in The Long Dark ended with me either dying or quitting. I thought the game was well made, but I just couldn't get myself to play it seriously. Now, a few months later, I decided to start a sandbox on the pilgrim difficulty, so I don't have to be in constant fear of being mauled by a grizzly or ripped to chunks of flesh by a wolf. I started at the Mystery Lake, geared up a bit, went to the dam, went to Winding River, then went through the cave to Pleasant Valley. Later, I went to Coastal Highway, to get some additional things. Now, I've settled at the big farmhouse on Pleasant Valley, and started to sort my belongings to separate cubboards, drawers and closets. On my 8th day, i shot my first deer with my hunting rifle, and I'm now curing the gut and the hide in my basement so i can later make a bow for hunting. The game is a lot of fun and very well made even though it's still in alpha, so I can only recommend to buy this game, if you want a challenging and realistic survival game, which isn't multiplayer or full with zombies.

								By far the best survival game out there when it comes to actually surviving. The struggle to survive is ever present and very realistic. The pure, simplistic yet detailed environments are incredibly relaxing. I've never played a game that was able to make me simultaneously feel so at peace and so concerned for the health and safety of character. Don't let the simplistic graphics fool you, the way the visuals and sounds impact your mind while playing is almost a form of meditation. It's a surreal experience. Marvelously juxtaposed against this, the survival aspect is very real. Your resources need to be managed constantly and every decision you make matters. You will find yourself wondering ""how could I possibly survive this?"" and the pride when you manage to make it out alive is something I've never experienced in another game. I have story after story of harrowing journeys and narrow escapes from this game. It genuinely makes you feel like a surviver. Strongly recommended if you are a fan of realistic survival or just want a game that can help you relax at the end of a long day.			"

								I absolutley LOVE this game. Yes, sometimes it can get repetitive, expecially after  100 days of survival. But I try to write stories into the game to make it more interesting to me. Personally I would love to see more plants that one is able to harvest, but I understand that would be hard in the dead of winter. I really can't wait for the game to be completed (as its still in its alpha phase). I have really enjoyed the addition of the challenges, and I hope for there to be more in the future.  This is the best survival game I have ever played! No zombies, or monsters or stuff like that....just you, the elements, and the deer, rabbits, wolves and bears! (beware of bears!) I highly recommend this game to anyone. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do! Oh and the scenery! AMAZING!!!! I just love everything about this game.			"

Early Access Review
								(Alpha Review, Sandbox Mode Only)     I've had this game for awhile now, I pledged enough money to get the alpha before it's early access on Steam. Personally I love this game, it's not your traditional survival game, there's no zombies or aliens, it's you agaisnt the elements and the wolfs. Currently the game is only sandbox mode but later the developer (Hinterland Studio) plans on adding a storyline campaign. Hinterland Stuidos are constantly updating the game, fixing bugs, and improving the overall experience. They're great when it comes to feedback and even personal dislikes.     Sandbox mode has a ton of replayability, every time I'm thrown into the world, I'm in a new area and I'm scrambling to find a familiar landmark. While attempting to survive you need to worry about food, water, wolfs, overall condition, and even clothing. Every decision you make, makes you second guess yourself. While trying to stay warm and keep your condition manageable, you also need to keep moving and find more supplies to keep yourself alive. It's part luck, part skill, and part making the right moves at the right time. While traversing through the beautifully done landscape you find yourself dodging wolfs, checking your condition, the time and even the weather. I personally can't get enough of this game, and I can't wait to see what the developers have instore for the storyline campaign.     I can say with confidence this game won't be left by the wayside like some other early access games. I've been a victim of developers abandoning games after they were released on early access Steam but I highly doubt this game is going anywhere. Hinterland Studios is a new company with this game being their first release but if you do your research into the team at Hinterland you will be blown away. Huge names that are worked on games like: The Far Cry series, the Saints Row series, Warhammer, Red Faction, Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic, Mass Effect, God of War, and the list goes on and on. These people are NOT new to making games by any means, and it shows with The Long Dark. I've only had to opportunity to play the alpha but I'll say it's one of the best alpha experiences I've had.    I hope this review has persuaded you to purchase this game early access. I will do another review once it's fully released. I hope to see this game hit huge milestones as I'm a huge supporter of this game and the studio. Thank you for taking the time to read this review.-Bay Area BuggsMy Playlist:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkIGJ7Ljv6Ywew9vmHlPM8HVnDZs4mqz0 "

								[Posted: Jan 18 @ 1:40am]Of all of the ""Early Access"" games I have had the fortune to play, this is by far the most polished.  The developers seem to be very involved with the community as well.Now for the actual review:A survival game without zombies or other players hunting you down?  Impossible, you might think.  Some might also think, screw that, where is the real threat?  From nurishment to wolves, the biggest threat is the weather.  Shelter is a commodity, offering temporary reprieve from the frozen world outdoors.  God help you if you have to spend a couple nights outside.  I loaded up my makeshift fire with plenty of wood, only to awaken after a couple hours in the midst of violent winds.  Needless to say, my fire had been extinguished, and I spent the remainder of the night inside a ruined boxcar.  As morning broke, I was nearly dead from the cold, but I managed to find an outpost with plenty of supplies and a furnace.  Besides having to share the haven with the corpse of its former tenant, I was quickly able to thaw out, boil some drinkable water, and cook up something to eat.  I have probably a day or two worth of food, and will inevitably have to venture back out shortly to aquire more wood to keep that furnace running.  I dread my next trek, but in the best of ways.  Very few games immerse me in such a way as The Long Dark has managed, and it is merely in Early Access!The few complaints I have with the game look like they will be hashed out long before the game's official release.  And those complaints are very, very minor (as of writing this, the only thing that comes to mind is the rate at which your clothing wears down).  The developers are constantly asking for feedback, and have been quick to work out balancing issues.I have been burned by most other Early Access games, to the point that I was considering never buying one again.  I am so glad that I did some research on this game and saw exactly what it has to offer, right now, aside from the coming additions that it promises to offer.  Do some research, like I did.  Check Youtube for some gameplay.  Read up in the forums.  Anyone on the fence about this game should take a hatchet to that fence.  You're going to need all the firewood you can carry once you decide to brave the cold... ;)[Update: 05.24.15 @7:29am]I still stand behind everything I initially said, and am really satisfied with not only this, but several other indie developers I have since had the pleasure of watching their involvement with the community inparticular.  These guys are great at what they are doing with this.			"

								The concept of the game sounds amazing and is the reason why I purchased this game for 14.99 (Halloween Sale).The game started off fun for the first 30mins, however I realized how mundane and repetitive the game is after about an hour. Also, it doesn't feel like the game rewards me for my skill, critical thinking and creative ways of approaching the situation. Instead, it feels more luck based then anything. In regards to the mechanics. Starting with the hunger system, good lord man, no one can get that hungry and eat that much food in one day. Also, the conditioning mechanic on items......I've had knives, can openers, rifles, hachets and other items presented in the game. Those items do not break apart after a few times of me using them in real life. Lastly, the fact I can't wear multiple layers of clothing is quite fustrating, because if I were in that situation, I'd be wearing layers upon layers of clothing to the point where it is not cumbersome. Another thing which is quite annoying is how fast your hunger and thirst rise. If this character ate this much before the plane crash, his fatass wouldn't even survive the first hour.But, I do understand that the item condition mechanic of the game is suppose to be a way to make you go out and look for materials to repair your say, hunting rifle or knife.  Or that food supplies go out faster to give incentive to go out and hunt a deer or eat some canned goods. It's there to make you move about and explore more versus holing yourself up in a cabin and piling up a massive supply cache. (That's what I would try aiming for.)This game has the potential to be amazing, but as it stands it's not as realistic as it claims to be and gets way too reptitive too fast.I'm going to give this game a 5/10 atm, until futher notice. I do realize this game is in alpha so changes can definitely happen.P.S. The price of the game was reasonable so it doesn't bother me much. I hope the money I put towards this game helps the futher development of the game.			"

								TLD is the definative survival game. Lightyears ahead of anything else.Well I bought TLD sometime back in 2014, just after they added the Coastal Highway map. For the purposes of this review, i've only ever played on Stalker difficulty.I still remember my first death.....I spawned, walked 20ft into a building and was mauled to death by a wolf that came running out of the darkness like some horror film whilst trying to work out how the inventory system worked 3 minutes into the game. I got better after that.TL;DRI'll say this and this only:The Long Dark is the only game where I thought I should have bought it twice for the amount of effort and content the dev team have put into it over the two years since I bought it originally. I'd gladly pay for the whole game again. TLD is not your run of the mill survival game, If you like an atmospheric survival where you think and make your own descisions about what you do next, you will like TLD.Full:This is not your run of the mill multiplayer survival etc. It's more of a carefully crafted atmospheric story that drives itself as you play through the sandbox. There is no guide, no hand holding, no tutorial. TLD makes you think to overcome problems. If you think that is what you would do in real life, there is a good chance that is what you would do in TLD. You're bleeding and have no bandages? What would you do IRL? The more you do this, the better you get at the game.The other thing is TLD can force you to make choices, There is a blizzard, you're slowly dieing of cold...do you hunker down?  or do you continue on? Will you make your safehouse?It's nasty out and you're out of food. Do I stay and wait it out? or do I try and make a run for it? Do I know the way back? How far is it? Will I get lost? Will I make it back before the sun sets? Is it safer to stay here?The above are all situations i've found myself in  within the game and made the right descisions to get out of them.There is no game like TLD currently and it's one of the best games and personally highly rated games in my collection. It is the definitive survival game.The devs are constantly updating the game and have added loads since bought it, including two new maps and mechanics changes and additions. The game has come a very long way.Hinterland are very receptive to player input and feedback, more than any other developer i've come across. After playing for a long time I made several posts on the Hinterland forums about how to possibly improve the game (imho) and several of them appeared in later builds, most notably the addition of skill books.A word on story mode. Yes it's been delayed several times but i've seen the changes that are being made and honestly, I had to pick my jaw up off the floor. I have every confidence in story mode being released and i'd rather it was delayed and highly polished than just released.TLD really is a unique single player game, It has so so much more depth than anything out there. So, if you're in doubt, or teetering on the edge or comparing it with another survival title, just buy TLD, you won't regret it.			"

								At first you would look at this game and think, ""I'm just running around in the snow and picking up stuff till I die.  How can this be fun?'  Until you start to play, then the atmosphere starts to suck you in.  The calm silence of only the wind and your breath,  a bright sunrise in the distance.  Then you hear the howl...this time not the wind...and then you just have time to see the dark shape run out of the darkness and kill you.  The first time i played I lasted 35 minutes.  Now that I am a 20 + player I have learned to appreciate the sunrise of another day.  A nice warm fire to stare in and cook food upon.  and utmost, I listen for every little sound in the distance because the thrill of this game is that death can come from any place at anytime and only your quick wits and skill will keep you alive.Do I suggest this game for others to play?  Yes I do.  This is a game all it's own, there are no others like it.  The graphics have a beautiful artsey style and with only a minimal amount of ambiant music where most of the time nature is your soundtrack.  Buy this game, this is a beautifully pollished gem even though it is still early access.10/10.			"

								My review concerns only the Sandbox mode of the game, since there is no story mode yet. Also I always play on medium difficulty.A few days ago I decided to give the updated TLD a shot. What can i say: annoyingly addigting. Simple yet very, very addicting. Also infuriating. Imagine spending 10 hours (IRL) gathering resources, crafting stuff, getting the best possible clothing etc. You're getting really into the game. 28 ingame days go by, you're getting proud of your achievement, aaaand then you fall to your death while crossing the ravine. Just magical. This is what happened to me, and though I got really close to just Shift deleting every trace of the game, somehow it lured me back into its' chilly atmosphere to brawl with hungry wolves and saw some clothes.I can't recommend the game enough, though it requires a lot of patience and practice to master. It's kind of like the little cousin of Dark souls.Big big thanks to the developers!			"

								In a genre of tedium, mediocrity, and illogical design, The Long Dark is the diamond in the rough. From the moment you start your game, you're thrust into a place that does not want you alive, and I'm not talking about animals, they can't hold a candle to the harshness that is the weather. One bad decision and you're completely lost a zero visibilty blizzard with small hope for survival. Survival is not a matter of chance but a matter of wits. ""Supplies are running low. Do I set out into the storm or go hungry for another day?"" The decisions matter. I've been an Early Access customer for since the game launched and I've constantly been impressed with not only how quickly the game has grown in size, but how professional the development team is. The Long Dark is the only survival game that has had the confidence to attempt to truely replicate wilderness survival, and it has succeeded in spade.			"

								This has to be one of the best games I have ever played. Yet, action-wise, there is very litle. This is all about survival and survival depends on the tactics you employ within the game. There are no 'buddies' to ask for help. No one you can telephone. Make a wrong turn, wonder off into the forest with night falling, and you are dead. Simple as that. It's all about decisions and making the correct one at the point you are at is the essence of the game.There are no real spoilers in the review - but there are a few tips that could be useful for beginners. Be warned.............In fact, the first few times you play, you are likely to end up dead very quickly... There is no real game help, as such, and it is a struggle to understand what is required of you. However, give it time and it starts to make sense. When the game first starts, you are dropped in a random location and it could be day or night. I suggest starting on the easy level as wolves don't attack you. In some respects, this is more accurate as wolves tend not to attack humans.The first thing to do is find shelter. You are unlikely to survive the cold of the night (or the day) if you are out for too long. This can then be used as a base.There are buildings scattered about to scavenge and hidden caves where you can find a few scraps.Journeys need to be planned. Never, ever, go out with just a couple of hours of light left. Darkness comes in rapidly and you are liable to get disorientated and die of hyperthermia. Also, weather can change rapidly and you need to know that you can make it back. Pay close attention to your surroundings and make a map ( I count steps).Explore each area thoroughly to find the exit. Carefully time when you leave the exit area.This is the beauty of the game. Everything needs to be calculated carefully to survive - just as in real life.Another nice feature is the lack of other people. Clearly, they were there at some point but for reasons not given, you could be the only person alive on the planet. To meet other people would spoil it and wisely, the developers know this.After all, what is more terrifying than being totally alone in a hostile environment? And that is the cleverest part of the game - the shear lonliness.So why is the game so compelling if there is no action, as such? Well, you live and die by your own actions and there can be no excuses if you do die. Therefore, everything is down to you the player and we all want to survive, right?I treat the game as a real life simulator. Should the big freeze ever come, I fancy my chances. Well, maybe a little bit more than most. Buy this and enjoy one of the most beautiful and yet scariest games ever written (without a monster - or is 'cold' the monster?). "

								It's very difficult, but the mechanics are very intuitive for the most part. It's kind of like a survival game that is basically everything that DayZ's survival mechanics wanted to be, but the devs didn't get all caught up in needlessly complicated micro-interactions within your inventory. -TL;DR: Game has incredible depth of mechanics while still being relatively simple to interact with. -The game is more about planning and judgement than flick shots or reflexes. If you plan poorly, you will die very quickly.-No game has ever made me more afraid of simply freezing to death--Things you can expect-- -You will try to find firewood outside, a blizzard will start. you will become disoriented and lost and likely freeze to death about 50 feet from your shelter because you're wandering blindly in circles in a blizzard.-you will freeze to death again-you will begin to starve, so in desperation you'll try to find a new shelter and some loot. -you will get lost looking for new food.-freeze to death-fall to death because you are tired and can't see very well while hypothermic-be freezing and wandering desparately, get attacked by wolves. die.-attacked by bear. die. The game is brilliant because there are many mechanics that are not explicitly shown to you- things that if you're thinking in a good survival mindset will be natural, and likely reward you in some way... or punish your greed. CONS:The only thing I can really say that I don't like much about this game in its current build is the importance of reparing and maintaining items, and the fact that there is very limited ways in which to start a fire. Nothing in that capacity is truely renewable. Once you're out of matches and fail to be blessed by RNG to find a fire striker, you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed. I would like to see more emphasis on outoor survival/bushcraft type stuff as development continues. There is already a ""campcraft"" action menu for building fires outside and laying a bedroll down, so hopefully we can get something in there for making a bow-drill fire starter or something eventually.

Early Access Review
								This game is an outstanding title in the survival genre. Why? It creates a unique atmosphere in an open-ended, realism based, beautiful environment with a challenging sandbox gameplay.Have you ever romantically thought about the experience of living in a lonely wooden cabin, far from the civilization, in the icy north of canada? Can you imagine this ambivalent mood, being in a beautiful, but also hazardous wild nature. Do you want to feel the pulse of the wilderness to experience your own limits? This is the atmosphere, the game is build around. It's not about fear or depression - it's about living at the limits and the willpower to survive.The game achieves this by a very unique and own game art, realistic game mechanics and the beautiful northern setting with stunning varying light based on weather and day-night cycle. The realism of the game adds more depths to the decisions you make. There is rarely a strict pattern or some kind of ""best practice"", that you can follow - it's truely up to you, to decide if a risk is worth the reward. Even your bad decisions may bring you an exciting experience. You will die often in the beginning. But everytime you start a new game, you will be enriched by this experience, getting a feeling for the dangers out there and how to withstand them.Still unsure? Check this points:You like to play in an open ended scenario, with no other goal, than to survive? If not, than better wait until the storymode is added.Bad experience with Early Access Games? This title is nearly bugfree and in a steady development by a small, but professional and experienced gamestudio.Does the current content justify the pricing? In my opinion it is more than enough and there are regular content updates, delivered mostly polished and bugfree. It's really high quality entertainment for an unbeatable low price.To come to an end.. If you like this genre in general you will not regret the purchase. Have fun and a lucky hunt :P			"

								I never thought another game could rival my love for and time commitment to Spelunky, but I may have found that marvelous game's equal in this early access gem! Of course they are two COMPLETELY different games (aside from both having permadeath), but I love it when a game captures my imagination to the point where I'm thinking about it long after I quit the game. Along with the stellar and challenging gameplay, the look and feel of the world Hinterland has created often causes me to just pause and take a screenshot. This game is beautifully designed! The sandbox mode is great, but I'm especially stoked for Hinterland to finish Story Mode. The only thing missing is full controller support which I'm sure they will add later. And don't be scared off by the early access status. The game has never crashed on me, and I have never lost a saved game. I'm certain this will end up being a 500+ hour time sink for me!			"

Some pros I have to say about this game:1. Best survival game ive played in a long time.2. A survival game thats not based on zombies and the fallout of mankind.3. Learn real survival skills used in the real world.4. You feel like a real survivor in the real world playing this game.5. I have learned playing this game that wolfs are fluffy and bears have emotional problems.Some cons I have about this game1. This game is insanely dark (pun! and true!), because its so immersive, with the sounds and artwork, and the countless sad stories you will see. 2. Why am I the only live person around in Canada? All in all, amazing job by the devs, one of the best games ive ever played!11/10			"

								I'm not too sure why I keep coming back to this game, whether its the cold atmosphere that makes me feel colder (i live in Australia and don't like the temperature), or whether I'm coming back purely because being alone and not having other people ruin my experience, I'm glad that I keep coming back, because every time I do it feels better.. Like watching The Breakfast Club or Ghost Busters after years of mediocre and boring movies, and this is the same for The Long Dark. Frankly, I'm sick of trashy multiplayer games that have you spend your money to have an advantage over someone else, or games that are pumped out every few years by the same studios, that only really capture the satisfaction of 12 year olds and other people that generally wouldn't know better, but this, this is something else, it's like the Sherlock Holmes of Crime Movies, its like Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the old classic movies that DEFINED the Horror genre, and when you put up Friday the 13th and The Nightmare on Elm Street against The Blob or Paranormal Activity, it makes you realise just how special this game is.. It makes you appreciate every detail of this game, from the brutal cold winds that blister you and wither you down, or the bloodthirsty wolves that roam endlessly outside of your base of operations until the moment you step outside, not realising you don't have flares or a rifle, and your 24 day life is ended, just because you wanted to get the Pacifist Achievement, that means nothing, but makes you feel like 24kt gold, and honestly, when you play this game, whether you're practically homeless or you're the head of multimillion dollar firm, you experience the same pain, same experiences and same menacing mechanics that want to destroy you.. and for that, I must say, Thankyou Hinterland, for creating a game that I can continously go back to and enjoy, just like the first time I played this, thankyou for creating a game thats inspired me so much, to spend my own time writing a (pretty pathetic) guide about the game, thankyou for creating the best survival game on Steam.Thankyou Hinterland "

								I have issues playing this game. I'm just too big of a wussy to actually play it for a long period of time. The first time I ever saw a wolf, I was in the Hydroelectric Dam at night. I was walking down the stairs without a care in the world thinking wolves just couldn't possibly spawn in a building. I turned the corner and that boom, getting mauled... Lets just say I didn't rage-quit, I fear-quit. Never before have I hit Alt-f4 so quickly out of pure terror. 10/10 for PTSD.			"

								Incredible game. For Alpha, this game far outclasses many fully developed games. That said, there are some minor, nitpicky things it could work on.Pros: +Cons: -+Extreme realism. This game depicts a survival scenario in an incredibly realistic way. Not too hard, not too easy.+Wolves. The wolves make sure you never quite reach the top of the food chain.+Graphics/audio. The graphics are beautiful, charmingly cartoony, and the audio's attention to detail really sets it apart.+Wildlife. The AI is perfect for the wolves, deer, rabbits and birds.+Fluffy.-Wolf fights are a little too hard to win. (I know they are in real life, too, and it does add to realism–but purely in terms of gameplay it can detract from the experience when a wolf is encountered in early game when you have no means of defense.)-Time seems to pass too slowly with too little to do, dragging days out.-Fluffy.Realism: 10/10Graphics: 9/10Audio: 8/10Combat: 7/10Fairness: 9/10OVERALL: 9/10Worth $20, easy. Spend your money here, if you're gonna spend it anywhere.			"

								Since I play The Long Dark game, I wake up at dark, I go abroad frozen, and with the axe I shave. Then I'm going to hunt a bear for breakfast.After lots of hours in my account and many more plays in the account of my brother, I can only say that this game has changed my point of view about the EA. This game is in Alpha stage and is already a real gem. The potential is immense. The atmosphere is awesome, right game modes. Not have music but occasionally sound a successful chords depending on the situation where you are. Currently there are only wolves, bears, deer and rabbits so much wildlife to incorporate. Same with the flora, much to add. Only 4 maps but soon will come more and by the end of the year the story that so many people waiting for. The developers of this game are really doing a good job. Updated and improved every month, you can give your opinion and maybe see your desires reflected in the game. You always have an dev here to reply your questions. An EA game like all should be.The good: Environment, gameplay, sound (excellent), graphics, inventory system, how survival and much more are facing.The bad: In Alpha state, many things change from update to another, and it really is to improve so that there is no ""bad"" in this game.Recommended: 100%			"

								This is the most addictive and un-bugged early access game I have played! The details are amazing, like ducking behind trees and along banks to lower windchill, or spraining an ankle more often due to carrying a lot of heavy stuff in your backpack. There are so many small details and polishings that just immerse you into the unforgiving world of The Long Dark.The devs are also very attentive and present on the forum, which is reassuring. All in all, this is not an early access game that feels unfinished or unpolished - and it only includes the sandbox! This game will go great places.			"

								The Long Dark, what a great game!  I've been waiting for someone to do something like this since I played Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.  This game will get a curious person hooked instantly.  In my first play thorough I found myself on a hill next to the logging camp in Mystery Lake.  I ran to the trailers because I figured with all the snow I'd freeze to death fast with what little clothing my character spawned with.  I had great luck with gear in that play through.  I found two rifles, several knives and hatchets, but after 5 days I found 'the door' to Carter river. Unfortulately I didn't have much tinder and of course as soon as I walked out the door a storm hit.  My character survived 2 more days back there looking for a way out but ended up freezing to death lost on the river.  I've since earned my 50 day badge, I even came pretty close to 100 days before I played after a night of heavy drinking.  I ended up trying to see how high I could jump from ledges and ended up falling to my death on the side of a mountain.  Lesson learned, don't drink and survive.  :)There are several treacherous places on this map, if the wolves don't get you, the weather or starvation will your first few hours playing the game.  It's not one of those games that's so damn hard you'll get frustrated and lose interest either.  Patience is as much a virtue in the long dark as is caution.  Over time you'll craft clothes and collect what you need to make a bow and arrows.  You'll learn to conserve calories and let the wolves do the hunting for you by following one around crouched down until he takes a deer, and then you'll take him after he takes the deer to get a double meat, gut and hide harvest.  A few things to know if you want tips:1) The ravine takes you to the next area, don't go that way till you've explored Mystery lake and learned the game's survival basics.  2) A decent set of maps can be found here: 


Detailed Region Maps - The Long Dark 
A Guide for The Long Dark
By: Whiteberry

			Updated 2016-05-01. Detailed Maps of The Long Dark as I finish them in 3 different versions depending on level of spoilers. All are based on coordinates and should be fairly accurate.		


3) Snare traps are a great way to feed your charachter.  Make at least 10 snare traps but preferably 20 or more because after a while they break down, and need to be harvested and rebuilt with new cured gut.  Your return on the gut you use to build them is at least twice and more often 3 times what you'll spend to make them.  Easy calories, set where you see rabbits and forget, check them early the next day.  4) Fish are heavy and offer little calories for how much they weigh.  It's a good idea to cook the fish you catch right in the bob house and store the fish in the bob house so that you can have meat spread out on the map in case you run low on food while your out.  You won't be upset if you spread food out around the area you choose to make camp.  Storms come in fast and without warning.  Stashing food here and there will help you survive longer.  5) Save processed foods in good condition for as long as you can.  Processed foods are lighter in weight than the stuff you can catch and are great for traveling from zone to zone.  Eat the stuff that's going bad when you find if for easy calories, but save the good stuff if you can.  6) Rose hips are great for throwing on the ground in the snow.  They make for an easy to find trail if you're on your way home from your regular routes when a storm hits.  Rose hip trails saved my guy's tail more than once.  You'll need hundreds of them to make a full trail.  I managed to make a trail from the camp office to the first bob house in my last play through.  Other thoughts for the devs:Don't take the following negatively, you guys made a kick♥♥♥♥♥game, I love it.  But I'm a critical prick and need to voice my opinion so here it is:A zippo lighter, flint and lighter fluid would be nice.  Who uses matches these days anyway???  We should also be able to craft some sort of friction fire starting system out of sticks, birch bark and branches or find flint and use that with a knife or hatchet.  For more info see ""Dual Survival"" watch Codey the giant hippy make fire from almost nothing every time.  Google ""Fire starting tools"" you guys could add plenty of items for starting fires from flint magnesium blocks to those rods that shoot all the 3000f sparks (not flint) when struck with a knife.  Our charachters should level up and be able to carry more weight over time.  Adding a frame pack to the clothing and different levels of bags would be a nice addition to the game.  An adult human can survive 3 days with no water, and 3 weeks with no food if he/she is sitting around and was well fed before their starvation.  Please loosen up the food and water requirements, we're surviving in the cold not running marathons.  I'm aware that we burn more calories trying to stay warm in cold places, but three steaks a day?? Really?? I'm a ski bumb and ski in New England and Canada, it's not that cold.  I've been out skiing in -20F weather; after 8 hours of that you'll look forward to a hot Irish Coffee and a warm fire, but you won't die if you break the wind properly and keep moving.  Running and other strenous activities (work) should lower the effects of the cold weather.  Keeping active sould be another way to survive the cold.  MORE BULLETS PLEASE!!!The trapper's cabin should have reloading tools and supplies in addition to the work bench so that the old .303 bolt action fir stock rifle can be used more often or those prepper caches should have multiple cases (1000 rounds per case) of ammo.  Bullets come in boxes of 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000.  Black powder, caps, and shells should be stocked at the cabin, it would be another task for the survivor to complete.  Shells should be able to be recycled if picked up.  We should be able to harvest much more metal from cars to that entire hydro factory.  There are plenty of metal objects that we should be able to melt down for bullets, arrow heads, and tool repairs.  Either that or give us a pick and hammer and let us mine ore and coal.  Tips for noobs at Mystery lake:SAVE THE FOOD YOU FIND FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN, JUST EAT IT BEFORE IT GOES BAD!!! I like to trap rabbits up the river, hunt for wolf and deer on the way out and back, and then catch a few fish on my way back to the Camp office at the bob house nearest the Camp office.  If you want your survival badges, do it like this.  You'll find yourself holed up for 30-40 days at a time eating the extra food you collected just passing time and chowing down.  I recomend collecting the materials you need for the bow and being patient, there aren't very many bullets for the rifle in my experience.  Once you've visited every cabin on the map above, check out the other areas.			"

Early Access Review
								For me, The Long Dark used to be a shining example of Early Access done right.Not quite so anymore.The game mechanics were released in Sandbox as a playground test for the development of The Long Dark, the game.It has now been 2 years and 3 months since the original EA release and the Sandbox is what the team focused on at the cost of the game promised.Some people find a sense of accomplishment in applying the mechanics of the Sandbox game to just long as last as possible. I personnally do not and it is the one question you should ask yourself before buying the game today.Without narrative, I personnally find it a waste of time. The survival aspect is just discovering mechanics (but they are really limited, do not expect complex crafting but a permanent damocles sword of  hunger/cold management) and applying/abusing the survival mechanics to last as long as possible.You might say Don't Starve does that somehow. But Don't Starve has loads of contents and crafting, TLD has 5 maps and very limited item interaction/crafting.Some very slow perk development has been introduced some time ago in a patch, making your characters getting better at making fire, repairing etc. to give each try a limited meaning but the lack of ambition on this part and the grindy aspect of it makes it more of a detail than something to look forward to.Without going full perks as in Everspace, a more satisfactory system would be needed to make the experience fun and rewarding. As it is, the only reward is your own satisfaction to have lasted some arbityrary days in a game with arbitrary mechanics for survival : once again this will determine if this game is for you.Hinterlands does a very good job at communicating, and they regularly release new patches and new mechanics to the game. But they also recognized that the focus on Sandbox impacted the development of the story, with episodes not being able to be fully based on what has been developped in Sandbox anymore.The graphic style is good in its choices and I appreciate the character and identity of it. But such a long development begins to make the game feel outdated in some aspects of the engine like animation, an interface that should be reiterated on some aspects etc.Some decisions such as mandatory permadeath for all can be bothersome to some players when simply giving the option would not break their game. The food decays for no good reason when you could use the outside cold to conserve it for a long time, matches will degrade for no good reason also.Some historical stubbnorness over such elements, a lack of flexibility in strictly defined mechanics and an absence of direction in the game make some of the experience feel slightly outdated when noticeable survival games have been released by the dozens now, innovating in the gameplay and the user interaction towards less grind and more variety.I feel Hinterland refuses to introduce some optional fun in their survival.It is interesting to compare TLD and Subnautica which were both released 3 months apart. As of now I really have a much better time playing Subnautica, who listened to the player base when introducing a mode without food/water for example, offers more content, and where the sense of discovery of the player is far more rewarding in the first playthrough.One could definitely say Subnautica's experience is around exploration and base building while TLD is focused on survival. In the end exploration and discovery provide a much more rewarding experience than the later for me. I just don't have enough awe with TLD past the first remarkably bleak but beautiful depiction of Alaska's white harsh environment.(edit : to be fair, after spending quite some time on Subnautica, the experience offers more variety but also a lot more bugs for now)It really feels as Hinterland, while doing a very good job at developping TLD, lost focus on the ultimate goal of it all.I do hope their future episodes will make me change my mind, but the recent announcement of 6 hours of gameplay for 2 episodes leaves me a bit perplexed as of now.TLD is a good software, but for the last time, you should ask yourself if you can find it satisfying to survive in a contrived space just for the sake of it, with some frustratingly limited mechanics after such a long development.ps : Also, as in any online community, the TLD steam forums have become too often toxic to different views. Try to find your information and make up your mind somewhere else.pps : I would add that in the end, this game costs 20 dollars, half that on promotion, and half of that if you use a different region thant the US or Europe for Steam ; a price well worth paying when discounted if you want to have the long dark experience for yourself. I have no regret buying the game whatsoever despite my criticisms.			"

								This game is so immersive. At times, I have to just stop playing because it is exhausting being constantly focused on surviving for hours on end. Do I have enough food? Is my water supply sufficient? Will the weather turn foul while out exploring? Are there wolves in my path? Can I avoid them or must I fight?The game only saves when you sleep, enter a shelter/building or become injured. Death is permanent with all saves erasing when you do die. Save scumming is impossible so every time I venture outdoors I am looking out for possible dangers. It's been a learning experience as I have avoided reading guides or looking at videos. The first time I died venturing out in the wilderness at night. I quickly lost my sense of direction. It is much colder at night than during the day so I froze to death. All my other deaths have been due to wolves. Generally wolves are just a nuisance. They telegraph their intention to attack from a long ways off and are easily scared off by fire. It is when you are weak from hunger, thirst, fatigue or the cold that wolves can make an easy meal of you. Even when you are in good shape if your fight with a wolf leads to being wounded gravely you better have first aid gear available. If not you will likely bleed out.This game gets you thinking about what you would do if in the same situation. Would you end your life early to avoid the slow death of starvation or would you fight will all your might to survive no matter how much suffering you endured? You can't really hold it against the person in this situation who takes their own life. Starving or dying of thirst are horrible ways to die. Freezing to death is perhaps a bit less horrible but you do suffer quite a bit until hypothermia kicks in. No need to mention the horror of becoming the next meal of a predator.You are stranded in the Great White North. You have few supplies and must scavenge for anything which improves your lot.What would you be willing to do to survive?			"

								The game is fun even in this early state of development. If you start the sandbox mode the only goal you have is surviving by keeping you warm, finding enough nourishment and other supplies like medicine. Not just the subfreezing temperatures are dangerous you also have to watch out for wolves in the woods they are just as hungry  as you are. The graphics are simple but beautiful and emphasize the unique atmosphare. If you tramp throught the snow you always be like ""please please please let me find a shelter with enough supplies for the night"" and this is what the game makes so good it is hard but fair.

								Probably the best survival game on Steam at the moment. Stable, well optimized (including the Linux version), and for an EA release, relatively low on bugs.Being a single player game, there's none of the griefing found on games like Rust, and the emphasis is actually on survival. Food, water, and shelter are always top priorities, and not always easy to come by. Disease and injury are real and present problems, not something you can ignore for days. Cons: You can't jump - meaning sometimes you'll get stuck behind a couple of cms of rock, or even unable to climb up a step. I get it, nobody's going to be jumping around in the game's conditions. But c'mon, a heavily nerfed jump? An ability to take big steps? Or climb? It's a game mechanic that's sorely needed.			"

								Finally a survival game not based on a zombie apocolypse. A very beautiful game with lots of potential. You can even see the air coming out of your mouth as you breathe outside. The weather is random and always changing. The cold winds and foggy weather makes a huge difference in how you plan your day. My best strategy so far has been to find deer and scare them toward a wolf so that it would kill th deer without me spending a bullet. I scare the wolf away with a flare and steal all the meat and leather.			"

								(First playthrough btw)Day 2, I was pretty geared up.  I had a rifle, and some food, however I had run out of water. I decided to trek out in the morning, as I was quite parched. I came upon a derailed train and spotted a wolf beside it, and I quickly thought to myself, ""If I engage this wolf, will my rifle be enough?"" He engaged me first, and he ran at me snarling, I fired off a shot and, ""oh what a surprise, I missed!"" He tackles me into the snowbank, I fight for my life, and eventually I win and throw him away. He began running but I wasn't having any of that. He tore my jacket wide open and sprained my ankle, why would I let him escape? I began chasing him, but he was ready. In retaliation for me chasing him he turned around and began counter-charging. Ofcourse I had my rifle ready this time, yet I barely managed to graze him, he went down! I started cutting him open, good eats tonight! However my conditions are worsening. I'm freezing, my ankles are broken, and I'm still thirsty. I begin running for about 10 seconds until I spot a small overhang. (7% Condition Overall Now) I put the last of my twigs together, and just barely managed to create a fire. I sat by the fire cooking my fish. As I'm about to eat the delightful lake trout, I hear something coming up behind me! I stumble backwards into my fire, and fall to the ground. (2% Condition!) I can barely see now, life is fading away... On the other side of the fire, a wolf stares at me. With a last moment memory, I pulled out a flare. ""Flares can be used to scare away animals"" as said in their descriptions; so I light this sucker up, and with my last breaths I throw it at the wolf. Success, he runs! I feel so achieved but so broken, and I know I have to find shelter. I begin sprinting, (Crawling on the ground fast at this rate.) It's so blurry, I can't see! Where should I go? I follow the tracks, but too my demise, they were the last things I ever saw...AMAZING GAME, I was genuinely scared by that wolf at the fire, the immersion is unreal. "

								TL;DR -- The Long Dark is indie development, Early Access, and PC survival gaming done right; you will enjoy your harsh survival experience with this game.  Pros:- immersion. The crunch of snow underfoot and the fog of your breath will make you feel like you're there.- permadeath. This game brings the challenge back to PC gaming that has been missing for a while. - femshep. Jennifer Hale voices the female character. Sorry, no bionics available.- challenging. It is a struggle to survive, but they have since added some gradation to the diffuculty level with three settings to choose.- regular updates- vindicates the 'Early Release' business model. The 'Early Release' concept is hit or miss (Ex: DayZ SA) and is the topic of a lot of debate among PC gamers and interested parties. 'The Long Dark' plays like a beta or even a release candidate, although they call themselves an alpha. It's easily worth the $20 tag on it right now. - roadmap. More areas are coming. Maps are coming; I find the lack of maps kind of exciting, there is a thrill of exploration to be had. - survival without zombies. Although I could play a hundred zombie shooters and be fine with it, I have to give credit to a novel concept of man-vs-environment in today's arena that is full of zombie shooters.Cons:- will test your gamer might. You will die. - [This is now fixed and smoothed with weather cues to alert you to oncoming bad weather] weather model. Sometimes it goes from nice outside to foggy to blizzard with little warning. In summary, 'The Long Dark' is probably a $30 title than you can get for $20, it's a great alpha, it will provide hours of entertainment and seconds of terror, it's a unique pc game survival experience that's worth your time and your cash.=== 9/6/15 v256 ( hotfix v258) update ===[read this to yourself in Cartman's(tm) voice]Dear Diary,It's been days since I've stepped out of my apartment.

								I've been playing TLD for about six months now, and I figured it was time for a review.Survival games. When I think; ""Early Access Survival Game"" I think, half-baked half life 2 engine survival game piece of garbage that somehow still manages to attract stupid amounts of attention, with devs that are only there to make a quick buck, and a community of troll snipers that will KOS even if you have zero gear.The Long Dark throws all of that out the window. Half-Baked? In the literal sense, yes, but I think with just a few more tweaks you could bring it out of early access. Devs are supportive of the communty, and open to suggestions, KOS troll-snipers (a phenomenon which I like to call ""Unturned Syndrome"") are removed altogether by removing multiplayer altogether. No it's not the end of the world, belive it or not, not every video game is multiplayer.The art style and graphics are lovley, and all of this alone would be enough to set it apart from the crowd of indie survival developers, coughcoughRustH1Z17DaysToDieTheFifthDaycoughcough.But the gameplay goes further. All feels balanced, and while some argue for reduced calorie burn, some argue for increased, so I think it's best to just keep in the middle. There's no insta-craft, something I've wanted in a survival game forever, along with sleep deprivation (which this game has as well). It gives a real sense of acheivment when you finally finish the wolfskin coat you've been working on forever. I love the gunplay.(Because hip-firing dosen't work in real life. It just dosen't unless you're supressing, and why would you supress a deer?)There's no base building, and this might be my favorite part. I can't tell you how many times I've stumbled across someone's giant♥♥♥♥♥♥♥monument in Rust. Kinda breaks the survival aspect.Bullet balistics work, Animals are scary (at night more so) The map (when you consider that it's one giant linked map) is actually pretty bloody hugeI could just go on and on.I could talk to you all day of every thing I love about this game but I don't have the time or the patience. I definetley recommend this game, for anyone sick of every other reskinned survival game. I know there are some who prefer to troll-snipe bambies for fun, in which case, you can head to the featured page and see about twenty games for you.I bid you all adeiu.			"

Early Access Review
								as if living in finland is not hard enough, the guys from hinterland present and even harder way of life by setting up a survival-environment in CANADA. the first time i heard about this game was in a stream, and it felt only natural for a finn, to show the canadians we can do it - we can survive everything. but i was wrong. it is surprisingly challenging!although having doubts at first, the game also runs on an older computer with APU and without dedicated graphic-memory, if enough ram and processing power are available.i suggest everyone to start the game really on the lowest level and to explore the effects of certain decisions on the character and to get to know the map! it helps a lot to know one's way around and it makes surviving in the advanced levels of the sandbox easier, if you know where to find locations, shelter, loot, other stuff and possible threats.remember to make enough water for your character! he/she will need it for sure.runs very well, although an early access-version. this game is definitely recommendable from a beginner in survival-games to other beginners. the different levels in sandbox and the challenges make it nevertheless also interesting for more experienced players of survival-games.can't wait for the story-mode to come out! but take your time, guys at hinterland! there is still lots in the game to explore before that.congratulations, canadians! you got this round. but we will get you in ice-hockey then ;)			"

								Canadian wilderness survival after a geomagnetic disaster.  My longest survivor so far hit 100 days.  By day 4 was eating dogfood and the end of the week was stumbling through the woods with hypothermia when lucked upon a prepper's cache.  It's not always life or death, I have experienced some peaceful days hunting in the woods or ice fishing.  But one careless moment falling down a hill or failing to read the weather signs of a coming blizzard and it is you having to quickly improvise a new plan or die.  IRL I have spent a couple months living on a mountain (in a tent) in winter conditions and they get alot of it right except your clothes/axe/knife/whetstone don't wear out as quickly as they model it.  On the other hand, I can guarantee you that starting a fire at 12000 foot (3658 m) is very difficult with wet wood and no kerosene.  The game is still in early release and they are coming out with a Story mode.  Most players already love their Sandbox with several maps.   Great community and check out Geltaz on Youtube for some interesting play.  Also like to thank Drifter Man for all his forum posts.  These two seem like opposite playstyles and I am somewhere in the middle.			"

								This is a fantastic game. It is a sort of hard core survival game where even being tired can get you killed, nevermind the blood thirsty wolves. There is a great community for this game and I highly recommend you check out the Hinterland studio forum as the devs are very active and responsive to feedback. One of the biggest sale points for me on this game, for being early access, is how incredibly stable and smooth the game runs. The folks over at Hinterland really nailed down the basics and continue to tune and tweak even as they add in new content. I won't go into too much detail about the game content except to say it is cold, there is snow, and you can just about feel it through your screen. This is a masterpiece in progress and if you have even a passing interest in this sort of gaming experience, then this game is well worth the price.			"

								The top of the line in the survival genre, this game epitomizes the Man vs Nature narrative, even in the sandbox mode. Wander through the semi-tamed wilderness like a post-apocalyptic Jack London, marveling at the savage beauty of a world that pits you against your own survival strategies, rummaging through the leftovers of civilization's fringe. The scenery is gorgeously compelling while the situation feels dire, bleak and lonely, just as it should. You're going to die, but how long can you stave off the slavering fangs of the wolves that await you in the long, cold night?Highly recommended.			"

								This game is aesthetically satisfying, immersive, and fun. Of all the early-development games I've played, this has been my favorite. Dying after so many hours of walking, collecting, hunting, crafting and hardship is devastating; however, the permadeath aspect requires thought-out planning for every endeavor. +: I love the music, the sounds of nature, the exploration and the struggle to survive. I am so happy to find a game like this that doesn't have zombies or a ridiculous premise. I love how in-depth the statistics are recorded and available to track in-game and compare between games. Being able to record notes on my travels and activities is useful - I used this feature to record where I had to leave essential items behind in order to efficiently travel to new destinations.-: I am very excited for a story mode; however, it is very difficult to be patient. I am dissatisfied by the lack of background information, features and dialogue that I hope will be implemented in the story mode. I would have enjoyed the ability to record a rudimentary map in-game based on areas I have already traveled.Overall an incredible game, and I am looking forward to the Story!			"

Early Access Review
								An amazing survival game that is constantly updated and worked on, with plenty of content to keep you busy. Here are some pros/cons:Pros:- NO ZOMBIES: really, I'm sick and tired of this cliche that plagues this genre.- Not action/combat oriented: apart from wild animals you will only fight nature and your needs.- Amazing atmosphere: even if you know there's no zombie to jump on you, you'll still get uneasy feelings when going through an abbandoned place- Realism: there are very few other games that emulate real survival so well. Everything from hunger to weather or wildlife behavior is spot on.- Constant updates and feedback from developers: this is clearly not one of those alpha/EA games that is abbandoned after the first cash grab- Incentives to explore: the game is designed in such a way that you cannot jut bunker down in a cabin and live there indefinitely. You NEED to explore to survive and it's alaways a hard choice to leave your cozy ""base"" to brave the unknown.- The game is harsh: one moment your condition is 100%, everything is great, then you make 1-2 mistakes like you decide to butcher a deer even if it's frozen and there's only 1 hour of sunlight left, then a wolf attacks you and you're maimed and can't find your way to your precious shelter.  The cascade/butterfly effect can kill you even after 30-40 days of survivalCons:- No HUD to display the hunger/thirst/energy levels. While this is intentional (for immersion), I'd like to have it as an option.- Needs a bit more wildlife variety and more crafting recipes.			"

								This is the best and the most realistic survival game i have ever played. The atmosphere is a lot more different than those other survival games (Rust, DayZ, The Forest, etc.). And you get those rewarding moments, like when you find a lot of warmer clothes, or finally finding some food, or a lantern.You can't run everywhere with an axe and strike down animals like that. Every single action consumes time, and calories. And being outside for a while is very risky and cause you the risk of hypotermia easily.This is not one of those multiplayer survival games like Rust, Miscreated, H1Z1, Dayz, etc. It's just you vs the environment. And the environment can make some harsh moves for you in the game, even in the easiest difficulty.This is the most realistic and brutal survival game i have ever played. Buy it.			"

								This game is brilliant.The game spawns you into a random location on a map, and then the clock starts ticking as you try to survive as long as possible. The catch is not only are you trying to find the important aspects of survival like food and drink, but you are also being hunted. The game spawns wolves who are just as hungry as you. The wolves will hunt in packs to try to find their next meal, which may be you. This keeps you on your toes constantly as you never know what may lurk behind you or around the corner. It is very unnerving and really gives the game a creepy atmosphere. The fight for finding food, water, and shelter, as well as trying to fend for your life give the game the desperate struggle for survival it was trying to achieve. The maps are big with plenty of places of interest, and the gameplay will keep you coming back for more!Oh, and don't die. The game has permadeath, and I mean PERMADEATH. It will delete your save the second you die automatically. Every second is a fight for survival, as well as for preserving all your hard work up to that point. I go back and forth if I like this feature or not, but the stressful and desperate atmosphere it creates is definitely worth it. Pick this game up now! I can't wait to see what the future holds for it already has enough to keep me occupied for months to come :)			"

								I am most likely going to get downvotes and probably have my review marked as ""funny"" due to certain members of the community, but I'm here to say what I've been holding off on saying for the past few months. I bought The Long Dark primarily for the Story Mode; back when it was seemingly right around the corner. On the fence about purchasing, I was persuaded by the 90%(!) approval rating and endless amounts of positive reviews, so I thought I'd buy the game. While waiting for the Story Mode, I thought I might as well give Sandbox a try, so I'll start there.Sandbox mode started out fair enough - The visuals were amazing, the wolves felt like threats, and I was always on the edge of my seat, planning my next move. The atmosphere was great.However, after some hours, it became obvious that there was no point to surviving - There is simply nothing much to live for. Even with these new ""challenges,"" the game's sandbox lifetime is disappointingly short. Simply put: It gets rather boring. Surviving for months is a tedious chore, not a fun adventure. There's no reason to live. If the game had been marketed as yet another sandbox survival, I wouldn't have bought it. There's a multitude of those already, most of which are better than this game.Moving on to the mess that was/is Story mode: 18 months and multiple failed release dates later, the devs have engaged in a rigorous ""it's done when it's done"" stance.  Waiting for months upon months for a story mode that was promised to be delivered months ago and may be at best only a few hours long is not my cup of tea. I have been holding off on writing this review, but as time passed I ended up feeling disappointed and angry as The Long Dark seemed to be traveling down a never-ending road of Early Access, sadly like so many other games. This is the first Hinterland product I have purchased, and it will also be my last. I've uninstalled the game, and it will most likely remain uninstalled for the rest of eternity.			"

								A thought provoking and realistic survival game, you wont find mutants, zombies, dragons or any other unrealistic crap here! Even in it's current state (no story mode yet, just solo sandbox) I'd compare it with 'The Road' when it comes to the mood and atmosphere. The sound of the wind is your only companion in this game, only to be occasionally interrupted by the spine chilling howl of a wolf, or wolves. This game will scare you, whether you're walking through the forest after a blizzard, exploring abandoned houses or winding your way through the dreaded 'Carter Hydro Dam' (I'll let you play the game to find out why :D) you will be on the edge of your seat. Things can and WILL go 'south' in this game very fast. In my most recent game I was warm, well fed, in perfect health... I decided to go foraging. After a while walking through the snow I came accross a black bear, I had 3 rounds in my rifle, took the shot (I was running low of food stores) but I didn't kill it, I was then mauled and left in the snow to bleed out. It was my stupid decision but it shows that you have to be so careful in this game. Supplies are scarce, you are your own worst enemy, you have to deal with tiredness, health, hunger, thirst and of course warmth.I highly reccommend this game, as I said at the start it's thought provoking and has great atmosphere. This game really makes you appreciate the things we often take for granted in our day to day lives.			"

								The Long Dark is one of the best games I ever played (even if it's still in Early Access!).I can clearly recommend this game to all people who like survival games.Not survival like ""you have to kill all the zombies to survive"" (there are no zombies) more like you against nature (against extremely cold Canadian hinterland, against wolves and bears, against thirst and hunger, against your body that get's tired, against loneliness and declining tools). This game is for explorers and nature lovers, for romantics and survivalists, for art lovers (beautiful graphics) and sound freaks (amazing sounds, really rich in detail, voice acting of your own character is also great). At the moment you can only play the game in sandbox mode. The studio has planed this game as a story mode and released the sandbox to test the in game mechanics of the world. They constantly improve the mechanics always in close connection to the feed back of the community. (It's just amazing how fast they respond!) If you read this you can get the impression of the game is in an experimental state - belief me, it's not! I played this game in sandbox mode for more than 100 hours, I wouldn't  have if it wasn't playable and highly enjoyable. In the last update they also implanted a challenge mode where you have missions to accomplish under high pressure. This is great for all players that spend a lot of time in the game and wished for some change in their day to day survival. If you are new I recommend to first explore all regions and learn to survive in the wilderness before accepting the challenges. What I especially like as a female player is that you can choose between a female an a male character. It helps to merge in to the game even more. And you really get absorbed by the game: If you played it for a couple hours you will start to collect matches in real live. In short: Highly recommended for players who like to explore a beautiful landscape under extreme circumstances. Who like to collect food and stuff and build a base camp. Who like game mechanics that are oriented in real life (you can't run all day, you have to sleep or you can't sleep if you aren't tired). Who like to think of what happens if you are the last person after the apocalypse. Who like an apocalypse where nothing really changes but the weather gets more extreme, the wolves are more aggressive and you can't find other survivors (at the moment).			"

								February 22nd (Day One)I knew it was a mistake when I did it, but I took her up anyway. That's the last time I ignore my gut. Hell, ignore my reason, my instinct. Every inch of me was saying, ""hey, bad idea; let's not put five miles between you and the ground when every other plane crashed simultaneously four weeks ago."" But that's what you do when you're desperate, you stop using your God-given common sense.If this does end up being read by anybody other than me, congrats! You are alive and I am dead. And you will probably be easier on me than I am being on myself. You might say, ""Jack, you had to take that plane South. You were freezing to death. You had one good day to get the hell outta Dodge."" Well, thank you. Maybe you are right, but it is what it is.Either way, my plane did what every other plane did: it crashed. By some combination of my incredible flying skills (and humility) and nothing short of a miracle, I put her down in a way that didn't crush any of my bones or major organs.I would take the time to tell you about all the crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥that's been happening to the world lately, but if you are alive enough to read this, then you know damn well what's going on. If, by some small chance someone deciphers this thing twenty thousand years from now, well...the world went to hell in a hurry. Some insane solar flare sent our magnetic field bonkers and managed to fry every piece of electric hardware ever (my plane is a rebuild from way back so no computer, lucky right?) Not sure what the warmer places in the globe are dealing with, but up north here the weather is about as predictable as a grapefruit squirt.So, I'm not dead...yet. In fact, I had the good fortune of crashing and not dying in a place that had been inhabited not too long ago; that, and salvaging a few items that, like me, were lucky enough not to be crushed in my plane, I might actually have a chance. I guess I have to look at it that way so I won't give up and die right now. What's that saying? Expect the worst, hope for the best? Well, I don't even know what to expect at this point but I'm sure there's some other saying for how it can always get worse... actually, I think that's the saying. Not the most creative people making these things up.As for what to hope for...how about another sunrise.Enough of the backstory, that's not what journals are for and I better get to it anyway before either this fire goes out or I pass out. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I'm out of shape. Someone shoulda had the decency to mention the world was gonna end, I would've gone for a run or two. Who am I kidding? No I wouldn't've.* * *It's sometime mid-morning and I'm standing next to this wreck of a plane, scratching my head at how I'm not dead when I realize I might literally be freezing my♥♥♥♥♥off...like my actual♥♥♥♥♥my just fall off of me, land in the snow, and I might not realize it. So I manage to grab my survival pack with the few things I could salvage and I hoof it toward something that looks less mountain-ish and more building-ish in the distance (basically something more square and less pointy). I'm not really thinking thoughts at this point; I am just realizing how out of breath I am trudging about a hundred feet through snow and that if I stop to catch my breath I might become an icicle.But would you believe it? A poor, insignificant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me gets lucky, like jackpot lucky, twice in one day. There is a building, which means I might have actually crashed near civilization, which means I might not freeze to death, which means I might find something that will keep me from starving after I chow down on this energy bar. Hell, I might even meet another person, and they might not even want to kill me and eat me. I should be dead, anything could happen at this point.I snapped a shot of the building[zeemodernnerdblog.files.wordpress.com] with the magically uncrushed Polaroid camera I had in my pack, though I would trade this camera and my left pinky for a hot burger right about now. Screw it, I'll give both pinkies for any amount of ground beef. Did I mention this is day 1 of me surviving out here? Not sure what limbs I'll be willing to trade if I make it ten days. I guess I'll let you know.This thing is some sort of dam. I assume it's hydro-electric, no one builds a dam without an opportunity to generate some cash flow from it. Ah, those were the days, when you could subjugate nature for your own personal gain. Well, thank you Mr. Dam-Builder you helped me live today.By the way, I say I assume it's hydro-electric now as I am writing this, but at the time my brain is still frozen and I believe I was thinking: ""me cold, building less cold, me go.""So ""me went"" and ""me not freeze."" Me actually almost trip over a dead guy holding a storm lantern as soon as I enter the thing. I was horrified at seeing the corpse at the time, but it's really crazy how different your brain acts when it knows you need to live. Let me clarify: when I'd realized I'd tripped over this corpse--this former person with a soul who died a terrible death that I might soon die--I was both horrified and relieved. Relieved because it was dark as hell and this guy is holding a lantern with fuel in it. I don't know how he didn't leave it on, I'm not sure how he died, but all I am thinking is, ""thank the sweet Lord: I have light.""Then, I turn the lantern on and see a giant gash in his side and a trail of blood and realize this guy made it about four feet in here before he passed out from blood loss. The snow outside must have covered whatever trail he left out there. But, I feel nothing.  It wasn't like the movies. I know I should have curled up in a ball and sobbed for the tragedy of it all. I should have puked because it's a body and I don't see those, but really, I'm feeling nothing. Call it shock. Call me a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but unless you have been there, you can't know.The things I should've been thinking (and not doing so nearly got me killed) was, ""what made that nasty huge gash in that man's side? Could it be a thing? A dangerous thing? Could it still be around? Do I need a weapon pronto so I don't end up like this unfortunate gentleman?""But anyway...Listen, my fire is dying down. I don't want to keep you on the edge of your seat, but I'm still alive, for today. I have enough stuff at the moment that I can write a bit in the morning before I have to go continue to try to live. I'm not sure why I care so much about writing this, but I hope if you are reading it you'll... yeah, I don't know what I hope.It is what it is.TO BE CONTINUEDCheck out my other Steam ReviewsFor more stories/reviews/articles check out My Blog[zeemodernnerdblog.wordpress.com] "

								Firstly, this game is amazing. The survival mechanics are well-thought out and the atmosphere is beautiful. The game is just a gem to those who love open-world survival and crafting elements. But more than that, the developers are extremely attentive to the needs and wants of their fanbase; they keep fans aprised of game progress and updates, and when updates are made available to players, they never disappoint. I appreciate this game and the developers' hard work. It's shaping up beautifully.			"

								There are few games that compare to the atmosphere and tension created by The Long Dark.  In my opinion, this is one of the best survival games on the market. It creates uneasiness from simplicity, and your biggest enemy usually isnt somthing tangible; although there are wolves that want to eat your face.  The fight between staying fed and healthy/ balanced with exploration and a beautiful art style lends to many hours of satisfying gameplay, and replay value.  It is a must have for any open-world/survival connoisseur. 10/10 hypothermia sim...			"

								Really great game, even though its still not officially complete.Had to die a couple of times before I learned the mechanics, but once you understand how to gather food, water and find enough places to keep warm, the real exploring can begin.Explored all the main locations so far, but the maps are big and quite complicated. Some have an abundance of resources and shelter, while others will take a good bit of searching. Most frustrating bit so far was getting stuck in a cave complex with no way of making a light. Took a while to get out of there.			"

								The Long Dark is a survival game that takes place in a sad, depressing and oppresive envrionment where quite literally is trying to kill you, wether it is a wolf or a bad can of pork n beans. The reason why I recommend this game, and will be nagging my friends to purchase the title is due to the fact that the game manages to pull off a very, very impressive atmosphere that delivers a very emotional and very raw experience to the player playing the game. While I do believe that the game does have a long way to go, the copy paste buildings and the somewhat repitive environments do very little to enhance the experience, but with more unique areas such as the hydro electric dam being added into the game, I feel like this could be one of the best indie games of the year.

								At first I was skeptical about The Long Dark but once I bought it i fell in love with this Early Alpha survival game. If your on the fence about The Long Dark you should consider a few things, if you love survival games and that hardcore aspect this will never get old. But before you buy it though you have to really think ""Will i put up with dieing all the time"" because you do. You spawn in and basicly if you don't find some shelter fast you die. And thats the nature of the game, but if you like a challenge you should defently get the game or think about it. P.S the devs say it will become more expensive over time when it's finished so if your going to get it get it now.			"

								What to say about The Long Dark that does it justice?Unlike most other 'survival' games out there in the market, do not be expecting to swing axes at Zombies and other supernatural beings. Your enemy in this game is the weather, wildlife (Wolves / Bears) , fatigue, thirst and hunger.Simply walking around with no enemy in sight can cause your health to start deteriorating if you are being careless about how cold the weather is. When you are starving, the sight of even a small handful of herbs or a degraded packet of candy will get you excited.Expect to build fires, evade wildlife, monitor the weather like a hawk, inspect every nook and cranny for food / water / medicine - expect to hurl yourself into a cabin with a wolf or bear on your tail like your life depended on it. (Which it does!) Expect to traverse up large mountains in the hope that there may be a shelter somewhere. Enjoy the beautiful sunlit and moonlit views of the Canadian forests whilst reminding yourself that you need to keep moving.Expect to flounder in the darkness and traverse through mines with the kerosene in your lamp trickling away. If you can plan ahead, if you can adapt to harsh situations and if you can handle doing as much as possible with as little as possible in your possession - you will relish this title. This is an intelligent game designed for intelligent gamers. It is a true masterpiece and example of not only what a survival game should truly be about, but also how an Early Access title should be developed.Hinterland Studios actively and consistently interact with their members on the forum and listen to inputs about any bugs and feedback about the game. And all along, they still remain true to their core vision of the game.I cannot recommend this game enough. There is plenty of content in the game and it barely feels like an Alpha release.------------------Some key notes about the title;* One life. When your game is over, it is over.* Ammo is scarce.* The weather WILL dictate how much you can explore at any given time.* You can craft gear, which includes warmer clothing, weapons and food harvesting.* There is item degradation. All repairable... if you have the materials.* There is no ""map"". You learn by exploring and memorising.* What you can carry is limited. Whilst you can go over your 'maximum' weight, be prepared for the fatigue, thirst, hunger and movement penalties.* The game has a learning curve which would be considered steeper than most other titles - there is a bit to take in, there is no game manual - and it can be unforgiving. This is a game that intuitively makes you discover by yourself.* You will be monitoring your four stat bars and your health bar a lot in this game if you want to succeed.* There will be a lot of exploring where you do not get attacked for long periods. This is normal. (And to be honest, a welcome thing!)------------------The only things I would consider as ""CONS"" for this title is that it's in Alpha - so you naturally want more content and there are pockets of bugs you can discover. (I don't come across very many though...) Also, once you get proficient at surviving (takes a while to get there) it can be a bit lonely and repetitive if you aren't exploring around the maps.Other than that - fantastic title. Do get it!If you're a patient, planning player - then this acquired taste is more than for you. A hidden gem of a title that already has amassed a cult following. http://www.hinterlandforums.com/ "

								So far, the game is great. It is a difficult survival game and accurately portrays real life survival. Still, like all early access, I am left with wanting a little more out of it.Specifically, I find the game visually understimulating. Let me clarify. The scenery and art work are amazing. My problem is that every action I go do, I have to watch a loading bar tell me time is passing rather than show me that it is. Like when I eat a candy bar, I want to see myself take a few bites out of it. Instead I hear a few crunching noises and measure my progress on a bar. When I go scavenging for wood, maybe show me chipping away at a nearby tree. The only action I don't mind watching is sleeping. Right now the game has so much potential. I just still worry that the developers will dip out too early on this project.			"

A survival game that is pure survival. No zombies, no nuclear wastelands, none of that. Just you vs Mother Nature and her elements. In The Long Dark, you play as a bush pilot who crash lands in the middle of Canada's harsh wilderness in the event of a geomagnetic disaster. You'll need to scavenge for food, water, meds, and tools to help you stay alive to see the dawn of the next day while the wolves and bears nip at your heels.You'll also need to take account for body temperature, caloric intake, your hunger/thirst, fatigue, wind-chill, wildlife, and other environmental factors. This game will have you making decisions and one wrong decision will see to your death. Can you survive to see another day....or will you succumb to the long dark.			"

								Most inmersive game I've ever played, combined with an astonishing landscape makes it the best choice to get lost for a while and forget about everything and everyone. But be careful while wandering on the canadian wilderness or you may fade into The Long Dark...Apart from that, all I can say its that this is an epic game, i have never felt so involved in a game, trying to figure out how to survive one more day, having gone to far looking for supplies and getting lost in a blizzard while night unfolds and cold begins to bite hard while having to watch out for wolf packs not to hunt me down as they did to the deer that I just encountered some time before.This game is a must. I've played 40 hours and have not seen half of the maps, still 3 more untravelled zones to explore and the new ones to be released with the story mode.It delivers countless hours of intense gameplay even if its just you and the unforgiving wilderness			"

								I bought this game a while ago, but I decided to write a review now. I had been looking for a survival game that would be as as close to real wilderness survival as possible. If you have spent any significant amount of time backpacking in wilderness you will understand how unforgiving it can be. And this game portrays that aspect of real life, granted wildlife like wolves don't come charging and try to kill you when they see you. I would say if you want a game that is very challenging and can be brutally unforgiving and will test your skills and luck around every corner, buy this game and immediately play it on Stalker mode. You won't regret it.			"

								Best Early Access game I've ever purchased!At first I was going to wait until I had more play time to write this review but I think 10 hours is a good start. First of all, the game is EXTREMELY immersive. However I wish the soundtrack played more than it did (because it's amazing), I think it only plays at certain times. The graphics are really great and different from most games. The survival aspect is great, people think the wolves are OP but really they aren't (only fluffy, he scares me).  The more things you use like clothing etc the more it decays which isn't really too realistic but it forces you to scavange, explore, and repair your items often. The Mystery Lake map is big enough to keep you interested and Hinterland has now added about what? 4 more zones?  I only have 25 hours on the game and the longest I survived was 2 days! You can sprain your ankles which requires painkillers and rest (somewhat like real life). You can get food poisoning from bad venison or wolf meat even if it is cooked! You can get dysentry from drinking tainted or unsafe water. I really wish I could describe the epicness of this game but I am a bit tired lol, if you're wondering if it is worth the 20$. IT IS! Especially with all the updates the Devs have release in just the past FEW DAYS! This game has much more to be added including a story mode. So yes, if you like survival games and want to see if you can survive the Canadian Wilderness, buy the game! :D			"

								This game is great...but the only problem is, it's addicting. I'm currently working on getting all the achievements, and am already on my fourth run.My first run (very proud of this) I lasted seventy days, decided to go shoot a bear, got mauled by a bear, somehow survived thanks to medicine, bear died from my gunshot wound, and then I froze to death while trying to harvest his meat. I learned my lesson...never try to harvest all the meat from a bear at once.Next run, I wondered what it would be like to jump off a bridge. Let's just say it hurt...a lot. I survived 6 days.Third run, I decided to go off-road and I fell into a ravine out of which I could not get. Being stuck, I froze to death...again. I survived 33 days.Now I'm on my fourth run (yes, I do have a life, if you were wondering) and I'm predigiously proud of surviving for 109 days so far. But, considering my luck, I'll probably be dying very soon.So, in summary, while this game is still an Alpha, I have had yet to encountered a bug in the game (well, say for being stuck in the ravine and not being able to get out, but I will blame that on my own stupidity). The art style reminds me a bit of Nightmare Before Christmas and the game mechanics are very simple for a newbie like me to understand, and yet the game has a lot of strategy in it. I personally can't wait until the full game comes out. Now, I have to get back to the game...who's betting I die in five minutes...oh dear, that bear is lumbering towards me...excuse me while I run for my life...			"

								I would recommend this game to anyone interested in survival games. It has a unique art style and it is all about you and the elements. The interloper mode is most challanging. This game is very stable and packed with features for a game in early access stage. The sandbox mode works perfectly and I haven't had a single crash. They are currently working on the storymode. I really like the ethos of the game and dev team. They have podcasts on their hinterland site where they discuss the genre and thinking behind the game.			"

Pros:- Open world survival.- Very good graphics and the graphics also suit the game.- Random Item Spawning, items spawn in a different place every time.- Well made AI Enemies.- Many different items and places to explore.- The devs add maps regularly, they will always keep you interested.- Story Mode will be coming out soon, as to how good it will be I can't say.- Not Another Zombie Survival Game.-All language types can be found on the Workshop.Cons:- After surviving 2+ days you will start to run out of supplies and it will begin to get to hard since nearly everything can kill you.- Worlds are not randomly generated, items will spawn randomly but the world and levels will always be the same.- No Multiplayer.Conclusion:This game is an Open World survival simulator that has very nice graphics that suit the games style. This game is currently not multiplayer but they are bringing out a single player campaign. The AI in this game are very will made, the voice actor also has just the right feel about his/her voice in the fact that it fits the style of the game. Sandbox Mode if very fun to play and will keep you coming back to explore the new maps that the Devs add all the time.Overall Rating: 7/10 "

								So I bought the game ...... when I realized that I was getting a bit hungry and my fire was running out. I had to go outside and scour the area for resources as the night was soon creeping up on me. I heard wood crackling, wind sweeping and wolves howling. I knew that I was on borrowed time unless I stood tall and vowed to make my living for a coming day. With one last inhale of my dying breath, I made a run for it and ran back to my cabin. Half of me was frozen, but I knew that I was still alive inside. While looking back on what I've done, a kindle lit up and made me think that since day 1 I've been building up to my salvation. I sat down to a warm fire ...... and then decided to play some Long Dark. It's a nice game!			"

								This awsome game...I can easilly recomend this game - as it holds you awake and on edge at all times. Even a small slip-up can cost you your prescious callories and need for first-aid. Surviving in the wild with no power whatsoever demands a certain skill and will..!This game gives you the feeling of being lost beyond everything and that you are all alone. Learn to master the environment, find clothings to keep warm and take shelter from the storm! The ways to survive are many, but only you knows how this will end - and end it will! ;)			"

								Amazing game with great transparency with the devs. The sense of survival is great, and dread of a blizzard rolling when you're caught unawares really puts the fear in me. Looking forward to future additions and developments in gameplay and immersion.The sandbox world is definitely interesting and can't wait to see story mode.I ruined an element of the game for myself by looking up maps online. Of the remaining zones I have yet to explore I think I'll grab some pen and paper out to make my own as I go.Great work Hinterland, and kudos on sticking to your vision. Nothing worse than mediocrity by pandering to the status quo. "

Early Access Review
								The absolute BEST survival game ever created. The immersion is absolutely stunning, there is just something about unreal engine that makes you completely absorbed into the game. The devs are some of the kindest, warmest canadians of all time, who listen intently to their community and are constantly involved with making the game as good as possible. This is the model Early Access game, and don't let heaps like dayZ or H1Z1 put a bad taste in your mouth, because these devs deserve every single bit of money they earn. The game itself completely breaks the monotony of regular survival games in that there is no end game item, or one that immediately makes the game easier to play. the focus is completely on the gameplay of survival, which is done incredibly well. It isn't the prospect of getting better guns or items that keeps you playing, but just the process of surviving day to day which makes me keep coming back to this game. The graphical style they chose for this game is just phenominal. The artstyle immediately draws you into the world, all without putting extreme intensity on your rig. The ambience and soundtrack are nothing short of perfect, adding to the immersion immensely. Now content-wise, I alone spent upwards of 30 hours just on the first realm, and by the date of this review, there are 5 regions available to explore. I just finished the second region in 20 hours, just in time for them to announce Storymode for 2016. I am sure that if I got back into it, I could easily top 150-200 hours on only sandbox. Now onto bugs, they are very, and I mean VERY rare. I don't even think I ever even got a CTD. In all my playtime I can't recall a single bug or glitch that took me out of the game, or messed with my progress. It is extremely well polished, which you don't get much of for Early Access.Bottom line, buy this game, but experience wise, I would reccomend you don't play it until 2016, when storymode comes out. I for one really wished I waited on playing it, because apparently Storymode will use many portions of the sandbox maps, which would spoil some exploration experience for me. waiting until storymode will promise you the best experience. Also, from my own personal experience, play the game on Stalker mode (the hardest). This is the only difficulty I've played on, and its one of the most punishing survival experiences out there, besides maybe Stalker Call of Pripyat's MISERY mod. You will be sneaking and fighting for you life every single day, and the rifle doesn't immediately promise to save you. This right here is an excellent game, and a model for all other survival games to take note from.			"

								I've owned this game for several months now and as a member of the Hinterland forums (anyone interested should definitely check the forums out; the community is wonderful plus you can easily stay in the loop of things: http://hinterlandforums.com/ ), I can confidently state that the devs are definitely looking out for and listening to their fan base.  With the most recent update released yesterday, it is very clear that they are taking into consideration every bit of critique, suggestions, and bug reports that the community has to offer, within reason (meaning that anyone who comes up suggesting they add zombies to the game won't be taken seriously, haha).The game itself is gorgeous.  The art style, ambience, music and everything else is breath-taking!  There's even a thread at the forums where people can post their beautiful screenshots of the game for others to enjoy ;)  And while it is still in alpha, meaning it is guaranteed to have balancing issues and bugs, the team is devoted to ironing out everything as best as possible.  This is probably the most stable alpha I can think of because of this, in fact.In short, with everything the game has had to offer in the past and now, I will definitely be giving this game many, many more hours of play!

								Wow! For the price of a couple fancy coffees I just fought to survive for 1 day 22 hours before a wolf tracked me down and ate my face. I was close to death atleast 3 times before the wolf even came into the picture. Holy hell I suggest you play this on the 2nd difficulty to start. It feels brutal to get dropped into the first map not knowing how the heck to do anything end you are at deaths door every 10-15mins because of the cold, hunger, thirst and lack of resources in the forest. Simply amazing game and I my first 2 hours was a blur. You're crazy not to buy this on sale if you even remotely enjoy adventure/survival games. Even at full price I think this game is easily worth the asking price.			"

								I have just finished a 20 day run, as of writing this I am rank #7. If you are looking for a realistic survival simulator this is not it. It is however, an enjoyable game. Once you discover the map and figure out the mechanics it's relativly easy to survive, it becomes a bit stale and offers no real long term objectives. Untill that point the game is very enjoyable. I think with future content and hopefully some improvements to the UI & late game it will be well worth the asking price. Right now you are probably only going to get a few days out of it. If that's ok with you then pick it up. I don't regret my purchase.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: A great survival game that pulls ahead of nearly every survival game I've played before. Worth every penny.My experiences in The Long Dark have all been entirely different (albeit always ending in my demise) despite picking the same map most of the time. The maps are quite large and connect to each other. The maps are NOT procedurely generated, allowing maps to be created and upon starting a new game, you can head in a familiar direction.The difficulty can be set depending on how you'd like to play, whether you prefer exploring or hardcore survival. Even playing on the ""Pilgrim"" (easy) difficulty it provides a solid challenge, eliminating only the threat of animals. My most recent experience was on the easiest difficulty and I still managed to die withing the first few days because I got carried away. Knowing when you have enough daylight to make it back to camp is essential. I decided to fish my last 2 hours of daylight, only a few hundred yards from what I decided to make my ""base"". That night of course turned out to be one of the darkest I've seen and of course I had ran out of fuel earlier, not expecting to need any. I lit my lantern that had very little keroseen and started to head towards my shack. Soon I realized I had went the wrong direction after getting turned around in the dark. It didn't take long for my lantern to go out, so I lit the only thing I had left, a flare. I wandered for what seemed like forever, not making any progress. Hypothermia ensued and I was becoming exhausted. I managed to find one of the many fishing huts on the lake I had been fishing on. I decided it'd be best to wait out the night in the shack rather than wandering around cold. To pass the time I decided to fish, there could only be around 4 hours of night left. 2 more hours of fishing and my situation was becoming dire. The night was still black and the temperatures had only become worse. I laid now my bedroll, hoping to rest and warm up inside the sleeping bag while in the fishing shack. Only needed to make it another hour and the sun would begin to rise, lighting the way to my base where I could be warm. As I rested my body temperature just continued to drop and I died in my sleep. This was on the easiest difficulty. (Yes, I obviously suck.)The game runs well, but can be demanding at times due to the large world and blizzards. The graphics are artistic, but nothing that will knock your socks off, but you can capture some pretty nice screenshots during sunrises or when the night isn't so dark. The game even has a nice soundtrack that can be quite ominous, but fits the setting. The music isn't constant so it doesn't take away from the immersion. Some animal sounds aren't great, such as deer running by, but others can be quite chilling. Hearing a pack of wolves begin to howl in the night while hearing the wind screaming throught the trees creates an amazing atmostphere.The game doesn't hold your hand. You're thrown in and survival begins the second you start. There are community made maps, but none in game. This is not to say that it has a sharp learning curve though. Crafting is simple and item descriptions tell you how to do certain things (such as curing hides).The developers are constantly putting out updates and doing everything to turn this into a finished product (even though it feels close to one now). Features such as story mode have yet to be added, but sandbox and challenges are more than enough to keep you entertained for more hours than many triple A titles can. The Long Dark is an excellent game and is well worth the small price tag. A game that shows no signs of ever being abandoned as many early access games have in the past. The game can be tough so if you're aren't a fan of survival games, it's probably safe to say you should stay away. If you are a fan of survival though, this is the perfect game for you. No zombies, no aliens, just you and the Canadian wilderness.			"

								When this game showed up on my Steam queue, the description was one that immediately piqued my interest (that and the beautiful artstyle). The promise of a ""thoughtful, exploration-survival experience"" was exactly what I'd been looking for since I've had time to pick up gaming as a pasttime once more. While I do have a few gripes with the game thus far, the duration of my experience in the game so far has been with answering a couple of questions that have been floating around since I was first introduced:Does it live up to what it claims to be (at least in terms of my playstyle)?Given that I've played the game almost exclusively on hard mode, and have recently reached day 30 on my current run, I'd consider myself at least a bit survivable and able to handle the game's mechanics pretty well. Did it challenge me? That's a given; my first four of five runs, each having been slightly longer than the last, each had their fun and challenging stories, which ultimately ended with my demise (to wolves every time). There seems to be a bit of a rough difficulty curve, as it starts off incredibly difficult and overwhelming, only to become basic knowledge to survive. Perhaps I haven't trying challenging myself, as my intuition within the game has been to reduced to ""Gotta find buildings, gotta go fast."" Judging from my experience, playing to live exclusively off the land seems impossible. Not that it should be the intended way of playing, but that I think it should be an option for the most daring of players. The game's mechanics do not allow for such a playstyle, as they do not for a lot of playstyles. A decently large game with so much potential ends up being disappointingly shallow at the end of the day. (I suppose that's the cause of Early Access, but I digress) There's a lot of room to expand and add depth.    TL;DR: Hell yeah, but could do with some improvements.Do the game's mechanics work well/properly? If there's anything I love, it's a game that you can't learn completely just from reading a couple pages on the wiki. A game that not only requires a strong sense of intuition and logic, but also experience to apply your knowledge properly. The only real sense of progression you have throughout the game is synthesized through the pseudo leveling system for repairing and firemaking. The game mechanics work properly, only, they become very predictable and boring over time. They are not, however, without merit. There are some unique mechanics within the game that deserve some credit. Let's start off with the the environment. In my opinion, the environment is very well done and is just naturally a challenging part of the game that is always a breath of fresh air. Air temperature and windchill are both very well done and fun elements of the game to play around. Not to mention how well the environment is aesthetically, though the night time could use a little polishing (snow and breath look awkward in the dark). The environment definitely does a lot better than it's living counterpart: the wolves. On the other end of the spectrum, wolves are what I have the biggest problem with. It's great to have a constantly looming threat, especially in the harder difficulty, but they have become more annoying than threatening at this point. Randomness is a very fickle element of survival games, and should be used only when necessary; ie. wolves should not be dictated by randomness. Being the BIG threat in most playthroughs, they should be challenging and something to think about, not annoying and something you just pray to avoid. I should be praying when I'm making a run for the cabin at midnight because I've run out of supplies, not when I'm leaving in the morning for a fresh expedition. The wolves are a very flawed gameplay mechanic, as they stand right now. With semi-random spawns, arbitrary movement, and aggro radius, they act pretty much exactly like a zombie would. I understand the suspension of disbelief that has to go into playing a videogames, but wolves should act as wolves do. There's very little room to play around the possibilities of wolf attacks, since they are so random, and once they're chasing you, they never let up. Of course, when they DO catch you, there's very little threat unless there are two or more to continuously pounce you, and then you're more than likely dead at that point. TL;DR: The elements are nice, the wolves are a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥br>Overall, the game so far has been a fantastic experience with lots of very high points where I've felt sheer awe from the beauty, pure relief from escaping the brink of death, or relaxation from sitting around a fire during a cold night. And, of course, there were some pretty frustrating low points. Wolves randomly become immune to flares, randomly become immune to torches, and randomly show up in packs right outside my door. Fun times in the Canadian wilderness. 8/10			"

								-Will redo another review for the next update-v0.196 ReviewSo, I feel the need to rewrite a new review because of the many changes occured in the game and I'm not happy with all of them !First, the good things.1/ A new area is available to exploration ""pleasant valley"". It consists of a bigger area representing a more ""countryside"" or ""rural"" feeling. This area provides some good feeling of what is really surviving in an isolated zone. You have to plan anything (where to go, what to do...) in advance because being caught in a blizzard or fog, or just be surprised by the night is a certain death coming to you very quick ! I really like this area because you have to be prepared before entering it and you can't rely on modern supplies because this area is almost made of empty fields and moutains (but you will find interesting things too if you explore the zone carefully)2/ there are now 3 difficulty mode. The standard one, an ""pilgrim"" mode (easy) where you can explore without caring of anything (I don't enjoy this mode because you can't die even if you go almost naked in the wirlds), but, it is a good point to try this mode and explore zones to learn where are the ""safe zones"". Also, the wolves will not attack you in this game mode.3/ New animal : The bear ! Very slow but massive, interesting but for now, it is overpowered and don't give enough meat to be considered like a valuable resource.4/ new crafts : you can now gpo hunt for mushrooms and plants to make bandages and tea (and some more things I don't discovered yet). Useful when you fall short of modern medical items.5/ I think there are some changes in food/drink consumption. but perhaps it's just me. It seems to me that food needs are now more realistics.Now the things I consider bad or I don't like (only one :D)1/ wolves are now mostly invincible. If they spot you and begin to run, it's over : they can't be scared anymore after that. I think this is a bug but it's really annoying...And that's all for my rating. I red on steam forums that there are bunkers hidden in the game, spawning randomly on start on each game. But I've never found one yet. And I don't want to see the maps created by the community (because I don't want to ruin all the exploration game). Another good feature I wasn't aware of.======================Original review below======================This game is very good and it's still in alpha stage.Explain why it's good will be a lot difficult but I'll try my chance to make you play this game.This game is a survival without any zombies or ennemies. The only thing you will fight is yourself and mother nature. when the game start, you are launched into the unknown, in a vast canadian land cover with ice and snow and the first thing you have to do is to find a shelter before dying in this cold country. The game is based on exploration, but you are limited by food, drink, fatigue and cold. You have to manage these 4 parameters (+ day/night cycle) to advance in the game, find better tools to survive and to be able to explore more.The weather can suddenly change to a mortal blizzard, the temperatures can go below -35°C, making you run to the nearest shelter or hill to try to protect yourself from the deadly winds, making a fire with your poor ressources to heat yourself a little... but wait, there's more : WOLFS !This terrible animal will be your biggest nightmare, it can kill you in seconds (you can fight back too but your chances are not very high) and very soon, you'll be out of ""modern"" supplies, you'll have to hunt too, making water from snow and making it safe to drink. And many more thing I can't tell you without spoiling the end game content (but it's still alpha stage so many more things will soon arrive). And oh, each new game randomizes all items, making each death a replay value.For now, the game has only two linked zones, a little one, easier to explore and memorise, and a larger one, more difficult, because of the distance between shelters (you have to plan all your moves before doing anything). Devs said a third zone will arrive soon but again, you'll have plenty of things to do and discover in the two zones provided with the game for now. Will you survive 50 days ?			"

								This is a game that works for me on nearly every level. I've spent 25+ years working in the outdoors of the Pacific Northwest so this was like playing in my backyard. I am not going to talk about all the aspects of this game that are great but will highlight a few. Played now for over a year - the updates & changes have been awesome! Here's the only negatives (?) imo.-Some players may not be satisified with the art / graphics. Personally I think they work, are simple and quite beautiful.-There are some oddities with movement over snow drifts / ice that I think are just minor glitches. Why, occassionally, can't I step over a 4"" drift on a road?-The rifle mechanics are a bit confusing. I have owned and used a .303 extensively so I'm not blowing smoke when I say a wolf shot in the chest at 10 feet is, at the minimum, going to be knocked off it's feet. EDIT: Since writing this review I have one-shot 23 wolves in a row. Curious...-Black bears normally do not attack when shot. 95% of the time they run away from the direction the pain originated from. In this game they attack 80% of the time. And they move at the speed of light. They cover 25 yards (the distance I typically shoot them) in about a second. ?? I've been charged 6 times in RL and as dangerous as that was I can tell you: bears are fast BUT not that fast.That's really all I can say that is remotely negative.I can tell you that the basic stats of keeping your body temperature up, monitoring your fatigue, keeping hydrated and watching your calorie intake is, in RL, critical to your survival outdoors. Reading the wind, clouds, type and intensity of snowfall, wildlife behaviour are also extremely important. The balance that this game has with making these characteristics important but not needlessly difficult to learn is brilliant.The crafting mechanic is simple and useful. The amount of steep and hazardous ground and easy going terrain is well balanced. The need for light sources is well thought out but not unduly taxing. After dying on day 1.5 on my first play through I was embarassed (stood too close to a fire and burned to death). My second play through I was mauled to death by a black bear on day 59 hour 22. I was equally embarassed, I KNOW bears extremely well - what the hell was I thinking? Now I am approaching 250 days of survival.Some advice to new players: Just like in the real outdoors there are the obvious needs of shelter, food and water. But the real key to survival is caution and patience. Don't push that extra two hours into the hills if the weather looks sketchy. Don't take a shot unless you have the near perfect or perfect angle. You can always go exploring the next day when the weather is better and there is always another deer or bear to take tomorrow.Great game Hinterland, love it. 9.5/10			"

								The Long Dark is a survival-crafting game based somewhere in the Canadian Yukon where the player is dropped into a depopulated tundra when an unexpected magnetic resonance causes his plane to crash. Survival is the name of the game and you will need to carefully plan your movements and actions to conserve as much of your food, drink, energy, and warmth if you want to survive.The game is basically a metered survival mode that you might be familiar with if you’ve played games like Rust or DayZ. In addition to the typical food/drink/rest gauges, you also have a warmth meter that must be satisfied by keeping in warm places and/or wearing warm clothing, to prevent risk of hypothermia. Like the aforementioned games, there is an underlying crafting system where you collect various items and combine them to make different things or to repair tools and clothing, which are worn down through use or misuse.There are a few wandering packs of wolves and solitary bears who will make your life miserable if you are foolish enough to get close to them but generally they’re pretty easy to avoid and, unless you are overburdened, you should be able to sprint away from them to safety so long as there is a cabin nearby or if you have some bait to drop as a distraction. Other than that the main “combat” in this game is you versus nature and time. Smart players will plan the use of available daylight with maximum efficiency, leaving hours of darkness purely for resting and campfire-related activities.That’s really about it. I kind of wish there were more things to do in TLD or more ways of achieving the same effect. For example, in order to forge arrowheads you have to have coal, scrap metal, and a heavy hammer. I would have liked it if there was a more time consuming way of using a rock or some other improvised device so I would have something to carry me over until I found the requisite hammer. You also have to rely on snares to catch wildlife without weapons which in turn require that you kill or harvest guts from existing wildlife. Not a huge problem but with all the cotton and leather I kept finding, and random cars which clearly had their internals still present, you’d think I could make some sort of alternative trap. Just a bit of cleverness would be all that’s needed to turn this from an okay game into a really great game (that and maybe a co-op multiplayer function).  As it stands, most people will figure out how to survive practically forever, especially if they are lucky enough to kill a bear yielding massive amounts of raw meat. Once you get into that kind of situation, all the stress behind surviving goes right out the window and you end up spending your time making up your own goals instead of being guided by the game. I’m sure this is something that will be remedied by story mode but in the meantime I will have to regard this game as half-finished.I still recommend The Long Dark, though, as the devs have been pretty good at bringing in new content and the majority of my gripes will probably be resolved with story mode wherein tool scarcity and lack of alternatives won’t matter so much. Consider picking this one up on sale if you’d like to spend 10-15 hours roleplaying Tom Hanks’ Canadian cousin. "

 The Long Dark	 Pros: + A decent ammount of types wildlife+ Weapons+ A pure survivor game (no zombies)+ Updates+ Hunting, Fishing, Trapping, Looting, and Crafting+ Big Maps+ Makes you feel all alone which adds to the game+ Food Expires+ Sickness and Health+ Game Modes Cons: - Some people may find it slow or boring, but I think it's realistic.- Wolves and Bears are overly agressive.- The Radio Will Make You Depressed...Stay Strong Review Have you ever thought what you would do if you had to survive alone? In The Long Dark you are able to do just that. The Long Dark is a realistic survival game, and personally my favorite survival game that I own. I really enjoy this game and exploring the terrain. You have to manage your supplies and resources as well keep your health up. There is a good amount of wildlife to hunt and avoid.  The developers did good on this one. Trust me, you are going to want to get this one. I highly suggest this game.This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

								As of v.119:As much as I usually don't like survival games much, I enjoyed my time with Long Dark.The sandbox mode is what you can try now with story mode coming later.The atmosphere they achieved is pretty damn cool. At moment I genuinely felt desperation and loneliness of a single person left to die in northern woods.I'm intrigued to see what the story mode will be like.Although, for me, the game did suffered from the same thing all other survival sims do - walking in a deserted area for way too long. ""Walking sim"" fits here quite right, yep.There's as well pretty poor optimisation in place at the moment - fps is all over the place.And I feel like the ""costs"" of various actions should be adjusted a bit more (may be easy mode for people like me, please?) - sometimes they even feel unfair.So, if you like survival sims - this one is definitely to keep an eye on. If not for the sandbox, then may be for the story (they do have some incredible cast on board).More details in the video:

								A cool watercolor aesthetic and solid survival gameplay elements drew me to this game initially 2 years ago....along with the ever lingering ""COMING SOON"" text indicating to me and you that a story mode was on the way. I don't get how the devs have added absolutely nothing in that regard especially when they claim it's supposed to be a 5 episode/chapter long affair. It sucks that Steam only has a recommended or not recommended rating system because I'm 100% in the midde with this one. Unfortunately my review will have to be a negative one because I can't continue to support developers not backing up their promises. A fun sandbox mode that becomes a repetitive after your first 20 hours so I suggest getting this one on sale. I pray this game can still be fleshed out in a better and more detailed sense....this game has the potential to become one of the best survival games of all time.			"

								I'm afraid I cannot recommend this game. It's pretty fun for about 15 hours. After that, you run out of things to do. The environments are gorgeous, but the novelty of exploration wears off, especially because every building, vehicle and corpse contains the same items.Inventory management is extremely tedious, mainly because you have a carry limit. Often times you end up having to do ridiculous things like dumping 5 lbs of meat just to be able to wear/carry the new snow coat you found. It becomes really tiring to have to make those decisions every time you loot a cabinet.At the time of this writing, the game has been in Early Access for 2.5 years. Over the course of this timeframe, updates have become less and less frequent. The lack of a developer blog/diary is a big negative. Looking from the outside, the game feels as abandoned as the environments in it.			"

								How to Make Grizzly Adams WeepLike all well-designed games, the best gear in The Long Dark isn't looted, it's crafted. In a game where the weather is the biggest threat to survival, it makes good sense that animal hides will ultimately provide the best protection. It begins simply enough with rabbit skin mittens. Rabbits won't fight back or scar you mentally, despite what the Looney Tunes propaganda would have you believe. These require 4 pelts that have been cured by air drying indoors for 3 in-game days. This is followed by 5 hours of crafting time.Crafting progresses from there, the next obvious choice are deer skin pants and boots. The cure and crafting times are elevated and already you begin to see that planning ahead is a very real component for your survival. Once you have these 3 items you will notice much better protection from the elements and you are now prepared for the ultimate in survival fashion: the wolf skin jacket. You have to fell 4 wolves in order to have enough materials, and now your crafting time is up to 25 hours! With these 4 items equipped you feel pretty invulnerable to all but the most severe of weather, you have mastered your environment! Wait a minute, what's this? A schematic for a bear skin bedroll...Hunting bears with a bolt-action rifle with less than enough rounds to fill a six-shooter isn't going to be a walk in the park. But on top of the potential to survive outdoors during a blizzard there is an achievement for this. Never let it be said that achievement whoring is without it's merit!I spent a week frequenting areas where bears have been sighted in Mystery Lake (the beginner's map). I never saw or heard a bear, so I made some tough decisions regarding carry weight and made the long, dangerous trek to Pleasant Valley. The trip was relatively uneventful, exactly as I prefer it, aside from one accidental fight with my campfire which burned my left hand severely and reduced my health to 75% for days. I set up camp in a centrally-located farmhouse and intended to rest up and then begin gathering firewood, setting snares and generally preparing for a lengthy bear hunt.The next morning I go out to check the weather (no shrieking winds from indoors is always nice to wake up to) and lumbering directly towards me about 50 meters away was 300 pounds of black bear! I immediately crouch, line up a head shot, and have second thoughts wondering if I'll have time to get off a 2nd shot if the first one isn't enough to put him down. I relax my in-real-life breathing and hands, line up a perfect head shot... squeeze and immediately begin reloading when... the bear just drops. It was rather anti-climatic and I reckoned myself now a seasoned bear hunter. Hubris never hurt anyone right?The next day I could hear a bear far to my north or what I thought was north, I would need to confirm that at sunset. I had only been here less than a day and with no maps, compasses or moss on trees the only directional indicator is sunrise/set.The next day I woke up to such screeching sounds of wind I didn't even bother going outside to see for myself. The blizzard continued all through the next day as well. I was forced to risk a trip out to carve off more bear flesh, of which there was such a massive amount available it would ultimately begin to go moldy before I could consume it all.On day 3 I set out towards the direction the bear sounds had come from. It's no wonder I never saw a bear at Mystery Lake, they apparently all migrated here because in less than 2 hours I saw my second black bear on top of a ridge. I circled around to approach him from behind, the crouch is agonizingly slow but the only way to ensure you get the initiative. I shouldn't have been surprised when the bear pulled a Crazy Ivan, everyone knows all bears are originally indigenous to Russia. I repeated exactly what I'd done with bear number 1, squeezed and... the bear was charging right for me. I didn't realize TLD had a science fiction-y time slowing mechanic but I'm pretty sure I trigged one because it took about 4 times longer than normal to reload my rifle. The bear was so close when I fired my second shot I could only see his snout in my sights. He dropped and I only had to take a single shaky step forward to begin the long process of harvesting him.I now have the 2 required bear skins to make my fancy bedroll. I spent a couple days at a nearby barn before heading back to my farmhouse base of operations to check on the curing time of my first bear skin. I lost track but it was an incredible amount of time, more than a week. As I approached my base I couldn't believe what I saw: another black bear not 100 meters from where my first had been! Now a rational thought would be leave well enough alone, however another game mechanic sprung to mind the second I saw him: decay. All items decay and in the case of your crafted items they require like materials to repair. So felling a 3rd bear is just common sense, and I am quite the expert now.I repeat the process, crouch, line up so his travel is directly towards me. It was snowing at a good but not blizzard-like pace, so I allowed the bear to get a bit closer before squeezing the trigger. I immediately begin a reload this time, and good thing I did because once again it was going to take more than 1 shot. Damn, this bear is moving a little quicker and he was a little closer, this is going to be an epic last-second sho-- the bear is on me. He knocked the rifle out of my hands and pinned me to the ground. It was incredibly violent, the screen blurring and dimming at times, my body flung face-down into the snow at others. What was most disturbing was how long the assault went on for. I was certain when the screen began to fade that I was dying, which was partially true. Suddenly the bear lost interest for some reason and lumbered directly over my prone body. As soon as the game would let me I pulled myself into a crawling position and started making my way for the farm house only 25 meters away. Then I noticed my condition: I am bleeding out at an incredible rate, when I first checked my health was at 15% and now 30 seconds later it's at 9%. I pull up my medical supplies menu, quite thankful now I hadn't managed to talk myself out of devoting so much space to medical supplies, and had just enough to stop the bleedout and stabilize my condition.The devastation was real and not just medically. The bear shredded all of my animal skin gear, some of it as low as 25% condition and all of the protection ratings minimal. It took the better part of 2 weeks of hunting, curing, and crafting to get everything into the 80% range (whereas it had all been in the high 90s). I also managed to see why the bear had stopped mauling me: he bled out slightly faster than I did. I have nicknamed the Pleasant Valley Farmhouse location Bear Highway.So, no more hubris from this huntsman, I have learned my lesson very well. I'm not sure I'll hunt another black bear during this play through (where my goal now is 100 days of survival), instead I'll probably ask myself what would Grizzly Adams do? And then I won't do that either because none of these bears are interested in a relationship that doesn't end with you in their belly.			"

								On my first game I did the equivlent to Normal mode. I found tons of matches, tons of water, can openers, But no hatchet and no knife. As I goubled down my last can of peaches and downed another can of soda I ran outside. Only to be forced back into the house by the freezing winds threatening to freeze me solid. On a final dash of hope I bursted out the front door and ran towards a house sitting on the lake. I arrived freezing and the house was beginning to be circled by wolves. Worst of all... the ""house"" had no door... So i continued to freeze. I found a small piece of wood and started a fire in the furnace, huddling as close to the fire as I could in a desperate attempt to regain warmth. Using the time it burned to cook some food which I soon swallowed. I was tired, I was hungry, I was thirsty, and i was freezing... I had no wood, and wolves were surrounding me. I bolted out the door in a desperate attempt to reach the next cabin. I was mauled by a wolf on the way out, but was able to fight him back before he delt me the finishing blow. Now bleeding, I sprint to the next house, Three wolves in Tow, I pray the ice does not break... I reach the next building and quickly treat my wounds, my eyes never leave the door in fear the wolves may run in to finish the job. I then quickly search for some wood and only find a small piece. I throw it in the fire realizing I would have to make another dash the moment it extinguishes... The three wolves circle my small hut on the frozen lake... I was out of time...			"

								This is my edited review to commemorate the 1-year mark since The Long Dark (TLD) came out on early access. That's not to say that the game is neglected. Quite the opposite. In the year since the game first hit Steam Early Access there have been 49 major updates and hotfixes. That averages to nearly one update per week for a year. Hinterland (the devs) have done the opposite of abandoning TLD.The game is beautiful and immersive. The sounds are gorgeous and occasionally bone-chilling. The devs consistently look at what the players request while not doing anything that would compromise their artistic vision for a lovely game. They have said that they are working towards a thoughtful single player, story mode experience, and while TLD is still only available in sandbox alpha everything they do to the game appears to be moving towards that goal. You can die due to freezing, falling, failing to light a fire, wolf, bear, bear and then wolf, falling off a cliff while running from a wolf, falling through the ice, starving at your campfire, dehydration, exhaustion, food poisoning, dysentery, exhaustion or... you know, stuff and things. The game wont hold your hand and it's not a quick fix. And I love it. At almost 400 hours of of game time, I'm still not bored with the game.			"

								This game is hauntingly beautiful and harsh. In my first two hours I stumbled upon an abandoned dam, explored it, locked myself out of fire escape during a blizzard and nearly froze to death. I literally fell into a Coal mine which saved my life. Burning coal and scavenging supplies off a dead corpse I slowly recovered from Hypothermia. The next day I left the mine seeking food and was chased by a black bear. I found a rifle in an abandoned truck and managed to bring down a deer. The bear showed up again and I warded him off using a flare taken from the miner's corpse. I'm currently holed up in a farmstead on Day 5....^ None of that is scripted gameplay. It's a wonderful sandbox with just the right amount of pressure, not too stressful, but urgent at times. Some of the locations are downright spooky. Highly recommended.			"

								1st attempt at survival-Everything was going well. It was 2 days since the event, and I had collected some decent clothing, had a good supply of food, and sodas, and was surviving well. I had come across an abandoned dam, so I scavenged it for anything I might be able to use and decided to make it my ""base"" for a short time, to aquaint myself with the surroundings and get an idea of where I might go next. 2 days passed of me scouting the general area and my supplies ran low so I decided to head out, following a set of train tracks into the unknown. I came to a collapsed tunnel just as night descended so I built a fire with what scraps I had and decided to sleep for an hour or two. I had ran out of sodas at this point and hadn't realized that I could melt snow for hydration. My health had deteriorated quickly. I froze to death in my sleep.2nd attempt at survival-Day 4 since the event and I've figured out how to melt snow for a water source. I have food, water, and my clothes are in great shape. I delve into a cave and come out the other end to a forested hillside. There was a wolf right in the middle, and I thought ""I'll tangle with him, take his meat and hide, and be on my way"". We struggled briefly and I injured him, so he ran over a small ridge to get away, and I got up and gave chase. I get to the top of the ridge and look down the other side to see him running straight at me. I'm like ""You won't get away this time!"". He runs right past me, bleeding everywhere. A giant bear comes running up shortly after, chasing the wolf, then turns on me and chews my stomach to shreds. I already took a good hit from my fight with the wolf, but I managed to survive the bear attack with 6% condition. I roll over bleeding and coughing and manage to get to my feet, and by the time I stood up and attempted first aid, the last bit of life force had drained from me, and I headed straight for The Long Dark.TL;DRGreat game, would definitely recommend to anyone.

								I am in love.This is it. This is the game I've been looking for. And the best part, it isn't even complete yet.Let's get started.I've had this growing interest on survival games for quite a while now, and as such, I've been looking for survival games everywhere to try out, and not more than one or two have captivated me (I could name which, but doesn't feel right on a review of another game). The Long Dark gripped me in, and oh boy, did it grip me tight.The graphics are amazing, has a great feeling to it, and not too cartoonish, or too realistic. Very well polished.The soundtrack will keep you interested, and every sound will keep you on your toes, wondering if there's a wolf nearby, or a storm coming. Basically, death is on every corner.The design itself is just brilliant. I've had the chance to play about 6 sandbox games, and I decided to go in ""blind"", not reading anything or checking any maps. Survived 1h56mins the first time, and about 2h10mins the second time. Needless to say, wolves got me (and of those hours, one might have been sleeping!). I then decided to get some brains, and see how I could counter those wolves. Great success, stayed alive for 6hours! Until a storm killed me. From there on, I survived for days, being my current record nearly 8 days. I admit I could easily survive for a bit longer, by being smart and stashing ""useless"" stuff on a cabin locker, but I'm a hoarder! (all of the playthroughs were on medium difficulty, I can't even imagine the hard one!)I do have one suggestion, there should be a two player co-op mode, that would be amazing, for when you don't want to feel as lonely. Or else I'll just keep going (Hans) Solo, and immerse myself into this AMAZINGLY brutal and harsh game, that will leach the life out of me. Over and over again.TL;DR - I love this game. I recommend this game. You will love this game.PS. Wolves have a soft spot for me, and always seem to find me at the ""right"" time.This is it. This is the game. I am in love.			"

Early Access Review
								The Long Dark is a great game. With many hours in the game, I can tell it is very immersive. One day it might be snowing and you have to stay inside or you'll die from hypothermia, the next day you can't go outside because of the wolves camping your door and impossible to leave because of it. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in playing Solo Survival games as this is a great game. It has a lot of positives and negatives. Overall, you should give it a try as it really gets you into the game, I frustrate when I can't go outside and am running out of food.-PROS:--Very Realistic--Graphics are great--Not very demanding graphics--Being in alpha not many bugs--Great open world in which almost everything is interactable--Realistic in which you find frozen bodies etc--Controls are easy--Different difficulties for different players-CONS:--No single player implemented yet--The energy/food/thirst seems non-realistic as it drains everything way too fast (Might be me since I always have overexcess in inventory but it seems like it is drained way too quick)I can't think of any more cons as of now, but there are definitely more out there just as there are more pros but I can't think of any as of now. Anyhow, the game is great for its price, has great content which you can have many different outcomes and everytime is just as enjoyable as the first time. Would definitely recommend. "

								I got this today for review for croatian gaming portal and couldn't wait to lay my hands on it.So after a few tries, some ups and downs and one unpleasant Fluffy encounter, I decided to share my thoughts. :)First of all, unlike all those boring zombie survivals, this concept is excellent. From graphics, atmosphere, music... And it will just get better since it's early alpha. My first Early Access game that I bought was Starpoint Gemini 2. And I'm thankful for it cause the devs were, and still are, so active and friendly to the community that they actually showed everyone what Early Access is all about. It seems devs are reading these forums too, and I'm glad for it. Things I'm missing at the moment is map (Ihave that awesome guide someone posted along with the map and it really helped me), but I know map will come laters. I had NONE crashes and NONE performance issues whatsoever. The game is, at least for me, perfectly stable and smooth. Good work on that considering it's still alpha. Highly recommended and I can't wait for future updates and features! :) Graphics:  ★★★★☆ Sound:  ★★★★☆ Gameplay:  ★★★★☆ Potential: (EA) ★★★★★   Overall:  ★★★★☆ "

Early Access Review
								This is a revamped review of The Long Dark.Like my Darkest Dungeon review, most early access games will either remain unpolished or the state of the game will become less shape than before.The Long Dark however is a different story, It's one of those early access games. That patches as you go along, while also providing the developers feedback along the way both good and bad. While there is no story mode, Sandbox mode provides you a glimpse as to what you will be experiencing within story mode once it's released.You can see just how ""hardcore"" the game is. This is in a sense a true Hardcore Surivial game. Sure people can play it on easy, but where is the fun in that? For the true Long Dark experience play on medium or hard. And you can see why The Long Dark remains a very highly postive game. All you have is your senses and wit as you surive the candian wilderness. There is no compass, no GPS, no fast travel, no general store to trade. Just you and mother nature. And your instinct to survive The artistic visuals in the game is amazing and detailed. Plus a very active translation steam workshop community in order to get the game out to other steam players who want to play this game but within their own native language. Hopefully, we will see somewhere down the line with more mods besides translations. Also like with the Darkes Dungeon it's a trial by error experience, you learn as you fail and vice versa. You need to be a critcal thinker and plan ahead in a game like this. Because if you don't, you will most likely die by the hands of nature. Or become deperived of food and drink supplies which by the way are randomly generated throughout the three maps. So don't expect each map to have the same stuff in the same location. You are also randomly teleported to a part of the map, while the terrain will remain the same, everything else will be different.There are two issues that i have with the game. The first issue is it's ""struggle"" mechanic. Maybe change it to tapping a particular key, instead of relying on the mouse button.How it goes, it goes like this....RMB (It could be LMB) is to charge upLMB (It could be RMB) to attackSure you could have weapons to give you an edge, but it won't do any much good. Use your brain power, rather than your weapons, this isn't Skyrim kiddies.The other issue is the lack of 'saves' now this question has been asked plenty of times and it is being considered. This game goes on the bases of Dragon's Dogma. Where it's one save per character, but it doesn't run like a typical Fallout or Elder Scroll game or just about any game with a mutiple save option. One save for everything basically, which sucks but that's the whole point of Hardcore survival you need to heavily rely on taking the game slowly and don't treat it like a typical RPG game.Lastly, The game doesn't hold your hand as well. So don't expect a tutorial. The Sandbox in every sense. IS the tutorial, since story mode isn't out yet. So pay close attention to your surroundings and you will be fine. Another thing is that the steam community has been very supportive in giving the tools you need to survive. Just hit up the guide section if your lost, because i can seriously tell you. You will need those guides.I recommend this game if you love a true Hardcore Survival Experience.			"

Early Access Review
The Long, Long, Long, Very Long Dark.OverviewThe Long Dark is single-handedly one of the best games I've ever played. Even in its Early Access state, it never fails to impress on the level of entertainment it provides. And boy, does it provide a lot of it.But like all great games, it's not without its flaws. Very few of them, but they are there.The PositivesCan I just say ""everything""? No? Okay.1) Never had I played a game that awakened the empathetic man in me. When my character is cold, I feel freezing, even in the summer. As soon as he starts shivering, my toes go numb. When he yawns, my eyes go heavy. When he makes a fire, I suddenly want to cook s'mores. When a wolf bites him, it's biting me. I can feel the pain. I can feel the desperation of searching for that next pit stop in search of canned peaches. I connect so well with the protagonist that I fear for his life, for it's not only his, but ours I must save. When he's in danger, I want to protect him, and his ultimate demise fills me with dread. Rarely does a game make me feel this way, so... f***ing kudos, Hinterland.2) The graphics are unlike any I've ever seen. They resemble colorful construction paper, pasted on a vibrant charcoal background. The uniqueness of it provides a sense of overall joy. It feels real, and yet, doesn't. A very surreal take.3) The uncomplicated utilities menu, encumberance system, and status screen. I seriously hit tab constantly, even when I don't need to.4) Commander Shepard.5) The entire world map is expansive and daunting. Just when I think I'm about to pass out and die, I come across a cave, or hidden cabin. Again that feeling of hope and excitement when I actually find an abandoned house is unsurpassed.6) Commander Shepard.7) Random item placements to give an even bigger boost to survival for when you start a new game. There's no memorizing this one, folks. You're on your own.8) Did I mention Commander Shepard?9) Hunting and harvesting. Skill-ups in particular things, like stiching and making fire. I love the feeling of improvement and progression, and I think they nailed it.The Negatives1) Unfortunately, I have to address that this game has been out for, I think, years now? There's still no story mode, and I have no idea when it's going to be released. The sandbox is entertaining for a little while, and you'll be testing yourself to push it to the limit every time, but a story really would be great for a game like this. Especially when it comes to playing two separate roles.2) How I want to feel when a wolf comes near me:

Don't let me look, don't let me look-- OH GOD I LOOKED!Seriously though, when it comes to the wolf attacks-- which make up for about 98% of my deaths-- some of them are just plain ridiculous. I once found a wolf inside of a building. Yes, THE WOLF WAS CAMPING INSIDE OF A BUILDING. How did it get in? I have no idea. No shattered windows, all doors closed. It's a mystery. I could have made it that one time, if not for a f***ing wolf hiding in a building.Without wolf attacks, I seem to do just fine, really. I'm on my fifth game or so, and I've decided to wuss out and play it on Pilgrim. So far I've lived for over five days. It's still some pretty tough stuff, and still pretty threatening. Just in different ways. I almost died of hypothermia one night.ConclusionsThis game is awesome, and I definitely want to see more of it. I can't wait to play more. It's become almost a nightly ritual to huddle up at my computer, curl up in a blanket, listen to the sound of a looping crackling campfire and play The Long Dark!			"

								At first I thought another survival game?  More zombies and mutants?  Well along comes The Long Dark and with a sense of relief I see that this survival game will not have zombies, mutants, and will acutally have a plausible story as a backdrop.  Add in the unique visuals, environment, characters, and challenge presented to you and I really think this game has the potential to be one of the top survival games (PC) for 2015.   I really like seeing the interaction from the developers in the forums and I am reassured by their many years of AAA experience that they will/can deliver.Here is my ""1st impressions"" video where I share some of my thoughts regarding ""The Long Dark.""   Really looking forward to seeing this game progress and especially looking forward to the Story Mode.

Early Access Review
								TL;DR at the bottom-I don't even know where to begin with this game.I'd heard about it a while back and I saw it, thought it looked kinda interesting, and then never bothered picking it up. My friend recently gifted it to me and if I could I would have been willing to spend up to $45 or so for the experience this game tosses at you. The only thing I can say now is that I regret not picking it up sooner. It just hits me in such a way that I can't explain. Everytime I'm walking slowly down a road and there's nothing but cars to the side and burnt houses around, and that ♥♥♥♥ing guitar picks up I just get so into it and feel like I'm actually a survivor.The Long Dark is a gem among early access games and deserves so much attention. I knew this as soon as I'd put in a good hour. Let me start off by saying that the immersion that this game delivers is phenomenal. It has a great tone and world design to be used for story telling. While the game offers no tutorial and this can be a positive or negative thing, I personally loved it. All it did was make me genuinely want to learn about the game and the world itself more, and as I did, I felt myself get better at it and feel more confident about surviving. The longest time I've survived so far on a character is 30 days counting and there's been numerous points throughout that timespan in which I thought I was going to die and got anxious doing something because I genuinely felt like I was the person wandering through the world. Each time I spotted a bear in the distance or a pack of wolves, I felt like they were a genuine threat and therefore considered my options. Do I try to sneak around them? Do I head in the opposite direction? Do I have ammo or a weapon to fend them off just in case? This doesn't even just count with the wildlife but the environment as well which I cannot stress just how important in a survival game. Every time I saw a side road leading off of the main highway I seriously considered my options. Did I have enough food and water with me in case it's a dead end? Do I have enough daylight left to make it back to the main road if there's nothing down this way? Will I have enough firewood and tinder to create a fire if need be? When I would be staying in a cabin for the day due to a blizzard, I would genuinely consider my options then as well and think to myself if I had enough food to survive the night before I would be able to scavenge for more supplies? The game pushes you to think about these options in a way that I've never felt another survival game do before.The game does an incredible job at atmosphere and aesthetic and is downright GORGEOUS from every early sunrise and darkening sunset to each howling blizzard or each bright sunny day. The more you're willing to immerse yourself into believing you're truly surviving in the world, the better job it does at delivering a truly special experience. There was a point in which I'd found a safe and when I was trying to crack the code, I actually leaned in on my monitor as though I'd be able to hear the clicks better without realizing it. When there's a blizzard in the game and all you can hear is lonesome ambient guitar music playing and the wind howling in you ear, you feel genuinely alone and feel cold. When you enter a cabin and all you can hear is the wind beating against the house and the creaks of wood echoing, it creates a sense of fear and paranoia because you know that there were people who are probably long dead that used to live here. When you’re walking through a cave and all you can hear is the vast echoes of your footsteps against stone and the hiss of your flare, you feel genuinely cautious.The fact that the game is able to pull this off is absolutely stunning. And above all, you genuinely feel like you're a survivor in this new world. You begin to grow attached to your character and genuinely care for them and begin to wonder if you can truly survive the wilderness. The game does an excellent job at small little stories you can pick up on when you're not expecting it. For example you can find a cave in which there's a small campfire with food beside it, or you can be walking through the woods and find a frozen corpse of a man with an axe next to a deer corpse, insisting he died of hypothermia while trying to get food. It's all of these little things that come together that truly help create an enjoyable experience and make me want to get out there and explore the world in front of me. When you walk through a town you begin to really have thoughts of, ""I wonder what happened to the people that lived here. I wonder what the story of the people who made it out is"" and it's like that for nearly every place.The only two downsides to this game for me at least are there's been few bugs in which I would climb a rock and randomly sprain my ankles or wrists for no reason and it's pretty immersion breaking. And secondly, there's no randomly generated maps and all loot spawns are always the same regardless of if you were to make a new character or not. If they were to add randomly generated loot and maps, I could play this game for literal hundreds of hours not to say I already plan to, but it would definitely help with the game in the long run and keep me coming back to it.In short, this game is truly something special for the person that wants to immerse themselves in a world where they feel like they're truly a survivor in the wilderness with nothing but their own decisions on what's best to help you survive the long dark.TL;DRPros-Breathtakingly beautifulIncredible sound designIs a true to it's roots ""you versus the wilderness"" gameDownright one of the most immersive games I've ever playedDecent amount of replayability with new characters you can create and difficulties to choose fromDevs actually seem to care about this gameDependent on you-No tutorialPretty unforgiving, if you die it's over even if you survived over 100 daysCons-No story mode as of this review, only sandbox (though one is supposed to be added later)Few immersion breaking bugs such as randomly breaking ankles and wrists for no apparent reason "

Early Access Review
								There are things that I like about this game, like the beautiful scenery and the brutally hash winter conditions, that feels very realistic for me, living in northern Sweden, where winter is hell on Earth and life is difficult enough even during the summer. I also appreciate the extreme difficulty the game offers and have spent some 60+ hours playing it. However, as much as I like some aspects of the game, I feel that this game is far from being finished (after 2 years in  EA!) as there is little or no point to playing it. After a few weeks of surviving it becomes boring and repetitive. You will soon get tired of just surviving without some higher goal to aim for.Something that I especially hate about this game is the extremly unrealistic behaivor of wolfs and the constant need to kill these fine animals because they act much more like mindless zombies or rabid dogs than like real wolfs. I think this is an unjustified shortcut for the developers to bring some kind of action to this game. I would much have prefered stray gangs of cannibals, or even zombies, since it would be much more realistic, and I don't even like zombies very much... To be attacked by one stray rabid dog after another even when I try my best to avoid them, often three dogs in a row, all with the same outcome - my cloths getting worn out and the dog dies - it is irritating and not much fun at all. And it happens over and over again, no matter how many you kill. This irritated me to the point when I finally decided to delete all saved games and completely uninstalled the product. It is a pity for an otherwise well made game product that the developers have made this in my mind bad design choice, probably only due to lack of action in the game. I saw a documentary once, about a guy who made a documentary film about wolfs and he spent 3 months without ever even seeing a wolf. Finally he got to film one wolf, but only far off in the distance. That is how rare wolfs are today and they will do anything they can to stay far away from humans.  This animal has been driven to the brink of extinction by the rentless and often cruel hunting and it is very sad to see a game in which the game play promotes the hunting and killing of wolfs at the same time as it is sold as a "" realistic simluation"". This feels totally obnoxious and breaks the suspence of disbelief that is so important to a good game.In summary, this is a game, not a simulation, that is in part very realistic and at the same time in some ways totally unrealistic. It is fun in the beginning, but becomes boring after a while, since there is little to do except surviving. Once you have explored the maps, it all is the same each time you play. Nothing much to craft either. The end game is when your cloths wear out and/or your tools break down, and then you die. That's it. A pity, since I feel that this game could be so much more. I would NOT recommend this game in its current state and I hope that it will be reworked and improved since it is still in EA. "

								When I first purchased this game I had fairly high expectations, I had seen some gameplay, and thought that the game was worth the £8 that I spent on it (dont ask from where). From the second I opened the game untill the second I died at 2 days (:P) I was ASTONISHED at how this game could be thought of as in its ""Alpha"" testing, as it has far better graphics and is far more developed than many highend, fully released titles on the steam market.A couple of months ago I wasted £10.99 on The Forest and when I purchased The Long Dark, I was expecting the same. Well, I was expecting wrong. Although The Forest has had several updates since being released and The Long Dark has had, well..... none, it is amazing how that game can be so good, Im Hooked. :P			"

								An absolutely outstanding and true-to-life survival experience. Few other games share the superb atmosphere, realistic weather, gorgeous art style and the feeling of your survival being down to you alone. This game really makes you feel like you are in the moment. The setting is perfect. Both the danger and beauty of nature is fully realised thanks to glorious sound design and a lovely painting-like graphics, allowing you to appreciate both the majesty and harshness around you. Your character, barely holding their constitution together as an evening blizzard begins to tear away at their homeostasis, faces a truly overlooked factor in most survival games: the elements. If you want the most real-feeling survival experience out there, I can't recommend this enough. This is Early Access done right. The Canadian wild commands respect, which you will learn first hand.

Early Access Review
								The Long Dark is a magnificent game, but beyond that, it's an engaging and fulfilling experience. You can put yourself in a frantic push for every minute of survival, or just soak in the aesthetic of the Canadian wilderness.  Each iteration plays and feels different, and the rogue-like style of death makes every decision matter.  The gameplay is exhilarating, the visual style gorgeous, and with regular updates from the good folks of Hinterland Studios, you can't go wrong.  I've enjoyed every minute I've put into this title and look forward to spending many more.  That said, this game isn't perfect.  A range of possible strategies for long term survival exists, but use of the rifle so thoroughly outclasses everything else that gameplay tends to revolve around it.  But this game is still in Early Access and the developers are quite active, so quite a bit can be changed and honed.The best part of this game though, and the reason I play, is that infinite survival is impossible.  That may seem a strange statement, and I know some people would love to see the game changed on that point, but hear me out.  Every time you begin, you know you will die.  There is nothing that can be done about that impermanence, about death.  Now, you can choose to curl into a ball, to let life pass you by, or you can choose to live, to fight, to find beauty in the harsh landscape and nobility in yourself.  I've never played with mechanics that so powerfully counterbalanced realistic nihilism with idealistic determination, and so I congratulate Hinterland on their work.  That got a little philosophically dramatic, but I stand by it.  Overall, I deeply enjoy this game and look forward to watching its progression, and offer my sincerest recommendation to potential buyers.			"

								Was out exploring. It was turning dark. Had no choice but to make a simple camp fire and sleeping bag. I heard howls throughout the night, and an occasional growl. I had to ration my sleep as the fire was going out as fast as i was looking for wood. It was getting quite creepy as the howls seemed closer every time. the break of daylight kicked in and i was freezing my♥♥♥♥♥off. I got up and i was surrounded by three wolves. My flare worked for a little bit but it didnt last long. I ran. I ran as fast as I could. I quickly got in a car I saw. That was the the best thing to happen. I had ammo for a rifle but no rifle to use. There happened to be a rifle in the backseat. I loaded it and prepared for a fight. I had 4 bullets. I got out at the best time to do so. I quickly shot one before the other two ran at me. I managed to get a shot on one of the wolves. The first two were dead. I didnt have time to shoot the next. I knew I had to fight it with my hatchet. It pounced me. I kept swinging. I managed to kill it. Somehow I did it. I bandaged myself up and limped my way to home as my leg wasnt in the best condition. I somehow survived the long dark... atleast for now.			"

								In the frozen wasteland of the formerly prosperous country of Canada, you alone must survive The Long Dark. This winter seems endless, so it's not a matter of if you survive it; it's a matter of how long. The Long Dark is a game developed and published by Hinterland Studio, focusing primarily on surviving in Canada after a climate disaster. Right now it's in early access and the story mode isn't complete, but its sandbox mode gives more than enough to talk about.The objective of the game is simple: you're abandoned out in the middle of nowhere in a random location and you must find a way to survive. The world is freezing and you must find food, shelter, water and keep yourself going for as long as you possibly can. While this sounds pretty straightforward, it isn't because there are plenty of factors in the game that can kill you and if you're unfamiliar with the game, and when starting out you're going to have a bad time.Full Preview[www.noobfeed.com] "

								The Long Dark, so far, is an amazing survival game. Survival games have been all about zombies or similar creatures, never the pure realistic struggle against nature. That's where The Long Dark comes in. It's not a friendly game despite it's soft art style, you will starve to death, freeze to death or die to exhaustion (not to mention wolves). It uses this kind of cell shading graphics yet it impresses for how much it feels real. The sense of clinging to life is always present when you constantly find new places, train tracks, trailers, a dam, makes you hold on to hope, for a better day tomorrow. It may sound easy, but believe me - it's not. There are a lot of different ways of dying and you never know what will kill you this time, so the game itself makes you feel nervous			"

I'm not normally a fan of these types of survival games, but this game grabbed my attention from the moment I saw the amazing landscape for the first time right upto my ultimate demise. On my 1st playthrough I managed to survive about 10 mins before being ravaged by a wolf. My 2nd playthrough and I stumbled across an abandoned cottage finding supplies and a gun, which saved my life later on in the game. This game is superb, it has all the elements I expect from this type of game.... tension, fear, the not knowing, living off the land, fighting for survival. You get the idea. Some of the games mechanics are not yet finished, and they do explain this in the game, but for an early access title I was very impressed. I'll be keeping my eye on this one for full release.			"

								I have to admit I was a little weary playing this game. It was difficult and I found it really hard to get a footing or control of the situation. Then I realized, that's the whole point! It's supposed to be difficult you crash landed in the middle of nowhere...so it seems. I encourage you to not let this game go! Trudge through the ""dying all the time"" stage and be patient trust me you will have a very fun survival experience.			"

								Excellent atmosphere.  Captures the sense of being isolated and vulnerable better than any other sandbox survival games I've played. There is a constant feeling of danger, as a wild predator or sudden blizzard could strike at any moment, especially on the higher difficulties.  The multiple regions give you a variety of environments to explore, and doing so feels very rewarding. (the first time, anyway)Unfortunately, once you've explored all the regions, the game is just a micromanagement simulator.  Cold, fatigue, water, and calories constantly needing replenished.  The game does get breathless after you've traveled the world and learned the mechanics.  Also I noticed some of the audio files have a distracting white noise in the background, minor detail but detracting nonetheless. All in all, I got more than my money's worth.  Very solid for early access indie game.			"

								Imagine you leave your safe and warm hideout in search for more food and other supplies. You stride along old railtracks through the numbing cold towards the unknown. There will be a point when you have to decide to either return and just narrowly make it back alive, or you might decide to continue, and just hope for the best.I chose to continue, and I walked, until it became dark and cold. I tried to make a fire, but it only lasted an hour, I was really tired and decided to make another fire with the last resources I had on me, just to warm up and sleep for 2 more hours.I never woke up again.

								One of the few Early Access titles that I'm happy with.Updates are frequent and carry a lot of great content, it feels like the game will be quite polished when released. As to the title itself - I don't think I've played a game that had such great atmosphere. It's a bit unique, it feels like you're writing your own adventure in the sandbox mode even though there's a story mode planned in development.I definitely got my money's worth out of it already and I can see much more cold gaming evenings in the future with this one. :-)Highly recommended for all the survival genre fans but not only those. There's something great about this game that I can't quite put into writing that makes me come back to it now and then and I enjoy it every single time.			"

								This has been my most enjoyable survival game for awhile. I love every aspect of it. I have had the  unfortune of being lost in the bush in a snow storm in real life when i was a kid. Its true, when you try to walk in a blinding snow storm, you just walk in a circle.In real life, the snow stopped and i was able to find the direction in witch i needed to travel. After 140 days in game however, near Timberwolf mountian i was was on an expedition trying to find all the steel crates when it started to storm. I had done this many times and was always able to find my way back home and i always came prepared.This time however, i foregot one important item, my bear skin sleeping bag.It stormed for three straight days and nights untill all my wood was gone and my fire went out forcing me to try and find my way home in the blizz. Well, i died. The moral of this story is, that i only screwed up ONCE . God i thought i knew that area like the back of my bag.			"

								Started the Sandbox Alpha. Pitch black. Wolf growls. Die of blood loss at 18 in-game minutes. 10/10---I am a Kickstarter backer and active video maker for the game and this Sandbox Alpha is something you rarely see. You get attached to every playthrough and want to live, explore and survive as long as you can. Dying is unforgiving and it will make you annoyed but you will start again and not get bored because the game wants you to try again and survive. The key point here is how long you survive, not do you survive, because you will die no matter what. Bugs get fixed, new features get added, bugs get fixed again and you just keep on trying to survive. The art is magnificent, the sound is magnificent and recently, the loading times are magnificent as well. The harvesting mechanic will need more work as it is a bit unrealistic(you harvest the same amount of cloth/leather no matter the item condition). Repairing works relatively great so far.The UI got a very sleek update and you can choose between a male and female voice in the Sandbox, both being the leading male and female voice actors from Mass Effect.Good game, good devs. Alan's cave sucks.

								I remember the first time i was in the Dam, i was walking around minding my own business as all out the sudden this wolf comes runing towards me so i grab a flare and throw that thing right in his face... He runs away and im like ""god damit, well atleast im save now"" So i kept looting untill i saw the way downstairs, so i go down there its pretty dark so i turn on my lantern and as you know it makes 2 short sparks befor igniting and within that first spark i see that little ♥♥♥♥er standing right infront of me, i grab my gun of course no light so i just fire in the darkness, i have my volume turnd up to make the environment more aggressive and as you know you have that beeping sound in your ears when you shoot inside so to get that straight i cant see my ears hurt and i have a little♥♥♥♥♥♥in my pants than the wolf jumps on to me and kills me. 11/10 but i recommend everyone who want to buy this game to set a pair of fresh underwear next to them.

								The Long Dark is a sandbox survival game if you don't know already but it isn't like the others, there are no zombies or mutated creatures you have to look out for and there are no full out automatic weapon action sequences nor is there really any action game features for the most part. But that is what makes this game amazing and unique. Nature is your enemy. This game does a damn good job at nature being your enemy. And it does it whilst making it fun and interesting. Striving for a (for the most part) realistic wilderness survival experience, it suceeds.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It does so all with a beautiful, breathtaking soundtrack and stunning and simplistic visuals.I highly recommend this game to anyone really.Upon starting the game up I knew I was going to love it. And oh boy do I love it.			"

								This is one of the best survival games I've ever played.  I was apprehensive about it at first because of the cartoon graphics, but after only about 15 or 20 minutes of play, I was hooked.  Anyone who liked The Road by Cormac McCarthy will totally groove on this game.  The best thing about it is that it's well balanced and believeable; meaning that if you do something stupid, you die, but if you are careful, you can survive for quite a long time.  Much like I'd imagine a real life apocalyptic survival situation to be.  The crafting isn't extremely difficult, but not easy or guaranteed when you get what you need to do it.  Another plus is that it isn't glitchy, like a lot of other early access games.  The controls are intuitive and follow industry standards, so you don't need to spend any time going through some boring tutorial.  In short, if you are looking for a survival game that you can get into quickly, presents a real, but achieveable challenge and never crashes, well this is it.			"

Early Access Review
								Man,I really like this game a lot. I know it's still in Early Access, and there will be a lot of changes still upcoming (the story mode is the one I am most looking to personally), but the game in its current state is still absolutely a ton of fun. You basically crash land in an Arctic area, that was previously inhabited but now abandoned (I expect the reasons for this will be revealed through the story mode). You are woefully unprepared for the weather conditions and have to find better clothing, equipment, food, and water in order to survive another day...and more days beyond that. The environment is reasonably vast. You can definitely explore all the areas the game has to offer, but since you also have to manage your food, sleep, water, and so on...it will take a while or many playthroughs to do so.The character management is pretty simple and yet clever. You basically monitor your calorie count, which indicates your need for food, your dehydration levels (need for water), your restfulness (as in, you will have to sleep sometime), and your body temperature. All factor in fairly equally as far as your survivability goes. You can find places to rest and recover, can find gear such as can openers, hatchets, etc...to increase your odds. You can also obviously find food (in various state of freshness....the worse condition your food is in, the more likely it is that you will get sick if you eat it). There is medicine to be found, and even some weapons (hatchet, knife, hunting rifle, flares), that will be necessary, as there are also wolves that view you as a tasty morsel, lol. Additionally, there is a pretty intuitive crafting system in the game which allows you to break down, repair, or create items. This becomes very important as the days progress.So, that just scratches the surface of what this game has to offer. You are fighting hunger, the cold, wolves, dehydration, and weariness in order to survive from one day to the next. The decisions you make will impact how long you survive each day and are very meaningful. Even the most mundane act can have real repercussions. The game does offer an easy mode so you can get the hang of things before going for full survival. Easy mode features more resources and you can turn off the wolves hostility as well (so they just run away from you instead). It's not a bad way to get your feelers out in this game. However, the game really shines as it is intended...resource management and survival.I very much recommend this game, even in its early access state. By far my favorite game in the genre presently, with a lot more potential to come on top of what is already provided.9 out of 10.			"

Early Access Review
								I have utter mixed feelings about this game so let me go across certain things.PROS:-This is a unique game with a lot of intelligence used.-This game is exactly what it is described as ""a winter survival""-Promising map and story mode to be released-Semi random spawns for gear and player-Tough gameplay-I am sure there is a lot more but its all your opinionCONS: (This does not mean don't buy it because it is a great game and with the financial support hopefully will become even better!-No random spawns for bodies containers etc...-Small map size and yes I managed to climb a hill and find the edge. Made me tear a little.-Durability of cloths, weapons, tools are unbeleivably poor. I'm talking the crowbar from walmart? This is that crowbar after being used to pry open vualts, broke, then reforged with alluminum repair only to be sold at a pawn shop for a dollar. I have  yet to break a crowbar and I think you could open every locker in a school before it gets remotely worn out.-Drink and food survival is off a bit, typically its 3 days no water 3 weeks no food but on this its like a day no water and 4 no food. Don't get me wrong we need the challenge but killing people off after six days of survival is nuts. Just because people survive longer doesn't make the challenge of doing better than others go away.-Food posioning. Wow. I have never experienced food posioning before in rl thank goodness but the food posioning on here is crazzzzzy. I have about 30lbs of deer meat in my garage refrig and I cook it and eat it a lot. On here in one life I suffered from food posioning 7 times. 1 from a soda? 5 from cooked deer and once from cooked wolf. I understand it's a problem in real life but I think making it that bad is a little crazy...-Sleep cycle is just crazy, you will understand-I'm sure theres more of these too but due to a recent accident of nearly cutting my thumb off I am getting tired of one hand typing...My recommendations:-You are releasing a new map so if the progress keeps up I imagine map size won't dissapoint me.-Randomize spawns for containers and frozen bodies-Get rid of durability on metal tools that makes no sense on breakage ex. can opener, crowbar, hunting knife, and maybe make the hatchet a little less♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean I cut wood on my tree farm couple times a year before winter with a axe and have only replaced it once every couple of years with maybe like 1 fix of the head for every 200 peices of firewood? Or you could increase the number of wood you gain?-Make the game real life experience. 3 days water 3 weeks food. This means yes you get dehydrated before 3 days and yes you begin to get frail increasing fatigue and impossibility of working on certain projects. Ultimately leading to bedrest if not prevnted. If I was dying of thirst in this game and actually lasted 2 days longer than when it began while laying on my bed I wouldn't be upset. Same with food.If you want illnesses to prevent easy survival then dull your current illnesses percentages to the %'s in real life and add things like you can't eat too much in one sitting or you will throw up or gain fatigue, same with water but different effects. Just extra research would make this mechanic much more survival like.-Sleep... I sleep for about 6 hours everyday and can last till night which is pretty good since 8 is recommended. I understand trekking through snow is tough and wastes energy but why is it that I can go to a bed sleep 8 hours and my exhaustion/fatigue is still not close to the minimum? I might understand if you are suffering from sleep deprivation and need to sleep longer to recover but most time I oversleep it has the same effects on me as if I undersleep. Also maybe add a slight like 1% chance to have a power nap? And make it so when your sleep is at the minimum its hard to get more sleep? Finally my last point and something I am actually not familiar with. Temperature in Canada. Is this literally winter? Can you survive in to spring? By a quick look on environmental sites posted I found that the temps this game show are way out of wack. Also Are blizzards this common? Don't know these answeres but I am hoping that this can be explained by a climate shift due to the nuclear strikes or whatever?Overall this game is fantastic for the stage it's in with an even more promising future. I understand that I nailed a lot of my dislikes and did not capitalize on the fun it has brought me but I only am doing that for a possibility of helping the future progression. I also understand this was not easy to create and my ideas may be too much time to put forth the effort again only suggestions.Get this game, play it when you aren't mad about it. Enjoy the tough survival aspect and show up all of your friends! Hope my review helps and please comment with what you think about it or the game. I would love to have some conversations!Update:Also in response to a new review up there on the charts. (Stormrhodos). This guy is only complaining because he once again did not follow what this game is about. Intelligence. Tinder can be found easily by newpaper and warming up is easy if you just sleep for around an hour or two inside. Also foraging for wood and freezing? Forage on a warm day and in a shelter to protect from wind. Better yet forage inside! You know that furniture you complain you cant break and use? That's reclaimed wood baby and thats exactly what you get from foraging inside! Oh and rifle is rare? Its 100% spawn rate in homestead which if you were intelligent while playing you would notice. This game has a lot of secrets and once again if you use your brain while playing you will find them out and probably have a pretty successful run. If you would do it in real life then think about it in the game chances are its smarter than the other option. Don't let these reviews fool you because this game is great! Just know it's still early access.			"

								Excellent, exciting game that will push towards the edge of survival, your first life will consist of you blindly navigating the light uninhabited national park in the Canadian wilderness blindly. with nothing but a box of matches, first aid supplies, and the chloths on your back. you must trek this land, finding remnants of human civilization and clench the limited items you find for just to survive another day of life. pushing you to decide life and death decisions, do you stay in a cabin you found and face starvation, or hike through a blood freezing blizzard hoping to find something, anything edible. Although you will find nothing but the frozen bodies of other human beings, you are not alone, the howls of wolves, just as hungry and desperate as you are will send chills down you spine as they see you as prey   As of alpha v128 there is only one map, and once you know where all the locations are at via the railroad tracks surviving becomes much easier, looking forward to the possibility of a new map that is complete wilderness and be able to craft things living off the land, and crafting in general, and maybe start with nothing but a Hatchet, then it'll be the game equivalent to a book by Gary Paulson, plane crash and all!!!

								I've never really written a review before, but I feel that this game deserves it.No other Survival Game I have played, has ever truly felt like a survival game.More of a ""Eat-Drink-And try not to die"" game.Because of the perma-death mechanic, and the dangers present within the game.It feels so much more satisfying to be successful within this game.Don't get my wrong, I'm not a die-hard survival fan, who wants to have the most gruelling experience possible.It's simply that everything seems far more impactful than in most games.The weather is truly a hazzard, the wildlife can kill you, the landscape can kill you, having too little supplies or burdening yourself with too much.. can kill you.All of this seems quite intimidating, but if you give this game a chance you could be in for one of the most rewarding games you will ever play.This game is in early alpha, I have only experienced a few minor graphical bugs during gameplay. And I already have sunk many hours into this game. The future game features seem very intriguing, I look forward to what this game will become in the future.			"

What is The Long Dark?The Long Dark is first-person open world exploration-survival game that occurs in the canadian wilderness after a global disaster.Your job is to survive as long as you can by gathering food and drink that you can find in the various cabins and huts scattered around the map. What am I surviving from?Nature and all its threats (What threats? -> Animals such as wolves & bears, and the most natural threat of them... the cold)Is there a crafting system?There is a crafting system, but as of now its quite simplistic.To craft items you'll have to find a workbench. (Some location spoilers: Trapper's Homestead, Camp Office, Carter Hydro Dam, Forestry Lookout (Mystery Lake) - The Fishing Camp, Quonset Gas Station, (Coastal Highway) - Pleasant Valley Farmstead (Pleasant Valley)) Workbenches are used to craft clothing, weapons and first aid, items such as coats, a bow, arrows, mittens, etc.Cooking systemTo cook, you must start a fire either outside or inside cabins/huts at stoves.You can also melt snow to water and boil it.First aidThis is needed when you have food poisoning or a wolf/bear has attacked you and caused injuries.To use first aid you'll have to press tab (default button) and click the medical kit in the selection menu that will open.Afterwards you can choose which injury you would like to treat first.Fatigue and ColdThese can be seen by pressing tab (default button) in the bottom right of the menu that opens up.FATIGUE:[/b]Your fatigue will be increased after performing various actions (such as crafting, harvesting, etc.) once the bar on the tab-menu is completely filled you will no longer have the ability to sprint, (untill you have slept and you are no longer exhausted) in extreme cases your vision will become blurry and condition will decline untill you have rested, theres also a slight chance of dying by fatigue.COLD:[/b] Cold consists of Air Temperature, Windchill, Insulation of clothing and Wind protection of clothing.Your overall temperature is the air temperature plus windchill minus the effects of clothing on windchill and temperature. As the cold bar on the tab-menu you will get warnings and verbal complaints of the cold. If the bar completely fills up you will start losing condition which can lead to death if not looked after.[/list]ClothingYou can craft clothing and find clothing.Repairing clothing requires cloth and a sewing kit and can be done while accessing your inventory, selecting the piece of clothing that needs to be repaired and pressing ""action"", this will bring up a menu saying harvest and repair. It speaks for itself that you'll have to click repair in order to repair the piece of clothing. Harvesting clothing will give you cloth.Thanks for reading trough my review.Please leave comments if you think I should have added even more :)~ Hobo "

Early Access Review
								I used to play this game when it first came out. I died. All. The. Time. And the world was much much smaller - 1 map to be exact. I liked the concept, but got bored and frustrated (frustored? borstrated?) and quit and haven't looked at it since.When it went on sale recently, my husband pointed it out to me as the type of game I usually like and asked if I owned it. I said I had and mumbled something about not bothering... He brought it up again the other day, asking if I had seen if there had been any changes or updates since I played it last.So I cracked it open...and have been obsessed with it for days on end. I had to apologize to hubby for advising him against getting it when it was on sale. But it's on his radar now. His only disappointment is that it is only single player and we can't survive together (we play 7 Days to Die together extensively, for example, as we favor co-op survival).The game is Alpha, so is under active development and some of the mechanics and balance may be off in some players' opinions. For myself, I find it enjoyable, and have found that the addition of the new maps, and three different game modes/difficulty levels, have given this game whole new life and an opportunity for gamers of many stripes to enjoy playing. If you are not a fan of inventory management as a primary element, then you may not like this game. Your inventory is weight based, food and tools spoil over time, and you are battling the elements and mother nature (wolve and bears, oh my!) for survival. A large chunk of the tension of survival in this game hinges on having to make tough choices about what to carry with you and what to leave behind, what to repair or to scrap and harvest the resources, what to use now or try and preserve for later (with the chance it will degrade beyond reasonable use in the meantime). It's a complex combination of factors to consider, which I find compelling, but is essentially inventory management. So just be aware.Also, this game will NOT offer you running around, banging out shiny items on the toolbench, hack n' slash melee, or shoot 'em up guns blazing. This game requires a lot of patience. Resources must be gathered over time, hides and wood cured before fashioning into needed clothes and tools. There are no endless bullet stashes, or a promise of ever finding a gun. But if you find a gun and bullets, you might have two rounds to your name and they are precious--you can't make any more bullets, and your gun will wear out eventually. Tools and clothing degrade with use and must be repaired often to maintain them. If your hatchet breaks, you can't make another. Animals are predatory and will tear your precious clothing and cause bleeding and infections--I need not tell you medicines are scarce and also lose efficacy/degrade with time, and natural remedies can be hard to procure. Eating spoiled food can give you severe food poisoning, leaving you bedridden for hours on end. Frequent blinding blizzards can turn you around, leaving you lost and struggling to stay warm enough. And if you can't find adequate wind shielding you can't start a fire to save your life (literally). Running will tire you out, make you hungry and thirsty faster, and resources are limited. If you're too tired and come across a hungry wolf, you won't be able to run away, so you preserve your energies should you need them in a pinch. Getting across this desolate, snowy terrain can be slow and even boring at times. Funny enough, it adds to the atmosphere for me that you must trudge, with purpose and restraint, toward your next shelter because to rush it risks death.The graphics are lovely--something between a watercolor painting and paper cutouts. The ambient sounds and occasional music really add to the atmosphere and are not at all intrusive. In fact, keep your ears pricked because you may be able to hear that storm whipping up. When you are indoors, you can hear the shutters rattle, indicating a blizzard has swept through, so stay inside if you want to live. Even the quietest snarl or howl can indicate a wold is on your tail, so drop some meat as a decoy and get outta there fast. Make no mistake, the weather is a character itself in this game, and you want to get to know her voice.I look forward to seeing how this game evolves. As of this review, Story Mode has not been released. They have been promising it would drop by the end of 2015, which is coming up fast, so I am keeping my eyes peeled for some storied content in the near future. In the meantime, the sandbox mode is more than entertaining, and I recommend survivalist gamers give it a try.			"

								The Long Dark (TLD) is, without a doubt, one of my favorite games of all time. The art and environment are beautiful. The audio work is masterfully created and constantly evolving. The game mechanics are refined, but could use further tweaking, which I have full confidence in Hinteland Studios to do.Although without currently a story mode, TLD sandbox mode provides a self-generated emotional experience that tickles your visceral senses. This is the perfect game for fans of survival-themed TV shows, which would be me, or those who simply appreciate the challenges that natures heaves. Your ""enemies"" in this game are the choices you make. Yes, there are wolves and bears, but you have the choice to completely avoid them. In TLD sandbox, you create the story and are rewarded or punished accordingly. Hinterland Studios has done an incredible job of bringing the Canadian wilderness to your desktop (I say this without ever spending a minute in the Canadian wilderness). The immersiveness of the environment is felt immediately. Audio cues, such as the music transitioning in when you come upon a key location or when the skies clear for the sun, is quite moving. This game literally gives me chills and startles me when either a wolf growls unexpectely (or you think one is growling) and chases you while you find shelter indoors. You constantly battle the sense of desperation, cold and fear against hope, warmth and relief; fighting and thinking about the former is key to survival. The graphics, or more appropriately the artwork, is very good albeit not AAA-esque (and it isn't meant to be). For example, the sheet of ice crystals that form on your screen when walking outside, as if they're forming over your eyes, reminds you how cold it is. I would love to see the graphics be further refined to imbue more realism, but overall, it's fantastic. Game mechanics are good. Inventory system is easy to navigate, but I wish more items were made stackable. Overall, it's a very simple game that doesn't require twitch reflexes or advanced skill. The most difficult action is to shoot the bow and arrow, but with practice, one can master this pretty quickly. As with any early access game, we should see a lot of new content coming our way, including the story mode. If sandbox is able to lure me in this much, I have high hopes that story mode will do the same and add some context to the actual gameplay. Highly, highly recommend this game.			"

								UPDATED REVIEW JANUARY 2016In my original review I stated that this game had potential if the developers stuck to it. My 130+ hours of playtime show that it's a game that I managed to stick with - and the developers have not only met, but exceeded my every expectation so far. The game is still only sandbox at this point, but now has many regions, added wildlife, a crazy amount of added items, crafting and so much more. With story mode on the horizon, expect an updated-update-review in the future. This has now become one of my most played steam games, and is an example of early access done right. Slow and steady, with constant communication and updates.Even still in early access, the sandbox represents one of the most immersive, realistic and FUN single player survival games available. ORIGINAL REVIEW, WRITTEN SEPTEMBER 2014This game is early access and has little content to it right now. At the time of writing this, it has but one static map. The starting point and the loot that you can find is RNG, but from a small pool of locations and a small pool of items, survival is really not that difficult once you've had a few trial and errors. This game needs a lot of things. It needs more content, more maps, more items, more animals, it needs more realism and more balancing - but the foundation is absolutely rock solid.I don't usually like commenting on early access games, but in this case I'm recommending it for one main reason - I played 13 hours without even realising. I survived over 20 days (on my 4th playthrough) before I had to quit (I didn't die). It didn't feel like 13 hours. It felt like one or two. It is immersive, it is addictive, it has genuine atmopshere and had a weird combination of both being relaxing and gripping at the same time. I don't know how trudging through the snow for an hour became both challenging and fun - but it did!I also love the art style, the brief voiceovers and the very brief music on top of being one of the most bug free beta-games I've ever played. I think it's worth supporting these developers.Of all the early access games I've taken a risk on, I think this one has the most potential if the developers can stick with it. From the updates and forum interaction so far, I'm very hopeful.Even if you're not interesting in backing games in early access - keep an eye on this one for the future!			"

								Remember back in the day when your mom told you to stop playing Mario Bros and you said ""let me finish the level!""  Well if you where playing TLD you'd say ""I'm just about dead, let me see if I freeze before the wolf eats me.""  It's an amazing game of frustration, exploration and true sense of accomplishment.  I had no idea how exalting it is to find an old can of dog food until now.I'd highly recommend this game.  There's nothing like it out there and is incredibly enjoying.  The game play and levels are well thought out and the atmosphere is amazing.			"

								I must say my girlfriend, the kids and I were very interested in trying this game. We love games like rust and zombie survival games however we figured we would enjoy a more realistic gaming exerpience. We decided to take the chance seeing as the game was pricey for a game in development. $20.  To our pleasant surprise it is very challanging , realistic (just as expected) and detailed. You keep track of hours of the day, thrist, hunger (including calories and such) as well as your fatigue. You can repair items, clothing and other things. You research cooking, hunting and other things with books to further your ability to survive. Many of the activities in the game are like real survival and make the game very enjoyable. This game is NOT a super high paced shoot em up game. Your fortunate to find even a few bullets so you can hunt for survival. This is a mature persons game for people who are thinkers and enjoy trying to figure out how to best use your time and resorces wisely.In conconclusion this game is very good. Do not let the low quality of graphics fool you these developers are really on to something here! I genuinely hope they continue on the complicated path they are on. This game should not be for everyone. This is what I and the kids like about it. PLEASE finish the story mode soon. We all cannot wait for the updates and things to come. Kudos to the developers.I highly recommend this game if your into this style of realism.			"

Early Access Review
								The best survival game I've ever played. The atmosphere in this game is so thick that you could cut through it with a knife and then spread it on your toast, the frightening moments will have you sh*tting your pants (surrounded by a wolf pack and your last flare just ran out) and the rewarding moments will have you jumping out of your seat (finally found that elusive prepper cache chock full of supplies)Isolation is really what made this game for me, it's only you vs. the wild from the start and god knows you'll do whatever it takes to win. Another thing that really makes this game for me is the very realistic inventory, you have a finite amount of weight you can carry, but you can choose to go over it. Be warned though, an overencumbered character moves slower and tires faster, not to mention they are also an easier target for aggressive wildlife.TLD won't let you run through the forest swinging an axe to fell trees and strike down animals, every action consumes calories and time (two things that are in short supply most of your playthrough) and every action outsides adds the risk of exposure. Huge blizzards rip through the map every so often and gargantaun clouds of dense fog cloud everything, obscuring any potential hazards from your view. In the first two hours of my playthrough, my character was already cowering in an abandoned coal mine with his clothes torn to shreds and multiple bleeding wounds. He also had food poisoning and was crying about how death would be welcome compared to the hell he was going through. Two seconds later, he died of severe dehydration and acute ""wolf-bit-my-face-off"" syndrome.This game is brutal. Buy it.Also see if you can break my record for consecutive wolf attacks (mine's seven).			"

								First of all, I am going to admit I do have a bias on this game already because living in Northern Canada and getting a game on surviving in it already makes it 10/10 for me. But, I digress and will try and keep this fair.The Long Dark was recommended to me by a friend and I have to say, I am not disappointed by it. I loved the artstyle from the get-go because it's minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing but it may not work for everyone. For example, the buildings have an almost comic-book style to them which I enjoy but your mileage may vary. As for the actual gameplay, it's very easy to get into - very straight forward on what you have to do - but it gets very difficult very fast.For example, I kept assuming you need a fire going when you rest so you don't freeze to death (using my real world logic) but this seems not to be the case. Within the first day I used all my accelerant and tinder plugs and no idea what to do after. I went out to forage, got hit with a blizzard and died. Cue clucking of tongue and an annoyance to make it past the first day.But I admit, once you get the hang of it, it does become fun. Some people may not find calorie counting and foraging wood and lighting fires to be all that exciting mind you. Which this game has so if you want something more fast-paced, this probably won't do it for you. But for me, taking notes on what I'm doing, planning for the day or even just poking around outside for a minute and running back to shelter is fun. The fact that it's located in the wilderness of Canada - a place used rarely in games - just makes it better and I cannot wait for the Story Mode.Overall, again, I give it 10/10. The game is getting more content as the days go on so that's a big plus as it has changed from when I first downloaded it.Also, Jennifer Hale. I mean... that right there. Alone.			"

								With story mode soon to be released, I thought I might actually sit down and write a review for this game. The Long Dark is the best survival game I've played in years. There's a certain sense of desperation that you sometimes feel when you're playing this game - you might be out in the cold, with your character's condition steadily decreasing, and you hear a howl. So you look around, and on the crest of a nearby ridge is a dark silhouette. It's a wolf, and suddenly the situation becomes more dire. Your character moves slowly when their stamina is drained, or if they are injured. Sometimes escaping from predators is not as easy as it sounds or seems. The elements are deadly too - navigating through fog or a snowstorm can be a challenge, if you aren't prepared.The world of the Long Dark is a lonely world indeed. Searching through abandoned houses is always interesting - while searching for clothing you might stumble across the empty bedroom of a child, toys still scattered across the floor. You'll walk along lonely coastlines and across frozen lakes, through deserted settlements and climb up windswept mountains. When exploring new areas, you never really know what you might discover. The frozen bodies of those who could not survive serve as a warning and reminder of the post-disaster world the Long Dark takes place in. Every major update adds something new and interesting to find. I look forward to the upcoming story mode. Thank you for this game, Hinterland. Thank you.10/10			"

UPDATE (5/31/15): As per the developer's comment below, I revisited this title, and even though they claim that many of my 'Cons' have been addressed, I did not find this to be the case - the review still stands as-is. Details for haters: Menus are still clunky (a few new ones were added, but its the same format). It is still a numbers game, and you still magically know all of your calories at any given time. Maybe the weather numbers were removed (I don't remember seeing them this time). To be fair - I did not melee fight any wolves - I killed some with a rifle, though.I got my money's worth out of this and all, but to tell you the truth, I am just not feeling it. ITS SOOO CLOSE to something I could love, but yet so far. I love the idea of surviving the environment, and not zombies, but this just feels too tedious to be much fun. The graphics are also amazing, and in fact, probably the high point. It really does make you feel like you are out there all alone. Pros1. Graphics are killer good2. Atmosphere is very submersive, best I've seen for this kind of game3. Fresh idea that is welcome in survival games (no horror or zombies, I'm in!)Cons1. Menus are terrible - all weird drop down boxes and statistics, and terrible for controller support to-boot2. This is too much of a 'numbers-game' where you have to fight counting calories and how much stove time you have left3. THINGS ARE SO COUNTER-INTUITIVE - you can dehydrate yourself to death while you sleep. I mean c'mon. I could go on and on for this point, but those that have played it certainly know what I am talking about4. The wolves are actual enemies that leave something to be desired for me. The combat is really silly, and is basically just spam-clicking5. You magically have statistics on the weather (degrees, etc.), and actual calories consumed, but do not have these numbers for other thingsOverall, it just feels too clunky and tedious to keep me coming back. I also started to really dislike the developers on the forums. They are *too* involved - they should stick to reading the stickied threads for ideas or troubleshooting. Once they get into bickering, they only stand to lose on a long enough timeline.			"

								I've come across many games and ""the Long Dark"" is the golden needle in the haystack for 2014. The art is refreshing, It made me curse, scared me, felt joy of living by almost dying and then finding a cabin that prolonged my life, I had to pause the game and say to myself ""It's just a game"" that's how deep it took me in. The resources and the combinations of the rotating elements and my choices make for endless combinations and situations for an end result, and with multiple scenarios/stories/seasons (to come) the challenges and the reward's of playing would be endless, packed with adventure and ""Damn I should have done that instead of this"" retry!! And then I die 3 minutes later by a wolf so all theories about what I'm going to do go to hell and it starts all over but that is what makes it fun and challenging. I will do everything in my power to promote this game and have it go into every other season because these type of games helps expand the mind, at least from my perspective. Every time I hear a crow now I’m wondering what I can go and scavenge. Cheers Hinterland HQ for a great game and concept! I wasn't kidding on the ""I died by a wolf 3 minutes later""https://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/133248553/disp/c698d80789a7d1eb1a6d976b7e6c95b0.png "

								Every once in a while you stumble into a game that is just a pearl. With The Long Dark I struck gold and got 100% my cup of tea. I love survival and exploring games, making a base or in this case hoarding/starving simulator go apesh!t, I'm loving it. And the style is really special in breathtaking in my opinion.So you have your first try on the hardest setting with the ""bring it on I'm made for this game"" attitude, dying within the first 24 hours of hypothermia... Learning the game mechanics and the layout of the 1st map I made it a little further each try. Fist 2 days, then 5, then 11.I thought I had my act together then, at day 11. I found a preppers cache with food, made my base at camp office at the lake. Had a hunting rifle with ample of ammunition, axe, hunting knife etc. enough wood at the base, water, food, plenty stored for days to come. Went on a hunting trip, shot a dear, was going to skin it, not a care in the world, BLIZZARD! omfg I'm freezing and exhausted becuase of it. Collapsed about 30 meters from the camp office,... faded into the long dark.So I learned my lesson and now I make a campfire if I have to skin and gut something.My try after that was my best try after that. Same story, great gear, but I ran out of food and was beginning to starve. No Deer to be found where I usually found them for 3 days in a row so I went on for fishing. On my way to the fishing hut a wolf showed up between me and the hut, charging towards me lit flare to make the wolf stop hopefully. ""Well, I guess wolf is back on the menu"". Crouched for a better angle, aimed my rifle !BAM! and... missed! as the wolf went for my throat. ""O crap get it off get it off get it oooooff nooooo my clothes. aaaaaaah it bit me crap that hurt bad omfg I didn't know they could huuuurt you sooo bad!!!!!!""""I'm not sure if I'm going to make it"" my character gasped"" Bleeding bad I took care of the wounds at the spot and stumbled back to the camp office. I needed to rest, I needed calories to recuperate while I rested or I'd never wake up. Then I realized I still had some tea left!!!Down to 3% before passing out//dying.I grabbed my lantern ""out of fuel""... Looked in my inventory to refuel it, no fuel left,... Lit another flare. Couldn't nearly see anything as I was close to death and walking and stopping at a spot was a great challenge. When I finally ended up in front of the fireplace I see I'm down TO MY LAST MATCH. This better work! ""Come on little fire!"" YES, the fire is burning and I'm making tea, 3 whole cups, 300 calories! Now to rest, I fire up another flare and stumble my way upstairs leaning to the left wall to not go all over the place. I rested, for like 2-3 hours if I remember correct. Just so the calories and the rest would patch me up a bit and I'd have a chance to get to the fishing hut. If I'd rested too long the starvation would kick in again and would kill me for sure! I was back up to 6%! I had a fighting change!I lit a flare, made my way downstairs, exit the camp office. I'm not sure if there was mist or I was just nearly completely blind of being nearly dead, but I could not see crap. Going from left to right as walking in a straight line was not possible in my current state. I walked around till my flare burnt up, lit my last flare and still could not find a friggin fishing hut, my last and only hope.Then an achievement popped up ""You prep the preppers"" I made it to live 30 days!! Tea ftw! As I walked on with my last strength I see the lake cabins. I already looted that place so no food in there for sure, but maybe if I just rest for one hour... and if I don't wake up, at least I did not die outside in the cold but in a warm bed. As I lay my tired and starving body down on the bed I set myself to sleep for one hour as I fade into the long dark.			"

								So this is exactly the same experience that Skyrim and a couple of survival mods can provide me with. Maps are mostly linear (Only 2 of them ATM) and houses that you can explore are copy-pasted, there is actually like 6 types of them and you will get sick of exploring them pretty quickly. Whole gameplay is a dull grinding, check every small drawer, get from point A to point B at a snail's pace without something that can provide you with fun in the mean time , ETC. I wouldn't mind this kind of grind but it takes too long to perform ANY action. There's nothing to do outside except for traveling between locations and gathering wood (Wood is obtained without any axe through the ""gathering"" menu, which only consumes time and some of your stats while you remain at the same position.) And maybe hunting, but that's when you get a rifle, which is a very rare item. Wolves is the only hostile mobs in the game ATM and there is no melee system. When a wolf catches you, you have to spam your RMB, that's it. There is ""Gain strength"" button which has a purpose of... letting the wolf eat you in less than a second. Mashing RMB is the only efficient option, why bother with anything else then? Oh, and there's no story mode right now. This game is not very fun and has a small amount of content. But it IS pretty and promising. That's why i'm recommending this game. If you are willing to buy a fun game that you can put lots of hours into, it's too early for that. If you are willing to support this dev both with money and constructive critique, go ahead then and buy it. I'll update this review when this game recieves a major update.			"

								The Long Dark captures an unusual feeling in modern videogames: a sense of isolation. Alone in a vast and inhospitable wilderness, with no zombies or mutants or assault-rifle-toting killers in sight, it's simply ""Man (or Woman) vs Nature,"" like in classic survival stories from Jack London onwards. The eerie whistle of the wind, the terror of a blinding blizzard, the welcome warmth of a fire-stove while the storm howls outside... these are the moments The Long Dark captures best (and uniquely).

								Ok, so it's been arround 1 year since i got tLD. And at last, it runs like it should.So i can finally go back on a previous review i did and can actually recommend the game now.The concept is pretty neat, different from most survival games since literally every other one includes zombies or similar types of enemies. In Long Dark the worst thing to fear is nature itself and cold and that causes a pretty good sense of urgency to get food/calories and make players weight the possible risks/rewards of going out looking for food or materials.However, the character does seem to get tired excruciatingly quickly... Almost seems like you need go sleep every 5 minutes... It's a bit of a nuisance. And so is the walking speed, feels like a snail could easily leave us eating dust.			"

								If you like survival games, you'll love this one.You have to survive alone, in the cold of the north canadian, in an abandonned city were wolves roam looking for fresh meat.The game is providing a really great immersion, cool graphics (not fancy technical graphics, but I like the art :)) and fun gameplay mecanics.I really like how Hinterland tried to do something not too much realistic, so the game keeps his fun. I think they found a great middle ground between fun mecanics and realistic mechanics. I like how I can track a wounded beast with its blood trail (for the realistic detail side) and how I can read how many minutes my fire camp will be up (less realistic but you won't rage because your fire wasn't strong enough and you didn't know).Also, this game is continually improved, and Hinterland's team is doing a really great job at delivering patches, hotfixes, and  reading community requests without destroying the spirit of their game.Keep up the good work Hinterland ! The game is already awesome as it is, I can't wait to see the story mode :)			"

								Very good game. I have currently survived 140 days on Stalker which is already quite difficult. You have to manage your resource from the first day, nothing should go to waste. After you get the hang of it you will get used to managing everything, food, cold, gear, water, wildlife, guns, harvesting and most of all WEIGHT, everything weighs too much always.. There is really no downtime in apocalypse. If you decide to just play cards and waste time, you will waste your precious calories/rest when you could be harvesting, gathering, mending, fixing, skinning, cooking, melting and boiling water, killing fish/deer/wolves etc, gathering wood, sticks coal and whatever. You should also be studying fishing, guns, survival. You should make yourself clothes from those animals you kill.. But don't do it too much inside or you will get cabin feverDecide what to take with you when going somewhere, and then when you think you got everything you need, you get pinned down by 2 day blizzard with no shelter close by..RecommendedPS. remember you can cheat by checking your coordinates in case you get lost!

								The Long Dark Review - Raymond K. TurcotteOnce again, I’ve returned to review another game. The Long Dark; Firstly, let me just say Hinterland Studio did an amazing job! It’s by far the best survival game on Steam without a doubt. However, the game in my opinion lacks a bit. Not much, but I think it’s missing some things. Like, for example I believe you can’t break ice if you wanted too, and I don’t think it would be that easy to find food in the real world. *Difficulty level can change that FYI*Note, in the description box, it’s still an Early Access Game so the developers can change the minor details if they wanted to. But as I said earlier, this game The Long Dark is superior to the other Survival games IMO available on Steam. I think this game is great overall, because yes it’s just a video game but it prepares you for the world. Hypothetically that is.-Raymond K. Turcotte I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!Leave feedback, your opinions + Add me as freind :)			"

								tl;dr: The game Hinterland made is great.  The game Hinterland promised they'd deliver to the people who paid doesn't exist.After three (or four?) missed deadlines for the release of Story Mode, in order to stop disappointing the community, Hinterland decided to simply not announce any more release dates.  As a sign of good faith, they agreed to provide ""regular updates[hinterlandgames.com]"" on Story Mode progress, and they'd handle spoilers by way of an opt-out system.  Definitely a let-down for the people who have been waiting since 2014 for Story Mode but after so many fails, the decision to stop making promises Hinterland could not keep and the promise of transparency won them some goodwill.More than four months later, Hinterland has provided not a single update on what's going on with Story Mode.Adding insult to injury, Hinterland stated that four months with no updates did not conflict with their understanding of the word ""regular"" and the failure to update the community was merely a failure to not be ""as regular as you would like.""  Amazingly, the reason given for failing to deliver even a single update was the uncertainty of how to handle spoilers -- something Hinterland had solved at the outset in their promise to provide ""regular updates.""When players said Hinterland had been less than honest with the community, Hinterland initially reacted by closing the thread and saying the questions had been answered.  When pressed for an answer, and facing the prospect that Hinterland's false promises would be brought to the wider gaming community, Hinterland called these criticisms ""hostile,"" ""insulting"" and ""slander,"" ""threatening"" and ""bullying.""Finally, after refusing to admit that they misled the paying community, and continue to mislead the paying community, Hinterland banned the people who brought up the issues, myself included.But don't take my word for it.  Read Hinterland's own promise[hinterlandgames.com] and realize that today, a full twenty weeks later, they have delivered precisely nothing on their promise.If you like a Hinterland product as it is right this moment and don't mind supporting such a company, buy The Long Dark (and consider not updating).  It's a beautiful game.If you want a Hinterland product that they've promised to make, hold on to your cash until they've made it.  You may find the money never leaves your pocket.			"

This game has really hit my sweet spot: Artic Wilderness survival. I've been to both alaska and canada, and this really gives that immense feeling. Some of the most powerful surges of this feeling have been felt in my journies through Mystery Lake and Pleasant valley. When i was far younger, i dreamed of such a game. For the past 3/4 of a year ive seen it change, from new regions, sorry mode progress, wolf models, to advanced mechanics. From what i've read, this game is supposed to capture ""Strong Emotions"" I agreed with myself that this game has already captured them: Fear, wit, and the overwhelming drive for survival.And as for Hinterland, i have something to say: Thank you.

Ok try again,  Survive 4 days spend all of day 3 indoors healing repairing and getting geared up to explore some more, step outside and get attacked by another wolf. Incredibly Frustrated. Try again and again. You cling on at 1% health while you wait for the herbal tea to finish cooking. Yes  finally survived.   Working on the 25 day mark finally.  This game is Incredible and HARD and awesome and HARD! Did i mention that it is unmerciful? You step wrong and  twist an ankle. You do not plan for a hike and starve or get caught in a sudden blizzard or fog and cannot see. Stumble around and die!  This is the ULTIMATE in hardcore game.  One shot to live, death is just around the next corner, go from full health to almost dead in the time it took to read that sentence.  I Love it! Cannot wait for story mode.  Best game I have bought this year! Oh and I would like my weekends back I just spent the last few at Mystery lake!			"

								This game is everything you hope it will be when you watch the previews - immersive, engrossing, beautiful, and brutal. There are moments when you just stop in awe at what you are seeing! Best of all, this is survival done right. You don't get to ""base up"" and live safely after a few play-throughs of learning. Sure you get better, learn the tips, live longer, but you still fight to survive every day, sometimes every hour in this game.Yes I had a few hard deaths, some brutal moments where I wondered if I would ever last more than a few days, but the reward when you figure it out is that much better. And even when you die, the game has a hold on you. I remember fading out one time looking up at the most amazing night sky ever. I couldn't wait to start again.In terms of style, you need minimal hand-eye coordination. This is a game of constant decision making. EVERY decision has tradeoffs: run or walk, rest more or head out now, fight or flee, take a risk or wait out a storm, take the easy path or go up that ridge to see what's on the other side?  I'm hooked. I find myself thinking about this game at work. Wondering what I should do to eke out another day or two. I got this game on sale, but it would be easily worth it at major label prices. And it's still just Alpha. Amazing.			"

								I have nothing to gain or lose from saying this, but I do mean this out of the bottom of my heart. The long dark is absolutely amazing and one of the best games I have ever played.. It's got a steep learning curve, but it's so insanely rewarding once you take the time to learn and understand the dynamics. From playing about every survival game available I can say that these guys nail atmosphere.I have a bear near the farmstead, he's always there, I named him Barney, I once thought of killing Barney cause he was roaming near the house and he was getting a little rowdy, I'm very happy I did not, I keep my distance and the wolves theirs, no one's gonna mess with Barney so we have this weird relationship.

It doesn't resort to cheap scare gimmicks (like The Forest, which looks like it's becoming easier and less threatening with each update) and presents basic survival skills as the real challenge. The difficulty is unforgiving, but surmountable. Beautiful visuals with a unique nuance of style. Unpretentious indie feel.Looking forward to the story mode.			"

								The Long Dark is a great game which has a funny way of sneaking up on you. Right now only the sandbox mode is available so your objective is to survive for as long as possible by gathering food, wood, tools, clothing, etc. and by STAYING AWAY FROM WOLVES. Seriously, don't get near those things, not even with your rifle. You'll get bitten to death. Oh, and don't go out at night, you'll get bitten to death IN THE DARK.All of these survival stunts take place in a beautifully portrayed Canadian winter, and I mean this seriously. The developers haven't gone for photorealistic graphics but for a more impressionist approach with vibrant colours and more simple shapes. The game has made me go ""WOAH!"" several times because the landscape was so beautiful that you forget the hunger and the wolves for some brief seconds.There are some very interesting game mechanics that are the core of the game. Temperature is of the utmost importance so you are able to rip some clothes in order to improve others, skin animals to get leather or fur, etc. All of these actions are done inmediatly in real time but require an investment of in-game time (Which can be optimized by using the right tools) and that's the main point of the game: Invest your time wisely because your hunger, thirst and fatigue are going up continuosly.My favourite mechanic of all is the climate. Let's say you're save in a cabin but then you need to go outside for resource gathering, well, you may go out to find a clear day which allows you to see up to the horizon or, if you can hear the wind while into the house, you can find a windy landscape with reduced visibility or a FREAKING STORM may arrive reducing your visibility to zero. Good luck finding the cabin again.I feel like I've only scratched the surface of a very rich, survival game in which you can feel like everything is under control one die just to die horrible the next day because you made some poor choices. Give it a try, for real.			"

								This game is a genius near perfect game even at an Alpha Test level. It really takes your survival skills to a whole new level you can't take anything for granted.But seriousness aside here's the play through 1. Spawn and pick up as much stuff as possible 2.Grab too much can't run3. Move too slowly can't get too shelter in time4. Get caught in a blizzard 5. Die from cold10/10 Would play Colorado Simulator again			"

								Let me say that I will willingly change this review as is warranted if the game develops, but as of now, I wouldn't recommend it. Visually, the game is stunning- it is a work of art with an unparalleled level of immersion that draws you in...but it is not a good ""game."" Frankly, it becomes a stressful chore after awhile, and I never really felt like I was progressing (I acquired stuff, and my skill points went up, but with no appreciable effects).Probably the biggest negative is that I picked this title up a few months ago, played it over a couple of days, formed an initial impression, set it aside, only to pick it back up again now and...nothing has changed. To be fair, I'm sure the game world is bigger and richer now, and I noticed some UI polishing, but Story mode is still teased at, the UI is still clunky, the game still becomes the aforementioned chore, the bug where your character suddenly starts speaking in demonic tongues is still a thing (Linux) and modding still doesn't exist. A word on modding: I don't see it happening any time soon either, since the developer has stated they want to ""wait till they can do it right"" which is a complete blow off. This is a title based on the Unity game engine - tons of titles in Early Access (with Unity especially) have vibrant moding scenes, with tiny development teams (e.g. RimWorld). I predict (and I'm ready to eat this statement) that this game will languish in the EA development doldrums for quite some time. I would love to be proven wrong though.TLDR: Get it if you want to interact with an immersive work of art. Avoid if you want a survival game. Might be a title to hang onto though, if you get it on sale.			"

								By far, one of my best purchases on Steam. I've had this game since pretty early in development, and I keep coming back to it. It's as much a staple as Skyrim is to many. Aspects of the game do need tweaking, but for $20, the game is a steal right now. Of every early access game I have played, this is by far the best, hands down. It is so well put together, its surprising its still in development. Sandbox is plenty of fun. And they added challenges, Story coming soon, and more. Multiplayer is not necessary for this type of game - the tone and pace of the game would need major changes to fit well with multiplayer in my opinion. This is a good thing, as it fits what they want, and they do it perfectly. Tone and environment add so much to this game.They have a vision, a plan of how to get there, and stick to it. They are some of the best and most open devs I have experienced. You can see their team members reaching out to the community and answering questions. A huge plus is they actually listen. I'm sure some devs would release this game as is -or even earlier in development- and charge you $40+ for it. But Hinterland has a vision and they will delay, tweak, update, and change until they are happy and the community is happy. I am excited to see where the game will go, and what they will do with it. This game is fun, its thoughtful, and it is satisfying. The only downside is the lategame can be boring, but really, if youre making it that far, you can start new files, play the challenges, or even take a break. The game is unforgiving, and can have a bit of a learning curve, but its satisfaction is through the roof when you accomplish something you set for yourself.Highly reccomend this game, 9/10.			"

								It's cozy, but there is pretty much nothing to do in this game.You wander and constantly fill up meters. You collect resources from buildings so you can afford to wander more. Unlike most survival games, this never changes. You're basically a permanent nomad. You can, at some point, craft hunting tools, and then you don't really need to wander anymore since you can just hunt for meat instead. Then what? Nothing. There's no base-building. There's no """"""quests."""""" There's no higher-level of survival. As soon as you can sustain yourself via hunting, the game has nothing to offer you. The only threats the game offers you (beyond one of the meters falling too low) is bears/wolves. And these can't attack you in the safety of a house.Contrast this with something like Don't Starve. After establishing camp and farms and bee boxes and basically knowing that you aren't going to starve without anything happening to you, what is there to do? Well...Prepare for hounds. Or giants. Tree Giants. Caves. Deeper caves. Luxuries that allow you to still function (more-so than just surviving them) during the extreme seasons (winter, summer). Luxuries that allow you to not go insane. Establishing more efficient forms of food gathering. Etc.The base of the game is decent but there's a significant lack of content that makes this game just boring. This may change if they add more content, but at its current pace, it just seems far off from being an experience.If you want a good first-person survival game, I'd recommend Subnautica. Same price-tag, more active developers, and much more to do other than aimless wander.			"

								The Long Dark is the pinnacle of survival games. No zombies, no radiation, just you and nature. Ahead of you lies the vast Canadian landscape, where the only thing you can rely on to survive is yourself. The game creates a sense of pure terror as you struggle to survive, discovering the bodies of previous souls lost to this harsh land. As you hunt, fish, and gather other food and resources in the snow, you begin to see what really drives humanity forward, and that, is instinct.			"

								The Long Dark - AlphaSlowing fading away of hunger in an abandon car was not the way I was going to die.  The blizzard had been going for two hours, and only the sound of my stomach growling kept me from trying to wait it out.  The last shelter I had seen was half an hour ago and the chances of finding it in the pitch darkness were nil.  My shivering was becoming constant.  No, I would not die here in this car.  Opening the door and lighting my last flare, I knew I could end up a frozen slab of meat on the side of the highway, or worse; a warm slab of meat for a wolf or bear.  Who knows, maybe dying warm would be better...no, follow the road, there is always civilization at the end of a road, but which way?  To go back was certain death, but to go foward was to make progress.  To what exactly I could not say, but it was further from death, further from the dark.  Shivering and walking at a limping pace, the sight of my own breath was a constant reminder that I was freezing to death, and if I didn't stop my sprained ankle would never heal.  If only the storm would let up for a just minute I could find my way...my condition was only getting worse.  I did not bother to pick up fuel for a fire anymore, what was the point?  No, this would not be how it ends, this is not how I die.  I think of where I have been so far, what little I have learned about surviving in this barren wasteland.  How to start a fire, what wood is the best to use, and what clothes can protect me from the wind.  I thought about the last cabin that I last slept in, it had everything I needed.  A pot belly stove, bunks with thick sheets, and most importantly four walls and a roof to protect me from the wind.  There was so much food in it, the cans of soda, jerky, even a cooked fish.  The moment I walked in I knew I had been saved; most of the food was gone within the day.  There was no choice but to leave the cabin if I was going to survive, even had I known I was going to sprain my ankle I still had to leave.The flare has now died and I keep walking in the dark knowing there is no going back.  All of a sudden I was hung up on something in the darkness.  Remembering the matches, I lite one and see at my feet is an overturned row boat on a frozen lake.  There must be a cabin.  I rush around in the darkness lighting matches frantically and see the small simple structure.  Entering the cold room I rush to the stove and start an emergency fire with my last acclerant.  The fire starts quickly giving me my first respite from the cold.  The dimly lit room is bare of items but under the bunk is a dusty forgotten MRE, I have hit the lottery.  Eating the packaged meal immediately the darkness slowly begins to subsides.  I purify the melted snow on the fire and drink my fill of water.  The crackling fire's warm glow begins to fill the room with heat, but it will be out in a few hours without more fuel.  I need to rest if I am going to get more wood.  I go to sleep in the bunk taking in all of its warmth.  Upon waking up the fire is out but the room is filled with light.  Eleven hours of daylight left and I have survived for three days.  I go outside to find the storm has ended and the morning sky is now a pale gold.  There is a cabin is out in the middle of the lake and I am going to need more food and fuel if I am going to survive any longer.  I start walking towards it picking up whatever loose firewood I can find along the way before stepping onto the lake.  Today could be my last day here, then again it might be tommorow.  But with every day I spend out here, I find it easier and easier to live on the edge of 'The Long Dark'.  20 minutes later I was mauled by a wolf and bled to death.			"

								When I first saw this game I knew it would be a great game. It didnt dissapoint. The sandbox mode is so good I havnt played much of it but from what I have played so far I find it very enjoyable the intesity of whether or not there is food or matches in a house or car, getting scared because of a few wolves near by. It is a very great game. I really wish I would play this a lot longer than what I have. (CSGO is that blame) I really have enjoyed my experience thus far and I really want to see some sort of DLC or more updates. You can tell the devs put time into this game. For its price its a great game. Better than most on EA (Early Access NOT Electronic Arts) 10/10 There is nothing wrong with this game or at least that I have found. Its a PERFECT Action-Horror Surival Game.			"

								Very awesome atmosphere and gameplay, despite Early Access. DayZ fans will love it!При том что это Early Access, вышла отличная атмосфера и геймплей. Фанатам DayZ понравится!Не знаю, купил бы если бы не скидка, но со скидкой взял сразу. P.s. Чтобы сэкономить вам чуток нервов, скажу, что когда волк нападает, нужно быстро быстро кликать левой кнопкой мыши, чтобы накопить силы удара и потом произвести удар правой кнопкой мыши. Два таких удара и волк умирает, а вы можете добыть с него мясо, кожу и т.п. Если кликать слабые удары, волк успеет вас загрызть, либо останетесь с 6% жизней, а зверюка сбежит и потом еще раз нападет когда-нибудь. И очень берегите спички, лучше даже лутать вслепую или поспать до утра, чтоб стало светлее, но сберечь спичку.			"

								The sandbox mode is a lot of fun.  However, I bought this game under the idea that the first part of the story mode would be completed in ""Spring of 2016"".  Here it is, summer time, and no story mode even remotely in sight.  This is why I hate ""early access"" games... or as I like to call them, ""not completed games that ask for your money while the developers laugh all the way to the bank"".  I can't tell you how many early access games take this approach, and I was hoping this game would not join the ranks.  For this reason, I cant recommend this game until it is completed.  I wouldn't give a high rating to a half completed game on a ps4 or any other system.. why should this get a pass?  If you are fine with just playing the sandbox mode, have at it.  It's a lot of fun and can pass a lot of time.			"

								The Long Dark is probably the most realistic survival game ever made. I am a fan of survival games, I've been playing them for years and am quite good at the genre, but I didnt know what I was getting into on my first day in the fridged wastes of The Long Dark. It was exciting, terrifying and most of all, brutal. I didnt last a day. None the less, I loved it, and it quickly became my new favorite game, in fact now, I can last more than a month on a single character. If you like any kind of survival games, I would strongly recomend this game to you, and wish you luck for the arriving winter, its going to be a long one...			"

								I've been looking forward to this particular survival simulator for a good, long while.  ""The Long Dark"" plops you into a post-apocolyptic environment set in the northern wilderness (where everything has icicles growing off of it).  Instead of trying to avoid zombies and the like, you'll ""simply"" be tasked with battling the elements, starvation, and the occasional pack of wolves.  As you'll soon realize, there's nothing ""simple"" about it.  In its current state, only the sandbox mode is available.  With that said, you'll easily be able to pump 50+ hours into this mode.  While the map itself is fixed, the items and their spawn locations are not, making it a challenge to find the tools you'll need to stay alive.  Easily one of the best survival games I've played in a while.

❄ Freezing, starving and backpacking simulator 3000! Day 1:I found myself on the beautiful snowy hill, day was clear and I had in my mind just I can make it. Full of powers I ran down the hill, jumping through a crunchy snow like a astronaut on the moon. Crack! Yikes, I sprained my ankle and it hurts. I'm so stupid but this is ok, another time I sprained my ankle somehow by tripping the dead body. At least i found some beef jerky in his backpack, poor guy. Whatever I can make it, still flowed on my mind, just need some painkillers and rest for a few hours ... ""There is a sign! The Sign! Forestry lookout, hmmm ..."" I mumbled into the cold air with hope in some decent cabin where I can warm myself. ""... this f*&$ing hill ... my ankle ... it hurts ... aaaawww cold"", I was freezing and wind was blowing much more there on the top of rocky hill. Finally, I was indoors and felt better. Also I found some tools and food! Cans and can opener. I've started a fire in a stove, melt some snow for drinking, ate some energy bars, can of beans and lay down the bed to rest.My ankle was completely recovered but thirst and hunger growed to giant dimensions. If there is snow pretty everywhere around you so you can melt it and have enough water but you have to find more wood for boiling it. That wasn't my case, nevermind, one can drink it as is I thought. Yep, it was my brilliant idea. After a while I felt a pain and welcomed my new friend for long dark nights ... dysentery. Lucky that I found some antibiotics but it wasn't time for sleep, I had to find more wood and remembered to dead deer down the hill. ""I can cook some meat"", I almost can't heard my own voice in the loud whistle of the wind that stretched around the cabin. So I grabbed the knife and went out.Poor deer, torn by wolves. Hey .. a dead body over there! I started to be glad for these frozen guys, one may appreciate some more food or clothes. It was getting dark and cold so I had to return to the lookout. My stomach wasn't in good condition and also I started to starve again. Not mentioning that I was really freezing.                                                            🔥""I am the God of Hellfire and I bring you ... FIRE! ... I love you my dear stove.""My love to this solid metal thing was warm as like its fire. But why I was so stupid?! While boiling some water I forgot to add more fuel and my fire burnt. Without that last tinder I wasn't able to start it again and cook some delicious deer meat. I barely stayed on my feet so I lay down and went to sleep.I fell asleep, long sleep as was a long dark there outside. I have died from exhaustion.                                                            ⛰This was my very first gameplay of The Long Dark in the early access sandbox mode. Game is running pretty smooth and player can experience so much game mechanics even at this moment. I hope that every small deficit or issue will be tunned by developers and game will be even much more realistic. I'm looking forward to the story mode as well, because even in the sandbox it's very atmospheric. As I said in the beginning, it's like a starving and freezing simulator and you'll find out how this game can be challenging and hard if you are lost and wandering in -20°C (-4°K) with a limited supplies in the small backpack, burning your calories and freezing maybe dying from food poisoning.Anyway If this will be your last day, believe you will die in the stunning nature!  ... or just torn apart by wolves! 🐺			"

								I used to think wolves were pretty cool animals, now I could honestly care less - no in fact I hope they are all wiped out in a mass genocide, I don't care what happens to the ecosystem, where was that care when I was dying of hypothermia, barely awake and starving? Oh ya there was no care as I was ripped to shreds 20 feet from my safehouse.♥♥♥♥ you wolves and all that you stand for.			"

								This game is about survival in extreme conditions. You are left alone in the beautiful cold wilderness. There's no one alive to be found, and you'll require a lot of creativity to balance the use of the resource have, to avoid or respond to threats, and to adapt to the circumstances to make it to the next day.Yesterday a new update came out. Now we have a much wider area to explore, with a good number of improvements and fixes. I can see many of the improvements being taken directly from the community. The developers engage the community, explain how things works, and consider negative opinions. Future looks very promising for this Early Access game.As it's right now, you'll be able to gather resources from a wide range of places like a dam, a train wreckage, cabins, camps, or even a bunker (if you find it). You'll scavenge frozen corpses and abandoned backpacks, and you'll hunt for food with a rifle that will eventually break and with a limited number of bullets. You'll have to take care of your clothes, because you'll need them to get wood in the freezing open to cook meat and get drinkable water. You'll be able to repair your clothes for as long as you have materials to do so. You'll have to control the calories intake and it's burning to keep you healthy. Avoid dehydration and freezing. Running will burn more calories and raise fatigue, sleeping will save calories and better your general condition. Eventually your stored food will turn stale, and eating it would make you sick, so you'll have to make decisions on what to eat and what to store. But above all, the wild life is free from constraints, and there's no one keep the wolf population at bay, so you'll also be hunted down. You'll have to run for your life, to wait until it's safe to go out, or to use the harsh weather to be able to move from one place to another. As every single bullet counts, you'll have to make choices about how you defend yourself. Surviving a wolf attack with a bullet today will mean you won't be able to shot down a deer for food tomorrow.The game sounds great, looks great and feels great. Get it.			"

								I am inside the Forrest Lookout.  I have enough meat to last for a little bit, and some water as well.  I am out of firewood, though, and the temperature outside feels like -56 degrees. So, what's the plan? Do I go out and start my day exploring and gathering some wood? Or should I hunker down another few hours and see if this weather passes... one choice or the other could mean death.A true enough survival game with no visible bugs, but limited content.  It is relatively slow paced, which makes it more relaxing and calming until the wolf jumps out from behind you and tries to kill you. This game is quite enjoyable for what it is currently: a sandbox survival game with a pretty small, static map.  Your spawn is randomized, but the map is static. So, you will get used to it pretty quickly.The game features a lot of ways to die and is actually quite hard.  This is a good thing.  There are no zombies and/or other players to kill you, and it is still pretty hard. A lot of people are saying it is too hard and unrealistic.  In some ways, perhaps, but in other ways not so.  I think it is actually more realistic than people think because very few people have actually experienced any type of arctic survival before.I actually enjoy the game as it is.  A lot of people are calling for base building, MP, PvP, etc, to make yet another Rust/DayZ clone.  I am looking forward to the devs bringing out the SP story mode and additional maps, which already seem to be promised or in the works.Overall, a good alpha SP game that I hope stays SP and just adds more variety to the maps and adventures/stories in the future.

								It is an awesome single player exploration game with the probably most beautiful, great, and creative art style a game has ever used. It has realistic light and shadow effects combined with cartoony textures and modelling and some athmospheric music in the background and awesome athmosphere, it would almost be a feel-good, cheery game if it was not for the apocalyptic-wolfs-are-going-to-eat-you setting and the occasional frozen corpses that have a nom taken out of their arms.  9/10, and I have not even discovered much yet. It is so awesome, just to walk along a railtrack with a snowstorm breezing onto you and the sky and area being dark gray-ish at just 12pm, enjoying the athmosphere before hearing a wolf howl and growl on you and noticing you do not have any flares left thats where you get scared and run for your life .I hope you nerds will find a place in your heart to buy it and support the developer.

								One of the great early access games to come out in recent times for me.  There is only sandbox mode right now with a story mode to come.  But the sandbox is awesome, and each update just brings bigger and better things.  I've played this game since it was very early and there was only one area to explore.  The game is challenging as you have to plan out your every move.  Do I hunker down here for the night without food?  Or do I take the risk pushing on through a snow storm?  If you like survival games, then buy this one for sure.  It's not a game I play all the time, but everytime I pick it up for a few days/week I enjoy it greatly 10/10.			"

								When I started this game for the first time, I was amazed. Beautiful artwork, the sound of wind blowing... It was beautiful, clear day, I had no idea where to go, so I just walked by some frozen river. I arrived to Mystery lake, started to look around. I ran to the Camp office, set up base, and because snow storm started outside, I went to sleep... Next day, I somehow arrived to the Trapper's homestead. Entered it... YAAAAY!!! There was a rifle, bullets, safe wich contained more bullets, a knife... The best loot what I could have in this game. Looted the place and went back to my base camp. After few days surviving, I ran out of supplies, so I went scavenging... Found a dam... Entered the dam... Started looting it... Then suddenly a wolf jumped at me! I had no idea how to defend my self 'cause it never happend to me before, so I was just pressing all the buttons I possibly could... I died... Survived 8 days and 18 minutes... What a great expirience!PROS:+ Amazing art work+ Amazing sounds & music.+ Only you and mother nature+ NO ZOMBIES+ Permadeath, you really need to try hard to survive+ Tons of loot+ Big world to exploreCONS:- Gets repetitive after you get used to it- Waiting. All actions you do is just wainting. Forage wood? waiting... Harvest meat? waiting... Craft an item? waiting... This really needs improvement. - To be completely honest, there is nothing to do after you have tons of supplies and gun: wake up, go hunt, kill a deer, cook it's meat, boil water, go to sleep... Wake up, eat, drink, sleep... Day by day, until you ran out of meat, then you have to go and kill another deer, and again...After all, This game is beautiful piece of art. It is fun, but as I said, it gets repetitive after some time. I recommend.			"

								I think it's a fantastic survival game for people that love to get cold while playing. Game dynamics are thought well, maybe some balancing take into consideration however this is only alpha version. It's recommended to play at home alone, in a cold weather outside, snow will be best but rain also works, with your cup of coffee to heat you up. PS: Stop looking behind there is no wolf in your home.			"

								I dont mean to advertise but I actually watched Jacksepticeye play this and I was just amazed at how realistic it looked, felt and the mechanics were so interesting. There a ton of different places you can unlock and its always interesting when you have been walking in the dark snowy wilderness and come across a log cabin that seems to have came from the heavens because it saves you from dying. Also, everytime I come across a new building or anything structural (Which there is A LOT of) its exciting to find out what you will find! I really really reccomend this game because its just so amazing in everything it does. The one flaw is that I cannot use my controller however I dont know if they will have fixed it by the time you read this.EDIT: I believe I reviewed this wonderful game before it had controller support but it works now! Plus they added challenges and such and its all really cool!			"

								I just want to say thank you to the developers. Its obvious you care alot about your product. I died 5 times in the first 3 hours, mostly getting myself stuck in snowstorms. It takes a good deal of planning to make sure your not going to get stuck out in the snow, or attacked by wolves in the dark.When you've finally found the rifle or rounds for it, downing a buck is the most satisfying feeling. No worrying about sustenance for at least a week, if you ration. Make sure to build a fire nearby though, or by the time your done harvesting it you'll be frozen stiff. Im not gonna make a long review but I'd say this is one of the most rewarding games you could play. Also it's a better hunting simulator than most hunting games on the market now.I've played around 70 hours, and have not made it past 11 days. 4/5 needs a little work on the crafting but overall a very atmospheric, realistic experience.

								For a quiet and slow-paced survival game (a lot of these tend to be very boring and are paced way too slowly), it is incredibly fun to play. It's very atmospheric, relying on the very eerie sounds of the environment to slowly get at your psyche. However, for such an interesting sandbox, I wish the developers could hurry up and try to update the fanbase (me included) about their story mode. It seems like it would be a very interesting story, and i hope it comes out soon. Anyway, the game is great for its price. definitely recommend it			"

								The Long Dark drops you somewhere in the Canadian Wilderness with the simple goal: Survival. Explore an open world from the summit of the Timberwolf Mountain range to an old industrial whaling community. Navigate through caves, a dam, abandoned coal mines and broke down railroad tracks while discovering man-made and natural supplies littered throughout the locations. Travel expansive distances across multiple maps. Seek shelter from the elements in cabins, industrial buildings and abandoned vehicles. Keep a lookout for suspiciously aggressive wildlife while managing your always deteriorating supplies and condition. Simple yet rich with complexity, TLD becomes a reflection of your own decisions ultimately leading to your success or death.I absolutely love The Long Dark. The appeal is its simplicity - just you and nature. Hinterland takes liberties with the environment increasing the complexity in a positive way and strategic They have clearly established a well thought out; well executed game design. I enjoy the solitude of the experience and the discipline to carefully consider each move you make. Every play experience will be uniquely different and everyone who plays will find their own novel experiences. Although still in alpha testing, it is clear Hinterland revealed a new spin on the survival gaming model. No Zombies. No angry mobs. Just an angry wolf named Fluffy. Some Dislikes1.	Animal aggressiveness. All depends on the mode. As an example, in Stalker, behind the Pleasant Valley Farmhouse, 6 wolves and 1 bear skulked. Think they'd go for each other if they're so hungry?? Nope. Instead they sniffed me down like I was coated in BBQ sauce. It’s possible the aggressiveness will be explained in story mode. I generally enjoy the challenge of facing aggressive animals but, at times, it feels a bit overplayed for the sake of dramatic effect. 2.	Inability to start a fire without game specific materials (i.e. matches, magnify glass). I’d like to be able to craft a fire bow or a tinder bundle to carry embers to different locations. Yes, I know the difficulty in rubbing sticks together but it can be done…just not in TLD.  If man made items are not available or in very rare supply (Interloper), there should be a natural way for the task to be completed or at least attempted even if the failure rate is high.Wishlist:1.	Maps. There are stores, camp offices, forestry lookouts, cars and cabins with blurred pseudo maps on the walls but no discoverable maps!? I believe cartography is an age old practice to identify one’s location but surprisingly absent from TLD. Whomp. Whomp.2.	Compass. I guess if you don’t have maps then asking for a compass is like hoping to find Atlantis in Desolation Point. Even without maps, a craft-able compass would help to maintain an idea of where you are. 3.	Additional wildlife. Beavers, Raccoons and foxes oh my?? Umm now that I think of it, why can’t I craft a fur hat??4.	The ability to craft a blanket or bedroll. I’ve got a stash of 40+ cloths and I can’t make a quilt??5.	The possibility of eating raw freshly caught fish. Granted Lake Whitefish is not a staple in my local sushi joint but salmon certainly is…6.	Complexity sliders. Certainly a wish list feature but I’d love to see sliders for game settings like animal aggression, discoverable items, etc. This would truly make each gameplay a unique experience.			"

								One of my favorite games of all time, and if Hinterland stays true to the posted roadmap, it will probably be my favorite game of all time. The sanbox alpha would be a complete game in itself for most publishers, but these people are adding a story mode(which will be the core of the game),  and much more to the sandbox mode. The challenges already in the game are just that, challenges, nothing easy about them, but fun as hell, with more on the way! As a first game, Hinterland has a masterpiece in the making			"

								The game is absolutely gorgeous, the artistic style lends itself beautifully to the environment. This coupled with the great environmental audio (howling winds, snow crunching underfoot, etc.) really has a great immersive effect.Honestly there have been times walking through mountains in Pleasant Valley that I've stopped to look out over the beautiful scenery even though I was freezing my♥♥♥♥♥off and the sun was setting and it might kill me. Or the desperation when you're trapped at night in a blizzard dying of cold with just your storm lantern and 10 ft of visibility just praying you find shelter soon because if you stop to try to harvest wood for a fire it might kill you. All the while the wind is howling in your ears, snow is crunching under your feet and you're breathing ragged and shaking from the cold. Oh and you walk/run slower into the wind. Those types of details are the best.It looks like once story mode is released (Spring 2016 is the latest word) the price will be bumped so get this game now. The sandbox mode alone is worth it, I honestly can't wait for the narrative they're planning to bring. The episodic nature should also be really interesting. And a final note: Don't ♥♥♥♥ with bears. Bears will ruin your day.  "

								I've never written a review but after 60+ hours in this game I felt compelled to give it a big thumbs up!I've tried a few of the survival games on steam and none come close to the realism, intensity and atmosphere of TLD. You can tell with each update that the devs are listening closely to the communitys suggestions and they do not dissapoint!While other survival games might go for the same old approach of zombies or monsters, this takes a more level headed and sometimes subtle approach to survival, for instance you might find yourself with hypothermia after falling through some thin ice or get food poisoning or intestinal parasites in your desperate struggle for food while you chew down on some moudly wolf meat from that wolf you just shot in the face with your crafted bow.The screenshots on the scenery speak for themselves!Anyhoo; buy it!

								dear diary. day two went well, i found a nice cabin and started to live out of it on mystery lake. during the day i defened myself by accidently shooting my gun off in my house (ouch) then made a fishing kit! (wahoo) so i went out to the lake and caught some fish (too much for my limit dont tell anyone) and also shot at a deer on the way back (i missed). during the walk back i lost sight of the cabin so i walked around for about two hours using only my matches to guide me through the darkness. needless to say i finally found it and cooked the very fresh fish i got earlier in the day. i now sit infront of a fire enjoying warm fish and 0 calories i now have after writing this entry in!The next morning i died due to a wolf attack10/10 would die due to wolves again			"

								I've noticed that the survival game genre has flourished in the last several years with many indie games coming along. I think part of that is the Zombie fad, but not entirely. There is a harder core sort of gamer that wants gritty realism whose not satisfied with guns guns guns.Welcome to The Long Dark.This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ If your stupid, you die, that simple. If you /think/ you have a chance at survival.I love the premise of the game, the sun sends along a gift and turns off all electrical things on Earth. You, a bush pilot, manage to land your plain in the remote Canadian wilderness. Now what? Now you survive, or you die, a lot, before you start to learn just how gritty and realistic this game gets.Personally I love that, don't cut me slack, I've done god mode enough its boring.The graphics are stylized and really lovely, theres an artistic flair here not found in other games in this genre. The sound is good, not spectacular. It will make you feel powerful lonely at times, and thats sort of the point.After four attempts I managed to survive 20 days and am working on deerskin boots. The crafting and repair system is good, you have to find items needed and a place to do the work, and the game doesn't drown you in items. Sure, at first you'll find lots of candy bars and cans of beans, but they only last so long and you have to start thinking long term. Also, fire making skills are key, as would be the case in RL. If you wan't a casual game, this is NOT for you.If you wan't a game you can chew on, pitbull like, just to make it past a week...this is for you.System Specs: CPU: i7 4790K, Graphics: GTX 770 Mem: 16 gigs			"

								This is by far one of my favorite survival games. Hinterland did a very good job designing the game and the graphics are just amazing. This is finally a good survival game that doesn't involve zombies. One suggestion, maybe Hinterland could make another survival based game in a different area like a desert or a jungle. 11/10 Very well designed game!			"

								I've been waiting for some time for this game to come out and saw that it was on sale on Steam for only $10.00.   I normally try to avoid investing in Alpha games as they seem to take years to complete and a lot of developers cut and run and never finish their product.  Kudos to Hinterland!My first experience with the game I played it on medium difficulty and lasted 20 or so days without any kind of problem as I have played many survival/ resource games before.I turned it up to stalker difficulty (Hardest difficulty). Now this is certainly my kind of game:  Real survival.Artistically it's beautiful, the dark unforgiving environment was exactly what I expected for a survival game I rate it a 10/10.  Emersion is about 8/10 and it is certainly a playable game even though it’s Alpha.  Out of 36 hours played- I’ve fallen though the world once- That happened after I sprained my ankle from a bump in the snow. This was the only real bug I’ve found and I was able to recover after multiple saved game loads.    The game has only crashed once on me so my rating for general game stability would be 8/10- which is great for an alpha.It isn’t a perfect balance… for example:  In Stalker mode you almost never find anything in file cabinets, you would think you would find just a little more paper….  Other than that you might find one item for every four boxes or containers you search though.I can tell you that after 36 hours- I’m not bored with it.   There’s lots of content and places to explore, and there are no quests in this game.  Simply surviving hour by hour and day by day and making it from point A to B is more than a challenge.  Getting down to 3% health in the middle of a blizzard with 99% fatigue all because of rusty can of pork and beans…  and surviving it with quick thinking…  Glorious/Rewarding.Frankly Speaking- I think this game has the potential to be the best realistic survival game on the market today.

Early Access Review
								It's been a good year for fans of the ""less zombies - more survival"" theme, and this game is a nice addition to that theme. tl;dr: Scroll down for a short list of gameplay features that may help with decision making.Sandbox Gameplay:This is inherently a game about managing your resources and your condition and keeping yourself fed, warm, healthy and decently equipped. This specific iteration of the Canadian wilderness is empty of people but not of houses, cabins and other locations you can loot from, making this a game more about loot and less about base building or crafting. In fact crafting is minimal (at least at this stage of development), though repairing your equipment is an important aspect of the gameplay. The maps (both of which are relatively small) sport houses/lootable locations at regular, easily walkable distances and they are persistent. The loot however (the type and quantity of which also seems to be more or less persistent) is randomly distributed, offering at least some amount of replayability. The rest of the replayability comes from permadeath: Basically, you die often enough that it will take you a while to explore both maps, small though they may be. Hunting (or at least looting half frozen corpses the wolfs have killed for you) becomes necessary only in later game, when you have unearthed most of the loot and are slowly running low on food. There are at the moment three animals in the game: deer, the wolfs that hunt the deer (and you) and rabbits. You can use traps for the rabbits, and you can attack the wolfs and deer with your fists, a rifle or a hunting knife (both of which you have to find first, and both of which will degrade, so you need to be conservative about your hunting). You can apparently also fish, though I have yet to succeed in ever finding a hook, so there is little I can tell you about that.Wolves:You've heard about the wolves, and they deserve their own paragraph. Fighting them melee (when for example they attack you) is very much a twitchy experience of button mashing, one that feels equally ""realistic"" and annoying to me. Avoiding them (by using fire, flares or decoys, or by giving them a wide berth) is possible, but not always feasible/practical. Frankly, being stuck inside a house for two days because there's two wolves parked right outside and you have no weapons whatsoever isn't my idea of fun, yet it seems to keep happening to me. But I can see where the devs are coming from, and I have heard other players who enjoy that (and are apparently better than me in the twitchy button mashing), so ymmv.However, there is an easy mode of the game, which makes the wolves basically not an issue. Sadly, it also makes the rest of survival aspects a bit easier. I am still hoping better balance/alternative solution to this design choice will crop up before full release, but you shouldn't count on it. For now just know that if you are coming to this game for the snow and the exploration, you can feel free to play on easy mode and the wolves will ignore you.Story mode:This is a promised feature that will apparently get added pre-release, but it isn't here yet. Since this game feels somewhat limited as a sandbox, I am looking forward to the story mode. Theoretically, The Long Dark could be absolutely lifted to the next level with good story mode implementation, it's absolutely a great world to tell stories in. But at this point we have no clue what that's gonna look like, so for now buy it for the sandbox, or wait it out.Atmosphere:There is very little to say here, I absolutely love the art design. The screenshots you see are very representative of the real thing, so if that works for you, you won't be disappointed. The slightly stylized, less-than-realistic but incredibly evocative art style is gorgeous, atmospheric and immersive. The sound design also brilliantly contributes to the atmosphere. This is a beautiful game, even with lowered graphics.Technical stuff:For an early access game, this has been very much a bug free experience for me so far. And while playing this on a laptop not much above min specs, lowering the graphics from ultra to high was enough for a smooth experience, with no lag, small (hardly noticeable during play) fps drops and still stunning visuals.Finally, here's a list of features to keep in mind before you make your decision:Atmosphere: Walking around in the snow, listening to the howling wind is much of the appeal of this game.Permadeath: No way around it. Either you're okay with that, or you'll be very frustrated.Real time: The game doesn't stop while you're staring at your inventory trying to decide which socks to put on. When planning for a two hour tree cutting session, keep in mind the weather may have changed to howling winds and you may be dying of hypothermia when you emerge on the other side of it. (Not being able to break what you're doing in reaction to what's happening is one of my pet peeves with the game, btw.)Maps: This initially feels, but distinctly is NOT an open world survival game. There are two maps, and they are both small and persistent. You can basically learn where everything is in a couple of successful playthroughs. Also, some of the houses are too shame-y inside, which I find a pity for such small maps.Loot: There is a more or less set number of items you can find, spread randomly around the map in every new game. What you find when can easily make or break an early game.Hunting: This is not an FPS and it isn't Deer Hunter. You have a rifle with very limited ammo and a knife, and that's about it. And even those degrade btw.Difficulty: There are three difficulty modes to pick and choose from. It is a bit unfortunate imo that wanting to avoid the button mashing that constitutes fighting the wolves means also having to play in a mode that seriously nerfs the rest of the survival difficulty, but at least the option is there.Survival: The Long Dark is a decent, if rather limited, take on the ""loot, craft (minimally), repair, manage your resources, manage your condition"" type of gameplay. Because of the limited crafting and the reliance on findable loot, there is less flexibility of strategy here than in other games of the genre. And that inflexibility of viable strategies is for me this is the major negative of the game, the aspect that limits its sandbox mode the most. However, this could theoretically be completely offset with a decent story mode, effectively changing the whole feel of things. As a world to tell stories in, let me reiterate, this could potentially be an absolutely brilliant one. We'll have to wait and see.EDIT: Please add modding support! This game is screaming for it. :)			"

								So far, The Long Dark is looking excellent. It's a proper survival horror game, as in: You might not survive and that's pretty horrible. Gameplay: At the time of writing, only Sandbox mode is available. The mechanics of interacting with the environment are exactly what I ache for in many games, i.e. When I do something that would be sensible in a situation in real life, it works in the game too. Freezing? Get in the lee of that rock to get out of the wind. Yay, it works!The game itself kind of includes its tutorial organically. At the start, you have no stuff, so you don't have to worry about what you can do with stuff. As you acquire stuff, you can play with it and learn what it does.It is a little frustrating that there are some features you'd hope will appear in the final version that apparently don't work yet - like fuelling and starting the oil generators with you can see attached to many of the cabins, but it's still alpha and there's plenty of time for more actions of this type - the ones that seem obvious and sensible to the player - to be added.If you're easily frustrated by death, you might dislike this game, but as it stands, competing against yourself to see how long you can last is a main mechanic of sandbox mode.Atmosphere: Really good atmosphere, especially through sound and lighting. The constant howling of the wind makes you feel cold and alone, while I got a couple of good jump-scares from a sudden burst of incidental music and my own character mumbling to herself.Story: Storyline-mode isn't available yet, but there is a lot of good potential for when it is. You can already surmise a number of things about what happened simply from what you can see in the game - dinner still in the ovens, oddly placed corpses... if they stick with the vibe of ""Show don't tell"" it will be excellent.In summary, pretty good as it stands and can only get better. The only reason I -wouldn't- recommend buying it on early access is that this game deserves to cost more - I think the devs may have underestimated what it will cost to do everything they will want to with the game.

								Important note on realism: Hinterland does not aim for the game to be completely realistic, but rather a game that is balanced between game-play and realism. Some elements are therefore not in line with the real world (for example the degradation of items goes a lot faster). There is (currently) no intention of making a separate game mode that is as realistic as possible, although there are talks of mod support to enable this by the community.I bought The Long Dark because I have been searching for a realistic survival game / simulator for a long time. Even though it is not meant to be entirely realistic / simulator, it comes very close. So close that I can state it is the best game I have ever played. I have played a lot of games for many years (a lot outside Steam) so this is quite impressive considering it still is in early access. The game-play is fantastic and is a must for any gamer that is into survival games and crafting. I don't want to spoil it for you, but there are times where I am trembling of fear and excitement. The immersion is so great that I sometimes forget I am playing a game. It is visually stunning and the sound is even better.The game is constantly changing and new content is added regularly (big update each month and smaller ones in between). The developers are enthusiastic and committed and are willing to listen to the community, while maintaining their own vision. While there is currently only a sandbox, story mode is planned for release at the end of this year (which includes great voice actors like Jennifer Hale). The price will probably go up at that point, so buy it while it is still cheap.The Long Dark will not hold your hand and there are no tutorials. It is very intuitive, but you have to use your intellect. There are three game modes. One which is forgiving and primarily to explore (Pilgrim). One that is exactly in line with the vision of Hinterland, challenging but fair (Voyageur) and my personal favourite, brutal and unforgiving (Stalker). I love the challenge in the game (or any game) as there is nothing better than to recover from your near dead experiences. Most people will die, some a lot. As it is permadeath you will lose your hard work. If you don't like dying or to lose your progress, I would suggest waiting for story mode (but be ready to pay more if you don't buy it now). I however love permadeath and (almost) impossible games, which is why I play games that have this (Faster Than Light, XCOM, Don't Starve etc.). Always on the highest difficulty and with permadeath on if this is possible. The Long Dark has a difficulty mode for every kind of player, which is a big plus.To conclude, this game is so amazing that I bought a new Xbox One just to play The Long Dark. I bought the game for my low-end laptop, which was below the minimal requirements. Surprisingly I could play it extremely well until last big update. I felt so sad and empty when I could not play any more that I just had to do something about it. It is all worth it as I am 100% sure it will be a huge success (unlike other early access games). If there are any doubts or questions, feel free to send a message or post on the forum. Hinterland, me and the community are happy to help.			"

The current status list says another update the end of this month, ( Oct ) to add a new location, and other things. I would recommend this at its current price, and with the promise of more to come your really getting a good play for the cost.EDIT: The updated map is here. Its good. 'nuff said. If your looking at this. You want it.EDIT** A lot has changed. The game has really grown. Three maps at this time, which you unlock by traveling to, ( you only do it once, then they stay unlocked ) Lots of new stuff to help you out, and total overall of the HUD. A really good SP survive the cold game.			"

								""One of the most brutal, relentless, and unforgiving titles out there""The Long Dark is one of those games where if you (let's say, die) and quit for the day, you just come back tomorrow and start it all over again because of your need for accomplishment and progression. This game will make you question and value your decisions. In this game, everything you do has a price. That is, that last piece of wolf meat you ate? It's probably the last of food you'll have for days. That last piece of firewood? It will hold you out just enough to keep you warm and to boil you up half a liter of water. That run you want to make? It's getting dark out there. That last bullet in the rifle? It may end up saving your life, or end you.This game revolves around the concept of conservation. Of making wise decisions for your character's benefit. Of making sure you can make it through the day just so you can wake up tomorrow. Being just an early access title, at $20, with just the sandbox and two challenges playable at the moment, I couldn't have spent it on anything better.Remember to play your cards right because mother nature isn't planning on playing nice10/10 (Would get gang♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by two bears again)			"

								I was doing well. I started in a cave to the south and almost immediatly found a rifle on a body frozen into the canyon ground. Excellent, this will make things much easier. Leaving the canyon, I found myself at the Camp Office. A good place to stay after I stocked up on food and firewood there. I even found some bullets. The next day I started to explore the lake, pillaging the cabins for their precious food and supplies, returning once again to the office, my home. On day three I made it to the hunter's homestead, killing a wolf along the way and skinning it. On day four I decided it was time to go to the dam. Rifle at the ready, I opened the door. Nothing. As I start to open lockers, I hear a growl. The dam wolf starts ferociously biting at me as I struggle to fight it off. Eventually, I am the victor and the wolf scurries off down the corridor. Now the hunt is on, I take out my rifle and vow to remove the menace from the dam, and make it a new safe haven. I creep slowly down the hallway, the sights of my rifle in line with my eye. As I round the corner, I hear another growl, I aim, and I fire. I miss. The wolf attacks and I manage to kill it with my knife. Then I notice I only have one percent of life left and I'm bleeding out. I access my medical kit as the world starts to black out around me. I'm dead.			"

								No one to hug, no one who gives me tender words or kisses. I am alone and I am cold. I don't care to build a base. I march frome place to place, living of the things I find. Occasionally I fight with wolves over food and I am happy, if I can make a fire to warm myself and melt some snow to quench my thirst. But then, when the supplies run out, I am forced to walk out into the dark blizzard, freezing, derpived of sleep, thirsty and starving. And after the last shots are fired, and the sharp claws of a wild grizzly tear me apart, I finally welcome the long, cozy dark.			"

								EARLY ACCESS 23/09/2014One of the greatest survival games I have played even in its current state.This game is a great simulation of surviving in a cold winter mountain top, you must hunt for food or let the wolves do that for you since there aren't guns just laying around everywhere. You will have to either melt snow on a fire and boil it to get water or actually find some. You will need to forage for wood which takes aslong as you want but you may come up empty handed.-Gameplay-The game puts you randomly on the map and lets you survive how you want whether that be crawling up to a corner, putting a fire down, rolling out your bed and waiting although you will find that as the night approaches you will not want to stay there as your fire won't last long enough through the night and the cold wind will freeze to death, or close anyway. Tab opens up many options for you too choose from, ranging from inventory to foraging.-Conclusion-The game looks and sounds fantastic and I can guarrente that this game will become so much better as the game develops. The only thing I dislike is the calary metre as it drops too fast in my opinion and even drops as you sleep and when you have to sleep through the night you will need ALOT of food to keep it up.I give it a 9/10 for being fun, unqiue and realistic and definately worth the purchase!YouTube Video:

All warmed up and ready to seek food outdoors? Nope, windy and cold, your pesky jeans wont do♥♥♥♥♥♥ Found a gun? Wow, nice. Now try finding some ammunition.The ""enemy"" is not the wolves, nooo, you are fighting off the enviroment itself. You're always cold. Always tired. Always hungry and thirsty. Me like.			"

								Interesting but get's boring after a while.Doesn't seem to have much of a gameplay right now, just a bunch of mechanics in a sandbox. The problems is those mechanics are pretty shallow. Simply put there is simply not much to do, you just grind eternally, not even the exploration aspect is that good you just end up seeing almost everything there is to see very fast.You'd have better luck playing Project Zomboid or something like that if what you want is a sandbox with better mechanics. And maybe check this later when they add the story mode.			"

Early Access Review
								The long dark looked interesting to me when it was first teased a few years ago. I knew it was still early access and the developer was still working on the game. I gave it a shot, what the heck, support the little guy right? As much as I have tried to love the game, and I have given it plenty of tries over the next few years, its still has not won me over. The mechanics are promising, but need work. You burn through calories faster than an olympic runner, forcing you to constanly move. The fire building aspect seems promising, but it still needs refined though. Everything in the game still needs work. I keep checking back on the store page, hoping that it will be out of early access, but nothing has been done. It seems like the developer stopped working on it and let it drift away. If the game comes out of early access, perhaps it will be worth your time, but until then, I would stay away. The long dark is turning into the long wait.			"

								Do Not Buy.  3 years Early Access, No progress. This is a last minute money grab before they abandon it.Censorship on the dev forums.  You are NOT allowed to criticize anything!This game had immense potential that was thrown away by Hinterland.The Pros:  Immersion, Artistry, Sound, Elements, Exploration, Map sizes.It had incredibly beautiful landscaping coupled with great element effects and sound affects which created intense Immersion.  Maps were HUGE with tons of things to find (if you could) while exploring.  The best challenge was when you were ready to move on, trying to figure out how to get to the next region could really leave you stumped.The Cons: UI, Mechanics and AI.The User Interface was very clunky Combat mechanics just insane.  Calories and weights were severely skewed.  Running was reduced to almost non existent.  The AI for wolves.. *facepalm* just.. BAD.As for Crafting.. im sorta on the fence on that one.  You love it, you Hate it... it needed work. Er.. more work that is.So what went wrong?Well, they just stopped creating new regions and kept tinkering with the UI, Mechanics, and AI.  Admittedly they atleast knew where they were comming up short, but instead of fixing it, they just kept making things worse.  They should have simply acknowledged their strengths and weaknesses and subcontracted another company to complete work on the UI, Mechanics and AI while they themselves fleshed out the rest of the game and worked on the Storyline.  This would have been the smart approach and clearly in the long run, the most economical one. But they didn't, and here they are with palms out 3 years later facing the harsh reality of having to scrap it.It really is sad.  The death of a game that had such amazing potential.At 50% off it probalby isn't a bad buy, just for the exploration / sandbox mode, but don't expect anything more than what you get when you buy it.

Early Access Review
The Long Dark.No monster, pure survival. Yup, 4 kata itu merupakan kata kunci. The Long Dark merupakan game yang mengetes bagaimana kemampuan survival lo ditanah dingin Amerika bagian utara. Suhunya bahkan bisa mencapai -20 derajat celcius. Kalau lo suka game bertemakan survival, mungkin sebaiknya lo baca dulu review ini baru beli.Review ini gue tulis berdasarkan early access dan 5 jam gameplay.Score total = 7 dari 10Storyline:Gak ada. Katanya sih nanti bakalan dikembangkan lagi. Maklum namanya juga masih early access.Grafik:Standart 3D cartoon. Kalau lo liat screenshot yang ada di steam store, mungkin lo takjub dengan berbagai macam scenery nya. Tapi perlu di ingat, itu merupakan scenery lho. Kalau lo terjun langsung kedalam game, lo MEMANG bakalan melihat scenery seperti itu, tapiiiii.... kalau lo liat objek yang ada disekitar lo, lo bakalan sadar bahwa tekstur dari objek disekitar lo bertekstur kartun. Bisa dibilang low budget The Walking Dead Telltale. Nah, animasi yang ditawarkan juga sederhana... kebanyakan yang bakalan lo lihat adalah panel loading loading progress.. pas makan, lo gak akan melihat karakter lo memasukan makanan ke mulutnya, tapi panel loading progress. Mau minum? loading progress. Mau menyalakan api? loading progress. Mau looting? loading progress. Mau crafting? Loading progress. Emang sih terkesan simple tapi kalau hampir setiap action yang kita lakukan adalah loading progress, rada bete juga kan? Kalau lo gak masalah dengan loading progress, its okay. for me, its kinda big deal. Walau pun begitu, lo bakalan merasakan pengalaman yang cukup real. Badai saljunya itu bener bener DINGIN banget. Lo kerasa deh bagaimana angin berhembus dengan cepat dan jarak pandang lo berkurang akibat kabut. Serius. Gue hampir aja mati ditengah badai salju. Gue mencari rumah untuk berteduh dibawah derasnya badai salju. Nyawa gue udah 50%. Akhirnya gue duduk dibawah batu besar berharap badainya berhenti. Tapi karena nyawa gue udah turun drastis, gue nekat! Eh gak nyampe 20 detik, ternyata disebelah gue persis ada rumah. PERSIS lho. Badainya bener bener top banget.Sounds:Salah satu aspek paling keren di game ini. Suaranya bener bener ngebuat lo kerasa banget dinginnya. Badai, salju, jejak kaki, binatang liar, kayu yang terbakar, kabin yang ditiup angin kencang, semuanya itu bener bener keren dikuping gue. Gameplay:Survival, looting, and crafting. Yup, ini bumbu manis banget untuk para gamers di tahun 2013 keatas. Seperti yang lo tau, ini game bertemakan survival ditengah wilayah salju yang liar. Spoiler alert: Lo pasti mati. Yup, ini adalah tipikal game yang gak bisa dimenangkan. Game ini hanya mengetes seberapa lama lo bertahan dipadang salju yang liar. Kalau lo udah gak tertarik, lo bisa berhenti membaca review ini disini. Nah, untuk looting, didalam game ini lo musti mencari berbagai macam kebutuhan dasar hidup dikabin kabin peninggalan penduduk sebelumnya. Lo musti mencari makanan, minuman, baju, tool, dan fuel. Yup secara keseluruhan itu tadi adalah kebutuhan lo didalam game ini. makanan, minuman, baju, dan tool udah jelas yah. Nah fuel ini penting karena mau gak mau lo bakalan kedinginan dan satu satunya cara supaya gak kedinginan adalah lo musti bisa menyalakan api. disini, api gak cuman buat menghangatkan badan aja tapi juga untuk memasak daging mentah. sip, selain looting, lo musti juga pintar pintar crafting. sejauh ini nih, masih sedikit banget item yang bisa lo crafting. bahkan ya, gue udah bisa menebak end game nya seperti apa: sepatu rusa, sarung tangan rabit, dan jaket bulu serigala. Oh lo bakalan mati kehausan. trust me, you will be dehydrated.Kesimpulan:Yup, game ini masih early access. Secara masih banyak banget animasi yang bisa dikembangkan tapi malah dibuat panel loading progress dan item yang bisa dicrafting nya juga sedikit banget. Tambah lagi gak ada storyline dan fakta bahwa lo pasti mati itu yang membuat usaha lo dalam survival rasanya jadi sia sia. thank udah membaca review ini, jangan lupa tekan thumbsup yaa~			"

								We've waited ages for the story mode to come out.  First, they said it would be out winter of 2015.  So, we waited, patient and happy with the game we had and paid for and enjoyed.  Then, when winter came around, they said that they needed more time. Spring of 2016, they said.  And so, a little irked, we said okay patiently, and waited.  Spring rolled around, not even so much as an update to the story mode except ""we're still not finished.""  It's July now.  It's not really about taking things for granted, its about making promises and meeting deadlines.   And if you can't fulfill either of those things, then why should you expect a thumbs up?			"

								Wish there was a way to give this a middle rating rather than a thumbs up or thumbs down, but considering my recent playing experiences I’m going to have to vote down. It's a FANTASTIC game, fantastic concept and really interesting but cons are starting to outweigh the pros about this game. From the developers not being reliable to the game getting too difficult to enjoy.A few updates ago I couldn’t stop talking about this game, now I urge people not to buy it because if it continues the way it is going, it’s not going to be worth buying.update:it keeps losing its quality with every update, abandon hope all yee who enter here. and with every month that goes by, theres still nothing more than the sand box and now a few challanges that again, too hard to have fun.

								The Long Dark is a beautiful, immersive game.  In it's current state you can spend a lot of time enjoying the two connected maps in Sandbox mode.  The gap between difficulties is vast however, and the amount of loot is laughably small in Hard whereas in Medium mode I was swimming in gear and calories early on.  I explored and looted both maps but eventually became bored.  There is plenty of replay value with Hard mode, however, and a new map will definitely bring me back regardless.I have high hopes for this game's future and believe it's worth picking up in it's current state.

The Long Dark is quite a different.You're going to be surviving by yourself. You will die horribly or just stupidly. You can survive for a week and just die embarassingly from freezing because of a blizzard. You can get eaten by wolves. or just starve to death in a matter of I don't know. A few hours? This is what a survival game is. It has a lot of potential. I can go on and on about what they should add. But i'm pretty sure most people have that covered. Love it! <3			"

YouTube™ Video: The Long Dark Review -- Live or Die! 

			Views: 2,275		

			A Kickstarter Backer Review of The Long Dark. A hardcore, realistic survival simulator from Hinterland Games. ►►►Purchase on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/305620/ Welcome to The Long Dark...		

TLD Credits:David Hayter (Solid Snake - Metal Gear)Mark Meer (Cmd. Shepard - Mass Effect)Jennifer Hale (Cmd. Shepard - Mass Effect)Marianne Crawcysk (writer of L.A. Noire, Driver, Far Cry 3, Appleseed Alpha)Raphael Van Lierop (Project Lead - Relic Games, Blacklight, Ubisoft, Activision)Alan Lawrence (Lead Designer - Saints Row 1-4, Freespace 1-2, Red Faction 1-2)David Chan (Audio Director - Bioware) Now that I have your attention...let's explain the credits more in depth and why The Long Dark is a great foundation for an amazing final product.I have been waiting for years, if not decades for a game that makes simple man vs. nature survival the primary focus rather than simply a secondary after-thought. The Long Dark by Hinterland Games delivers a the closest thing to being Survivorman that has ever appeared in a game. They also designed TLD from the ground-up to work seamlessly with the Oculus Rift. The have a dev kit in their studio as of last month in fact.As of this review the game is currently in Early Access (v.119). It was the result of a Kickstarter campaign less than a year ago by Hinterland Games. The concept is you are a small plane bush pilot in Northern Canada when a Coronal Mass Ejection occurs (CME - similar to a solar flare). This causes all electrical components worldwide to fail. Unfortunately, this also caused the plane you were flying in to fall out of the sky into an unknown area in the frigid winter of a forest. You lived through the crash...but will you live through The Long Dark?Hinterland Games was founded by Raphael Van Lierop. Raph, as he's known on the forums, has over a decade of AAA game creation experience. As a creative director, narrative director, producer, designer, and writer on multiple award-winning game titles including Company of Heroes and Warhammer 40,000. His former studios include Relic, Ubisoft Montreal, Blacklight and Activision.Rapheal had the desire to create a first-person raw and realistic survival simulation with a deep story mode. The big box studios said it wasn't ""marketable"" enough. So he took his skills and experience and left. After easily surpassing his Kickstarter goal with his vision of The Long Dark, he grabbed some other highly experienced industry professionals. This inclused David Chan as Audio Director from Bioware. Next to join the team was Alan Lawrence. Alan was the lead designer on Freespace, Freespace 2, Red Faction, Red Faction 2, Saints Row 1-4 and many more. Together the group started Hinterland Games. Their first project is The Long Dark. With plans for future expansions and sequels in the form of seasons. This should be similar to The Walking Dead game series in delivery.Raph didn't stop there, he wants a deep and rich story to go with the realistic survival experience. So he invested a substantial amount of the kickstarter funds into hiring Marianne Krawcyzk as the writer. She wrote L.A. Noire, Driver, Far Cry 3 and Appleseed Alpha. Together Raph and Mirianne will have the story mode out by the end of 2014 with many NPC's characters created from the original Kickstarter backers likenesses.What else did Raph want for his survival game experience?? How about GREAT voice acting... Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale from Mass Effect. And maybe even a guy named David Hayter the former Solid Snake from a little franchise called Metal Gear. I guess Sutherland wasn't available...his loss.So if you are jaded like I was/am on Early Alpha games that alway overpromise and underdeliver, I know this game design team will not disappoint you from experience. See as a kickstarter backer, I got a copy of the game many updates ago. The design team has a clearly defined goal, and future plans for this as a franchise. They are just looking to the community to give feed back to best reach that clear goal. Guess who has the most posts on the forums...each individual from the dev team! They are really that interactive and willing to hash-out and debate concepts with the players who are ultra motivated to help.This leads me to the community. The community is amazing. No trolls, only mature and constructive gamers. Need a question about survival tactics...ask Rob Doar. Have an issue with the forum...Bill Tarling is your guy. Need help re-creating a bug...TattooedMac is your answer. Want to see how long you can survive...how about the long-term survival masters Heather and LordMasterGaming. Want to check out some great videos/livestreams...I'm your guy, Accurize2. Oh but maybe I'm not good enough for you, how about DaSquirrelsNuts or MathasGames...yep they are in the community too!So to summarize this amazing survival game has a great goal. A professional team with decades of experience. And a community that is 100% supportive and helpful to the team and fellow players. The Long Dark is exactly how the indie dev process should be and The Long Dark is exactly how survival gaming will be.Thanks for reading my review, actaully my FIRST STEAM REVIEW EVER!! :DCheck out some TLD gameplay, check out my YouTube channel:www.youtube.com/accurize2Check out my livestreams also:www.twitch.tv/accurize "

Early Access Review
								I have taken sometime to play this game myself and I decided that I should write a review here so that it would be helpful for those who read it and decide whether to purchase this game or not.Get to the point, right now the game is in 'Early Access' so it is not really complete. However, personally, only what the Early Access has offered now worths the money.The very first thing that can be accounted as pros is the the game's very own concept. It is a new dimension of 'survival game', unlike many mainstream survival game lists which involve zombies and mutants to horrify you, this game is another story: just you against the 'Mother Nature'. You are on your own, among the cold, hunger, thirst, tiredness, or even danger from wolves. All you need to do is 'survive'. It sounds simple and uninteresting, but believe me this game is well enough even with this simplicity in this game genre. No safe place with lots of supplies (unless you choose 'Pilgrim' mode). You need to take risks with your own actions. Everything is by yourself.The gameplay ... I don't know if I should classify it as a pro or con, but it is mixed. You can never expect anything from each playthrough; when you restart, everything except the regions will be resetted. This gives you the survival experience to some extends. For example, you might find a rifle, the only 'real' weapon in the game, without any bullets before you find one bullet miles away, or you need a can opener but still yet to be found; what will you do? which way? where is it going to be? Everything which other survival games may overlook matters in this game. You need clothes to keep you warm, raw food, if not cooked well, can be a threat when eaten, or you can even hurt your legs if you do not watch your steps (which happens to me a lot lol). These are some of the situations that I found and I need to give the 'thumb up' for the developer's careful planning so as to make this game as realistc as possible.However, there is something that still bugs me; the wolves. They still lack realistic movements: too repetitive and can be easy to deal with as you get get used to the game. Even though the developer has mentioned something about the wolves, their movements and some behaviors, such as how slow or fast it should be in different situations, are needed for consideration *for developers*. I hope if the wolves are readjusted in the right way it would gives me more exciting experience. Nevertheless, even with this comment I still find dealing with wolves sometimes hard anyway. (I heard that more wildlife will be added, so it might be the solution for this problem as well.)If you are fans of survival game and need a new dimension on survival experience, I suggest you that you buy this and try it once or wait for sometime until the full release comes (Story Mode, I'm really looking forward to that!). My last warning ..""Beware of the wolves, the cold, or even yourself as you play this game"". Good Job Hinterland!			"

								This game is somthing of a niche at the moment. It is a survival game which doesnt hold your hand learning everything; yet the intuitive controls and crafting system makes learning fun. You will die a lot in this game, half the timeby negligence, the other half by wolves (as of now you can turn off hostile wildlife) and really is a trial by error sort of scenario. For example I was on day 18 and was travelling between maps (a pretty cool feature) and was crossing a bridge and was looking at the view when I fell and died.You wouldn't even know its in Early Access. I havent come across any bugs or issues yet. The developers are clearly devoted to the game with the frequency of updates while making the game at its current stage the best it can be.Overall great game, get it.			"

								Awesome game. its fun wandering around and exploring. the sense of danger is unique, its like fighting against your own body versus killing hordes of mindless AI. i think its very unique and original. also very intense. it keeps you working to ensure your survival. this isn't a game for your 5 year old. I also really like how it saves only after you rest or go in a building after being outside for a while.Suggestion:it'd be cool if there was a map interface where you could write notes of what resources you've left in different spots or what things are there. obviously im not asking for a mini map because the way the HUD is now makes if feel more real. but if you had a compass and a map that you could open up i think there would be ways that would make it really nice. rather than a crutch for the player. i don't want a map to tell me where i am but simply be something to show me some land marks..

								Best game I've play in a very very long time. Gameplay is the main factor here but the art style is also very unique and beautiful.Although I'm currently switching over to the DRM-free version of the game I would still very much recommend The Long Dark for all ages no matter the platform.At the moment of writing we only have Sandbox mode which was originally designed for testing purposes and would be removed when story mode is ready to release (which can be any moment now).But Sandbox mode has been such a great success that the developers decided to keep it in the game. And I completely understand why, even without a story this game is huge!Go play it and support Hinterland Studios! ;)			"

								An amazing survival and open world game that confronts you with many choices.  You can either starve, dehydrate, freeze, or get killed by a wolf. Maybe jump off a high cliff? So many ways to die; how will you choose?Still, it's an awesome game that seems to be going in the right direction, with so many more features to possibly be added.  9/10			"

								I am fairly new to the survival game genre, but that doesn't mean i can't recognize a great game. The Long Dark, is freaking brilliant. It is one of those games that tries to be as realistic as possible. You need to watch your hunger, hydration, body temperature, and fatigue. The hardest of the 5 is temperature because the game drops you in the middle of a post appocolyptic arctic landscape with sub zero temperatures. You start with nothing but the clothes on your back and and an old sleeping bag. As soon as you start, it is a race to find shelter, food, water, warmer clothes, medical supplies, fire making supplies, etc. With a variety of maps, some will make this easier than others. The starting map, Mystery Lake, has plenty of man made shelters and cabins scattered throughout. Even so, you always need to be planning where you will spend your next night. If you stay in one shelter too long, you will run out of supplies or not have enough for your journy to the next shelter. Your best bet is taking off at first light so you have the whole day to find supplies and shelter. The game really throw a wrench in your plan though. Often, a storm will develope and eat away your daylight. Storms force you to seek shelter from the wind. You better hope that when a storm comes, you have the necessary supplies to stay in your shelter for however long it last. That means you should always have plenty of food, water, and fire supplies on hand. Storms aren't the only thing that can trap you though. Wolves are also scattered throughout the wilderness. You may find your self trapped in a broken down car waiting for the wolves to leave. Sometimes a flare can scare them off, but don't rely to heavy on that. Basically, this is an awesome game, and a must buy for any survival game enthusiast.			"

								I cannot express enough how much I enjoyed playing this game.  The artwork is beautiful, there are moments while exploring where you cannot help but admire the serenery, it can be breathtakingly calm one minute where there is light dainty snow drifting down around frolicking deer, but beware, mother nature can trap you.... leaving you alone..... in a cold blizzard..... roaming lost as you strive to find shelter.The Long Dark has great potential, I have really liked the content that has been available to us, where I do not need zombies to be afraid or entertained.  I have mother nature and the harsh elements to contend with.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves survival games.I've been running a Let's Play series for this game feel free to check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2QtQQYxhQXzzZD6TPH_lBG2zzBSU-4wA "

Also an online mode with 4 random players or something similar to replace AI survivors would be neat too.IF YOU'RE READING THIS, AND YOU AREN'T A DEV, JUST GO BUY THE GAME! IT'S ON SALE!!!!! "

								Survived 6 whole days cooped up inside an old house with nothing to drink but toilet water and smashed cans of beans. These wolves.. they're not.. normal. They know you're afraid.. The first day started normal, with just a lone wolf in sight. I managed to scare it away with some flares I found. The next day.. It got worst. The lone wolf from yesterday came back with with a pack and chased me down. I threw flares at it, but they ignored it. They're getting bolder. I ran inside the first house I see and stayed there for a day so the wolves would go away. I've made a big mistake.I opened the door to go out scavenging, but instead got pounced by 3 wolves. I fend myself as long as I could, throwing flares, but they were just useless against them now.Day 4. Food is running low.. ran out of clean water and can't start a fire without firewood. I had to go outside to get some. But that would be suicide.Day 5. Their pack is getting bigger. 12 wolves I counted. Circling around the house. I cant take it anymore.Day 6. I died from starvation. Better than getting mauled by wolves I guess.10/10 would starve to death again,			"

								Kickstarted this, and so glad I did. Even in Early Access with no story mode, survival is ultimately compelling. No zombies, no (large scale) crafting - just you vs nature in the cold, unforgiving Canadian wilderness. It's also beautiful and runs well even on lower spec PCs.Highly recommended.			"

								I might update this review as the game develops further. The TL;DR is at the bottom, if anybody's interested.First off, let me say that ""The Long Dark"" is one of the truest survival games to be produced in the year of 2014. Everything in the game is out to get you: the elements, the water, the wolves, sickness, hunger, dehydration, and fatigue, just to name a few. The game does a fantastic job proving how frail the human body is when exposed to these hardships, as well. One cannot go on a murderous rampage of kniving wolves and deer. One cannot travel miles in a blizzard. One cannot carry a rifle, six jackets, enough medical supplies to aid a hospital, and enough food to make people think you robbed a grocer. If one wants to survive, one must avoid wolves, travel light, and travel prepared. One wrong step and it could be one's last.The graphics are quite simple, yet unique for modern games. It's hard to describe, but it borders cartoon-y, in a sense. Finding a human corpse will reward you with a flat-faced man with hands lacking fingers, but it somehow does the game justice of displaying a bleak wilderness that is inhospitable.The gameplay is perfect, in such few words. Every day, one has to question oneself, ""What do I need to do today?"" One needs wood for a fire to stay warm, food and water to stay alive, clothes to stay warm while outside, medication to keep you alive when you're hurt, but one can only do so much per day. These needs will always keep one questioning if what one grabbed from that cabin was the right thing for tonight, or if one dodged that wolf on the railroads, will it have tracked them back to their camp? Every so often, these primal thoughts of food, water, and safety will even have the player making basic statements of ""Need water"" or cursing a wolf's presence. The game also praises (read: demands) players for taking risks and venturing away from one's safe camp to search abandoned vehicles and houses for more supplies, but remember: too much risk and one might run into a LOT of trouble.Some of the upcoming features include a story mode involving a Canadian bushman pilot who goes down after the freak electromagnetic surge which causes the events of ""The Long Dark"" to unfold, AI (and possibly human) survivor interation (which, as far as AI goes, has been teased that some AI are friendly, some are hostile, and some will pretend to be friendly to steal your supplies), and more undisclosed content that has yet to be revealed. After all, this is Early Access.Also, as a final note, the dev team is a new face on the development playing field, but they are certainly not green. With voice actors such as Mark Meer, Jennifer Hale, David Hayer, and Elias Toufexis providing their talents to the game's characters and devs including people who have worked on ""TES: Morrowind"", ""League of Legends"", ""God of War"", ""Far Cry 3"", and ""Mass Effect"". With such a team, not only will a quality game come out of ""The Long Dark"", but it will definitely be developed by a reputable team.TL;DR:""The Long Dark"" is a diamond in the rough amongst all the other survival games of 2014 that is being headed by a great dev team. I would definitely recommend it for everybody masochist out there who wants more challenges.			"

Early Access Review
								TL:DR Definitely worth getting. In the beginning challenging, afterwards still an enjoyable experience. Maybe wait for Story mode though, it was announced for spring 2016 but is delayed at the moment. And I do believe that this delay is for the right reasons.if 95% of early access games are a downer, this one is part of the 5% that know what EA is about.Challenging, atmospheric, tense, immersively beautiful, progression (at MINIMUM for the first 15 hours of gameplay on every run, and you wont get there with the first tries).decent fair explorable area with a 4-5 maps.good learning curve___________________________Oviously there are some things which can still be balanced differently  but hey, during the first 15 hours or so you wont even notice.And there are also things which you might envision to be there which aren't implemented (atleast for now, they do a good job of adding stuff) but generally the game already offers a fair amount of choice and a decent amount of content.
Now then, let's take a closer look:

I have seen this game about a year ago. It hasn't had that many reviews back than and i had to make decisions. I had played a number of early access survival games back at that point and was generally disappointed in the genre as it didn't live up to my expectations. So i decided for another early access game which wasn't about survival and proved to be a perfect hit. I tried a couple more early access games but lost this one vastness of the steam store, while i turned more and more sour in my opinion towards early access, untill about 4 days ago. And I currently 40 hours in, I should get back to studying.

With all the heart that Hinterland is putting into this gem, The Long Dark feels cold, as cold as the land in which you are stranded. It's ruthless and death lurks about everywhere and everywhen. But after a day stalking and exploring your way from hut to hut (only applies to one map), running for your life, freezing half to death you finally take shelter. Dusk has already come and it is starting to get a lot colder. There, struggling to get a fire started, you hear your belly rumbling, your lips dry of dehydration. Finally you manage to light up a small fire. You melt some snow in the last light of the day and take a zip. You heat up your canned food just assuming that you wont have any meat yetand a feeling of gladness, relaxation sets in for a moment. Your struggles payed off. You are still alive. Alive but tired. And thus the moment passes. You go to bed to wake up to another day to explore the world. To gather what you need in order to be unbound from the luck of scavanging, to sustain yourself.

All in all i can only recomend this game. it is definitely worth the 19 € it is currently priced at and already feels like a solid game. But wait there is more! This game actually uses the alpha! I personally can't wait for story mode which is soon to come!

9.5/10 from me

Cheers!

								It's cold. Very cold. The wind is howling, and my temperature is falling, but I have managed to gather the wood I need for a fire. I pause briefly as I pass the carcass of a deer, and consider scavanging some meat, but decide the time it will take me, and the heat it will cost me, are too much. Besides, I have a nutritious tin of dog food to look forward to, if only I can get to the cabin ahead. I trudge into the wind, thinking I have cut it very close this time, but I'm going to make it.Behind me, a wolf howls.Time for the next life...			"

Early Access Review
								I have taken sometime to play this game myself and I decided that I should write a review here so that it would be helpful for those who read it and decide whether to purchase this game or not.Get to the point, right now the game is in 'Early Access' so it is not really complete. However, personally, only what the Early Access has offered now worths the money.The very first thing that can be accounted as pros is the the game's very own concept. It is a new dimension of 'survival game', unlike many mainstream survival game lists which involve zombies and mutants to horrify you, this game is another story: just you against the 'Mother Nature'. You are on your own, among the cold, hunger, thirst, tiredness, or even danger from wolves. All you need to do is 'survive'. It sounds simple and uninteresting, but believe me this game is well enough even with this simplicity in this game genre. No safe place with lots of supplies (unless you choose 'Pilgrim' mode). You need to take risks with your own actions. Everything is by yourself.The gameplay ... I don't know if I should classify it as a pro or con, but it is mixed. You can never expect anything from each playthrough; when you restart, everything except the regions will be resetted. This gives you the survival experience to some extends. For example, you might find a rifle, the only 'real' weapon in the game, without any bullets before you find one bullet miles away, or you need a can opener but still yet to be found; what will you do? which way? where is it going to be? Everything which other survival games may overlook matters in this game. You need clothes to keep you warm, raw food, if not cooked well, can be a threat when eaten, or you can even hurt your legs if you do not watch your steps (which happens to me a lot lol). These are some of the situations that I found and I need to give the 'thumb up' for the developer's careful planning so as to make this game as realistc as possible.However, there is something that still bugs me; the wolves. They still lack realistic movements: too repetitive and can be easy to deal with as you get get used to the game. Even though the developer has mentioned something about the wolves, their movements and some behaviors, such as how slow or fast it should be in different situations, are needed for consideration *for developers*. I hope if the wolves are readjusted in the right way it would gives me more exciting experience. Nevertheless, even with this comment I still find dealing with wolves sometimes hard anyway. (I heard that more wildlife will be added, so it might be the solution for this problem as well.)If you are fans of survival game and need a new dimension on survival experience, I suggest you that you buy this and try it once or wait for sometime until the full release comes (Story Mode, I'm really looking forward to that!). My last warning ..""Beware of the wolves, the cold, or even yourself as you play this game"". Good Job Hinterland!			"

Early Access Review
								If you're looking to buy this game, here's a list of all the pros and cons.Pros:- Challenging to some extent- Beautiful art and sound combination - very imersive- Semi big maps (Sort of feels like the skyrim but instead of just having one huge main map and tiny sub maps, every map is linked together)- Quick access user interface (everything you need is in the screen when you open up the view you want)- There are moments when it is terrifying. There are no jumpscares, long dark uses that psychological horrorific fact that you're all alone.- Good crafting system (but need some improvements at some aspects)Cons- No tutorials. The game chucks you in there and says ""good luck surviving"". You would have no idea what to do at the beginning or where to go, which sometimes causes players to refund the game. If you're the type of person who likes to figure out things on the fly, this shouldn't matter too much.- Restricted crafting. What I mean by this is at the moment, arrow heads can only be crafted at the forge. A forge can ONLY be found at Desolation Point, which is one map out of the 4 maps. If you ever think about hunting with a bow and arrow because rifle rounds cannot be crafted and you started at Mystery Lake or some other map, you're out of luck. You HAVE to travel to desolation point. (Hopefully they add more forges in, but at the moment, 1 forge exists in the game).- There is a tendency to run out of things to do. If you are the type of person who just wants to stay in one place and hide inside a house, I warn you. If you have EVERYTHING you need, you have the tendency to stay in that safe haven and get bored because you run out of things to do. There's no base building mechanics (yet, I don't know if they think about adding it), but if you're just going to stay in one place, you'd get bored in around 9 hours of gameplay straight (because that's how long it takes to get all your stuff as well as getting enough food and everything you need to survive if you know your map enough).Conclusion: Every gaming experience is different. You never know how you'd find the game until you play it. I've listed all the pros and cons of the game and it's really up to you on whether you want it or not. If you do buy it, make sure you have heaps of flares and good luck surviving.EDIT: Nominated for the ""Just five more minutes"" Award			"

								This game is great for anyone who really likes to explore, and even better for those who want a gamne where it's an actually struggle to survive. It can be VERY difficultr at time where you've run out of food, have no more bullets or arrows, you're freezing to death, and a pack of wolves are strairing into your face; however, it can also be incredibly rewarding when you do finally find the hachet you've been so despetrately needing to find, or you discover/ reach a new location that you've been after. The map seems almost endless, and it truly is one of the most in-depth survival game I've ever played.			"

								In this game you fight off hunger, thirst, fatique and of course the cold.As you begin your adventures you realise how beautiful this game is. It's artwork is amazing and will leave you in awe as you freeze to death. Your situation  can go from very good to very bad with some people call the butterfly effect in just a few moments. You venture your way through the regions and you can set up a base camp or become a bit of a nomad, always moving from place to place.The first time you play might be a little discouraging as you run out of sodas and you've just finished the last box of salted crackers.  but try again, it gets better :)Wolves attack - Flares help. (if you fight off a Wolf, follow it, it eventually dies)Bears scare me - but the pelts are nice.Deer offer a good amount of meat and Hide for crafting. (bows or bullets required)Rabbits can be snared (a small amount of meat and hide for crafting)If/when you find a gun, use ammo sparingly. Wolf attacks and Bears are when I use mine.Bows are VERY useful and arrows can be retrieved, however arrow heads are only salvaged from broken arrows or forged.I would reccomend this game to anyone who has ever enjoyed any kind of survival game.

								Now before i start my review, Yes i know i only have 2 hours of playtime but i have learnt how to play the game and how to survive.The Long Dark is a post apocoliptic survival game, it involves crafting and scavaging inorder to survive which is what i found most appealing about it. When you first start up the game you are greeted by the Hinter Land Games logo, (Looks very sexy) My first time playing the game i knew nothing about it. I clicked start new and i had spawned in. I walked around for a bit trying to find a shelter. A dam is what i found full of all sorts of items i was excited to get my survival gaming back but there was a problem... a big... problem... i forgot that while i was on my way there i had sprained my ankle and cut my leg. so i died... didnt last long but hey i kept on playing. I started up a new game on the map for advanced players (forgot the name of it) i got attacked by a bear and♥♥♥♥♥♥my self the animation for being attacked was like nothing i have ever seen before it was like i was playing amnesia i thought i was all of a suddern playing a horror game but boy was enjoying it. i managed to survive the attack and run away and bandage my self up at a nearby farm. I found my self a rifle found the bloody bear and killed it with my bear hands... ( see what i did there c; ) I have now survived for 2 days and 24 hours and 31 minutes, I need to find shelter and i feel like im being followed...The long dark is by far one of my most enjoyed games i have ever played it is a mix of intense survival and the horror of being followed and hunted! i would rate this game a 10/10 for its amazing creativity Hinter Land did a bloody job well done on it and i can't wait for story mode!!!!  ""Bears, scarry, stay away"" -Hydra*Update*I have survived for 4 days and 4 hours and 46 minutes i found an old abandend fall out shelter i have stacked up on surplus that should last me for a week... hopefully.

								This game never ceases to amaze me.  The art style is beautiful and really gives the game its atmosphere.  Ever been out when the snow is falling lightly on the ground and you feel the crunch of the snow beneath your feet?  That is the feeling this game gives you.  It is the ultimate game in atmosphere.  The wildlife is dangerous but not all that common so most of your time is spent just surviving and trudging through snow in the beautiful wilderness.  This game is man vs. nature, not man vs. enemy.  That is what separates this game from others.  It is a fair game about survivng a cold winter.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Also, permadeath in this game is awesome.  The rare encounter with animals makes it so much more terrifying since if you die, you die for good.			"

								I waited a while before buying this in a sale and it is so worth the full price. The game has developed in an amazing way from 2014 and continues to do so. The game idea is a good one. No zombies, no mutants or any other creatures of nightmares. It is just you and your wits vs. mother nature. The graphics and visuals are amazing Hinterland have done a brilliant job with their expansions and improvements. The weather effects have improved so much I have to wear a jumper while playing because it makes me feel cold (My computer is near the radiator too!)I like that there is no tutorial and that the player is 'thown into the deep end' as it were, which I think adds to the experience. I have had no major problems with the game, the last minor one was fixed very quickly by update. Hinterland certainly knows what they're doing. Although I can't wait for the game to come out finished I am prepared to wait for a game that could be well beyond our expectations when finished.I am looking forward to the updates hinterland have planned in the upcomming months, all of which look good. I hope that they add new regions to explore (A small town would be nice,I wonder if they could add candles and a way to make them?).I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone!			"

								The game is early access and still in development. This review is based on build v375 and roughly 340 hours of gameplay. At the time of writing this review, only the sandbox mode and a number of ""challenges"" were available. A story mode which will feature a coherent story is announced, but the release has been postponed several times, and currently no release date has been set.It's a first person survival game set in a Canadian Winter wilderness after a geomagnetic disaster. All electric devices have ceased functioning, whether there are other survivors is unclear (NPCs have been announced for the sandbox for a future update). The player has to battle the adversities of cold, hunger, thirst, fatigue, wild animals and health issues, while exploring abandoned leftovers of civilization. No zombies, no arsenal of super-guns, no vehicles. Just the player against nature or, well, a model of nature.The game pleases with superb art style and sound effects. Sunrise, sunset, starry night skies and the snowy landscape in general are simply beautiful to behold and have been made to look a bit like oil paintings. Everything creates an atmosphere of beauty, but at the same time loneliness and urgency. The player needs to scavenge abandoned houses, cars, forestry lookouts, factories etc. to find means to survive as long as possible. And if you learn the mechanics of the world surrounding you, it is possible to survive for a very long time.The developers kept up a steady pace of updating and honing the sandbox mode, also adding new regions from time to time (there are now 5 major regions, each with its own ""feel""), but have slowed down at some time in 2016. They are super-friendly and give feedback to even the strangest comments from players. There is a dedicated community at the developers homepage (Hinterland Games) which is worth checking out.This game is not for everyone - it does not take your hand. You have to explore it, and the higher difficulty modes may frustrate people not used to overcome obstacles with patience. But for me, only the sandbox mode is one of the best games I have ever played. And I have basically played almost all the landmark games since 1983. I can't believe I only payed 20  € for this gem. And it's not even finished.A number of players are becoming impatient, because the release of story mode has been postponed several times and development seems to have slowed down. However, I for one firmly believe the game will be finished in due time. Even if it weren't, I would still recommend to buy this for the full price. I think the time I have spent playing the game speaks for itself.			"

								My review is that you NEED to get this game. I'm so sick of how Steam has been overridden by zombie survival games, but the Long Dark gives you exactly what you are looking for in a survival game. It gets really gritty once you get into it which is what I would expect from a survival game, andthe art style is also incredible. Recently there was an update for the sound design and weather, making it even more immersive.All in all this is seriously a 10/10			"

								This game is one of a kind and always fun to play even though its not done. The open world and random loot finds make the game much more real. Failure to start fire can make or break you and you pray when ever you loot that, you find somthing to keep you going. Not like anyother game I have played and is a true work of art. There are few flaws and the only thing that I would say to change or fix would be the combat.  I would say buy this and support these guys so they can keep on making this game great it is worth every penny.			"

								BUY THIS GAMEThis game is incredible, and its developers have put unparalleled effort into making it so unique. Everything from the graphics to the game mechanics contribute towards the game's unique atmosphere and mood. Honestly, I would pay 60 bucks to get this game in its final state. It inhabits a frightening, lonely, and unforgiving wilderness and forces you to make life and death decisions, take risks, and face your doom countless times in any given playthrough. Surviving and succeeding is difficult but feels extremely rewarding. The maps are large and diverse, offering room for nomadic play styles and more settling playing styles. There are too many good things to write in this review, so just play the game to find out. It is not without flaws, however. At its current state, it is lacking in some content, although I am confident that the addition of story mode (and hopefully co-op at some point maybe?) will fill in that gap. Sometimes, however, the games mostly successful ""realism"", ends up being a little bit too realistic. Wolves are a bit too aggressive, they should be more territorial and defensive. The hunger mechanics are a bit ridicoulous at times (aka I shouldn't be eating 2 deer, 3 fish, and 2 cans of beans a day...) The coastline highway map lacks workbenches and some much needed fireplaces (Why are their stoves in little fishing huts but not most of the houses?), and there is a very strange lack of roads in the mystery lake map.Overall, the game is an 8.5/10 for me, and thats in its early stages. Definitely buy this one "

But this game changed that.If you like survival games, this one seems to be the pinnacle. I've never before played a survival game that is as much fun or tense. Lemme give you a recount of my first three games.Game 1: Woke up in the middle of the night, in a blizzard. I had no idea where to go and began freezing fast. I realized I had a flare and popped it as quick as I could. I began to run through the woods. As I reached the end of my rope, I saw a small cottage in the distance and I ran for it as quick as I could. I made my way inside and found some food. I waited a day or so until I ran out of food then ventured outside once more.......and directly into the jaws of a wolf. I died, due to lack of food and preparation. I nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥myself when the wolf jumped on me.Game 2: Woke up during the day, afternoon I believe. The weather was relatively peaceful, and I managed to find a group of houses. I picked them apart then chose one for my own uses. Upon slightly stocking it over the course of a few days, I ended up making a fatal mistake by leaving to go exploring. A blizzard hit, and I couldn't find my way back in time before I froze to death.Game 3: By far my most successful one. Woke up around 9 am. I ventured from mystery lake to coastal highway along a set of railroad tracks. When I reached coastal highway I fell off of a cliff and ended up spraining my ankle. I hobbled along until I heard wolves behind me. I moved as quick as I could and at last spotted a cabin. I stayed there for a day, resting my ankle until it was functional once more. I began exploring a series of fishing villages, plundering what I could from the worn down houses. I found a gas station and began stockpiling it. A week passed in game, I had a good thing going. And then those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wolves moved in. I don't know if there is a pack tendency, or if they are randomly placed, or if they aren't supposed to move from one zone to another. But suddenly I had four wolves scratching at my door. I had found a rifle, but only had three bullets. I knew flares would scare them off, but not for good. But then I realized that they were taking down deer in the area. Then I formed a sort of symbiotic relationship with them. I wouldn't kill them and they killed deer, soon after which I'd go and carve the carcass up. I began stockpiling more food, and more, until I had a hefty amount. Day eleven rolled by, and I decided that I wanted to check out some of those ice fishing shacks I had spotted on the horizon. I geared up and made my way out to one. So begins my fatal mistake.I arrived at one and was relatively unharmed for a day. Then a wolf happened by. I had one bullet left, at this point, and I used it on the wolf, figuring it was the only one. Not the case. Three more soon arrived, huddling around the ice fishing shack. I knew that I was on borrowed time by this point. I spent three nights holed up in that shack, (earning the achievement for spending three nights outdoors), then made my peace with whatever God is out there, and I stepped outside. The moment I did, I was pounced and killed. Surviving an epic 15 days and 7 hours.It was amazing. ProsGood survival aspects such as calorie count, which drains as you preform heavy tasks such as harvesting wood, skinning animals, running, etc., and a tempurature gauge (including windchill!) to help you monitor how much body heat you have.The game feels balanced enough (for an early access game, no less) that you don't feel helped along by the mechanics, but they are fair enough to where you can, if you're smart, find or steal enough food for yourself to survive. That's what it boils down to in the end, food. Weather effects are amazing, and there's something to be said for being trapped in a building for three days because there is a blizzard outside. The game is beautiful, it reminds me somewhat of The Telltale games. It has a sort of handpainted, almost comic book look to it. The sound design is fairly well done.

At the end of the day it is an amazing early access game, and one that I would wholeheartedly tell everyone to support. It has an enormous amount of potential, and I would love to see this game be taken further.tl;dr: Great survival game, still in early access, buy it anyway. "

Early Access Review
								The Long Dark is an early access game by Hinterland set in northern Canada. Although it's a survival game, death is inevitable and, in my opinion, inspires the game's title. There is a story mode planned for release by the end of this year, but for anyone who buys the game right now the sole experience will be the sandbox mode.Players find themselves randomly thrown into the wilderness with nothing but the clothes they wear, a few matches, a sleeping bag, and maybe a flare or accelerant if they're lucky. The time of day, location and weather conditions are random so it is even possible to start in the middle of the night during a blizzard. However, even starting in the middle of a sunny afternoon, it will still be cold and bleak, and the player will soon need to contend with freezing, starvation, dehydration and fatigue. All of this is represented in an intuitive status screen that players will refer to often. In order to manage these needs, players must seek shelter and find what remains of civilization, which has been devestated by a mysterious geomagnetic event. This event has also disturbed some of the natural wildlife, and wolves that roam the wilderness are unusually hostile and will attack if the player wanders too close.Even if the player does find shelter and supplies, almost everything found will degrade over time. This includes food, clothing, a hatchet everytime it is used to chop wood or butcher meat, a rifle whenever it is fired, or even a toolkit whenever it is used to try to maintain the hatchet and rifle. This degradation mechanic causes the player to value every decision and plan carefully to maximize resources while continuing the struggle to survive. Although the game is early access, this degradation mechanic has been in the game from the beginning and is considered a core mechanic, so this feature will almost certainly remain in the game all the way until its official launch.Above all, the reason why I love this game is its atmosphere. Because everything degrades, I always feel a sense of urgency. Even if I kill a deer, harvest and cook the meat, and have a whole locker full of venison steaks in my base, I know that it won't be long before I need more. On top of that, if I use a knife or hatchet to help with harvesting the deer, or a rifle or bow and arrows to kill it, I also know that eventually those tools will wear out, so I also must be vigilent in my search to find replacements. Ultimately, the player will run out of tools and materials to keep those tools in good repair. Although a player may struggle on beyond this point, the odds of survival will decrease further and further until, eventually, the player must face death. Although to some this may sound frustrating, on the contrary that challenge of pushing the boundaries is a large part of the appeal. Because tools are limited, the player is encouraged to think of creative solutions on how to minimize the drain of resources.Adding to the atmosphere are also the sound and graphic style. Especially since some of the recent updates, the Long Dark really is beatiful -- that is, when it isn't errie or terrifying. Because the time of day and weather both change, there are lots of different possible settings. It could be a bright and clear afternoon, or it might be midnight with a blizzard that has reduced visibility to three feet. It could be a beautiful sunrise looking out across the landscape from a lookout tower or it might be evening, a thick fog, and the errie sound of wolves howling somewhere beyond.Now, I will end this review with a few points of criticism. Although another wonderful aspect of this game is the sense of exploration and discovery, that does diminish over time. The regions generally have very little that is randomized in terms of the locations themselves. The result of this is that the player eventually learns all of the locations, has very little chance of becoming lost, and no longer sees anything new when traveling the map to gather supplies. I would love it if the game's world could be procedurally generated in the future, but that may be too much to ask because ultimately The Long Dark is being developed with a story mode in mind. Despite this criticism, the world is detailed and fun to re-explore.The other criticism concerns the wolves which, along with the weather, currently represent the primary antagonist to the player. To beginners, the wolves may seem insurmountable because the wolves roam the world in large numbers and are always hostile to the player except on the game's easiest difficulty setting (in which case they are never hostile and always run away). On the other hand, to experienced players wolves become easy to handle and a convenient source of food. I will address my own criticism by emphasizing that the game is still in early access and, unlike other early access titles, gets monthly, substantive updates. In sum, the wolves are generally a fun antagonist but still a work in progress that will continue to be improved.Bottomline: If you like survival games, you should pick this up. I understand some people have doubts about early access. If that describes yourself, you might also consider checking out a let's play to get a better sense of what the game is like. But if you do, be sure to find one that isn't more than a month old (although watch one that's a year old if you want to see how far the game has come in that time). Also, avoid watching too much footage so that you can enjoy that sense of discovery I discussed earlier as much as possible. Lastly, watch the movie The Grey, which bears some striking similiaries to The Long Dark in both its setting and theme.			"

I saw a house and when i got to the door a damn wolf came and killed me. BUT this game is awesome and the most survival feeling game i have ever played, as well as emotional when you are on the edge of dying. Definently looking forward for this to release!Pros: +Survival feel+Wildlife+Good crafting+Large map with many different places and houses to explore+Little to no bugs and lagCons:-Extremly hard sometimes-Fighting with a wolf is useless. You will almost certainly get low health/die.-Clothes does not help alot.Score so far: 7/10(I am sure people will disagree with some of my points, but i don't care. Make your own review)			"

It has an enormous amount of potential, and I would love to see this game be taken further.tl;dr: Great survival game, still in early access, buy it anyway. "

								Literally Canada simulator, because it takes place in Northern Canada. The painting-like graphics are beautiful. No zombies, no freaky creatures, just exploration and survival. No gathering materials to make better weapons or defneses; just gathering enough resources to survive til you reach the next shelter. The environment is a very real and very extreme threat. Looking forward to freezing my butt off again, because as a Canadian I don't do enough of that already.			"

								If you're looking for a true survival game that will test your wits and abilities, this is definitely it. Using your brains to plan your meals, your travel and managing your supplies is vital and making a mistake can quickly snowball for you. This game is one of the few true survival games without an overarching threat (zombie invasion example) that asks if you could survive under possible conditions that could happen today. Just get it and try it. It'll be brutal but as you learn you'll enjoy the true curve and every run more and more.			"

								A somber and lonely trek through the northern Canadian wilderness after an unknown geomagnetic event has put paid to most of the world, The Long Dark shines in its austerity and stylized visuals. Gameplay is largely devoid of 'enemies' save the elements and the player's own entropy. Wolves and bears make an appearance, but they are best avoided- not engaged.Still undergoing development, the game lacks a story mode or campaign, but the sandbox is a blast nonetheless. I took a chance on this Early Access title, and I'm glad for it.Since my purchase a few months ago, the game has evolved in content including playable area (more than triple its initial offering), game mechanics, and depth. The developers' are fully engaged with their game community and much of the aforementined growth has been rooted in player feedback.TLD is a win.			"

This is one game I wish never goes below €5 anywhere.This game... It'll blow you away if you give it the chance to take a deep breath.If I hadn't paid for this game as much as I have, I would've closed it after my first, maybe second inevitable death.I'm glad I gave it multiple chances, really glad. Every time you retry, you make more progress.Before you even realize it, you've survived your first night and even more to come.As many have mentioned, this game has a great atmosphere and really drags you in within the first half an hour. Engaging music, neat graphics and this game plays very risky with light and dark but does so very well.Everything is up to you, realism is at it greatest here.To address some issues that I saw from other users;Yes, this game is hard. If hard games aren't your taste, then don't even bother.Yes, if active action is required in a game for you, this game will be boring and I would not recommend it to you.Yes, this game plays with time skipping, but it does so to stay true to its realism. If you consider what the developers have tried to create here, you would definitely not mind the time skipping when chopping branches, boiling water and much, much more. The game tries to stay as close to real life realism as possible, time skipping is inevitable.But if you can appreciate realism, passive action and many, many retries, look no further.Looking forward to the story mode!

								Awesome Game, Something i have been waiting for a long time. The most interesting thing in it for me is how well they implemented fighting for survival. Other survival games(Early Acces especialy) focus more on building stuff and fighting mutants/zombies/whatever while this one is more realistic. It simply focuses on our basic needs like food/water/body temp. and really makes it challenging while in others its only an addition.Pros(+)- Finally good game on Unity Engine(both graphics and sound)- Surprisingly innovative- Low price compared to other survival games- Quite immersive (especially when u're lost in a blizzard)- Huge worldCons(-)- No jump button- You need too much food(my character's daily need is arround 4kg of meat or up to 8kg of fish)- Too many wolves ( Its just stupid as u go for around 10mins u will surely meet at least 2 wolves on your way, It would be better if they were in groups or at least a bit more clever)All in all as in every survival game you can find yourself sitting in one place and having stuff to survive for over 20 days. Then you starts wandering why should i keep playing as i'm quite safe here. Then you get bored and start exploring leaving a lot behind. - what i ment by this - for now you can't be rescued and there is no plot in game(as far as i know) so only thing you can really do is explore this dangerous but beautifull world. Yet still for me it's experience worth 20 euro! "

								Gameplay is very well polished and I haven't encountered any game breakng bug (crashes and etc.). Also preferred the way they handle resource gathering (like chopping trees and transporting item), '7 days to die' and 'the forest' for e.g. has actual physics with the tree toppling and stuff but it usually ends up with really annoying physics game. The most important part of this game is that it actually feels like a survival game i.e. the world is always trying to kill you (the damn blizzard, the damn wolf or the damn bear). Initially you might survive on looting the abandoned world, but sooner or later you will need to start crafting your own stuff. Although your character gets more skilled overtime, making it easier to start a fire or gather resources, sooner or later you won't be able to maintain real world gear (knife/hatchet and etc.) and will have to start using makeshift gear (improvised knife, animal skin clothing or even magnifiying glass to start fire). Nothing is permanent in this world of TLD, eventually everything runs out, until then, you try and survive for as long as possible.TLDR:If you enjoy survival games that sorts of parallel real life survival, or if you are sick of incomplete and broken survival game out there, you will definitely enjoy this game. My only hope is that the dev don't rush it and properly finish TLD.			"

								It is become a nice game, no story mode yet.At the beginning of my playing i wasn't so keen with this game because there's no JUMP button, (really important to me to give that impression of freedom), and i died easily several times because i couldn't calculate well my resources or was attacked by wolves, but after a few deaths this game started to become really challenging, always asking for extra attention to the survival details, i died like 10 times but my curiosity asks for more, i want to go further with my exploration and i need to apply tactics to it, as soon as i'm dead again i realize that i played for a good couple of hours, hours that usually are flying away with this game, nice one. I wonder for how long i'll play it till i get tired of it, but if the story mode is going to be released i guess it will be one of the most interesting and challenging games of the year.It becomes really addictive!

								Best stuck in an ice box being attacked by wolves simulator on the market. Great fun to be had being frustrated and desperate anyone could ever hope for as a survivorlist. If you're into surviving under harsh conditions, this is a must buy. The price will only go up. Being early access, I was surprised to not come across any bugs or glitches yet- only limited game modes. (ie story isn't ready yet, but there's two sandbox maps) Awesome break from the survival horror tropes. Feel tension build in your gut as your pushing up a hill into the icy wind and you see a cabin in the distance...just 200 meters away...your teeth are chattering and you're freezing to death.

								This is addressed the people who are posting negative reviews and the others that are not buying the game because they read a negative review.Just did a quick look at the top games and most have 70 -80% good reviews. Currently The Long Dark has 93% good reviews.The game is in EARLY ACCESS which means a work in progress. Read the devs description below:""Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops.Note: This Early Access game may or may not change significantly over the course of development. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you may want to wait until the game progresses further in development. “***THE SANDBOX IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF IMPROVEMENT, AND IT ISN'T FINISHED. BUYING THE LONG DARK ON EARLY ACCESS SUPPORTS OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE IMPROVING THE GAME.*** While the game is already very stable and highly playable, the Sandbox is constantly evolving. Features and balance tuning may change from version to version. Content will be added, some may be removed, and entire systems might change or disappear. We appreciate your patience as we go through this process of evolving the game with community feedback.We'd like to expose the Sandbox portion of the game to as wide an audience as possible so that we can derive maximum playtesting value before we launch the game ""for real"".and from steam:""What is Early Access?Get immediate access to games that are being developed with the community's involvement. These are games that evolve as you play them, as you give feedback, and as the developers update and add content.""Also to the whiners ""ohh i spent $20 bucks and there is not much to do"" or ""the world is small""  again the devs have addressed this on the main page as below:“The full game will offer both the Sandbox and Story modes -- i.e. the Story mode will be entirely new narrative content that lives within the Survival Sandbox. The Sandbox will also offer more content at full launch. If you buy the game on Early Access now, you will immediately get the Sandbox Mode, and will also get the Story Mode once it launches (final # of episodes to be determined).”So for those thinking about buying the game do it. It is a work in progress but has huge potential. It looks and feels amazing. Look at all the positive reviews and all those people that have had a great experience playing this game even though the devs are months away from a full game.This game has given me shivers and made me jump so many times.

								Great game, This game gets a 7 out of 10 but of course it is still not finished, but very playable.  I hope to see more things to consume your time with in game other then just surviving if need be.   Playing Voyager I am at the point where i have survived 151 days, only explored 26% of the various areas of all maps combined, have a huge stock of firewood , water, food, clothes and pretty much everything.    decided to do timeberwolf mountain map without a gun and left most of my supplied in pleasant valley.   so more to do would be great as its not very challenging at this point.  Obviously stalker still would be more challenging, but perhaps i don't want the animal behavior or damage to change and i just want to enjoy the game more, would be nice.  With the amount of time I have survived, spring should be here (I'm from the area depicted in the game)Also it really bugs me that the fish in this game are not representitive of british columbia. There should be Trout (lakes) and Salmon (ocean) or other apropriate fish.I look forward to seeing the storyline really change the game in ways we players  had not concieved , but so far really enjoyed the sandbox.

Early Access Review
								This is a first day review. I've only played TLD about 4 hours at this point. I had to quit out of my 3rd playthrough, in which I have been alive for about 3 days, in order to go to sleep (in real life). However, I didn't want to do this. In fact, I really wanted to keep playing... scavenging... scraping by...... surviving. This is the magic of The Long Dark. I was hesitant to make the initial purchase, but I went with my gut and I have not since, in any way, shape, or form regretted doing so. This game is unforgiving, ruthless, and requires constant thinking and moving - or you die. And die you will. But this, however pointless as it sounds, is what makes the sandbox mode (the only mode available for the early access) so damn appealing. Each time you start over, you begin to pick up on things you didn't previously. You learn how to manage your resources better, how to assess and prioritize which needs should be met, and all the while you watch the clock and count the hours that go by with intensity and hope, however small that hope is - to live just a bit longer... to hold on, to find a way. The Long Dark is absolutely amazing and simply downright a blast to play. I can honestly say that it has me excited and hooked already. I'm looking forward to the Story mode, but for the time being will be completely satisfied with hammering away at the Sandbox. As of this moment I'd probably give TLD an 8/10. Well done, Hinterland Studio. Well done.			"

Early Access Review
								Game makes you never wanna go on a hike ever again, 10/10Seriously though. I have NEVER played a more atmospheric survival game. The immersion factor of the world is unbelievable, and being in it not only has you on the lookout for its more wild inhabitants, but also has you looking for dangers like hunger, thirst, exhaustion and the weather itself. Speaking of weather, the game beautifully displays the changing of its many dynamic conditions available. These conditions, whether it be snow, fog or the powerful wind whistling in your ears as you trudge through the world, all convey the sense that it IS a fight for survival, and you'll need to do everything you can to win.In its current alpha state, the game is VERY good. Although some systems need refinining, some optimization issues are present, and some more stuff needs to be added to make it a complete package, the game is still VERY fun and worth a buy for anyone looking for a game that will make you consider every possible decision, regret every time your fire goes out, and make you dread every howl you hear at night. This was only on my first run, so if I come across anything else worth noting soon or in future updates, I will update my review. EDIT 1: So, I've put a lot more time into it. As I've played there are some more notable things I haven't talked about yet, and my opinions on what could make the game even better.The systems. There are systems in this game you'd struggle to find in a modern AAA games, such as the different things affecting your ability to buld a fire, the amount of calories you have in your system, and the likeliness you'll be able to succeed in crafting (although this feature is rather undercooked at the moment. When you're cold, you can't do things effectively. When you're tired, good luck carrying all the gear you picked up. Hungry? Better check how old that venison is or else you might succumb to food poisoning. Things like these make the systems in the game feel fleshed out and more realistic, for lack of a better word, than other survival games on the market.Now, as much as I sound like I have no problem with this game (though the features that are currently present DO undermine any problems I have) there are some cons to the game, and ways to make them better. 1. Map size- The map is not as big as I would have originally hoped. Now, I know this is only the first  map of many, but I had memorized the layout by my third life (which was very short). After you've memorized it, the exploration factor which I loved in my first couple hours started to fade.   2. Combat and item use- Combat in The Long Dark revolves either around taking your foe out at long-range with a rare hunting rifle, or letting them jump on you and hopefully building up you attack power, and punching them off this way. I feel there should be a way to use a hunting knife or hatchet during a close quarters situation to be able to kill a wolf. I know, in real life you probably wouldn't be able to react this way when a wolf starts chasing you, but it gives players with low health and other status effects, i.e. starvation, exhaustion or a sprained ankle, a chance to survive a wolf attack instead of running away. And it doesn't have to be easy, just something players can do for a last chance.3.  Inventory- Lastly, inventory can sometimes be a pain to manage. Although it gives you a feeling you need to take what you truly need to survive, I sometimes wish you had more of a carrying capacity, or maybe it could fluctuate depending on your condition. The capacity DOES however change based on what status you're at, but the change is only made between when you're exhausted and when you aren't. These things will change, I know, because it's still in Alpha. For the content you get right now, the game is still worth every cent you throw at it, and I'd highly recommend it in it's current state.			"

								I've followed this game from late 2014 and much has happened since then. HUD has seen many changes. Gameplay tweaks have made it more fluent. New mechanics have been introduced. Yet the game feels very empty for me. There is nothing to do or see. I have done it all. Even the challenges dont help it because most of them rely on the aspect that you dont know the lay of land. At first I thought that Hinterland is a different studio compared to the rest of the indie developers but no. Its the same. They have showed that they have 0 (ZERO) interest in making the story mode and finally making the game complete. All they want to do is keep to the game in EA and keep milking the cash from ""Major updates"" that they produce (read; tiny gameplay changes and small mechanics that dont serve the game e.g smithing). Story mode was promised to us in Spring and I can understand that sometimes you might need more time to make it. But things get a bit hypocrite when you still keep developing sandbox.Wish I could get my money back from this fraud.			"

								So far, this game is very impressive. Despite a somewhat low polycount on the graphics, the game is aesthetically pleasing. Thematically speaking, there is the slight sense of terror opening each and every door, entering every abandoned home. You never know what could be waiting for you.Sadly, there really isnt anything ever waiting for you other than an empty house. Still, there is that ""empty house"" fear that kinda tugs at you a bit. As for the survival side of things, I didn't find the game terribly hard. Some mechanics don't seem to make too much sense. With a lit fire, I never saw my warmth level change and I still ate raw meat and saw no option to cook (this could be me being stupid.) That said, I enjoy this game. Its very similar to the forest/unturned/etc. The survival game movement is definitely getting too big for its own good, but this game is worth the investment. "

								9/10Dispite being in alpha, this game delivers. It has no zombies, no machine guns, no multiplayer (yet). You are left alone in the cold, fighting mother nature. There are no jump scares or spooks, becuase the only scary thing this game needs is survival. The only problem I have with The Long Dark is its loot mechanics and map. The loot never respawns, and it is possable to never find a rifle in the map. The maps are small, but I like how you can travel between the two. This game definetly could use some more work.			"

								I have backed this from the outset on Kickstarter. I liked the lineup of Dev's and the trailers where eerily exciting.I won't say the game is perfect yet, but when I'm sitting with my headphones on, and hear every little breeze, breath and howl, I'm in the game. There is still work to be done on the whole eating/warmth area, but as a EA, I am happy with the gameplay. I have played through so many times, and I still love the feeling I get wham I'm searching a frozen corps, in the middle of the wilderness, and I have visions of hunkering down, and ravaging the beef jerky I just found, to take away the stomach rumbles, and enough to get me to the next place I'm trekking too.If you are looking for a shooting/hunting game, where you have to go out and hunt deer to eat, then this isn't for you. As a Survival Sim, the Developers have dome a great job, to make you believe that you tare there, surviving, having to repair your jeans, before you head out to forage wood, so you don't freeze to death. I for one, am very happy with this game, but it is a really different learning curve to any other game you have played. There is a system to surviving, and once you find that, you will be wanting to get back to it, to beat that 20 day run. Can you make it to 30  . . .?? I give it a thumbs up, because I'm excited to see where this is going, and considering we are 5 days in to it, and its EA, there is a LOT of room to move and make this such a beautiful world to explore.The soundtrack, voice overs and Art is worth the look, and price of admission :D			"

								This is a solid framework for a huge survival hit. You take on a first person perspective of someone dropped into a frozen wasteland after a plane crash.  I've had three or four run throughs (all but one on the Mystery Lake sandbox). The first one was just a feel out, then I restarted with a good sense of the controls and when traveling was a good investment. My first two deaths in this game were both freezing to death, and I felt like I deserved those deaths as I ran out of food and had to go out to search for more resources. Fun, gritty, atmospheric. I was ready to be addicted to this game.The whole time during the early playthroughs, I had noticed wolves, and my thoughts were always, ""Man, there are a lot of those."" I always managed to keep my distance and keep an eye on them, so they never got to me. But I never enjoyed wolf encounters much. It took the game from a thoughtful, atmospheric survival game with lots of satisfying resource management and time for reflection to a Liam Neeson ""The Grey"" action game that takes me out of the world and makes me desperate to avoid something akin to a jump scare, since it is for all intensive purposes impossible to win a wolf struggle with any consistency.In the most recent runthrough, a wolf in the dam on Mystery Lake actually did jump-scare me. I was followed by two wolves into the dam, and without a sound or sight of this other wolf, it jumped on top of me and destroyed me.I actually liked how panicked the struggle made me feel, fighting for survival. But based on what I've seen in game and what I read on the forums, wolf encounters are far too frequent, and the struggles far too frustrating to be a major game mechanic. They destroy any resources the player has accumulated, make skill improvements become meaningless, and are a complete buzzkill for the morbid majesty this survival game otherwise does so well.Indeed, that is my biggest complaint: the wolves seem to remove the player from the measured, thoughtful, immersive scrape for survival and make the game lose some of that novel ""the elements are slowing killing me"" feeling.Maybe my vision for the game differs from that of the developers, and they do want that higher stress, more action packed, more sudden deathy atmosphere that the wolves provide. But if that is the vision, they will lose the following of me and hundreds of others on the forums.If their vision is mine of survival as long as you can on your wits and abilities in a quiet wasteland, then I recommend they change wolves entirely. Far fewer, maybe 2 or 3 total on the sandbox maps. They only attack you if they are desperate and you are weak. The wolf struggles add just a little bit of excitement to the game, and so should be present in just a small dose.I recognize this game is in alpha at the time of this review, and wolf balancing is a major issue on Hinterland’s plate. I will continue to watch it and play it, though if wolves or other wildlife attacks become the “main enemy” of the game, then it will lose my support moving forward.Otherwise, the game is excellent. The mechanics of hunger, exhaustion, thirst, and cold all work pretty well, and are improving as the game develops. The atmosphere and art are taking an excellent direction, the crafting system shows a lot of promise, and the coastal highway map shows the developers will be able to include multiple compelling locations with different survival challenges in each.It should consume a few hours of your life, and if the wolves come under control, it may just be the next addictive hit on Steam.

Early Access Review
								I've played TLD ever since it was released in Pre-Alpha, and I have to say it's come a long way since then. TL;DR If you're looking for a survival game that's atmospheric and beautiful, yet simutaneously challenging and terrifying, this is the game for you.Here's the meat:Devs: In a word: EPIC. The devs send out massive updates year on year, adding more flora, fauna, items, crafts, maps - the list goes on. Owning this game is essentially owning the rights to new content on a semi-regular basis. None of that DLC rubbish. Just pure and honest content. The devs make TLD a worthwhile investment.Atmospherics: You can tell Hinterland Studio spent a great deal of effort on the quality of their sound effects. Playing TLD with dolby 5.1 surround sound headphones in the dark room is enough to convince me that I've been transported to a frozen post-apocalyptic wasteland. Aside from sound quality, environmental elements like dynamic weather effects (e.g. strong winds actually feel strong as they sway even the largest of trees) adds a layer of immersion most triple A titles often overlook. In fact, TLD hinges on its ability to deliver quality atmospherics and environments. I found myself sitting at the top of a hill just watching the waves crash against the icy coastline against the backdrop of the sunset for about 5 minutes. It was the most zen moment in video game history, I assure you.Visuals: Don't expect mindblowing post-processing, hyper reflective, overly filtered, mind-numbing graphics from TLD. It simply just isn't that type of game. It represents its own stylised version of reality. It kind of looks like a beautiful watercolour painting, except it's interactive and you get to explore it. It may even turn out to be a master stroke (pun intended) on Hinterland's part to design the game this way - using the Unity engine - as it makes the whole visual representation of the game timeless. In other words, if you play this game in 5 years time it won't look dated in the way some triple As do when it's been a while.Gameplay: Ah finally, the gameplay. Arguably the most important factor in any video game. I'll get to the good parts in a second, but there are couple niggles I have to contend with first. 1) movement feels a bit clunky and unrefined. And 2) the inventory management system is overly complicated and lacks visual representation. It can make it hard to locate items if you aren't sure what category it belongs in. For instance, instead of just having a list of items on a grid, how about an image of the bag with compartments that clearly designate what kind of item would be found there? It's difficult to imagine fitting a rifle the length of your leg inside a bag. You could show it slung onto a silhouette of the character's body, and when it's not there, have a silhouette of the rifle, indicating that it would be there if you had one. Just a suggestion. Another aspect that bugs me is the lack of hand animations. Given the attention to detail elsewhere in this game, it's a little strange to find that Hinterland overlooked this. For example, you become a handless person who can magically reload a bolt action rifle with your mind. Sensational, but immersion-breaking. Who knows, maybe it'll come in an update.It's not all bad though. Rummaging though houses and buildings for resources is simple and streamlined, so it doesn't feel like a chore. There are enough props and containers to make sure you aren't opening and closing the same closets and drawers time and again, and the items available for the user to find are worthwhile. I also love the fragility of the player because it doesn't take much to kill or injure yourself. What might look like a relatively small hop down from a rock might end up breaking your ankle. It makes sense, as you're likely carrying ~30kgs on top of your own weight. Even worse, once you die, there are no reverting saves. When you're dead your savegame is automatically deleted, which makes the prospect of death all the more terrifying as you extend your run. But that's the fun of it.However, my absolute favourite element of this game is its emphasis on exploration. The playable area is huge, with every individual map weaved together via corridors of travel. So if you decide upon say 'Mystery Lake' instead of 'Coastal Highway' as your spawn point, you can always crossover during your run. Each map also offers its own unique level of difficulty, so exploration comes at a cost. But sitting around in a cabin for 40 days will ultimately see you run out of resources in your immediate area, so being nomadic is part of the experience. That doesn't mean you can't be sedentary though - but don't expect to see past 50 days unless you're meticulously resourceful.Conclusion: It's worth every penny. The sandbox nature of survival means that there's lots of room for replayability. The attention to detail will have you totally immersed, whilst the fragility of your character means every decision you make has to be well planned and well executed if you are to live to see the next day. You won't find another game on the market quite like TLD.			"

								I'll admit, it was the unique art style of The Long Dark that initially drew me in.  I loved the way the lighting seemed to work with the stark contrast between the whites and browns of nature and the reds and chestnuts of man man objects.  There is no denying the game is absolutely gorgeous, and it succeeds in making you want to kick down your front door and go exploring.However, you had better pray that you can find a hammer and nails to reattach that door before the sun goes down.  The beauty of The Long Dark is also it's most dangerous aspect.  It's easy to get lost in the wonderful landscape that Hinterland Games has crafted, but underneath a black night sky with plummeting temperatures it is only a siren's song.  Wolves will stalk your trail, seemingly alert to your deteriorating condition.  Sometimes, the only way you will know their presence is through their foreboding howls, following you as you desperately seek shelter from the freezing cold and brutal wind.Eating food, staying hydrated, rested and warm are essential to survival in The Long Dark.  You will find supplies like candy bars, pork & beans, beef jerky and military food packets to help you stay alive.  The attention to detail is delightful even if it stands in the way of your best case scenario for living another day.  Canned food requires a can opener to access, unless you want to smash it open and risk losing some of the food.  Your character will make remarks when he/she is hungry, thirsty, cold or tired and you would do well to take care of these ailments before they start affecting your condition.  When your condition meter reaches 0%, you will finally succumb to the Terrible Outdoors.  The Long Dark will give you stats on how long you managed to survive and what you died of before sending you back to the main menu.The alpha version of the game features a Survival sandbox, with a story about a Geomagnetic disaster coming later with the full game release.  For now, purchasing the Early Access version helps the studio identify and fix issues with the game, and helps them fund the overall project through release.If you love open world games with gorgeous visuals, unique gameplay, and you have the desire to see how long you would survive in the middle of nowhere with limited supplies;  The Long Dark is for you.

Beautiful graffics, stunning features and really tests your survival skills! My only problem is that I get scared wayy too easily!! Haha but that makes it even more fun I think!

								Became super boring and super tragic, super fast; just not fast enough to get a refund. :(Once you realize that you can never improve your life, and that you simply find and use up the resources of the map until you run out and die, it becomes so completely pointless to me. I'm sure that is the point of the game, but I am not interested in that in the slightest. Give me a world in which I start with nothing, fine, but let me be able to grow and build into something worth living for. But just pure fatalism? Nah. Not interested. ....Shame, cuz it's pretty looking.			"

								I was never really fan of survival games, and after purchasing this during a sale, I'm still not.After wandering around and enjoying the beautiful scenary, it just wasn't for me as there is no real reward for survival. I originally purchased this games as there was a promise that a story mode would be realised, but I think it is just a ploy to trick more people into buying the game.Unfortunately I feel with certain 'Early access games' they tend to just abandon any future ideas once they have made a bit of money, as it has been in 'Early access' for 2 years now, with still no date as to when the storymode will be out.

								Yet another game which was sold on the back of an extravagant crowd funding pitch only to fall woefully short of its promises. Nearly three years after funding, the story mode (the primary motivation behind my purchase), still has no estimated delivery date. And in fact, there was a rumor that it would be sold separately from the survival sandbox which it exists as today. Firstly, if that is true, that's a bunch of crap. The whole reason I purchased the game in the Alpha state was because I was excited for said story content which sounded to be right around the corner. If the game had been pitched solely as yet another survival sandbox, I would have passed, as there are already a countless number of those about, most of which are better than this one.Secondly, the Sandbox as it exists today (and actually 2 years ago as well) just isn't very fun, it's tedious. There's really no point to exploration, and in fact usually leads to an early demise. Which is fine, because there's no real point in surviving anyway. I guess to see how far you can go and pat yourself on the back if you made it longer than previous attempts? This gameplay, as it is, gets old fast.			"

								Very polished for an early access title, The Long Dark, it a fun thought slightly limited game. Once you’ve played enough to memorize the maps the gameplay can become stale, though the introduction of a story mode in the final release hopefully will change that. The items needed for survival are generated through the map randomly which spices up the gameplay, but I wish there were more enterable buildings and shelters. Maybe more will be introduced in the coming updates. Ending on a very favorable note, the developers are transparent and really make you feel like you’re being heard. There is no radio silence like some early access games. Overall, The Long Dark is a favorable experience and worth a buy. It is one of the best survival games out there at the moment and I’m excited to see what the full release has to offer.			"

								Latest update: It's a few months into 2017, and still no ETA on the story/campaign. I want to believe.Update: I'm so damn sick of games sitting in Early Access for years. There is STILL no ETA on an actual story mode or campaign. The number of devs simply do not correlate with the progress that has been made.Update: I hate writing negative reviews, and as soon as this gets out of early access, I'll do my damndest to give it a good review!It's really close to being awesome, but some horrifically stupid hangups get in the way:- It is nearly impossible to defend yourself from wolves over the long term. In real life, I would grab a big stick and use it. Not in The Long Dark; no, you can't use your axe or find any intelligent way to ward the wolves off after your flares run out.- I survived for nearly a month and only found half of the ingredients needed to make a bow and arrow. It's ridiculous that you need to find 2 different types of rare tree saplings just to make a simple bow. How about making a spear instead, or even just a pointy stick?- Clothes degrade at least ten times faster than they do in real life.- Thirst accumulates faster than it does in real life.- Hunger accumulates faster than it does in real life (but is much closer to accuracy than thirst, and it drains accurately while sleeping)However, the temperature balance seems polished and well-implemented, and the ambiance and art style are nice. The main complaint is that the constant threat of wolves is not offset by the common-sense ability to pick up and use a freaking stick, or maybe not be so damn picky about your choice of bow and arrow materials (alternately, maybe maple and birch saplings shouldn't be rarer than the lost city of Atlantis).

								Waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting...Is it done yet?  No.  The new textures and tuning values are much more important than the actual content and gameplay, apparently.  An archaic saying comes to mind:  ""If it's not broken, don't fix it.""  The game is constantly updated with meaningless tuning fixes, overhauls to systems that are fine, and general developmental distractions.  What began as a work of art has been corrupted by Early Access, a millieu of persons all demanding their stupid ideas (and they are stupid) be implemented in someone else's craft.I'll edit this upon full release.  As it stands now, I do not enjoy this game whatsoever, which is disappointing as I was quite immersed in it during previous builds.  One day, the feel/vibe just changed, and I could not immerse myself in what felt like a childish copy of the game I was previously playing.  For the sake of sanity, do not play it until the full release.This game is still in Early Access, but a sequel has already been announced.  This game, The Long Dark, will now only be the first ""Season"" of a game, and not an entire game.  Some people say that this was decided from the very beginning, but I only recently caught wind of it, and would never have been remotely interested in this ""series"" with that knowledge.  I will never be able to recommend this game, as I will never buy the rest of it.  And here I thought I had a game, not a made for TV mini-series.			"

								Right straight off the bat, this game is brutal. In my 2 hours of gameplay at time of writing I've died twice and been attacked by wolves 4 times. Yet I've enjoyed every minute so far, and it really feels like I've played for much much longer.The mechanics are rather simple, and therein lies the games strength. Keep yourself rested,warm,fed,watered & out of trouble to survive, everything you do burns calories, so make sure you have enough to stay fit.The world is stunningly realised and if wandering around aimlessly wasn't so fatal, I could spend a long time exploring the initial map the sandbox mode currently has available.Time for a few minor gripes. Whilst you do need a lot of calories to survive in the cold (approx 6000-8000 a day) the game does burn through a considerable amount more than that. I checked when indoors, with a 'feels like' temperature of 19C (i.e. typical room temperature) with all my winter gear on, I was burning 200+ cal per hour, so almost the expected cold requirement, only at room temp. Whilst increasing this value for gameplay reasons is understandable, I have basically spent my entire play time so far both hungry and eating almost constantly.My only other gripe is the wolves, and the systems designed to combat them. There are a lot of wolves, and they are very aggressive (pretty much attack on sight) and can be warded off with flares. But if they attack you, the only course of action is to frantically punch them, which can get slightly silly if you have a knife on your character.Wrapping it up, overall an enjoyable, robust experience (especially for early access) that could do with a few minor balancing changes to avoid having to eat near constantly just to prevent your hunger level getting worse. Also as it's in the trailer it's not much of a spoiler, yes there is a wolf in the dam, his name his Fluffy, and he respawns.			"

								So in 2013 I did a race that was considered one of the toughest mountain bike races in the world, The Tour Divide.  It extended from Canada to Mexico over the Continental Divide, unsupported.  We started in Banff, Canada and rode out from there where we were left to our own wits and survival.  Everything I had for the next month was on my bike and that's how I lived.  The Long Dark, while you're not on a bike, is a bit like the race.  You're constantly wondering if you have enough food, enough water, was there a predator lurking about (not wolves, we had to worry about Grizzlies).  In the game, you do this, you figure stuff out and it's fun... depressing, but fun.This is the first game I'm actively avoiding all videos, how-to's and spoilers because I want to figure it out on my own, take my time and enjoy it.  The artistic beauty, grim deaths and isolated gameplay really throw me back in the Tour Divide pushing my bike up the side of a mountain in the middle of the night, alone and freezing.As a casual gamer who lightly plays games, I cannot recommend this enough.  I feel drawn in and ""cold"" when I play it and it's a haunting comfort to hop in and play. It does come with a few snags and that's mainly performance on my Macbook Air.  It gets a little sluggish in fullscreen but runs fine in a smaller window.  I don't mind.(Also if you're interested, I wrote a book about the Tour Divide race which has some similarities to The Long Dark.  You can find out more at http://www.softpedaling.com).			"

								A true masterpeice in the making.The artwork is simply amazing, visuals, music and atmosphere.Exploration, survival and crafting balanced to give a fulfilling gameplay.An experience I expected in other games that never quite acheived it.Here we have a sim-crating-management-survival-exploration title.We play games to escape reality, in a digital world.To have fun, to feel something else, intense or calm.Of all the games I've played this is the one i'd settle in, near the mystery lake in the small cabin.Thanks to the developer's team for this title, really enjoying your work.Gudsy "

								The Long Dark is an different type of survival game that challenges players to do something that, at times, they no longer do while playing a game. That is paying attention. To everything. The first two hours were simple and easy. I found a rifle, knife, hatchet, ammo, and crap loads of food. Wolves did not scare me. The weather was no longer a threat. Then I walked into the Dam and, while looking around for supplies, was prompty f#$ked up by a wolf that I didn't see. That is where the challenge is in this game. Pay attention. To everything. All the time or you will die.			"

								Instantly The Long Dark makes you alter your play style different. Everything can take a toll on your character such as spraining an ankle while walking down a steep slope or getting sick from unboiled water. For this current state of the game it is truly at a solid and sets the foundations for a lot of further potential.My only concerns are that the current level is relatively small and perhaps the developers should reconsider the possible of a Coop or Multiplayer option. While The Long Dark offers a great & unique experience, I worry that without a multiplayer function, it's replayability is limited. However it's possible that once development reaches a further point, the extent of more content might solve this problem in it's self.Overall it is highly worth checking out and worth every bit of the $19.99 price tag			"

Early Access Review
								I have been following this game since the Kickstarter last year. (Which I backed) I had pretty high hopes for this game and it showed great potential. As many other reviewers pointed out, when this game first released into Early Access it was almost unplayable. You froze within minutes of starting, or you died of hunger within minutes of starting, or you ran out of calories within minutes of starting, or you died of thirst within minutes of starting or you get killed by a wolf within seconds of starting. Yes, seconds. Once a wolf had you in sights, you might as well restart because there was no escaping or surviving. If you managed to somehow survive a wolf attack, you would quickly die of infection or bleeding out. Why in the hell can't you use your hatchet or hunting knife or rifle to kill it when it attacks you?!? Cooking the food did no good. You still got food poisoning even after cooking the food. RIDICULOUS! Sitting ONE inch away from a BURNING FIRE didn't even help warm you up a single degree, even while you're using one of the pits inside the house. How does a fire in a house not warm you up past 40 degrees?!? Especially when you're basically standing INSIDE the damn fire.But since the latest update, they have addressed ALMOST ALL OF THESE ISSUES! Calories don't burn QUITE as fast. Still really damn quick though. You definitely don't freeze as fast. A fire finally seems to warm you up when you're sitting next to it. Hunger takes a TINY bit longer to kick in and thirst is pretty easy to quench so long as you have even the tiniest amount of water. The wolfs no longer home in on you like a heat-seeker missile. You can actually run away now, but only IF you are far enough away. Cooking the food finally seems to help from getting food poisoning(ABOUT TIME).They still haven't addressed being able to use the HUNTING knife or Hatchet to fight the wolf off. You still have to fight it off with your bare hands, which is ALMOST impossible. Seriously, why have a HUNTING knife if you can't use it when you get attacked?!?The game is beautiful and the artwork is amazing. The sounds and music are both really good. It just needs some minor tweaks to help make it a lot better.I'm glad I waited until after they did a few updates before I did this review, because if I hadn't then it would have just been all negative. But instead I waited to let them get the updates out. This way I got to try it both BEFORE and AFTER the updates. The game has IMPROVED VASTLY with these new updates. I really hope they continue to listen to feedback and make adjustments accordingly. So far, it's working out pretty well.			"

								Not being one to review games on public forums such as STEAM , I was so impressed by this one that I though it high time I started. The Long Dark is indeed a game about survival.. but also funnily enough (at least at this stage) an exploration into what it is to be human. The mechanics are simple and quite mathematical in nature.. warmth, hunger and thirst vs time and resources, however given that routine is often interrupted by disease or wolf attack the game makes you head out of whatever comfort zone you've created to search for the rarities that make life sustainable.I found this game ultimately eventuates into posing the question ""why keep going?"" and those steam achievements certainly rank high in the game's longevity. More importantly I found myself thinking .. ""would I keep going?"" surely there is something in our makeup that makes gripping onto life with every last ounce of strength...  a game mechanic that is both powerful and compelling.I was an alpha backer of minecraft, the most amazing part of that experience was the journey I took with that game (and Notch) as it evolved into the massive beast it has become. The Long Dark is evolving, and I think part of the attraction I have to this game, is the oppportunity to follow the bread crumb trail that the developers scatter as this game flourishes into maturity.

								Fricking great game! Awesome survival mechanics, very brutal. Even in just alpha, it's great. Totally worth the money to back the game. If you like awesome survival games, BUY IT. Every time someone buys the game, it goes towards making it even better.Update: The Game is even better now! This latest update added a lot of stuff to it, including difficulty levels, and a new map to explore/survive. Still no story mode yet, but the sandbox is just as fun if not even more fun. Totally worth buying/backing.Update:Once again they have improved this already very good game. With this most recent update, they've added a HUGE new area, and several other new features, including but not limited too; BEARS. Harvestable plants. And new crafting recipes. They've also greatly improved they AI and rebalanced the calorie usage and crafting requirements, and have also updated the inventory system, which was a major improvement. It is however still almost impossible to find a fricking rifle. XD Really REALLY good game. I'd easily pay $30 just for this. They could sell it as is without the story mode and I'd be perfectly happy. IT IS A MUST BUY.			"

								I really love this game. Because it's smart, and it treats me as a gamer, and as a developer as such.  There's nothing hand holding about the survival, there are no explicit tutorials, it doesn't assume I'm 12 years old and have never stood out in a forest in my life.  It's smart, And it's challenging.  A tremendous amount of the survival comes from how you play it, the game is never unfair, if you died, it's because you made poor decisions, or as is often the case in real survival, one fatal misstep that led to a cascade of errors.The Long Dark is gorgeous, smart, and an engrossing play.  I don't know why you're still reading this and not buying it already.			"

								I can't believe this game is only Alpha. This is a great example of Early Access done right. While there is no story mode yet, the sandbox is a great game experience. I've already spent over 40 hours in here. The quotes at the beginning of the game are completely appropriate. It feels like a Cormac McCarthy novel. You aren't going to survive. It's going to be brutal and bitter, but you're going to keep on walking as long as you can.I don't really have much negative to say. Maybe you could craft a few more items? Buckskin pants? Maybe you could create a basic shelter/tent? But, these are small details. I highly recommend this game.			"

								To review The Long Dark, you are either best waiting until the game is completed in it's development OR explain what it is right now and comment on it's progress as time goes on... I'm going to attempt to do that.As of now, The Long Dark is in it's alpha testing phase, with no storyline, however holds 2 huge wilderness maps, in 3 different difficulties as a man or a woman. There are no zombies, no bad guys, just you and nature and of course, wildlife. At the moment it's a total survival sandbox - exploring, looking for supplies, weapons and clothing to help you fight the Canadian wilderness.The Long Dark is hands down the loneliest game I have ever played, and the fact it's a sandbox and nothing else at the moment, it adds to the atmosphere. The visuals are stunning, the voice acting is very professional, the animal AI is fantastic, and to be frank, if this is the game at its alpha stage, I can't wait for the full experience. Right now, the achievements are the closest thing to a 'quest' or a 'mission' because the majority monitor your survival time. So far, I've lasted just under 14 days...2014 has been an excellent year for games, especially new and indie. This is definitely a favourite, and if this is what Hinterland Studio have got in mind as an Alpha test, they are going to become a big deal, even if this is a one hit wonder. They are not messing around with this one.Get it.P.S.  - the chances are this review is either doing to be edited (alot) or deleted and re-reviewed as much as possible.			"

Early Access Review
								The Long Dark is everything I wanted Skyrim to be. I loved Skyrim. I still do. But I wanted more realism. I wanted to feel like every little choice really mattered. In Skyrim, you can run through the snow in your underwear, and the only thing you have to worry about is stumbling across a wolf or troll, but you can usually cut them down with a chop or two.Not so with The Long Dark. The Long Dark, even in its alpha stage is as intense and challenging as a game of chess against the game world itself. Every move you make has consequences. Every little thing you do or don't do could mean life or death.You are a survivor of a plane crash in the Canadian North. You have the shirt on your back, a pair of boots, and a few bits of food. You're in a blizzard in the middle of nowhere, and there are wolves on the hunt. Go.Maybe you see a cabin in the distance, in the blinding cold and blowing snow. Maybe you find a hatchet. Maybe you find nothing at all. You're slowly freezing to death, but you must find some wood. Do you have enough calories to go out foraging? But if you don't, how will you melt snow and boil it to get clean water? You're thirsty too. Very thirsty. And the clock is ticking.It's this kind of intensity, this kind of challenge, where consequences loom behing every little choice that's missing in almost every other game I've ever played. It keeps you coming back, again and again, even after you died so many times in the bitter cold. You keep coming back because you learned something, and you just might do better the next time. You just might survive a few more days.A good game rewards you. And this is something that's beautiful in The Long Dark. Because every little choice matters, because every hour of survival is bought with intelligent choices and lots of luck, that one scrap of food or firewood you find in a cabin is worth more than gold to you. You almost want to cheer. The rewards are doled out like breadcrumbs down the trail of life, and you keep searching for the next one. You keep fighting for your next hour of life.You're also rewarded by levelling up skills. You become better and better at making a fire after a few days. You improve in repairing and crafting new gear. The crafting system is interesting and engaging as well. You find an old pair of pants or a sweater that you don't need? Harvest it for cloth and use it to repair the gear you're already wearing. Patch that hole the wolves tore in it. Fix up your hatchet with the scrap metal you found in a locker. Cobble together a pair of deerskin boots with the hides you've scavenged off of a carcass in the woods. It's all so involving, and it only adds to the sense of reward. I made this! And it just might help me survive a few more days.The music is creepy and intense, but it only comes on occasionally, when something of consequence is going down. Otherwise, there's only the wind and woods, creaking trees, squawking crows, and your own breath. The graphics are stylized. It's not a realistic world. It's somewhat cartoony, TF2 style. But it's not a flaw. You can see for miles on a clear day, and everything looks beautiful, like a painting you've somehow wandered into, a painting that's trying to kill you.And thank God, there are no zombies. I'm sick to death of zombies. This game pits you against the real world, a world unpolluted by all the survival horror cliches that have been done to death in by every other game in the past ten years. (Guitar Hero: Zombie Edition? Go f*ck yourself.)If I had to complain about anything in this game, I'd say the item lists need to be expanded. There are only five or six types of food. A couple of each type of clothing. Tools, weapons, gear--they all need to be diversified. After a few hours of play, I'd discovered pretty much everything there was to be discovered. I was no longer being surprised. The rewards were still rewarding, but I would have been thrilled to walk into a house somewhere and find some new article of clothing or type of food I'd never even seen before.The wolves are too over-powered at times, and you spend a lot of time just walking around in very wide circles to avoid them. Some items, weapons, or defense that might give you a bit of an edge on them would be awesome, especially if it took a hell of a lot to earn it.I got stuck in a hole at some point, between two boulders by a bridge. The walls were too steep, and I couldn't get out. I was worried I'd be stuck there and lose my week's worth of gear. But I somehow managed to go into crawl mode and wiggle and squirm until I glitched right through the ground. then I was walking under the earth. All of this could have been avoided with a simple jump function.The game is still in alpha, so all these things will surely be fixed over time. And all these things are forgivable, considering the massive amounts of fun I'm having. It's looking like the devs at Hinterland are putting out an update every couple of weeks. I look forward to the new developments. New regions to explore. New animals to hunt and be hunted by. Maybe even a multiplayer mode, where you can team up with a buddy or two and face the elements together, or hunt each other down in a last-man-standing survival showdown. That would be too amazing for words.All that is yet to come. For now, I recommend this game to anyone who likes an intellectual challenge in their game play. You'll be hard pressed to find this much intensity in any other game you can pick up for only $20. If you enjoy a game that makes you think, strategize, and plan every move in order to win, you'll love The Long Dark. If you're more the mindless hack n' slash type, you might still like it. There is excitment, there is atmosphere, there are scares and thrills. But mostly it's about slow, methodical puzzle solving, where every move could mean a miserable death, bleeding out in the dark, with an empty stomach in the cold bitter snow...			"

								Right straight off the bat, this game is brutal. In my 2 hours of gameplay at time of writing I've died twice and been attacked by wolves 4 times. Yet I've enjoyed every minute so far, and it really feels like I've played for much much longer.The mechanics are rather simple, and therein lies the games strength. Keep yourself rested,warm,fed,watered & out of trouble to survive, everything you do burns calories, so make sure you have enough to stay fit.The world is stunningly realised and if wandering around aimlessly wasn't so fatal, I could spend a long time exploring the initial map the sandbox mode currently has available.Time for a few minor gripes. Whilst you do need a lot of calories to survive in the cold (approx 6000-8000 a day) the game does burn through a considerable amount more than that. I checked when indoors, with a 'feels like' temperature of 19C (i.e. typical room temperature) with all my winter gear on, I was burning 200+ cal per hour, so almost the expected cold requirement, only at room temp. Whilst increasing this value for gameplay reasons is understandable, I have basically spent my entire play time so far both hungry and eating almost constantly.My only other gripe is the wolves, and the systems designed to combat them. There are a lot of wolves, and they are very aggressive (pretty much attack on sight) and can be warded off with flares. But if they attack you, the only course of action is to frantically punch them, which can get slightly silly if you have a knife on your character.Wrapping it up, overall an enjoyable, robust experience (especially for early access) that could do with a few minor balancing changes to avoid having to eat near constantly just to prevent your hunger level getting worse. Also as it's in the trailer it's not much of a spoiler, yes there is a wolf in the dam, his name his Fluffy, and he respawns.			"

								A promising start to a survival type of open world game, made by a new Canadian developer.  As an early access review I can't speak for the coming story mode, but so far they've built a solid foundation of crafting, exploration, and resource management.  You need to see beyond a storyline to enjoy this, and don't expect any handholding in it's current state.Looking forward to what updates are coming in 2015.edit: search the forum for ""FOV"" and you'll find 3 pages of results of people complaining the FOV is too narrow at max 90 setting.

								The best part of this game is the fight against the elements: the cold, the hunger, the dark.  Getting stuck in a fish-hut on a frozen lake in a seemingly endless cycle of blizzards and blinding, heavy fog. Getting lost in the forest in the middle of the night when you're only 500 meters from home but you can't remember which way you came from.It's very satisfactory to craft better clothing from deer hides and rabbit fur. To find medicinal plants. To find a cave that protects you from the icy wind and make a lifesaving fire. Then make a nice, hot herbal tea that revitalizes you.The art style is beautiful and evocative. There's much to explore: forests, lakes and mountains, settlements, abandoned mines and highways.And then there are the wolves. They ruin everything. Your clothes, and your fun. Fortunately, you can play on a mode called Pilgrim where the wolves (and the bears) don't attack you, so you can focus on survival rather than stealth.The game is quite stable and runs well. In sandbox mode there is a lack of positive goals, but there is a story mode still to come.			"

I mean, it's pretty incredible in its current state, definitely the most fun I've had playing an alpha in a long long time :)Highly recommended!2/7/15 update: Even at this point, if the developers abandon ship (which they have not), I've been quite satisfied with my purchase. I've gotten at least 25 hours of fun out of this game, and it just keeps getting better. The strides the devs are making seem to be going in a great direction. They're making the game more fun while still maintaining a somewhat realistic tone. They haven't even released the story part yet!Buy this game, even at its current price, if you like fun things, this should provide it!			"

								I thought I was doing well. I had a ton of supplies. I was well-rested, hydrated and fed. Then I went outside, got lost, and froze almost to death... I say almost because just as I was about to die from the cold, a wolf came and chewed my face off. 10/10: will catch that wolf one day...			"

								I started near a lake, with many ice fishing huts littering the frozen surface. I searched them all, taking all that I could find. Some wolves were nearby; best keep my distance.There are some cabins on the shores, I rummage through a few, only to emerge from one confronted by a wolf. I retreat back inside, sleep for a few hours to wait the wolf out, and reemerge. The wolf is gone, but it's getting late and the wind has picked up. There are still a few ice fishing huts to search, as well as a rather large cabin across the frozen lake that I have yet to visit.I begin my trek across towards the cabin, checking out the last few huts. The wind now brings snow. Darkness is quickly descending. I search the last hut, I am only a short distance away from the shore now, but the storm has become a blizzard and I am freezing.I need to warm up. Luckily the hut has a pot-belly stove, which I am able to get a fire going in. The hut has no door, so I stand with my back to the fire, staring out into the whipping wind and snow. It howls at me, daring me to venture forth into its icy embrace. I don't want to indulge it, but I have no choice; my fire is about to go out as I have no more wood to fuel it.I burst from my shelter only to realize I can no longer see the shore. I stumble blindly in what I pray is the right direction. I find the shore, but it is unfamiliar, and too steep to climb. I keep following the shore to the right, hoping I still have my bearings correct. I am beginning to freeze again. I just want to sleep.The incline of the shore decreases, a sign can be seen.""Rangers Station""Never have I been so relieved. I burst inside the cabin. Food. Medicine. Tools. A wood stove.I am safe, for now.10/10			"

I should disclose that I am Canadian, so I can't help but love that this takes place in the wilderness of my home country. That doesn't change the fact that it's got an amazing atmosphere, beautiful landscapes and a very real sense of you against the elements, against nature! I highly recommend it!			"

								I woke up in the middle of a blizzard, freezing and disoriented I looked around me, only able to see a few feet ahead in any direction. As I started walking forward I questioned myself, did I choose the right direction? All around me are trees and snow, wind and doubt, in the distance I see a shape taking form, a sign and guard rails. As I get closer I see the remnants of a road winding up a hill on my left, the wind is getting stronger and I can tell im moving slower, im taking a gamble there is shelter at the top of this hill. As I clear the top of the hill I see an outpost, 30 – 50 feet in the air atop a winding red staircase. Struggling to make it to the top of the stair I fall through the outpost’s door and into one small cramped abandoned rangers post. Rifle on the table, 5 shells on the floor, some kindling by the stove and an energy bar. I lit a small fire in the stove, but without proper clothing I never really warmed up. Taking some snow from outside I melted it on the stove, but before I could get it to boil the fire went out. I ate the energy bar and grabbed the rifle, made my way back into the howling wind, down the stairs and started descending down the hill. Im starting to freeze to death, no food, no shelter, no heat, it doesn’t look good. I follow the road heading away from the outpost atop the hill, the wind starts to die down and I can see further into the distance now. Round a small hill to my left and see a building in the distance built into a mountain, ive lost track of the road, lost under the snow, I head to the building. Under the snow I see something red, I get closer and see it is a dead fox, half eaten, mostly frozen. I have no tools, nothing to cut the meat, I have to abandon the carcass and pray there is food in the building up ahead.I open the giant metal door, this is a hydroelectric dam, empty and abandoned, dark and silent.  My body is going into shock, I have no food, no water, no way of building a fire. My only hope is to find a furnace and pray there is wood nearby to burn. As I walk into the main room coming through the front door I can see hulking machinery, up ahead, file cabinets to my right, and stairs going down to my left. It reminds me of something out of a horror movie, pitch black with only light from a small window, something is lighting up the stairs, beckoning me. Im dying, I can hear the wind outside starting to pick back up, I head down the stairs in a last ditch effort to find heat, to find what the light is coming from below. I take 3 steps and see a shadow at the bottom of the stairs, it’s a wolf, and it guarding something, meat… I pull out my rifle and before I can take aim the wolf lunges at me, I cant fight back, im too weak. I die on the floor of the building. "

								Forty two days since my plane went down in this arctic hell. The wind broke long enough for me to venture outside, my growling stomach told me i had little choice. The deer i'd been tracking slowly moved along picking out what bit's of vegetation it could find, ever wary of it's surroundings. I saw my opportunity arise as it stopped ears perked in the opposite direction of me. My rifle came to my shoulder slowly as not to spook the deer, my breath slowed finger on the trigger slowly squeezing back. For a second i could swear i  caught motion out of the corner of my eye, then it happened. The wolf sprang barely giving me enough time to pivot in his direction. My shot was true and i caught him mid chest. No deer for dinner tonight but i find i'm getting used to the taste of wolf.Let me say that rarely do i ever see a survival game that has pulled me in so deeply, immersed is a word that does not do it justice. Ive actually found myself talking to myself as i move along warning myself not to get too focused on the road ahead and to scan around as i go. Nothing about this game is linear or boring. The graphics are stunning and the dynamics of the game itself work incredibly well. Bravo dev's bravo!If i had anything to request or add to the game it would possibly be allowing the hatchet or hunting knife be used as a weapon itself and maybe adding an option for scrap metal to be heated in a fire for use in making the basic items for tools weapons etc. One could possibly assemble a crude axe that way etc. I see great potential in this game to evolve into not only a urvival game but a hybrid crafting one as well. The elements of basic survival alone make the game more than challenging for any player, adding a primitive crafting system could only enhance the experience. "

It is daunting, engrossing, beautiful, and surpirsingly sensible.  The challenge of survival in a rugged winter wilderness will make you grin in earnest at the discovery of months-old sardine tins, and cringe at the pitter pattering sound of wolf paws on packed snow.Can't wait for the full release.

								I bought this game over the objections of a close friend and I am glad I ignored his advice.  Love this game!  For me the weather, from snow storms to the cold is a bigger threat than the wolves (once I figured out how to make bandages that is), the icy silence of my boots on the snow and ice is a constant companion to the mournful howling of the wind.  That aside I wish there was a tutorial of sorts to show me how to craft snares, boil water etc.  Steam guides and blind dumb luck have been the only reason I made it beyond day 5.  I really dig the survival aspect of this game and I realize it's in Alpha still but I do wish surviving was a little easier, or resources a bit more plentiful, or maybe I should just play more and try not to suck.

								Wow. This game looks incredible. I've always been interested in getting a survival game, but I never liked how most of them involved gratuitous zombies. If I wanted to shoot zombies, I'd play Left 4 Dead. I just want to survive in a survival game.This title, however, is just about surviving the harsh life in the frozen north (the devs have hinted they may add other ""survivors"" of whatever catastrophe sent your character northwards, and that they may not be friendly, but they're not zombies)The gameplay is currently only the sandbox mode, with no narrative or guide whatsoever, and just one map so far (though they have more planned). They drop you in, and its up to you to figure out how the ♥♥♥♥ you are going to stay alive. Make no mistake, that's no easy feat. You have to manage a number of different variables, including body heat, windchill, hunger and thirst, exhaustion, wounds and disease, and hostile wildlife. Neglect any of these and they can kill you faster than you can sneeze.In order to get firewood and harvest meat, you need a hatchet. To get that you need to venture to the clearcut lookout, but there are wolves in that area, and you can't go there without a firearm. To get one you can go to the trapper's homestead, but will you survive long enough to reach that place? These are the kind of questions and dilemmas you need to answer in order to survive. It's hard to start off: in 3/4 of my attempts I die within three days, but when I do survive for longer, the victory is sweeter than honey.Its onyl early access, but that means we can help shape the game as it develops. If you are remotely a fan of survival games, purchase this title immediately!			"

I'd underestimated the supplies I needed for my journey - dragged myself back to the cabin, freezing and nearly dead from exhaustion (plus I had food poisoning from some bad meat).After resting and warming up, I awoke dehydrated and close to death. My vision slowly faded while I frantically searched my cabin for something to drink. I would have melted some snow - but I didn't have any fuel for the fire.Awesome - would play again.			"

								So in 2013 I did a race that was considered one of the toughest mountain bike races in the world, The Tour Divide.  It extended from Canada to Mexico over the Continental Divide, unsupported.  We started in Banff, Canada and rode out from there where we were left to our own wits and survival.  Everything I had for the next month was on my bike and that's how I lived.  The Long Dark, while you're not on a bike, is a bit like the race.  You're constantly wondering if you have enough food, enough water, was there a predator lurking about (not wolves, we had to worry about Grizzlies).  In the game, you do this, you figure stuff out and it's fun... depressing, but fun.This is the first game I'm actively avoiding all videos, how-to's and spoilers because I want to figure it out on my own, take my time and enjoy it.  The artistic beauty, grim deaths and isolated gameplay really throw me back in the Tour Divide pushing my bike up the side of a mountain in the middle of the night, alone and freezing.As a casual gamer who lightly plays games, I cannot recommend this enough.  I feel drawn in and ""cold"" when I play it and it's a haunting comfort to hop in and play. It does come with a few snags and that's mainly performance on my Macbook Air.  It gets a little sluggish in fullscreen but runs fine in a smaller window.  I don't mind.(Also if you're interested, I wrote a book about the Tour Divide race which has some similarities to The Long Dark.  You can find out more at http://www.softpedaling.com).			"

								I have been following this game since the Kickstarter last year. (Which I backed) I had pretty high hopes for this game and it showed great potential. As many other reviewers pointed out, when this game first released into Early Access it was almost unplayable. You froze within minutes of starting, or you died of hunger within minutes of starting, or you ran out of calories within minutes of starting, or you died of thirst within minutes of starting or you get killed by a wolf within seconds of starting. Yes, seconds. Once a wolf had you in sights, you might as well restart because there was no escaping or surviving. If you managed to somehow survive a wolf attack, you would quickly die of infection or bleeding out. Why in the hell can't you use your hatchet or hunting knife or rifle to kill it when it attacks you?!? Cooking the food did no good. You still got food poisoning even after cooking the food. RIDICULOUS! Sitting ONE inch away from a BURNING FIRE didn't even help warm you up a single degree, even while you're using one of the pits inside the house. How does a fire in a house not warm you up past 40 degrees?!? Especially when you're basically standing INSIDE the damn fire.But since the latest update, they have addressed ALMOST ALL OF THESE ISSUES! Calories don't burn QUITE as fast. Still really damn quick though. You definitely don't freeze as fast. A fire finally seems to warm you up when you're sitting next to it. Hunger takes a TINY bit longer to kick in and thirst is pretty easy to quench so long as you have even the tiniest amount of water. The wolfs no longer home in on you like a heat-seeker missile. You can actually run away now, but only IF you are far enough away. Cooking the food finally seems to help from getting food poisoning(ABOUT TIME).They still haven't addressed being able to use the HUNTING knife or Hatchet to fight the wolf off. You still have to fight it off with your bare hands, which is ALMOST impossible. Seriously, why have a HUNTING knife if you can't use it when you get attacked?!?The game is beautiful and the artwork is amazing. The sounds and music are both really good. It just needs some minor tweaks to help make it a lot better.I'm glad I waited until after they did a few updates before I did this review, because if I hadn't then it would have just been all negative. But instead I waited to let them get the updates out. This way I got to try it both BEFORE and AFTER the updates. The game has IMPROVED VASTLY with these new updates. I really hope they continue to listen to feedback and make adjustments accordingly. So far, it's working out pretty well.			"

								Instantly The Long Dark makes you alter your play style different. Everything can take a toll on your character such as spraining an ankle while walking down a steep slope or getting sick from unboiled water. For this current state of the game it is truly at a solid and sets the foundations for a lot of further potential.My only concerns are that the current level is relatively small and perhaps the developers should reconsider the possible of a Coop or Multiplayer option. While The Long Dark offers a great & unique experience, I worry that without a multiplayer function, it's replayability is limited. However it's possible that once development reaches a further point, the extent of more content might solve this problem in it's self.Overall it is highly worth checking out and worth every bit of the $19.99 price tag			"

								Fricking great game! Awesome survival mechanics, very brutal. Even in just alpha, it's great. Totally worth the money to back the game. If you like awesome survival games, BUY IT. Every time someone buys the game, it goes towards making it even better.Update: The Game is even better now! This latest update added a lot of stuff to it, including difficulty levels, and a new map to explore/survive. Still no story mode yet, but the sandbox is just as fun if not even more fun. Totally worth buying/backing.Update:Once again they have improved this already very good game. With this most recent update, they've added a HUGE new area, and several other new features, including but not limited too; BEARS. Harvestable plants. And new crafting recipes. They've also greatly improved they AI and rebalanced the calorie usage and crafting requirements, and have also updated the inventory system, which was a major improvement. It is however still almost impossible to find a fricking rifle. XD Really REALLY good game. I'd easily pay $30 just for this. They could sell it as is without the story mode and I'd be perfectly happy. IT IS A MUST BUY.			"

								Day 46: I found a bag of Beef Jerky in a little cable off the beaten path, probably some kid's snack on a hunting trip with his uncle. Or at least that's what I imagine. Its been over a month since my plane went down, and the only people I've found are frozen corpses being picked over by the wolves. It seems the only thing I can do anymore to keep remotely sane and inspired to stay alive is to talk to myself during the long hours.  Oh, I had to put the spare wolf pet somewhere out of sight, I woke up in the middle of the night about two days ago to get a drink and about had a heart attack, the light filtering through the windows made it look like a wolf had crashed thru the window and gotten inside, I nearly wasted a round of my rifle ammo.That's about the only positive thing I have to say today, I'm stuck in that little cabin off the beaten path. There's a snowstorm right now, my leg is bleeding profusely, I tore my hat to pieces in order to make a bandage, but I have the sinking suspicion that a bear's mouth isn't the most hygenic place in Canada. So yea, it's probably infected. I'll have to treat it when i get back to the gas station. Might be difficult walking thru the snow with a bum leg and no pants. ... Funny story behind that actually. I spent days hunting deer and drying their pelts in order to have some warm pants, and the bear ate them, and a bit of my leg as dessert.It sounds so absurd to say it out loud... the bear ate my pants. Its like one of those things you learn to say in highschool spanish to make the teacher have a headache ...something something mis pantelones ...*a blood stain signs the final entry in a small journal laying next to a half naked corpse leaning in a corner of a little cabin off the beaten path.*--Really its a fun game where the experiences that kill you are just as fun to talk about as the experiences you survive. Hinterland is doing great with keeping the game coming along with updates and bugfixes. They have an amazing team that really is interested in player feedback.The game has immense replay value, even in its unfinished alpha sandbox mode. Great graphics that I can only describe as water color cell shading ... ish.I like that they're not trying to carbon copy other survival games.I've got nothing negative to say about the developers. Nothing negative to say about the game.Honestly I think everyone should play this game at least once.I guarantee the first time that you're ripped apart by wolves after barely surviving a blizzard after finally finding a box of crackers after panically searching houses for anything to eat will be 1000% times more enjoyable than experiencing those things in real life. ... at least, maybe like ... 1010% more enjoyable even.

								Hello all you hardy folks out there in the electronic wilderness!!!  Originally i had posted negative feedback on this game last year after my saved game vanished just shy of 100 days in the winter cold ... i was thoroughly fed up it had vanished and this was the second time it had happened ... I have been following the developers progress and reset my expectations for a speedy release of the story mode and you know what ... I think ive enjoyed following the developers progress as much as the game.  Hinterland have stayed true to their objective of delivering a first class survival game and have taken a lot of flack for delaying the story mode in favour of polishing the overall game and making the survival experience about as real as you can get without losing your own toes!!!Now 1 year on following the loss of my saved game i have pushed out into the whiteout anew and wow ... the game is 100% better than the game i played 95 hours in!!!!  Seriously guys and girls, buy this game.  Its no longer about supporting early access ... its about experiencing simply the finest and most realistic survival game out there ever!  You owe it to yourself to be patient and persist with this game because if you dont your letting the greatest gaming experience pass you by!Well done Hinterland!!!  You really are the very essence of ""all good things, come to those who wait"" ...			"

								This game starts you off by punching you in the face, stabbing you in the stomach, and kicking you in the teeth.  If you survive the first week, odds are good you'll go the distance and survive forever until you get bored and start over.  You start off grossly underdressed and underequipped, and the first few days are touch and go.  Maybe you'll find some better clothes before the cold kills you. Maybe you'll evade the wolves long enough to acquire a decent weapon.  If you can tough it out, you'll become the predator, strolling around proudly wearing the wolfskin coat, deer hide boots and pants, and rabbitskin mitts.  If you're particularly savvy with your rifle and flare gun, you'll even manage to sleep soundly in a handmade bearskin bedroll.  Whether you die poorly to the elements, die like a warrior in battle, or survive as a master of your domain, this game will challenge even the most veteran players, while remaining playable even to a novice.My only gripe with the game is that if you do manage to survive for an extended period of time--namely if you manage to acquire the 200 day achievement...it's still friggen winter.  Seriously, are we in an ice age now?  I get it, it's northern Canada, but still.  After 200 days you'd think you might start to see some vestiges of summer.  But nope, always winter.  C'est la vie.Still worth it.			"

Despite the 20 to 30+ deaths I incurred right off the bat going into the hardest difficulty setting, I've had a blast learning the ropes of this environment.  It's got a real living, breathing, feel to it.  I hope they keep adding to that, it will only make it even better.  Wolves are one of the biggest threats, and they can be quite deadly, especially if Mother Nature has already 'softened you up'.  They're also stubborn about dying on the spot, often limping away from a fight and forcing you to follow a blood trail to find your meat for the night.  Or to find more wolves ...  I'm hooked - Great Game !   "

								Beautiful visually, gives a strong and realistic immediate sense of sudden stranding in a very harsh environment, alone. I like this feeling, the sound effects, the half light, the breathing animations in cold air. It's great.But... I found certain things to be illogical and against the sense of realism I was expecting to feel:1. Clothes need to last longer and be added in layers, it is what you would do and they wouldn't fall apart in a few days2. I understand water has to be boiled to make it safe (assuming some chance of contamination as this a ""post apocolytic world"", but it shouldn't take hours to melt then boil the snow because it simply does not in reality - too ridiculous, especially when your fire has only 1hr burning time. It can take half a day to boil a few gallons.3. All tools such as crowbars, hatchets, knives etc need to be usable in self defence (wolves...) as well as for ""harvesting useful items"". They should also wear out more realistically. No axe maker in the world would remain in business if their axes only lasted a few days or weeks.  Making the game hard by doing this and removing realism doesn't make it fun long-term, think retention.4. Should be easier to collect wood, it's everywhere, via using the tools as mentioned above, be easier to go out and collect diamonds than wood in those forests, peesh.5. Food should last longer if prepared/sealed, it isn't the tropics, it would last a long time. Even frozen animals would.6. Map should auto generate as if slowly drawing one through discovery, be a nice touch7. If you don't happen upon a rifle you are defenceless against wolves even if you are carrying knives, crowbars etc, this is totally unrealistic.I sprained an ankle somehow, it was the death of me, that did feel realistic in that I couldn't move fast enough to gather supplies to feed myself, but the above issues take away a lot of the fun for me right now.Fix the above and I'd be hooked, I remain keen :) "

								I have only played the game for an hour...but let me tell you it has been one nervewracking hour (in a good way).  I have had only had one life in this game and in the short time I've had more fun than many survival games have given me in many hours.I spawned in and the sun is just rising behind the mountains.  Snow is gently falling and I can see a clearing down the side of the hill I am standing on.  I make my way down and find it's a tiny encampent for loggers.  After searching through the trailers I find myself with a few cans of soda, peaches, and a new jacket.  Not a bad take.  Returning to the wilderness I begin to trek into the unknown.  After making my way through the woods and following a railroad it gets quite dark and I realize the sun is actually setting.  Now with a sense of urgency I begin to scramble for shelter.  The wind picks up and the snow begins to fall heavy on me.  I find an abandoned hydro dam and take shelter inside.  It's pitch black so I light my only flare to give me some sense of comfort.  After finding a crowbar I begin breaking into lockers and after finding some beef jerky and a knife I hear a menacing growl.  I turn around just in time to see a rather large wolf lunge at me and pin me to the ground.  After a brief struggle the wolf is now dead and I'm bleeding all over the place.  Turning the place upside down I managed to find some bandages and antiseptic and am able to treat my wound.  Fearing another wolf attack I head back outside and seek shelter elsewhere.  Walking around the darkness for what felt like hours I found a lookout tower.  This is my current shelter.  I managed to get a fire going and got a good nights rest.  Tomorrow is a new day and I can't wait to see how it unfolds.This game even in its current lacking state is awesome.  The sense of immersion is unrivaled.  Going inside the dam was truly unnerving.  The echoes and emptiness in the halls set up the tension that built up to the wolf attack perfectly.  Wandering around in the dark as the storms began to roll in made me feel helpless and that's what a survival game should aim to do.  It's nice to see a survival game without zombies and this game offers a great challenge and a fantastic sense of immersion.  Get it. Play it.  Enjoy it.			"

								The Long Dark tells the fantastic tale of Will Mackenzie.  Will being a pilot who flies cargo planes full of rubber dog♥♥♥♥♥♥through northern Canada finds himself stuck in those very woods in the Norhern Canadian wilderness.  Not only that but he appears to be the last person alive on Earth.  Apparently what happened was there was a global disaster where it's freezing cold all the time and everything is broken and this leads to wolves taking over the world.  These aren't ordinary wolves no, these are magic wolves.  They appear out of nowhere and multiply like cockroaches and will kill you on site.  Thank God Will has plenty of fuzzy Canadian winter hats laying around and more then enough normal gloves to wear.  I almost forgot the abundance of canned sardines Will get's to eat because apparently Canadians can't get enough canned sardnes, those things are freaking everywhere.  Overall not bad but the finished product has a ways to go.			"

								If you like in depth, realistic, good looking games then I garuntee you will like this one! The long dark is by far in the top 5 survival games I've played, with its cartoony look it still seems to put other games looks and graphics to shame. The scenary is just one of the most beautiful thing I've seen in a game before. This game has a very neat inventory system that is very in depth in the sense you can forage for wood and it will give you the amount of calories you will burn along with the wear it will do to your items, you can also repair your clothes with a sewing kit, or even harvest cloth from your clothes these are only 3 of the things you can do from your in depth inventory system. This game is only in alpha and it is already a stunning game I can't imagine what this game will be like when it is fully finished and has storymode and multiplayer. All in all I'm not a real big PC gamer but this game always keeps me on the edge of my seat. I really recommend this game to anyone I garuntee it is a great acturate realalistic survival simulator and you will not waste your money!			"

I ended up in a picnic area and saw a dead dear so I was thinking that wolf is really close. Slowly was starting to freeze to death.I saw a waterfall from a distance and walked to it staying close to the icy path.Saw a dead body so I checked what he had and I ended up giving that dead body everything I had by mistake.Got all my stuff back from the body and heard birds nearby. Decided to finally leave the Icy path and go a different route right into a wolf.Hit every body on my mouse and keyboard shaking and scared thinking of what to do.Took out a flare and stared at the wolf while slowly backing backwards.Fell of a small cliff, sparined my leg, wolf attacked me. I DIED!!!Game Time Survived: 1hr 47min. . .Did not play for long but I am already addicted to this game. Can't wait till its finished.			"

								This is an amazing game. challenges you to think and adapt. The wolves are cunning, and it takes a lot ot outwit them, but it is possible. Always ALWAYS carry your hunting knife and flaregun.			"

								Alone in the deadly, frozen wilderness, struggling to survive.  Trudging through blizzards, trying not to starve or freeze or wind up as a wolf's or bear's dinner; you just hope you can find another whetstone or box of matches.  And yet, at times, when you're well fed and warm in your woflskin coat, you watch the wind die down, hear the birds, see the sky clear and it becomes quite lovely.  An absolutely incredible experience.  Some of the best money I've ever spent on a game.  And it's not even finished!			"

								I am simply love this game my initial responce was jsut ""wow' the game is so beautiful and its simply just a super immersive game. I left the game one night feeling very cold haha and thi game makes me very hungry after im done playing it because i jsut put all my energy into surviving. i really love the game and how you feel alone (altho one more person like a coop would make the game less lonely ) but its also the lonelyness part that makes it so great ! its me against the world and the wolves scare the crap out of me even just the sounds scare me alone. and the athmospher is jsut amazing i leave my house and its all foggy i go to sleep for an house still foggy i sleep the night still foggy i wander a little fog clears  and it felt so good becuase i couldnt see anything. i really could go on and on about the game but i wont i really liked it ! DEVS if you see this dont mess up this survivial game like dayz or h1z1 make it amazing for us gamers follow your hearts and not the cash grabbing			"

								The Long Dark is a first person, open world, survival game being developed by a rather new company called Hinterland. I bought this game back when it was very, very new. And there was, and still is a lot of potential for this rather unexpected gem. I don't often write reviews on Alpha/Beta/Early Access titles, and typically, when I do, they're because you can tell the'll be utter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm pleased to say, that I've yet to be disappointed by Hinterland Studio. The Long Dark, in its current state, has only the Sandbox Mode, an open-world survival that we're all too familiar with, with three difficulties, and the obvious absence of a story-mode. Survival games are now so common, like your failure to potty train your dog, you can't walk more than two feet without stepping on♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ And often, this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥brings about a revolted feeling of disgust and you urgently rush to the washroom to clean the filth away. In otherwords, since the rise of Minecraft, there's been a few gems in the Survival genre, but the majority have been such massive disappointments, you'd think that the only service their dev-companies could do now, is to beat themselves in the face with a club labled bankruptcy. It seems so irritating, to be taunted constantly with these games, of the next-generation ""survival"", only to discover that its only usefulnes is to help fix the unlevel table in your dining room. I spent the majority of my time at first, learning the game, as any decent person would, and that was by ignoring any sense of a tutorial or wiki. Well, they had the latter, the former might as well as have been named bigfoot. From the start, there were a lot of problems with the game, I can't count how many times I found myself squealing as my face was mauled by a wolf, with my attacks being as useless as an old lady with a foam bat. However, they quickly nerfed the wolves, still ensuring they were a challenge, but not so much that any form of resistence or risk-taking adventure around them could still result in your body being violently eviscerated by ravenous teeth.The landscape and overall design of the world, which gave me the impression that someone spilt a set of depressing watercolours on a Canadian forest, is actually admirably beautiful and robust. Immediately, when you spawn into the game, you're hit with the feeling of desolate isolation, and a sense of ever foreboding dread that the whole world has in fact gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The devs masterly crafted a mosaic and rather sad setting for such a survival game that few can compare. In fact, I spent a lot of my time risking my life in the subzero frigid temperatures, and the horrendous monstrosities birthed by Cerberus to explore this rather dire landscape, and found it so oddly enchanting that I often starved or froze to death. An ending well fit for such a daring expedition, I might add. In short, the entire survival atmosphere Hinterland Studio built, is very well done, beautifully so, and their attention to detail in such a world is so remarkable that the experience of being in such a terrifying world really affects you. Everything from the wind, your breath, the need for food, water and sleep, and the constant battling of the elements have been so neatly put together that I could sit down and eat the game if it were my favourite box of mixed mac'n'cheese and feel sad yet strangely delighted. So far, there's been little to really complain about. The Devs have really taken their time to listen to community input and respond rather quickly with bugfixes and patches to rebalance the game, something that I hope remains, since I'd rather not have to compare a new company to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥isations of EA or Ubisoft. Honestly, I remember a time where companies were so closely-knit to their communities they were like a pair of siamese twins, and now, we're left with the brooding dead husks that make up EA, Ubisoft, and other alleged AAA developers.However, what kind of review would this be without some complaint. Ones that they haven't been sniping out rather quickly, they also have been rather sluggish in others, whether because of budget constraints or a risky move when they opened the game to Early Access. I contemplated purchasing the game in Early Access, because as we all may know, some companies, and especially certain groups of devs, have burnt us on Early Access titles and you're left caring for the drooling, brain-dead husk of a game as they run off with the money and flash it you in suggestive poses with a sign saying, ""Ha Ha, Fooled You"". However, being one so often familiar with the feeling of disappointment, and a craving to be disappointed, I bought the Long Dark in Early Access and immediately found a few discrepancies. Initially, they advertised the game, insofar as its mechanics with a world that became drastically altered and terrifying at night, than during the day. Something that at first, made me recall another game, perhaps Minecraft. However, their unique twist to it made me forgive Hinterland for that comparison. You see, the world you're character has fallen into has been ravaged by a Carrington Event, or a large Solarmagnetic Storm that wipes out nearly all electrical based systems across the globe, creating terrifying aurora at night, that send the radioes screaming alive, and the lights flashing on. The storm's impact disrupts mgiratory patterns of animals, sends birds flying around until they die frome exhaustion, and disrupts the hibernation cycle of bears and other animals. As a result, nighttime in this desolate and frozen wilderness brings you into the horrifying embrace of every♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off animal from Quebec to British Columbia, who are all out for a snack, and you look like a delicious New York strip with a side of their favourite barbecue sauce. With all this riveting advertisement, I just couldn't help but buy the game, and immediatelly noticed something interesting, the lack of this solarmagnetic storm, and even the terrifying aurora. Instead, all that happened at night was frostbite. After I found myself comfortably rooted in a home, I eventually lost interest with the game. While they were quick with patchfixes and updates, it made me feel more like I was playing Minecraft: The Canadian Edition, with less green phalli to ruin my day. I stopped in when they made a few major updates, particularily they've been good at adding maps and new areas, and more mechanics that kept me interested for a little while, and then I'd lose it again and go back to bludgeoning people's heads open on one of my favourite FPSs. However, finally they've made the big announcement, and this is why I chose to write this review now. Despite their lack to give us the initially advertised content when I first bought the game, and when I started to wonder if I had made a grave mistake, I saw a beacon in this dark and macabre wilderness. A teaser trailer for their storymode, with the features they promised at the start, and then, I was finally sold. In short, I would recommend you buy this game. With the big announcement for the upcoming story-mode in 2016, and the final major updates involving the auroras and other massively yearned for features, Hinterland Studios has proved that they actually care about gaming and development. They've proven that they care about their community, something we can't say for EA or other Early Access shites, and with a dedicated team to fix bugs and patches, I can say that the wait has well been worth it. I may not be all that interested until those features are finally added to the game, but when they are, I can see my social life suffering in the face of surviving the brutal Canadian wilderness in a post-apocalyptic gem of the survival genre that deserves all of its praise.

								Oh look, a first person survival game on Steam that isn't complete tripe. This game is really difficult and a lot of your ability to survive depends on your perseverance and persistence to learn maps, resource management, and weapon locations. You will die a lot (I have not survived very long at the time of this writing). You can play as a dude or a dudette (yay!) and in both cases, you are subjected to utter hell on earth. Unlike other games, which rely on biochemical warfare, nuclear weapons, or zombies to craft apocalyptic hellholes, this one uses freezing cold. Take it from a Coloradan who used to do outdoor education for elementary students, the cold can and does suck if you are not properly equipped.You start out with your standard survival stuff: fatigue, hunger, thirst, health, and a meter detailing how cold you are or aren't. Lanterns are useful and are rather plentiful in the world, so pick them up. Starting fires can give you warmth, but also consume resources and may fail at the expense of those resources. Water must be purified before hand, or else you will get sick. The main problem I had was locating food, which is difficult to find and can go bad (like in the real world). You need to constantly be moving between shelters and raiding things, which is hard because there are wolves and now bears (have not faced them yet) to harass you. This game is dangerous trial and error, but the most enjoyable kind. If you want a realistic and challenging survival game, check this one out! The visual styles are really nice and remind me a lot of graphic novels with a dash of Telltale. And hey, if you play the lady, you get to have Ellie from The Last of Us as your narrator. You can't lose. ;)			"

								I know what you're thinking.""Oh God its early access, get back to me when the game is actually released""I, too, was like you....until the steam sale once again captured my money, and with it about 9.5 hours straight of survival. What might you expect from this game? Well here, ill reenact my time immersed in the barren wilderness of Canada.Day 1: Wandered among a small Fishing Village, abandoned of course. A slight fog covered the frozen lake, a few deer roamed about here and there. Not bad so far, seems pretty easy actually I thought to myself.  Found some supplies, enough to keep me going for a bit, and hunkered down in one of the small fishing huts on the water. Spooky noises as I ate crappy energy bars and drank Stacy's Grape Soda Skip forward 2 weeksDay 14: 10 cups of coffee a day, I refuse to sleep in fear of waking to a bear Carry around 17 logs of Fir wood with accelerant just in case. Pretty much consistantly at 40kg of weight, 10kg over my max carry capacity. Its ok though, I count it as a workout. Spent about 3 days straight melting water, more or less carrying around a small pond with me.But wait, it gets betterManaged to scavenge about 11kg of venison, easily cooked with my absurd amount of wood carried on me at all times.Grind out 16 DAYS of sleeping 12 hours, waking up, eating meat, drink a bit, sleep again Mlg survival strats, I should write a book Become a bit risky, leave the safety of the coastal town to explore a dam Take off all my gear, cause traveling light inside exit lower dam, lo and behold, it is the SINGLE ONE WAY DOOR IN THE WHOLE AREA Get stuck outside with no gear, pitch black Roll out my bedroll, freeze to death in my sleep10/10 survived 28 days, only to get foiled by a door "

								I previously downloaded The Forest. The gameplay I managed to get out of it that wasn't clouded with lag and bugs was pretty decent, but not as realistic or challenging as I expected. I held off a hoard of cannibals with a tennis ball and a fireax. I previously downloaded the Long Dark. I haven't played much, but what I have played has ran very smoothly on my sucky HP notebook. Very challenging, and I can't seem to survive more than a couple of days at a time before freezing in my sleep or being mauled. I wasn't expecting much realism, but I entered the game and spent the first 10 minutes or so going through all the menus seeing the dozens of things I had to keep up with to avoid from meeting death. Very fun game, runs nicley on old PCs as far as I'm concerned, and once you finally do pick it up it's hard to put down. I wish I could have come into this game with no prior knowledge of it, as that would have made it much better. If you do want to download, don't look up much other than controls for an amazing experience. There are about a thousand different ways, and maybe a couple to survive. Download The Long Dark.			"

								Never understood all the negative reviews about this wonderful game but nevermind about that. The game itself is a unique, survival, atmospheric and at certain points somewhat horror-like type. I've never seen something like this before and also the cartoony graphics makes it even more interesting and unique, which is a big plus from me. I've recently heard that the developers are working hard on the Story Mode and it got me really excited. At first i wasnt really convinced about the game, the price was again a problem, of course I could have refunded it but still got me thinking wether it's a good choice or a complete waste of time and money until i've played it...it got me wanting to play even more and more, it's a great timekiller, always new stuff to do and endless possibilities. I absolutely love the dedication of the developers, when they say they wanna do something, they do it, this shows that they care about us and they are trying to keep the game alive, which is fantastic.

								Brilliant game. Equal measures of time spent in admiration of the graphical beauty of the game, then blind panic. Frantically hoping that you are walking in the right direction to find your cabin in the midst of a white-out blizzard, with hypothermia about to set in, and no time to find fuel to warm up, because you know this would be the death of you........... and then you bump in to a wolf that stares at you, advances and starts growling.....Evokes all kinds of emotions and awe, I love it.The sandbox alpha is an absolute pleasure, and easily worth the purchase price. And to make it even better, the story mode is yet to come, for free, this spring. Top class developer, who regularly updates the game, responds to customer feedback, and appears to take absolute pleasure in producing an outstanding survival game. "

								The game has a ton of potential at the moment. The survival mechanics are excellent and I love the details in this game like how wind speed contributes to how cold you are and such. The only gamemode playable right now is sandbox. I can't wait until the story mode is finished, it would be nice to do a proper playthrough. My only gripe is that you can't survive without constantly looting and it's impossible to live off the land. Being able to live off the land and survive indefinitely would be excellent.After playing a ton of bad early access games, it's nice to see some quality games on steam.			"

								Very awesome experience. (Caution before buying, make sure you got a good CPU, its CPU intensive) What I love about this is that it's not Humans to try to not get killed by, (they dont have them right now, I don't know if they'll be added or not) and to be honest, wolves aren't that big of a problem either. (though if you do get attacked by one, its very devastating)  It's the more realistic things like hunger, dehydration etc. And when I say that you're CONSTANTLY looking for supplies, you are really on the move 24/7.  After seeing waves of zombie survival hardcore pvp games come out, this is something fresh.  The art style is unique and I really love it.  Being inside a cabin with a fire is really cozy feeling, even if it's just a game.  Although some things are slightly unrealistic and at times outrageous, (such as falling a foot and breaking your ankle, not being able to use your knife to fend off a wolf attack, having to boil your water twice, and things breaking after like 10 uses...) I definitely still reccomend it.  If you doubt      your decision, wait until its complete. 8/10, Fun gameplay, great art style, definitely a challenge compared to other ""survival games,"" but lots of flaws.			"

								Amazing Game !Finally, some game that is actually hard to play. Not in the way that enemy has more health or you die more quickly, but overall gameplay is pretty tough.If you are a person who likes action, shooting anything that moves with unlimited ammo, etc... DO NOT EVEN TRY THIS !In this game you actually need to use your brains, you have to think at least two days ahead to stay alive. Some people didn't like this game mostly because of :""Strong Wolves"" (yes, wolf is actually freakin' hard to kill barehanded in real life.)or""No Saves"" (when did your life ""Saved"" last time? That is why you think about things twice before you do them, that is what makes life hard...)so as a Survival Simulation, this game is 10/10 for me !They are doing an amazing job with this game.NEW UPDATES are comming out all the time. And game is getting much better by each of them.			"

								""Once more into the frayInto the last good fight I'll ever knowLive and die on this dayLive and die on this day..."" (c) - Ending monologue from 'The Grey' Cold, brutal and lonely. These words descibe this game better than any others (at least now). And this is awesome.'The Long Dark' is one of the very few really-really awesome kickstarter projects/Early Access Steam games that could've ever exist. It's atmospheric, it's hard and it's promising. To confirm my words, I'll just present one of the situations.On the very first day of the survival, I made it to the dam. It looked creepy, but the storm was rising, so I just stepped in. I was terrified: I had no light sources, I was law on food and had nothing to protect myself with. And then the atmospheric part stepped in: every sound I made sounded like a gunshot in a closed room. I got that feeling of someone else watching me. I started looting around, went to the far dark room. Suddenly, I heard somthing else. I crawled down and realized that there is a wolf right next to me. There is just not enough words to describe how actually much I was scared, so I just rushed outside. It was a relief for me, I stopped for a second to catch my breath. And then I realized that there is a fog arond me and I hear someone else coming. This is just one of the many. And you don't want to get hudrated, hungry or tired, because if you are in the middle of the cold wilderness, you are probably dead.So, summing up: +Awesome, fantastic atmosphere +Great soundtrack +A large world to explore+ Non-scripted events+Beautiful graphics+Breathcatching wilderness+The only game where you can be Liam Neeson from 'The Grey' -It becomes kind of impossible to survive after the fifth day (approx.)-Becomes a bit boring sometimes As a result: one of the very few games that I'm excited for. Sandbox is already one of the best survivals ever, and I can't even imagine how actualy good the story is going to be. And you might say, that this is getting old and mainstream. Yes, it is. But you will remember my words after you hear that cry in the middle of the night. Must have for fans of such games/settings. 8.5-9/10.			"

								This game is awesome. I'll give it 10 / 10 in the future.It has one wonderfull thing, which few of today's games have - it's own, specific CLIMATE. You feel it from the first seconds of play. Things which build up for it are:1. STORYYou wake up in the middle of nowhere, with no weapon, nor food. The heat of your body constantly falling. There's no time to think, you must act. The game pulls you in at the very beginning and keeps it that way.2. GAMEPLAYYou constantly need to do something. You're either hungry, thirsty, cold or exhausted. At some point it may gets little tiresome, because you wish you had more time for exploring things and this beautiful world, but if you carry on, you'll explore it anyway (Sandbox).The game is hard. There's only sandbox mode available with one area, but it gave me 10 hours of solid gameplay anyway. I consider full game with story mode and few more sandbox areas will give at least a couple of times this.3. GRAPHICSIt is made by a renowned artist Hokyo Lim, author of i.a. The Unfisnished Swan (https://www.google.pl/search?q=unfisnished+swan). He's an out-of-the-box thinker.Sometimes, you feel like watching a very good movie. But mostly, you feel like you're actually there. Standing there at the top of the mountain and admiring views. Some people may consider it looking a bit too fairy-tale-like, but for me it is suiting.4. SOUNDThe sound effects are what builds up the atmosphere and they are very real. At some point even the howling wind gives you chills because it sounds similiar to the wolf's howling.The music is heard only occasionally, but the moments choosen to play it build up the atmosphere even more.There are two PC available - man and woman. Man is vioced by the Mass Effect no.1 voice actor Mark Meer. Female - I don't know, but I think she's not a professionall voice actress or at least for me her voices are disturbing.CONS:The game got kind of tiresome after ~10h and a few deaths. There's lot of walking in the beginning and tt's also easy to die. If you die you loose your save. So, if you're hunted down on 2nd day due to distraction, you have to replay the whole part before it really got fun. I think it requires some sort of calibration yet.To sum it up: This game is made by professionals, who left big gaming companies to create offbeat titles. It has great graphics, music, and nice gameplay. When the story mode will be available, it will be unbelievably good. I predict it will deliver one of the best gaming experience in a long time. And I don't mean survival enthusiasts.			"

								This is one of the best Survival games ive played. Im not trying to be sexist but i feel like the male character should be able to carry at least 10 more lbs than the female, and also so its fair, give the female the ability to craft items faster and a higher chance of success than the male. It also would be awesome to be able to craft a bow and arrows so once your all out of bullets and cant find anymore you have something eles to protect yourself and hunt with.			"

								What an great survival game!  The graphics are oddly delightful too in a cartoonish but also very beatiful way.  I haven't encounter a game breaking bug besides hitting 'F10' to take a HUD-less screenshot of some scenery and the game crashed....once out of a lot of screenshots.  Who knows though?  That may have been my pc's fault.  This is how an alpha should be.  The game is well made without any game breaking bugs that's fun to play.  I know the community is looking forward to the story mode, as only sandbox mode is available now.  I highly recommended this game to a few of my friends, they loved it as well.  God bless Canada!     P.S.  I feel like I'm in the movie 'The Grey'			"

								This is my story of an experience which happened later on in the game, a few parts are fictional to provide more immersion.One cold day I was traveling to a place known as the Desolation Point, the wind was howling and wolfs where strafing through the cold wasteland.I heard about this place called Hibernia which was some kind of wale processing facility before the geomagnetic storm happened, I thought it might be worth a visit, maybe I would find some tools there, a saw would come in handy...As I was making my way to Hibernia I saw a bunch of wolves and even a bear guarding it, maybe the smell of the wale meat was still hanging around. I really wanted to get to this place, I only had one bullet left and I had the feeling chances are of finding some more in this abandoned factory. As I came closer and started to walk slowly across the frozen sea, trying to make as little noises as possible, the wind turned and carried my scent towards the wolves. I pulled my gun off my back and as soon as I had my finger on the trigger I already heard paws and claws on the ice behind me, I turned around and looked the wolf right in the eyes, it was baring its teeth and growling. I slowly started walking backwards, the muzzle of the gun pointing towards the wolf but it did not seem that it wanted to attack me and my pulse started to normalize, but suddenly I ran into something, the chicken wire fence surrounding this place got me caught. More wolves where approaching in the distance and I had to make a decision, do I run towards and past the wolves or do I use my last bullet... The sound of a gunshot is incredible loud if you haven't heard any cars or planes for a few weeks, it made all the other wolves flee, perfect as I needed to gut the wolf because a man has to eat if he wants to survive in this cold hell. It took me almost two hours to skin this poor thing, I didn't want to shoot it, but it was hungry and it was either him or me...My heart just stopped when I heard the breathing of something really big behind me, a big black bear stood not even 5 meters from me, I did not hear him coming because I was so busy pulling the pelt off this wolf, the smell of blood must've caught the bears attention. I slowly stood up, a mistake, the bear made a jump and his paws threw me to the ground, I was feeling his steamy breath in my face and I passed out...Was it the 350kg of pressure on my lungs, the pain of the bear digging his teeth into my shoulder or the fear which made me pass out? I don't know. But as I woke up It took me a few seconds to remember what just happened, I had pain everywhere and my vision was blurred, I looked around and saw my attacker who was just a few meters away feeding on the corpse of the wolf, I was lucky he liked that better then me. I dragged my body a few meters away as the bear noticed me and stopped eating and turned around and started walking towards me, with shaky hands I pulled out a flare and light it up. That was the best thing I could have done, the bear stopped and was afraid to come any closer. I barely made it into the factory and blood is pouring out of my shoulder, luckily I've found this bottle of antiseptic which burns like crazy but at least my wounds wont get infected.I can barely see anything because of the pain and its also very dark in here, it looks like a mattress is laying in that corner, time to rest a bit... The few pieces wolf meat I was able to grab before the bear surprised me will be very useful to keep my stomach filled for a few days while I recover from my wounds.			"

								It was a cold morning when I loaded this game up. I had the day off and the blinds were drawn. As I pulled a sweater on and sipped some tea, I felt the chill as I loaded the Mystery Lake sandbox mode (the only mode available as of yet).WIth no map and a few supplies, I found myself in a cave that led out into a clearing, with snow blowing. I managed to find a few cabins along a lake, with some food to keep me going. I ate too quick, and stretched myself too thin in the first day. The harsh realities of survival set in quickly. You need to make calm and calculated decisions. Evaluate your needs and priorities. The game builds an amazing atmosphere, reminiscent of being out in the forests of northern Alberta myself. Hearing wolves call, and seeing a buck off in the distance, going about it's life in a world devoid of humans. The short days and the blowing cold outside the window.This is a game that will addict you. It will give you the urge to stop down at your local MEC or REI to shop for a pack saw and a Coghlan's pocket can opener. You'll crave pork and beans in a way you never thought possible.For all its simplicity, this game is an enjoyable experience. Hinterland has delivered that experience with simple aesthetic that transfers a complex atmosphere. One of emotional and physical desolation that instills in you the desire to survive.An update: I brought this game out again after about half a year collecting dust, and they've made some great improvements, added new areas, refined a lot of the mechanics and crafting.I can not stress enough: one of the best things about this game is it is *not* procedural. Somebody actually put work into crafting the environments, and they're crafted well because of it. It does not look like an AI hit copy-paste. The artwork and modelling is fantastic, something a lot of the crafting/survival games right now lack.			"

								If you wanted to try one fo those survival, crafting games without the worries of zombies trying to kill you at every turn? Want a fresh, fun sandbox mode set in a winter wonderland (wonder hell when its a blizzard outside and you try and wander the frozen lakes at 4 am, character freezing, over encumbered and all you can see is 1 foot infront of yourself with your lantern because the strom is so bad. I swear it took forever to find the fishing shack and heat!),Then this game is for you! I'm very happy I picked this game up when it was on sale and get to experience it while it changes and evolves. Its also very nice to play a game set in Canadian wildlife, finaly feel my life experience of growing up near forests and living in cold winters paying off! The geography and setting feel very authentic and the little details remind you of where you are and what used to be there before the events of the game. The single player storyline is not yet done, but will be in final release. The option of male or female in sandbox mode is a very nice touch, too often I get stuck listening to some male character complain about hunger or heat or blah blah blah... Now it can be a female as well. (I think my survival skills need improvement :/ )UPDATE: Found out the two starting zones are connected by a few middle map areas to explore, which is pretty awesome I think. Also doing alot better in survival and gearing my character out to survive the harsh winter weather. I made it up to 5 days of survival (YAY!) and still havent found a rifle in my last two playthroughs, though plenty of ammo (11 shells being plenty to me since 5 is the most I've ever had at once until recently). Also survived a few harsh days and nights either on Mystery Lake or the Forestry Lookout house. The environment is still amazing to look at and omg the sunsets on calm, (cooler, not freezing) winter nights.Going to be a great game when its finally done, will update my option/review as it goes along.

It's mainly a survival/resource management game right now, with a Story Mode coming later. The game is in ALPHA right now (not even Beta), and it's very fun so far. The developers are still working on fixes and features. They are also considering suggestions for additions to the game and Sandbox Mode. Who knows what will be here in the future, but I'm going to call it: $10 is worth the game right now, as an unfinished Alpha.Will it be worth $20 in the future with the Story Mode? Possible. The art style is very cool, and some real nice voice acting. I expect there to be plenty of care with the story mode, so I'm staying positive.			"

								The Long Dark is a game in which the player has crash landed his plane into the canadian wilderness. If you play on the Mystery Lake map you bound to get killed by a wolf. But if you play on the coastel highway map, let me just say it is like the 31st of October. This game is a really challenge, if you don't find any weapons (gun, hunting knife,etc.) You are going to die. The combat system is very different and it can use some fixing. I stab a wolf 3 times with full power and only takes away 20% out of 100%. Overall this game could use some fixing, but it is in alpha. For being in alpha this game is sick and I recommend it to anyone that likes realistic survival.			"

								The only real survival game I've played.The long dark is a really phenomenal survival game. Unlike other games of the genre you actually struggle to survive.At one point I had survived for about two weeks and things were going pretty well. I had lots of food, I had plenty of water, good clothes and a nice warm hut to live in. I noticed I was running out of firewood tough, so I went outside and had a look at the weather. It looked good enough and I had a couple of (ingame) hours left before dark. After getting myself some firewood, I started to head back and out of nowhere a snowstorm showed up.I got lost on my way back to my hut and the sun was setting. I wondered around for a while trying to find something familiar but I couldn't see more than a couple of meters in front of me. I realized the longer I stayed out in the freezing wind the less time I had. My character was freezing pretty badly by now. In a last ditch attempt I went back the way I came where I had seen an old wind shelter. It was just big enough to fit in. I crawled in and tried to start a fire. I didn't have any accelerant with me so I couldn't get it going. I tried again and again. The storm wasn't getting any better. And by now the temperature was below -40 degrees Celsius. I came to the realization that I wouldn't get out of this. By now my character was too cold to even try to light a fire. I lit a match and held it up which increased the temperature inside the small wooden shelter by a degree or so. It was meaningless of course.I wrote a few last words in the diary and drifted off to sleep, never to wake again.			"

								The Long Dark delivers an experience that has since been missing in survival games: patience and strategy. In fact, the game feels like a rogue-like in the first person. The focus on realistic survival mechanics, such as material quality and time-dependent tasks, makes the game plenty challenging. Meanwhile, the cold environment creates an atmosphere of both tranquility and awe. Without superfluous mobs, character stats, items, and other distractions common to survival games, The Long Dark presents a beautifully refined survival experience.			"

								I bout this game yesterday thinking, ""Oh this could be interesting."" I was wrong. I was VERY wrong. This game is exceptional. Beyond excpetional. I started a sandbox, picked my character, and named her Abbie. Abbie and I started in a lighthouse and from there we spent the better part of 13 hours exploring, scrounging supplues, and escaping the local wildlife. Eventually we found ourselfs at the Trapper's Cabin and I decided that this would make a great home for Abbie. We went in and were very surprised at all of the gear left behind, there was even a rifle to but all the bullets we found along the way to use. Abbie and I then went about gathering firewood, hunting deer and bunnies, and making foraging trips for better clothes from the Mystery Lake.  On the 10th day, We were about gathering firewood and a bunny passed by, so Abbie equiped her bow and we started chasing that little bunny down. After a few minutes and many misses, we finally managed to hit that little rabbit and moved in to harvest it. Little did we know that there was a bear right around the rock the rabbit had died at. So Abbie quickly equipped the hunting rifle and took a shot, but it was too late the bear was upon her. She fought as hard as she could but the damage was done. Even though the bear had left her alive, we were far from home with no healing items to speak of. This was Abbie's last moments. We tried to stumble home but she collapsed in the snow dead.Never have a felt such heartbreak at losing a character. All the work that we had put into trying to build a home was all for naught. The fact that I had connected so much with a character who I never even saw the face of just shows how amazing this game is. I could not recommend this game more.TL;DR First character mauled by a bear after 13 hours. 10/10 Would get mauled again. "

								By far the best Early Access game I've ever played. This game is gorgeous, and simply exploring the vast expanse of Canadian wilderness becomes a main driving point as every new cabin or site you discover is like some sort of picturesque painting. I've amassed a considerable screenshot collection, utilizing the handy HD Screenshot (Hud Disabled) hotkey. The beauty is enchanting, but also deadly--which is another great aspect of this game. No zombies or otherworldly threat. Just nature's bites--the cold and the wolves. Those damn wolves... Surviving is a great challenge in either starting point, making each decision important since it is life or death with every hour that passes. A lot of games tout ""Survival"" as a selling point, but none have managed to really be an enjoyable experience to me until I played The Long Dark. I think the dev team have managed to strike a near-perfect balance of challenge and reward. Note that I've only played this on the standard diffuclty level--I've heard that the hardest difficulty adds more wolves... I'm confident they will change that and challenge the player some other way, as the wolves are notorious♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game. Like I mentioned, however, I think standard strikes a great balance and has been a lot of fun.Be aware that there is currently no narrative story mode--Sandbox mode alone is worth the price during a sale. Throughout the play, you'll encounter hints as to what the story may be... I've had a lot of fun with the minimalism of it all, and to see that sense of mystery last so long is impressive. I still haven't explored every last bit of the lands yet, and now they are going to double the size of the explorable terrain! So, I'll just leave off with that--I'm impressed with this game!!			"

								A beatiful game. I spent most of my time indoors, afraid of the wildlife. I went outside in the middle of the night and I saq the aurora. It made me feel comfortable.This game isnt just a survival game after the apocalypse. Its a exploration game more than anything.You are set in the northern Canadian wilderness after some sort of apocalypse that caused the tempetures in cold places to grow colder, and probably hot places such as deserts to grow hotter. Yes, its made in unity BUT, it looks beatiful. Just go outside at night and I assure you. It is such a sight.Cons: Possibly could use a tutorial or something.Pros: Everything else.Please buy this game, support the developers. Yes it is in Early Access but so far, its beatiful and amazing.			"

								TL;DR: Yes. Yes, yes, yes.Wow! I as a rule dislike survival games. Not my stuff. But I have to say, TLD is a nice - no, SUPERLATIVE change of pace. All the others try to get you in a big hurry, or have some NPC nonsense which ends up always screwing you over, and sometimes even they go for cheap jumpscares. But The Long Dark? It is an exceptional variety of game which deserves its space as one of the best, in my opinion, survival games. It could serve as a nice role model for what a truly good, truly fun survival game should look like, and I feel a successful launch out of early access is all it needs to get its worth in attention. Not only is it a worthy adversary towards others of its genre, the Hinterland team also serves as a great role model for what other indie and early access devs should be. Now, I realize that many are upset about the rather belated story mode; however, I am excited to see what they do with the extra time!Here's why I love this game:- As I said before: It's definitely a change from other survival games like Rust or The Forest.- It's a healthy balance between realistic and reasonable, two aspirations for survival games to reach.- The devs seem to genuinely care for the game, and respond to - or at least heed - the community.- And - and I hate to judge a general game off of this, but must comment about this on The Long Dark - the atmosphere: WOW. The Long Dark, even with its particularly... surreal, may I call it? art style, can completely captivate you, have you listening to the beautiful sounds and looking at the rather stunning world in the midst of your struggle to survive. It's amazing what you can do with pixels.Some things I (personally) would like in the game:- A few more bug fixes. I.e., random fall damage (still happens to me), sound cutting out every once in a while. That is not to say bugs are a major issue; no, no, in fact I wouldn't call them an issue at all, for me (except for those two, of course).- Maybe a map with a few more shelters for individuals such as I who aren't too good at the ""actually-doing-what-the-game-is-trying-to-get-you-to-do"" - survival.- More... interaction, within the game. Hopefully the story mode will have solved this issue with its NPCs; as of now, there is not much to do but survive and hear your character talk about surviving, and then move and do it all over again (of course, the very fact that a game can get away with that and still be fun is mind-blowing, and shows the splendor of the game).Welp, that was a little long-winded, I know, but I had a lot to say, and I've been holding it in too long. This Halloween update jumped me back into the game, and then I realized how fun it was and felt as if I was letting the hard-working devs down by not letting them know, Hey - your game? It's great. Keep it up.			"

If you're into survival games, and you're tired of not getting the full experience, The Long Dark is for you.This game includes many features that other survival games lack. For example, this game can be a big grind for casual players due to the simple fact that anything and everything will kill you. You can die of starvation, dehydration, hypothermia, and much much more.It's awesome, unforgiving game. 10/10.			"

								I haven't felt this invested in a game since long ago. I've found my heart pounding a couple of times after narrowly escaping a close encounter with the punishing wildlife, and spent some serious time pondering the best courses of actions (certainly more time than I would in any other game). You need to plan every outing somewhat carefully and be always ready to make a beeline back to wherever it is you call home.The beautiful art design and the amazing audio really conspire to pull you into the Canadian wilderness to a level that I believe could only be surpassed by the implementation of a VR mode, if at all.I am really looking forward to the full release and playing what promises to be an intense story-driven survival experience.

								The best survival experience I have found in a game yet.  It is challenging without feeling entirely unfair.  When you fail, you can generally look back at a moment of poor decsion making.  The game play is fairly simple with a basic gathering / crafting mechanic.  The hunting is one of the best I have played with wounded prey collapsing from their injuries at the end of long trackable trails of blood droplets.  The combat system is more of a struggle system and does a fair job of capturing the desperate feeling of being mauled by a wild animal.I wish I knew who to thank for this quote, ""It is like living in a painting that wants to kill you.""  And it is like that.  The game is gorgeous.  Every sunset and daybreak warrants a screen capture.  The sound effects are splendidly encompassing.  The music is subtle and lovely.  This is one of the rare games that I feel like I am in another world.A great game and must buy for any survival game or immersion gaming focused player.			"

								I backed this game on kickstarter based on the story mode that was promised. Here we are, YEARS later and still no story mode and not even a date for one any longer. I don't even bother to check for progress updates any more. As it stands this is just another sandbox survival game as the developer seems to have been sucked into a neverending sandbox development cycle whilst story takes a backseat.Very very disappointed in this developer so much so that I feel strongly enough to write my only ever steam review.If you just want a sandbox then from what I hear it's pretty good ( I don't play it as it's not what I backed this game for), if you want a story then I'd look elsewhere because right now I feel that I may actually see the final Song of Ice and Fire novels before we get this game finished. For those of you who don't get that reference, that's REALLY saying something. "

								Look, I really like this game, it's amazing and I don't need to add to the positives already listed here.  BUT the lack of a map is INCREDIBLY frustrating.  I know there are maps on the Steam Community, but surely this just goes to show that there needs to be an in-game directon system.  It's not even out of the bounds of the game lore to include this - in fact it's frankly ridiculous to go into the Forestry lookout and for there NOT to be some kind of map.  Or a compass.  Or anything so that I don't have to sit here with my ipad following a third party map.  At least where you've explored could be revealed in a mini-map.  Please, please incude  a mini-map!  It's just too frustrating without.			"

								Have I not reviewed this one yet? Well in short, it is a very good game. Probably the best survival simulator on the market.In further words, this game is truly excellent, in design, in aesthetic, in gameplay, in approachability. I've done a lot of outdoorsy stuff, and so far this is the only survival game I've played or seen that really captures what it's like to be in the environment. You aren't sprinting everywhere, you're usually just hiking with 40 kilos on your back. You aren't crafting improvized armor and weapons to battle the wolves and bears, but usually cleaning your rifle, and sowing up your clothes at night, so they keep you warm when you're working in the day. Sure you can get attacked by wolves, but most of the time your main worry is hypothermia.That's something else that's great about this game. It doesn't feel like you have a bunch of arbitrary rescource meters that have to be baby-sat all the time. You have the meters (Cold, hunger, thirst, exhaustion), but the game is quick to teach you how to manage them, and it isn't an immediate damning hit to a health bar when one starts to lower. Rather it just reduces your ""condition"" from 100%. Now I have been able to drag myself back to life with a condition of 15%, but likewise I have gone outside with a good condition, but froze to death because I didn't take necissary precautions. So the game never feels like it kills you unfairly (unless maybe you get blind-sided by a wolf, which is rare), and you always understand what you did wrong. So with the current rogue-like sandbox build, you have this great process of iterarting on previous runs and constantly improving, making it such a relaxing, fascinating, and enjoyable experience.So in conclusion, everyone should buy this. I'd say a solid 8/10 for the genre, and it ain't even fully built yet. I sing it's praises from the top of the firewatch tower where I first found the rifle, and a bottle of much needed lantern oil.			"

								Ohh it's creepy...there's this wolf see, Fluffy, and long story short he randomly appears in the dam (baffles many people how he got in, aside from possible window entrance) but he tends to be the #1 cause of death for players.BUT, there's a bigger story than that...I've concluded he's a ghost wolf, died in this dam during an accident while working the night shift. He was security, and his life was pretty good. He had a wife, couple kids, and good health. He enjoyed playing tennis at the local YMCA and building snowwolves with his kids on weekends. But one night while patrolling, one of the valves blew off it's place when to much pressure built up in a damaged pipe, and it got Fluffs (as his friends called him) right in his head. He held out for a little, but unfortunately there was too much internal bleeding. He was a dedicated security officer, and in his death he believes he's still on that night shift. Looking for trespassers, taking justice into his hands against thieves. We rage out on him, I do myself, but is he not doing his job? Is he not more dedicated to his work than we are to surviving? Fluffs, wherever you are...please let me hear you coming so I can bolt out the door X(Anywho...Good game, though I recommend it despite many frustrations I do warn that it's early access and thus frustrations will be common.

								This is a beautiful, immersive and tough survival-adventure game. There is not a lot of content out there due to it's early version, but it's still sucks you in pretty easily. It offers some realistic elements that are together making it a great survival experience.Exploring the world while scavenging for food and tools is surprisingly not boring at all compared to all those ""running simulators"" survival games, probably because of it's gorgeous world (that is not randomly generated, BTW), and it's a bit creepy, which is nice.When it comes to the mechanics and technical stability it's clear that these developers really know their business.I played a few early access titles, but non of them showed some real potential like The Long Dark. Buy it. I think that even if your not a survival games enthusiast, you'll still find The Long Dark very enjoyable.			"

								After playing this game for the first time, I've decided that I love it. The way the gameplay and the atmosphere feels simply amazing. The game design concept is simular to Shelter with it's lovely art. It feels so realistic walking around in the world explorning, searching for supplies and watching out for wolfs. Even though this isen't a horror game it still feels so scary (thanks to the atmosphere) that you're ready for anything. And I love this game because there are NO zombies in it (seriously guys, there are way to many of them already) only cold, wolfs and starving. And the Developers are constantly updating the game to both improve it and to add new things. And this is only Early access, the story mode isen't available (which will be when the full game is released) and yet there are so many things to do, to explore. This is my favorite survival game by far. And I've played loads of them. The Forrest, DayZ, Don't Starve, Shelter, pretty much all of them.Pro's-Huge amount of detail has been put into the game, level design and art.-Huge map to explore (three regions)-Pure survival, no zombies or unnatural creatures-Crazy amount of items, food, clothes, craft items, weponds, tools, etc.Con's-Can become a bit boring when you find yourself a food and water supply on day 1 and then you basically don't have to move your♥♥♥♥♥♥for a very long time.I give this game 8/10 for it's lovely design, gameplay and atmosphere.

								Loving the game and the atmosphere.- Really addicting, can't get enough! 100 days in and still going~- Beautiful. Nature and the sky. I'm ready to risk to get hypotermia everytime when I see beautiful sunrise.- Realaistic. Animal behaving is nice, maybe depens on how you like it. I played 100 days on Pilgrim. I felt a little silly sometimes how animals were too scared of you (but wolves are not always hostile in real life either). I made silly move once and provoked wounded wolf..., it made me feel game was back to perfect.    Weather is also amazing, Foggy days, blizzard nights. Just amazing~- Sounds. I love the sounds when walking on the snow in complete silent and I love so much the sound of own backpack, makes it really feel you carry so many supplies with you. Wind is sweet and bitter when you really need a shelter- It have it's calm relaxing moments and then those really intense moments. Blizzard at midnight, middle of Pleasant Valley field with no firewood. And too heavy backpack at Timberwolf Mountain. Worth it.- Feeling when finally returning to the own home base after weeks out.Going to try play on Voyageur next and ready for more challence.I can't wait to get storymode released, I still have so much fun in the sandbox mode.10/10 would sleep again Beneath a Starry Sky			"

								How am I suppose to write a review if it is Dark, and it will be Long???Well anyway,You play as a guy/girl that is lost on a random generated map, and you survive [Duh?].You can pick : Get rekt by nature and animals, or you can disable that.This game isn't a horror, but sometimes, for me, it becomes spooky.I recommend playing this if someone is in the room with you, or a friend came so.. you are not alone.Sometimes you will find broken cars, houses, roads and alot of things, I recommend going inside them and searching for food and water, and clothes.There are no zombies, monsters or anything paranormal in this game... Thank god... uushh..Last time I played this, I slipped into cold water since the ice was thick, and died 11/10			"

								Man vs Wild: 2015: Bear Grylls Reccommends 7/10.Oh and there's bears. You aren't DiCaprio, so I suggest not facking with bears. Or Wolves.Might update when Story mode S1 is out. Not very content heavy atm, hence the 7. Okay don't hate, I got this during 2015 Winter sale, hence the title. I would never buy singleplayer survival titles, because fighting NPCs isn't fun and will get boring after a while, hence Unturned or 7 days to die or Rust/DayZ/H1Z1 (lmao) are better imo. But since the store is already saturated with tons of those, and some are not well optimised, some have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community, I made an exception. $$ Well spent, it's beautiful and very immersive, the content is a bit on the low side as compared to similar titles, crafting is very basic and there is zero basebuilding and that is how game sets itself apart from the others, and is absolutely brutal.You for once, are  actually struggling to survive constantly.

								The Long Dark is very acceptable game for an early access. It has decent enough mechanics and the environment is really well made and pretty. However, the game has been stuck in early access for a long, long time. I myself got the game pretty cheap ( in a humble bundle), but there are people who paid full price. If I was one, i'd feel pretty ripped off. There is no story mode and there are a lot of bugs, and a ton or repetitive stuff. Some developer decisions are also kinda questionable. In a game where you literally die if you just don't do anything, the walking speed is infuriating slow. Doing anything takes a really long time - e.g breaking a branch in 3 doesn't really take 30 minutes IRL, and water doesn't take an hour to boil.  It feels like an unpolished 3D, first person rip off of Don't Starve.			"

								In this game you can listen to Jennifer Hale slurp tinned peaches - the heck else do you want?But seriously, this is a lovingly crafted game with punishing and brutal survival mechanisms, and evocative atmosphere dripping from every pore - some of the most gorgeous environment design I've ever seen. A moderately successful kickstarter game, it's immediately apparent to anyone giving it a fair chance that this is a true labour of love from a talented development team. One without the other would be an unfortunate miscarriage, but such is definitely not the case here.And yes, that is what Canada looks like all year 'round.Please be warned that it is not a hardcore hunting or survival simulator, and takes a few liberties with animal behaviour for the sake of game balance and flow that folks looking for a 500% realistic wilderness survival experience might find off-putting.

								We had two bags of Simple tools, 75 cardboard matches, five Sewing kits, a jerrycan half-full of kerosene, a whole galaxy of multi-colored meat pieces, guts, pelts, feathers… Also, a Hunting rifle, a knife, an small axe, a fishing tackle, a can of low condition dog food, and two box of ammo. Not that we needed all that for the trip, once you started marauding throughout the Canada, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the Dog food. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a survivor in the depths of a food poisoning, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.			"

								Great game, extremely beautiful and all. Works fine not really any bugs, However there are two issues that warrant a negative review1. Its an ""Early Access Game"" the problem with this and all other ""Early Access Games"" on Steam is that they NEVER come out of ""Early Access"" they are often just abandoned by their creators/developers. This game has been in early access since it came out and I'm really looking forward to it being a full game. The only problem is, it's been 2 almost 3 years since its been in this, most likely, forever lasting ""Early Access"" stage.2. Fall and other types of damage are extremely unrealistic. For example: jumping off a 2-4 ledge gets your ankle and wrists sprained. I get why, but it's still ridiculous.			"

Early Access Review
								It’s been over 2 months since the last sandbox update Vigilant trespass (22nd September). When vigilant trespass was released I uninstalled this game because this update added nothing that I had been waiting for and playing this game had become repetitive, boring and unenjoyable. The update before that was a decent update, penitent scholar (23rd of June). That was 5 months ago.For the time that we wait, the updates bring underwhelming content. Vigilant trespass being a prime example. Waiting for 3 months for an update for which the main attraction was a harder version of the same game is not worth it. On top of this, promises for a monthly sandbox update have never been met. Occasionally we get an excuse, this time it was “2/3 of our team is working on story mode”.Story mode has failed to meet 2 promised dates and has been given the ""it’s NOT coming out soon, we are trying to make it as good as we can"" title. Personally I’m ok with that because this game has amazing potential and wasting that on a rushed story mode would be a disaster. My problem is that the promises should have never been made in the first place. It’s misleading and unprofessional. If you paid builders who said they could make you a house in a year and after you paid, the builders said ""we can’t make it by that time, we want to make it as good as it can be and we can’t say when it will be ready"", you would be understandably annoyed. What I’m more upset about is the sandbox. There are no dates on when anything will come out. All we have is the roadmap which uses terrifyingly large timescales such as 6 months, and things on that list have been there for over 6 months! I’ve supported this game since its release. Sandbox updates used to add new regions, wildlife, weapons, and gameplay changes. They still took more than a month to come out but they were worth the wait. Now updates come out in 3 month periods, adding almost nothing new to the game, merely tweaking it slightly. I’m sick of it.I love this game. I’ve played it to death. As it stands the game needs more. Not just a story mode, but a massively improved sandbox with WAY more content. I’m sick of waiting too long for too little. If you don’t want inconsistent updates, a game that the more you play the more tiring it becomes because it’s lacking in content and developers who remain ambiguous about the release of content because they can’t keep promises. Then don't buy this game.			"

								Don't buy it!!! It's in early access for 3 years now and the developers won't even announce a release date for story mode anymore. Most likely this will go down the usual early access survival game path. The sales will dry up, the devs will run out of money and, in the best case scenario, they'll release a half finished, duct taped together, mediocre pile of garbage.And if you even dare to complain about it on their Facebook page, they will delete your comments and block you.As for the game itself, it's boring. It seems amazing the first time you play the sandbox, but when you die and restart the game, you realize that there's nothing much to do in it. You visit the same locations, open the same drawers, scavenge for soda cans over and over and over again. After 40 in-game days the game turns into a wolf fighting simulator, because the map is spammed so full of wolves that you can't even leave the house without having to fight a wolf.I noticed that the AI of wolves got worse over time. Now the wolves aren't even scared of your flares anymore. I dropped a flare on the ground and the wolf walked over it, probably burning himself, but he didn't care. And that's basically the game - you visit the same locations, scavenge for food and have MMA fights with wolves.			"

								This game hasn't evolved enough since it first beta release. Developers are not giving feedbacks on their work. They make promises and excuses, but game is not going on. I'm rating this down since i think nobody should buy this game until devs respect their promises on kickstarter campaign. It's not even about the 3 years in development, it's about how much they share of development status, which is almost nothing. Why should i believe they are actually doing anything? Don't buy this game until finished.Once (and IF) they release, i'll gladly change the evaluation of the game.			"

								It's one of those titles that get's you connected, actually living your adventure as a city man/woman in an unknown frozen part of Canada, freestyle and with full consequences.I won't soon forget the grueling one hour I spent on a new map just entered when a blizzard hit and my frantic search for a cave or shelter of any kind (I died that time from hypothermia and 2 sprained ankles that made me crawl, made it almost through that night blizzard, after I burned every piece of wood I had with me to keep me worm and finally got so dizzy I couldn't move)...At 140+ hours I'm still learning stuff, finding new ways to do things. It may not suffice to play only TLD, but I find myself returning every few days to adventure solo in a frozen wilderness. There is a certain appeal to that.I highly recommend this game. It is being actively developed from forum feedback and it shows an unbelievable quality for an Alpha game. The price is a bit steep but well worth it. One can feel the love the programmers put in it, just as they say in the opening screen.			"

P.S - Make sure you have a half decent computer, I'd say I have a sort of high end pc and when outdoors the framerate is always around 30 and can drop lower.

								If I recommend this game? the answer is: YES YES AND YEEEEEEEEEEEEES.Each update this game gain more and more I fall in love with it, the developers work really hard to make this game the best and they already gave the idea of what the story mode will be with the teaser they showed (I feel so hyped for 2016 right now).So first things first as is said the game isn't about zombies or player versus player survival, this is the intimate thing, you can face others people and survive ? or zombies ? good but in the long dark this doesn't mean anything, here you have to face the nature, you can kill things ? welp sorry but you can't kill the cold, neither the thirsty or hungry, here you need to always keep yourself warm, with food and resources or: it's over.The game is really challenging and the better you get more you will want to explore and get better gear and of course if you do a mistake: game over. So if you are like me and love survival games who are always challenge you and is a true survivor, bought this game, is worth it!			"

Look at the items (plenty and more coming) The game doesnt take too much hard drive space. A story mode TBA. A weapon to defend yourself. Great sound effects. Bad part: Small map. Hatchet,s prybars and hunting knives not usable in hands? No real people after you or saving you (maybe in story mode!) Great game! much to come!LOOOOONG review (very detailed)As you can see ""Early Access"". I've had history and I'm sure many others had history with bad ""Early Access"" games. Too many bugs, discontinued, you name it. This game is the exact oppasite. -No Bugs (only a few mistakes in map where you can run out) -Still continued and has been proven to be good by kickstarter and steam. -Rich content is still being added, it is amazing to see new items. But dont get your hopes up for content every week. They're surely working hard!-Soon TBA the date of the Story mode-Male and Female (not that deep stuff please)-Geomagnetic storm (learnt that after looking on wikipedia, very interesting)-Spoiler: Bunker?? 20 hours on this game, still cant find it.-Good size of the game-Good amount of buildings on first map-Wolfs (My breed just black) are very angry-Shooting Hunting rifle indoors? *PPPIIINNNGGG* great soundaffects including sound like flashbangs!-Limited ammo for rifles!Now, here comes bad stuff (don't worry, its not alot!-Wolf's are very concentrated on deer if they killed one you can even sneak behind them and tickle them before they notice you. (yes i did this)-Why does everything wear out so quickly. Im sure i can use a hunting rifle that was used in World war 2, that could maybe have a ton of damage (lets say 25% is still good) and shoot another 10,000 rounds.-Food get worn out too quick, i had so much wolf meat, they just disappear.-Make Hatchets, knives, prybars useable in hands.-Be able to sharpen tools with certain rock types-Bigger maps (I'm really wishing for a big map of like Canada's mid-lands of train stations to national disaster parks (before the geomagnetic storm there was national parks, see what i did there)-Maybe a Pistol or something from the army which is very rare-A 2.5x or 5.0x or 20.0x scope meaning anything from agoc simple, to holo sights, to old war-time ironsights (the ones that germany created that thought they could shoot anything up to 5000 yards, (silly germans).Yeah. sorry that this review is too long but yeah! there you go :)-Floje			"

Use your time constructively, by looting, hunting, and gathering the supplies like timber, and horde it at your favourite shelter. This is very important for when there is bad weather.Make a mistake, or take too big of a risk and expect to the severely punished!!Planning is the key. Fun challenging game. Highly recommended. "

								Early access review:After a few stumbling attempts ending in death by falling, hyperthemia, wolf attack, exhaustion coupled with food poisoning and more wolf attacks, I finally got the hang of things.With an ever-present sense of peril, I chose to leave the forrest with all its delicious untrappable rabbits, embarking on a journey in search for better pastures and -- dare we hope? -- a gun. After a few days of scavaging, I eventually found a tunnel through the mountains, leading to a large lake. Along its shores I found a small town and was finally able to make camp on a more permanent basis. There I spent my days fishing and forraging, each day trekking back to my pleasant little homestread. Life was good. On the seventh day I finally found a gun next to a corpse and... it all went down-hill from there.With a sense of delusional self-empowerment, possessing the means to ascend to the top of the food chain, I shot and missed a few wolves. On the 9th day, on my day home from an unusually unproductive expedition, I came upon a bear that had annoyingly blocked my path during the morning. Taking aim, I shot (and probably missed yet again) believing that I could get to a nearby house if I couldn't get it to bleed to death. And oh boy, bears can apparently sprint pretty well, for it quickly pushed me to the ground and mauled me repeatedly, leaving me for dead. Within an inch of my life, I crawled my way back to the house. The next morning, a wolf waited outside my door, making easy pray of my already wounded form. And so yet another story ended.----------Perhaps a little repetative with the same map every time, but as long as you're actually exploring its a very enjoyable experience.			"

Spent the next two hours dying, a lot.If you like survival games I recommend jumping straight in with the hardcore mode. Anything less and the game doesn't really pose much of a challenge. Also, try to avoid looking stuff up on the internet. It's quite rewarding when you slowly figure out how things work and you'll kick yourself for your previous stupidity when you do. Really gives you the sense of being some inept survivor stuck in a weilderness that you have no idea how to survive in.Has taken me around 20 gaming hours to finally craft all the available items and get to the point where I'd say I'm an accomplished survivor. I did nearly give up at one point, after a wolf surprise attacked me after around 10 days of game time (around 8 hours real time) and killed me but I persisted and later figured out better ways to survive wolf attacks with some pre planning.There are a lot of tips I'd love to give you, as looking back I realise I spent many hours doing things the wrong way or not understanding a concept that meant I was dying more than I had to, but this is what made the game a challenge. If you can accept that you'll inevitably die many many times but each time you restart you'll be a little better and get a little further, then you'll enjoy the game immensely. Sometimes it can feel like you're spening most your day constantly eating, drinking and sleeping just to keep yourself alive, with only a little time in between to explore. This did very nearly put me off, so be prepared to hit a point of frustration and battle through it. Once you get the hang of it though, you'll learn how better to keep your energy up and make efficient use of your time.Only one info I will give is that the sandbox has three maps. These maps are interconnected from within the game. I assumed they were three entirely different worlds. It was nice to realise that once I was starting to understand the layout of the first map, I could actually walk to a new area entirely and so the fun of exporing would begin again. "

								If you like games about exploration or surviving against the elements, this is an amazing game. Well done graphics, chilling - literally and metaphorically - atmosphere, not too hard to figure out without a tutorial. Auto-saves frequently which is nice. Died within 10 hours on the first play.

								Let's begin with the insane amount of survival games that already exist. There are plenty to choose from. So why The Long Dark? Because there's something about it that is constantly tempting me to come back and play it again. Early access, yes. However, a genre that needed something different, got it. The art style is overall incredible. The gameplay is mostly smooth and besides the fact that it's not finished, the gameplay sets the stage for a promising, yet haunting, survival game.			"

								Update: The developers have continued to provide excellent content for this game. Despite still being in early access, this game has outperformed and outlasted many others in terms of love by the devs.Without word of a lie, one of THE best game's I have bought on a whim. I wasn't sure if it'd be that great. But I have instantly fell in love with this game. Within 10 hours of playing I was completely enveloped. The ambience and sound direction of the game are incredible. It really feels like your stranded out there in the freezing cold forests of Canada. The game offers good quality, challenging gameplay. Mistakes are punished and taking risks will either net you great reward or complete loss. Yes this game is early in development, but it is incredibly flushed out.			"

								It's one of those titles that get's you connected, actually living your adventure as a city man/woman in an unknown frozen part of Canada, freestyle and with full consequences.I won't soon forget the grueling one hour I spent on a new map just entered when a blizzard hit and my frantic search for a cave or shelter of any kind (I died that time from hypothermia and 2 sprained ankles that made me crawl, made it almost through that night blizzard, after I burned every piece of wood I had with me to keep me worm and finally got so dizzy I couldn't move)...At 140+ hours I'm still learning stuff, finding new ways to do things. It may not suffice to play only TLD, but I find myself returning every few days to adventure solo in a frozen wilderness. There is a certain appeal to that.I highly recommend this game. It is being actively developed from forum feedback and it shows an unbelievable quality for an Alpha game. The price is a bit steep but well worth it. One can feel the love the programmers put in it, just as they say in the opening screen.			"

								This game is amazing! (ok not so much but still :P)Yes, my picture is a wolf, why do them Wolfannibals (cannibals) exist? Well.(Short Version)This game is very good, look at the bugs (none). Look at the items (plenty and more coming) The game doesnt take too much hard drive space. A story mode TBA. A weapon to defend yourself. Great sound effects. Bad part: Small map. Hatchet,s prybars and hunting knives not usable in hands? No real people after you or saving you (maybe in story mode!) Great game! much to come!LOOOOONG review (very detailed)As you can see ""Early Access"". I've had history and I'm sure many others had history with bad ""Early Access"" games. Too many bugs, discontinued, you name it. This game is the exact oppasite. -No Bugs (only a few mistakes in map where you can run out) -Still continued and has been proven to be good by kickstarter and steam. -Rich content is still being added, it is amazing to see new items. But dont get your hopes up for content every week. They're surely working hard!-Soon TBA the date of the Story mode-Male and Female (not that deep stuff please)-Geomagnetic storm (learnt that after looking on wikipedia, very interesting)-Spoiler: Bunker?? 20 hours on this game, still cant find it.-Good size of the game-Good amount of buildings on first map-Wolfs (My breed just black) are very angry-Shooting Hunting rifle indoors? *PPPIIINNNGGG* great soundaffects including sound like flashbangs!-Limited ammo for rifles!Now, here comes bad stuff (don't worry, its not alot!-Wolf's are very concentrated on deer if they killed one you can even sneak behind them and tickle them before they notice you. (yes i did this)-Why does everything wear out so quickly. Im sure i can use a hunting rifle that was used in World war 2, that could maybe have a ton of damage (lets say 25% is still good) and shoot another 10,000 rounds.-Food get worn out too quick, i had so much wolf meat, they just disappear.-Make Hatchets, knives, prybars useable in hands.-Be able to sharpen tools with certain rock types-Bigger maps (I'm really wishing for a big map of like Canada's mid-lands of train stations to national disaster parks (before the geomagnetic storm there was national parks, see what i did there)-Maybe a Pistol or something from the army which is very rare-A 2.5x or 5.0x or 20.0x scope meaning anything from agoc simple, to holo sights, to old war-time ironsights (the ones that germany created that thought they could shoot anything up to 5000 yards, (silly germans).Yeah. sorry that this review is too long but yeah! there you go :)-Floje			"

								This is the most realistic survival game I have ever played. It makes all these modern day folk that only care about graphics remember how good gameplay is. That's why I like Valve so much because they care ALL ABOUT gameplay and graphics do not matter to me. It looks spectacular for the Unity Engine and is EXTREMELY difficult. Not so difficult that you would quit the game and get a refund, but the kind of difficult where you MIGHT quit and come back later and then start anew and have another fun adventure in the frozen wilderness. I don't even have any changes except for one thing ; I got caught on a snow polygon and was walking on the mountain top and all of a sudden out of nowhere sprained my ankle. This happened three times and made me waste all of my painkillers. That's...About it for bad things. This game is simply stunning in realism.			"

								Simply the best survival game at this moment.In theory there is very little to worry about. For survival you need  a few simple things:  Food, water and shelter. These are the key elements in this game. No complex crafting (though there is some crafting and repairing), no complex building. Just plain simple survival.  really?  It is harder then you think. This game does not give in to the easy generation. It has permadeath, and it's hard. Every bullit counts. You have to plan ahead to survive.  You can't forage wood in bitter cold. So you better have some in reserve.  Ah yeah, every match counts to :P . Sometimes it's even unfair how hard it is. Just like real life.Simplicity is the key In everything. You won't find super realistic graphics with grass looking even more realistic then real grass, like in chernarus (from arma/dayz) However, the graphics still look very appealing.  Especially at sunrise, and sunset. Just beautiful.Allthough this is yet another early access , it is a Must buy if you are into survival games.  I bought this game in  sale, but I would pay full price for this game.  It's worth it.One tip for starters:  Don't start on easy mode. Go for stalker, or at least medium mode. Also, don't  use any online maps to find all the locations. Find everything yourself.			"

Early Access Review
								Initial Review - 31/12/2014I've never purchased an early access game before but was intrigued by the concept of The Long Dark and the overwhelmingly positive reviews it has received so far. Suffice to say I was not disappointed.The Long Dark is an Incredibly tense, beautiful and engaging wilderness survival game. Although the wildlife and combat are quite limited in the current version, the survival mechanics are very deep as you find yourelf in a constant struggle to stay alive as you scavenge for food/water and try to keep your character warm, healthy and rested,The difficulty options are neat - allowing you to opt for a more ambient experience, a brutal survival experience or something in between - and it's nice to see you can choose your gender and environment before starting.There's alot of fun to be had with this game in it's current state (sandbox mode) and I can only imagine it will get better as new mechanics, modes and environments are added.Recommended for fans of games like Don't Starve but I also encourage players who enjoy exploring vast yet delicate environments to give this a try.-----Review Update 1 - 11/6/2015: Following my review from December 2014, this game has went from strength to strength as the devs have added a host of new environments, wildlife and mechanics. Each update has been of a consistently high standard and I have no doubt they will continue to improve/refine the game as they push towards full release.Each of the sandboxes has a very distinct feel - forcing you to adapt your survival style as you progress - and the transisition areas between each sandbox are unique and challenging. The bears are a welcome addition as are the new crafting mechanics: such as curing of animal skins (which makes crafting of animal-based clothing a little trickier) and the bow and arrow (which provide a nice alternative to the rifle). The general balancing has improved alot since I started playing this - providing a good mix of thoughtful exploration and harrowing survival - and the backpack interface has evolved nicely.The Long Dark is undoubtedly one of the finest products on Steam and surely one of the best examples of Early Access done right.Highly recommended!-----Review Update 2 - 13/2/2016Following my June 2015 update, the Hinterland team have added even more environments: including the oddly-sinister Desolation Point - where the ominous Processing Station contrasts starkly with the cosy Lighthouse - and highly-challenging Timberwolf Mountain - which requires nerves-of-steel to navigate its lakes, forests, slopes and caves.New gameplay additions - such as the flare gun, rope climbing mechanics, ability to pick up stray wood and ability to break down items in the game world (one of my favourite additions since purchase) - serve to deepen the already-refined gameplay; nothing feels quite so humbling as finding a cosy cabin in the middle of a fierce storm then being forced to break and burn any remaining signs of humanity in order to stay warm.Hinterland have overhauled the UI side of the game too with a much improved backpack interface, detailed logbook and stats screen and the ability to create multiple saves at once. You can also choose to start from any region now: a welcome edition for new players who will likely benefit as they attempt to hone their own survival style. You can now play the game with a controller as well as keyboard-and-mouse: the former feels good but the latter remains my weapon-of-choice.Since my last review I've clocked in almost 100 hours of playtime and reached the peak of Timberwolf Mountain: a great achievement indeed. I look forward to the impending Story mode but even without that feature, this game is already more than worth your time and money.Essential!			"

Early Access Review
								After 23 Hours of the game on record I can safely come to this conclusion.First and foremost I would like to personally and sincerely thank (HINTERLAND) for doing the right thing and slowely adding content to an already great idea and focusing on core gameplay, not boosting the specs with Unreal Engine 4, Cry Engine 3 or some other kind of Graphic Steroids that would require a $200-$350 USD Graphics Card just to run.  I  can't beleive I put off getting this game for so long, it had been in my Wishlist since late 2014.  Most (Early Access) developers earn a bad repputation for doing 1 of 3 things.  (1.)  Abandoning the Game in Early or Mid Development Stages.(2.)  Focusing Soley on Making an Overhyped Graphics W**** Game.(3.)  Continuing to add content to a game, none or very little of which is community input based.I feel strongly as a middle aged veteran gamer and a person who has purchased many bad and a few good Early Access games that this game has a very very strong chance of success.As long as (HINTERLAND) continues to stay away from those 3 bad EA Karma's.  If you have been looking for a serious, deeply immersive survival game with an atmosphere and core gameplay that makes since and isn't too over powered and isn't 24 hour beatable either, then look no further.  Other than maybe (DON'T STARVE) or (STRANDED DEEP) you aren't likely to currently find a Crafting/Open World/Atmospheric/Survival Game that is quite as polished and runs as well as this.  Seriously, I have a F****** Dinosaur of an old Gaming rig, most friends call a toaster, I can run this game with 50-60 FPS though.			"

								The crucial advice about this game is not to spoil yourself! This Game combines the Beauty of canadian winter with solitude. Creating a picturesque yet subliminal morbid atmosphere. Game is in a very developed state. Very little bugs in game or translation german and english text. At this point you can explore 5 different big maps. I had the most fun explorring the areas and still finding surprises after 100h of gameplay. Dont read too much about it. Buy it and have fun you wont be dissapointed.			"

								This is a very promising game if you like certain types of gameplay. Let me clarify what type of gameplay this game has so you get the idea of whether you want to play it or not.---------------------------------At this CURRENT moment the game only offers the ability to play in sandbox mode. In this mode you spawn in a random area at a random time of day. The goal is to survive as long as you can and that's about it, however, it's not as easy as you'd always assume. The loot around the area is also random so you may be lucky or unlucky as to what you will find. I don't think you can be soo unlucky that you will die right from the start but you may not find something as valuable as a sewing kit.You have to deal with many issues in this game such as starvation, dehydration, fatigue, injuries, freezing, etc. There is food within the game as random loot as well as raw meat from animals which you can cook on a fire. Having something to drink can be random or you can melt snow to get water and you will need to boil water to purify it for safe drinking unless you have a water purifier. If you carry too much weight you will get fatigued very fast as well as running around everywhere and burning your calories which is another thing in the game. Depending on the quality of your items and what they are changes how well you can survive outside for extended periods of time and being by a fire isn't going to help you if it's windy and freezing outside so going indoors is always a good option.This alone wouldn't be much of a challenge but there are also wolves in the game and they are quite brutal. If one attacks you then you must build up strenth then attack it which can do 3 things: hurt the wolf a little, hurt the wolf enough to make it run away, or kill the wolf. If you are very tired and run into a wolf you are screwed because you cannot build much strength up at that time and you will be overpowered and killed.The weather can be mellow, windy, or there may be a blizzard which will freeze you VERY fast if you are outside.There will be more options and there will be a campaign but at the moment there is only sandbox survival which is still fun.---------------------------------The art style is nice in this game and is different. The sounds are great and this is an overall nice game. Should you buy it? Completely up to you but at the current state $20 is a bit much but there is more content coming and I've been seeing 1-2 updates a day since launch so things are actually getting done and I believe my money was well spent so far.

								My Husband actually recommended this game to me, he saw that it was about Canada, and created by a Canadian and rightly thought - my Canadian wife might like this game!  I've put in about 10 hours so far, and I've enjoyed them all.  So far I've only played on the newbie level, I was just trying to get a good feel for the game and what I'd be in for.Some quick things that stood out for me are:* The attention to sounds; The crunch of the snow, the soft woosh sound of nylon clothing rubbing when you walk, the sound of the wind when it picks up (sounds so cold..), and the moment when the fire takes and picks up intensity (I can almost imagine the smell of the wood burning).  It makes the game way more real for me, maybe it's because these are things I recall from living in Canada during the winter months - dunno, but I love it and hope they continue to add more.* It's not too intense; so many games right now are all about scarying you out of  your chair, or zombies.  This game is just quiet, and alone.. it's a nice change.  It reminds me of being a kid outside in the snow and that feeling of alone - and that building fear of being really alone - and wondering what might happen. I dunno, again - this might just be me - but it's a great change from all the running and constant death and fighting.I hope this game continues to develop, I can't wait to see more new stuff and explore further.  Highly recommend, one of the best games I've purchased in 2015! :)			"

								This is the most realistic survival game I have ever played. It makes all these modern day folk that only care about graphics remember how good gameplay is. That's why I like Valve so much because they care ALL ABOUT gameplay and graphics do not matter to me. It looks spectacular for the Unity Engine and is EXTREMELY difficult. Not so difficult that you would quit the game and get a refund, but the kind of difficult where you MIGHT quit and come back later and then start anew and have another fun adventure in the frozen wilderness. I don't even have any changes except for one thing ; I got caught on a snow polygon and was walking on the mountain top and all of a sudden out of nowhere sprained my ankle. This happened three times and made me waste all of my painkillers. That's...About it for bad things. This game is simply stunning in realism.			"

Early Access Review
								Day 1: I awake to find myself in a frozen wasteland. Alone, cold and getting colder. What do I do? I need food, water, shelter. Trudging through the thick snow, I decide my best bet is to find some high ground and hope I can spot something that may be of use. As I reach the peak I see a small wooden structure next to a pond. Eagerly I rush down the side of the hill, hoping that I may find something of use. Inside is a can of beans, and not much else. Quickly I collect my prize and scavenge a small bundle of sticks that may be I can use for a fire if I can't find some place to hold up for the night. A little ways in the distance I see a flock of crows cawing, and circling over something. I decide to check it out. There in the snow bank, right under where the black birds hover is a man, dead. Covered in ice and snow. Most likely lost his way in a storm, looking for shelter or food, the same way I am. Is this my future? No, I won't end up like him. All I need to do is find some place to hold up and eventually, surely, help will come. I search his body, no time to pay respects. The sun is setting and I need to move. Maybe he has something that will help me avoid the same outcome as him. A smile spreads across my face. A pocket knife! Jackpot! I need to move now. I think I see something in the distance.Night 1:The house must have belonged to a trapper. Inside was a rifle, with a couple rounds, and some wire traps for small game. I've never hunted in my life, but necessity demands that I learn on the fly now. I tore the cabin apart, scavenging whatever I could use. I'm so cold though. Snow clinging to almost every inch of my clothing. It took a few tries, but I was able to get a fire started in the stove in the corner. Good thing I had those matches on me during the crash. There's only a few left though. I'll need to be careful how I use them. Right now these are the most precious tools to me. Each small stick is precious to seperate me from death. As I warm myself by the fire, I decide to melt some of the snow to give myself a small supply of drinking water. As the water boils I also use my newly found pocket knife to open the can of beans. Heating them on the fire I gulp it down as soon as they're done. Back home this would barely pass as a snack. Here it's a gourmet meal. It's time I get some sleep. In the morning I need to hunt. Other than a small package of jerky and a candy bar I found in the cabin, I'm not very well stocked. Hopefully my first hunting trip will pay off.Day 2:Maybe I should've watched somet hunting shows when I was back home. It occurs to me I know almost nothing on how to hunt and trap. I set up the wire trap in the woods, but unless a rabbit just happens to strangle itself in it I don't think I'm going to have much luck. I'll come back and check in awhile. In the meantime I'll try to track down one of those deer I saw yesterday.The trap is empty. Go figure. My stomach is growling. The candy bar did little to slate my hunger. What the hell am I going to do? I pick up the trap. Maybe I'll have better luck somewhere else? What's that? Out the corner of my eye I see movement. A buck! Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ No way! Maybe someone up there is looking out for me after all! I crouch trying to hide my presents as I bring the rifles sights up. I've only ever fired a BB gun before, but it's the same concept right? I line the sights up, centering them near the deers heart. I let out my breath slowly, as I go to pull the trigger...Night 2The irony isn't lost on me, even as I sit here, the Long Dark creeping in on me. My head hurts, I can hear my own heart beat pulsing in my ears. I killed the deer. One shot. It went down like I was an expert. I even was able to skin it, gut it, and harvest the meat, something I never thought I'd ever do. I had a feast all laid out in front of me. Yet in the end it wasn't lack of food or shelter that will do me in. Fire. God damned fire. Something that the earliest man knew how to use somehow eludes me. I couldn't get the fire started again. I had two matches and both times the fire only flickered and died. I have no way to start it. In a panic I ran outside to go look for something to start it with, but it's midnight and a storm hit. I can't see a foot in front of my face. I'm lost, I think I've been going in circles. I don't remember where the cabin is. I chuckle as I think of how bad I am at this. I couldn't even survive 2 nights on my own. No ones coming for me, there won't be a rescue party, and in the end I'm destined to die here in the snow. I close my eyes and wait for the end. I just hope that the darkness comes for me before the wolves do. PROS:-Fantastic survival simulator, even at this early stage of development. Already have put 4 hours in and will continue to put in more.-2 large maps-Each playthrough feels different-Challenging. 2 days is the longest I've survived so far-Great atmosphere, and feeling of lonliness and isolation-Wolves stalk you, and at night their eyes glow and makes you feel like you're in ""The Grey."" A+ for that.-No map. I count this as a pro because you have to rely on your own memory of where things are. When storms hit you can quickly become disoriented and lose your way which is thrilling.CONS:-The coastal highway map feels a bit too easy. I came across a town with several houses and have found a virtually endless supply of food, water, and great clothing. Not to mention it's next to several fishing spots. When your supplies are in abundance the game loses it's sense of adventure and danger, and thus loses a large amount of fun-Items are randomly placed every game, but structures are not. This means you can eventualy learn the map and find all houses quickly just from memory. Though it's random what you'll find, knowing where to look eliminates some of the challenge of surviving. -Only animals you'll currently see are deer, rabbits, and wolves. Here's hoping we see some new fauna additions in the future.-Not a lot to do when you're well fed, and stuck inside during a blizzard. A way to level up your abilities with out having to repair/craft something would be nice, like reading books, etc.			"

Early Access Review
								A great and challenging survival game with well balance mechanics.Died within 24 game minutes my first time playing (24ish real seconds). Spent the next two hours dying, a lot.If you like survival games I recommend jumping straight in with the hardcore mode. Anything less and the game doesn't really pose much of a challenge. Also, try to avoid looking stuff up on the internet. It's quite rewarding when you slowly figure out how things work and you'll kick yourself for your previous stupidity when you do. Really gives you the sense of being some inept survivor stuck in a weilderness that you have no idea how to survive in.Has taken me around 20 gaming hours to finally craft all the available items and get to the point where I'd say I'm an accomplished survivor. I did nearly give up at one point, after a wolf surprise attacked me after around 10 days of game time (around 8 hours real time) and killed me but I persisted and later figured out better ways to survive wolf attacks with some pre planning.There are a lot of tips I'd love to give you, as looking back I realise I spent many hours doing things the wrong way or not understanding a concept that meant I was dying more than I had to, but this is what made the game a challenge. If you can accept that you'll inevitably die many many times but each time you restart you'll be a little better and get a little further, then you'll enjoy the game immensely. Sometimes it can feel like you're spening most your day constantly eating, drinking and sleeping just to keep yourself alive, with only a little time in between to explore. This did very nearly put me off, so be prepared to hit a point of frustration and battle through it. Once you get the hang of it though, you'll learn how better to keep your energy up and make efficient use of your time.Only one info I will give is that the sandbox has three maps. These maps are interconnected from within the game. I assumed they were three entirely different worlds. It was nice to realise that once I was starting to understand the layout of the first map, I could actually walk to a new area entirely and so the fun of exporing would begin again. "

								I hardly ever buy early access games, not because I don´t trust them, but because I know I´ll find glitches or things that I won't like and therefore, be unfair with the concept or the game itself. The Long Dark is one of those gems that still has dust and mud all over, but you know will be worth in the end. I so far have found a couple of glitches like wolves getting stuck inside a tree or even myself getting stuck where I should be able to walk and pass freely. Despite glitches and difficulty (which can be extremely high at times) I loved the game. I'll be brief with the review:a) Graphics 8/10: good and different. If you're looking for detailed textures and realism this ain't for youb) Gameplay 9/10: frustrating at times (killed by falling from the edge of a mountain when walking at night), foolish at others (spent a week eating cooked meat, drinking water, and sleeping 12 hours in a row), but overall balanced. Make sure you get some experience before trying hard modec) Sound 8/10: effects are pretty good. Wind, wolves, even drinnking water sound good to me.d) Replay value 9/10: you'll find yourself trying over and over again till you kill those mother***** wolves or find better resourcese) Concept 10/10: the idea is amazing. Co op, bigger maps, more loot, more crafting chances, less wolves, more guns and ammo, these are some ideas I'd like to see in the future.MY VERDICT: Worth a try			"

								Early access review:After a few stumbling attempts ending in death by falling, hyperthemia, wolf attack, exhaustion coupled with food poisoning and more wolf attacks, I finally got the hang of things.With an ever-present sense of peril, I chose to leave the forrest with all its delicious untrappable rabbits, embarking on a journey in search for better pastures and -- dare we hope? -- a gun. After a few days of scavaging, I eventually found a tunnel through the mountains, leading to a large lake. Along its shores I found a small town and was finally able to make camp on a more permanent basis. There I spent my days fishing and forraging, each day trekking back to my pleasant little homestread. Life was good. On the seventh day I finally found a gun next to a corpse and... it all went down-hill from there.With a sense of delusional self-empowerment, possessing the means to ascend to the top of the food chain, I shot and missed a few wolves. On the 9th day, on my day home from an unusually unproductive expedition, I came upon a bear that had annoyingly blocked my path during the morning. Taking aim, I shot (and probably missed yet again) believing that I could get to a nearby house if I couldn't get it to bleed to death. And oh boy, bears can apparently sprint pretty well, for it quickly pushed me to the ground and mauled me repeatedly, leaving me for dead. Within an inch of my life, I crawled my way back to the house. The next morning, a wolf waited outside my door, making easy pray of my already wounded form. And so yet another story ended.----------Perhaps a little repetative with the same map every time, but as long as you're actually exploring its a very enjoyable experience.			"

								If you're afraid of a challenge, this game isn't for you. It won't terrify you or provide you with a cheap thrill. Instead, it will continuously put you in disadvantageous scenarios that will test your survival prowess.It's unfortunate that other maps must be unlocked by exploring the default map given the seemingly enormous size of the default map but I suppose that would make the unveiling of new areas much more rewarding.I'd really like to see a multiplayer aspect going forward.10/10, absolutely recommend for non-zombie survival enthusiasts.

Early Access Review
								Probably one of the few better early access survival games on steam at the moment.The bigest issue and complaint iv'e had with almost every indie survival game currently in development is how the enviroment is not a danger at all and instead the only danger is other trigger happy players ,which just turns all those survival games (Day Z,Rust , etc) into just very big PVP combat arenas and not much else, however the Long Dark does not have that problem.The Long Dark is a single player survival game, so no pesky human players are around to ruin your day instead the things you have to worry about alot and are in  constant danger from is the enviroment and the animals that live in this frosty land.The game has a very beautiful and unique art style which i can't get tired of looking at, it might not be the most techical impressive game but the devs used such a wonderfull colorfull but at the same time not too coloruf style with some subtle touches on each texture which almost make it feel like you're in a picture book or some sort of animated detailed cartoon but without pulling you out of the game's wonderfull snowy atmosphere, it's really,really nice.Same goes for the sound design, it's very well done, hearing wood creeking as you slowly walk around a dark house while a strong blizzard is blowing outside makes me wanna just wrap myself around a blanket as i play it.Now, onto the gameplay.You have to find worm clothing to make sure you don't freeze in the icy lands of Canada, you have to use a sewing kit to maintain your clothing so it doesn't become useless overtime,you have to gather wood,matches,fuel,old newspapers and use them to create camp fires where you can cook food,melt snow into water and purify water by boiling it so you don't get poisoned, you have to scavange huts and small houses for food,water,tools,clothing,weapons etc etc. but they don't respawn so you have to be carefull on what you eat and what you use since you can die from hunger and thirst very easilly if you don't plan ahead carefully.At the start you'll be eating anything you find but once you pick which house will be your base and you manage to gather and stock some food into it,It's smarter to start eating food you hunt and save up the canned goods for desperate moments, in the current build you can only hunt with a gun(which is hard to find) or catch some smaller wildlife with a basic trap, however even if you don't have a weapon or a trap you can still get some deer or rabit meat since the wolfs hunt too and often leave a few good slices of meat on the bodies for you too cut off and take back home to cook, oh and you can also fish which requires you to cut a hole into the ice in a specific location with your knife or axe.In the wild (as i mentioined them before)you have Wolfs patrolling which you have to stay away from as much as possible, if you get caught with just your fists against a single wolf(or more), you're pretty much a goner allready. Knifes and Axe's will help you alot in those situations and if you're lucky enuf to find a gun with ammo then it's the Wolf/s who should be afraid of you then.You have two fairly big maps to play on at the moment, in the future hopefully there will be more as developemnt progresses, they are also promising a Story mode with some fairly famous voice actors such as Jennifer hale but that's still not in the current build, at the moment all you have is sandbox where you just try to survive for as long as possible and maybe also try earning some achievements to give yourself an objective once you manage to stock up on alot of things.Bottom line :The game is still lacking content but the content it has at the moment is enuf to keep you busy for a good few hours of survival fun, it's in my opinion much better then most unfinished survival games we have at the moment and it seems to occasionally go on a nice sale, if you see The Long Dark 50% off then I'd say pick it up if you like survival but for 20 Euros,ahh I'd say wait a bit for more content but even if you get it for 20 Euros i don't think you'll really regreat it that much, specially if you love these survival games and this is one of the few that's atm in a solid fun state unlike other games.

Early Access Review
								This is an outstanding piece of work for a game not yet even released. The sandbox mode available at early access is a decent game in itself and I am eagerly anticipating the story mode release to add more depth to the experience. I picked this game up during one of the sales and I think it offers excellent value for money in its current state.In a genre otherwise swamped in zombies it is extremely refreshing to play a survival game where you are simply pitted against nature itself. This is certainly more than challenging enough and although the game is a sandbox, there are plenty of goals that will keep you interested. I spent a fair amount of time gaining the achievements and surviving the toughest settings and starter zones, something simply not possible till you've mastered the game in the earlier areas.The game adds real peril and fear with the introduction of the wildlife and it's genuinely scary to be trying to find shelter in the darkness and come across a growling pair of green eyes or when you see the bear stand and sniff the air for the first time.Positives:- This game is a unique experience in an otherwise very predictable genre.- It's extremly well designed and balanced feeling very challenging without being impossible.- It's actually very addictive as the game constantly presents a new threat to your survival.- It feels like you've genuinely accomplished something when you become ""sustainable"".Negatives:- Graphically, this game is let down a touch and almost certainly due to a lack of budget when it was needed. As a very good game it shines on its gameplay but it is a shame it doesn't have the looks to match.- The game is surprisingly unforgiving in some of its starter locations which might lead to a newer player being presented with a very tough start to the game. Persevere if this happens to you, although frustrating, it is part of the charm.- Some of the sound balancing is a bit messed up. Most terrifying thing in the game? Bears? Wolves? Nope, spraining your flipping ankle. The sound scares the living heck outta me every time.Would I recommend this game?I guess it depends if you like the idea of it, but if you do; this is arguably one of the finest survival titles ever made, and it isn't even finished yet. ""Highly"" recommended.			"

								Tired of Zombie survivals? Well this one is for you. In Alpha, but still pretty solid. Has a deep crafting system, has a lot of loot to find. and Really the only dangers are the weather and wolves.Think Dayz without the lame zombies, crappy engine... and worst of all... People Ruining your day cause they feel like it. Check out my video on it :)

								Awesome game. Very promising. I'd advise people to not buy it right now because the game is so good but its missing a few things that will make you wish it would be changed tomorrow and it's frustrating. Its like making the perfect cake but you have to eat it with your hands. Its delicious but yeah, its missing something for it to work well. For instance, there's wolves in the game but they are way agressive and there's too many of them. Very annoying. The inventory is terrible, terrible, terrible. I wish we could see our stats and our character next to it. A way to use third person too. And something else to do once you reach end game... yeah. But seriously this game is awesome, I just wish they had a bigger team to patch it faster.			"

Wolves are no longer death tanks and they've added more maps, harvestables, and things to craft since the last time I played. Loads of fun and the story isnt even out yet.			"

								For an alpha, this game is already amazing.Sick of zombies?  Me too bro.  That's one of my favorite things about The Long Dark; it's unique.  Your biggest enemies are the elements, wolves, and your own human needs.  Hunt for food, boil snow for water, find better clothing to stay warm.  It sounds simple, but it's surprisingly difficult to keep yourself in homeostasis.  True shelters are few and far between, and you will find yourself wandering through a blizzard because you ran out of food.Check out a short gameplay video from the latest update for an idea on how this plays.

								It's one of those titles that get's you connected, actually living your adventure as a city man/woman in an unknown frozen part of Canada, freestyle and with full consequences.I won't soon forget the grueling one hour I spent on a new map just entered when a blizzard hit and my frantic search for a cave or shelter of any kind (I died that time from hypothermia and 2 sprained ankles that made me crawl, made it almost through that night blizzard, after I burned every piece of wood I had with me to keep me worm and finally got so dizzy I couldn't move)...At 140+ hours I'm still learning stuff, finding new ways to do things. It may not suffice to play only TLD, but I find myself returning every few days to adventure solo in a frozen wilderness. There is a certain appeal to that.I highly recommend this game. It is being actively developed from forum feedback and it shows an unbelievable quality for an Alpha game. The price is a bit steep but well worth it. One can feel the love the programmers put in it, just as they say in the opening screen.			"

								This is the most realistic survival game I have ever played. It makes all these modern day folk that only care about graphics remember how good gameplay is. That's why I like Valve so much because they care ALL ABOUT gameplay and graphics do not matter to me. It looks spectacular for the Unity Engine and is EXTREMELY difficult. Not so difficult that you would quit the game and get a refund, but the kind of difficult where you MIGHT quit and come back later and then start anew and have another fun adventure in the frozen wilderness. I don't even have any changes except for one thing ; I got caught on a snow polygon and was walking on the mountain top and all of a sudden out of nowhere sprained my ankle. This happened three times and made me waste all of my painkillers. That's...About it for bad things. This game is simply stunning in realism.			"

								If I recommend this game? the answer is: YES YES AND YEEEEEEEEEEEEES.Each update this game gain more and more I fall in love with it, the developers work really hard to make this game the best and they already gave the idea of what the story mode will be with the teaser they showed (I feel so hyped for 2016 right now).So first things first as is said the game isn't about zombies or player versus player survival, this is the intimate thing, you can face others people and survive ? or zombies ? good but in the long dark this doesn't mean anything, here you have to face the nature, you can kill things ? welp sorry but you can't kill the cold, neither the thirsty or hungry, here you need to always keep yourself warm, with food and resources or: it's over.The game is really challenging and the better you get more you will want to explore and get better gear and of course if you do a mistake: game over. So if you are like me and love survival games who are always challenge you and is a true survivor, bought this game, is worth it!			"

								Great atmosphere with unique visuals.  Definitely challenging.  A world I'd love to spend more time in but the game doesn't seem to want to let me stay in it for that long without restarting.  Unfortunately, it feels like an eating and sleeping simulator right now as the hunger and hydration degradation speeds are insane.  Even if the degradation speeds were decreased, I just don't see how one would be able to play this game for extended periods of time since the resources are just gone when you use them and the map isn't that big.  While I'm on degradation speeds, doing even the most menial of survival tasks reduces your overall calories (your hunger level) by way too much.Still, for what it is, it does it well and is a refreshing change from being chased by zombies.Update (5/3/2016)Still an eating/drinking simulator, and in this case, it's not a good thing.  Realism is cool and all, but this game still overdoes the caloric management.  I get resource management is a key point to this game, but overall, the game just isn't interesting enough to make slogging through the resource management worth it.  Map is much bigger since I first reviewed the game, so that's a great addition.  Also, more renewable resources are available than when I first reviewed it.  You can keep fishing and hunting forever I guess, except that you won't b/c you're going to die long before you ever get ""settled in.""  I'd still recommend buying this game, as it's sort of the Dark Souls of the survival genre, but prepare for a frustrating experience...and perhaps that's the point of this game.			"

								Simply the best survival game at this moment.In theory there is very little to worry about. For survival you need  a few simple things:  Food, water and shelter. These are the key elements in this game. No complex crafting (though there is some crafting and repairing), no complex building. Just plain simple survival.  really?  It is harder then you think. This game does not give in to the easy generation. It has permadeath, and it's hard. Every bullit counts. You have to plan ahead to survive.  You can't forage wood in bitter cold. So you better have some in reserve.  Ah yeah, every match counts to :P . Sometimes it's even unfair how hard it is. Just like real life.Simplicity is the key In everything. You won't find super realistic graphics with grass looking even more realistic then real grass, like in chernarus (from arma/dayz) However, the graphics still look very appealing.  Especially at sunrise, and sunset. Just beautiful.Allthough this is yet another early access , it is a Must buy if you are into survival games.  I bought this game in  sale, but I would pay full price for this game.  It's worth it.One tip for starters:  Don't start on easy mode. Go for stalker, or at least medium mode. Also, don't  use any online maps to find all the locations. Find everything yourself.			"

								This is without doubt one of the best and most realistic survival games i have ever played and that is compared to games like dayz and other survival games. I think its very nice to get the focus off the zombies and focus on the survival itself. I love the graphics they dont have to be fancy like COD games and so on, there is just something special about those graphics just like in the walking dead games. The gameplay is alot of fun and challenging but not to much. The inventory system is great and it fits the game just right. In my opinion the early access almost looks like a fully developed game, cant wait for the full release. Really good game if you like survival in a tough enviroment. 9/10 just because its early access.			"

								I'm reviewing the early access version. We are still waiting for the story mode.This game is a survival masterpiece. Most survival games (or probbaby all of them) lack the reality. I mean let's say you are alone on an island. Is it reallistic to craft an axe, cut some trees and build a house in few hours (or few days)? It would take weeks for one human to do so and I'm in doubt that this would be possible at all (imagine you need to transport lumber - how?). Another thing - you are getting hungry what would you do? In most games you just hand kill an animal which by chance came near you. Too easy.You won't find such things here. The game is as reallistic as possible. You can't build. You have to relay on what was already built. You can craft only some basic stuff like fishing hook, bow and arrows, skin clothes, torches etc. Hunting is really dificult. Unless you find a rifle (you will still be very limited with ammo though) you will either have to craft a bow (using which is very difficult) or try to get some food by chance. Of course you need to gather wood to boil things etc.Your main evemy is cold. Until you craft some better clothes you can't stay outside for a long time so you need a lot of planning. You will have to explore with a lot of common sense too - never go out too far without a chance of getting back. You will have to account for changing weather. You have no map, no compass and when visibility drops you are lost in a moment.This game can give you a lot of fun for tenths of hours even though it's just a sandbox. Survival and exploration in the most realistic way. We are still waiting for the story mode. My guess is it won't be as deep as for example Fallout but still combining the most reallistic survival with a thrilling story can be perfect. I hope this game can be modded in the future so there could be more missions on different custom-made maps. If you are not sure whether to get this game or not, wait for the story mode. It might skyrocket the fun even more. In one sentence - the most reallistic survival game out there.			"

								I was introduced to this game by my cousin. I was reluctant to try it at first but when I finally got it and started playing I was immediately blown away by the imagery and design. That was and remains to be my favorite part of the whole game. The graphics and landscape design aren't incredibly realistic but I believe that is what makes this game stand out. To me it's like everywhere I turn I'm looking at a beautiful painting that someone made with their own hands and imagination. Besides the imagery, I am impressed with how challenging the game is. There's no cutting corners here. I must admit, I am a known rage quitter, but I have yet to quit this game. No matter how many times my throat is ripped out by a wolf, I just want to keep trying, because unlike many other games this one is not monotonous. It's not trying to redo the same level over and over again every time you fail. Every time you die you come back in a completely random location with completely random gear. The whole world is shuffled. I have nothing negative to say about this game, in all honesty. If you like survival games and you have an appreciation for the outdoors and snowy mountain peaks, you will love this game. "

Because there's something about it that is constantly tempting me to come back and play it again. Early access, yes. However, a genre that needed something different, got it. The art style is overall incredible. The gameplay is mostly smooth and besides the fact that it's not finished, the gameplay sets the stage for a promising, yet haunting, survival game.			"

The game tracks your hunger, thirst, body temp, medical ailments(sickness/injury) and calorie intake and usage.  Failing to manage all of these correctly will result in the death of you.Inventory.  This is your mini game to keep you occupied while trying to defrost your tootsies.  Clothes, food, water,  weapons and miscellaneous supplies all have a purpose and must be maintained to survive successfully. Animals.  They're out there and so are you.  These towns are only big enough for one sheriff so show them who's boss.  But be warned.  A failed skirmish with a hostile animal can result in fatal injuries.The environment.  This is the star of the show.  It will stop at nothing to kill you with its sudden storms, blistering winds or vast wilderness where one wrong turn could cost you more than just time.  I was in fog so thick I literally didn't know which way to go and I ended up getting lost.For a survival game this is top of its class.  Don't let the art style throw you off.  This is the most realistic survival game to date.  No game makes you feel the desperation of scavenging like this one.  Just hoping to find something to eat or drink.  The relief of finding shelter just before nightfall to keep from freezing to death.  The fear of running in to a small pack of wolves as they feast on a dead animal carcass.  Or the absolute dread when night has fallen and you have inefficient supplies to make a fire.How long can you survive?10/10 "

								Given that it is still in development and a lot of the assets is still on hold, It an experience playing a game like such. Although I expected more from it due to the fact of the overwhelmingly positive reviews it got and few of my friends hyping it. In the end I still enjoyed it but hope more things would be added in the near future.			"

								The crucial advice about this game is not to spoil yourself! This Game combines the Beauty of canadian winter with solitude. Creating a picturesque yet subliminal morbid atmosphere. Game is in a very developed state. Very little bugs in game or translation german and english text. At this point you can explore 5 different big maps. I had the most fun explorring the areas and still finding surprises after 100h of gameplay. Dont read too much about it. Buy it and have fun you wont be dissapointed.			"

Early Access Review
								This is an update of my previous review of The Long Dark.  I highly recommended it in my first review, and continue to do so now.I'm old enough that I was a kid when the first gaming consoles were first hitting the market (Atari, Intellivision, etc.), and I've been playing games since then.  When PC games were just getting started, I got sucked into those as well.  There have been a lot of really good games over the years.  Some of those early ones (think:  Zelda) are still famous today.  For me, The Long Dark falls into that category of ""historic"" games.  Not because it's old, but simply because it's just that good and just that enjoyable.  It is, however, a single player survival game.  So if you're looking to run around on a multi-player map shooting, stabbing, and lauching grenades and friends and enemies with equal ease, well, this certainly ain't that, as I've yet to even find a grenade, let alone a friend!But if you like survival games - just you versus whatever nature can throw at ya - well, here ya go!  There are no flesh eating zombies here, but the wolves and bears seem to be quite happy to play the bad guy. I've been playing The Long Dark off and on since it first came to Steam Early Access.  Since then the Dev's have slowly and consistently been tweaking gameplay, fixing bugs, and adding content/maps.  They have an overall development roadmap that they're behind the power curve on, but they are and have been consistently and continuously pushing forward.  Updates are pushed through often, and they're incredibly good about communicating with the players - and that communication is a two way street with them.  They listen to player feedback and also communicate what they're working on and what their expected timeframes are.As for the game itself, well, it is WELL worth the current $10 to check it out yourself.But if you just have to have an idea of what you're getting yourself into, here's some tidbits for you:- There are a variety of difficulty levels.  The easiest is quite easy.  The hardest - well, most players won't survive very long.- Death is permanent and ends the playthrough.- There are only a few games that I've ever played that I continually come back to time and again after taking a break from gaming.- There IS a relatively steep learning curve where survival is concerned, but not so much where game mechanics are concerned.  The weather is your biggest adversary in this game, as it limits your ability to harvest food and water. - I love the graphics.  They're not what I would consider HD, but the artwork is amazing.  Go outside on a clear night and look up.  It's really spectacularly beautiful!- There are currently 8 different connected maps/zones.  Each map/zone has the potential for dozens upon dozens of hours of interactive/exploration gameplay, all while trying to avoid becoming a meal for local predators.Of all of the games I've ever played, The Long Dark easily makes my list of top 10, and in reality it's probably in my top 2 or 3.  If you can afford it, plunk down the current $10 (it's 1/2 off right now) and find out for yourself if you like it.  The thousands of positve reviews certainly should tell you there is some survival gaming goodness inside!__________________________________________________________(Old Review)I have nothing but positive things to say about this game.  I've played it off and on since it arrived on Steam.The Dev's are incredibly active with the game and are regularly fixing bugs and/or adding content.  They commuicate regularly and are very accessible through both the Steam and Hinterland forums for help, questions, bug reports, etc.  They are also very receptive to gameplay feedback as they are always seeking to improve gameplay.As for the game itself, it's simply excellent.  It's challenging and VERY replayable.  Once a player gets the learning/playing curve down, survival is not horribly difficult... as long as you don't make any mistakes.  And mistakes can be costly, sometimes resulting in death.  Death is permanent and ends the play through, which simply adds to the challenge because developing character resources that allow more in game freedom (from the weather) takes a lot of time.  The player is on a constant hunt for survival resources, which includes food, water, clothing while being on the lookout for predators such as wolves (quite common) and bears (fairly rare).  Depending on the game difficulty level chosen, play through goes from relatively easy to incredibly difficult.  The game graphics are not high end/high definition, but are quite nice, and a starry night sky in this game is phenomenally beautiful.If survival challenge games are your thing, then I highly recommend this game.

								Well had 4 attempts at the sandbox mode and just about getting used to the maps, wish game had a compass or had the ability to find one, I seem to get lost a lot....lolBut loving this so far, so much potential and so much hidden mechanics which bring the game alive. Have to stop playing like a game at times and think what may happen in real life (to a degree).Only suvived 8 days, was going good until a wolf attack and then blizzard straight after, supplies to far away in safe house and slowly drained away. Was doing so well. Just need to get a rifle or bow as I havent managed that yet! So far probably my favourite survival game, it acts so simple but underneath are a lot of workings. And no zombies...Yay!9/10 Will keep up to date on devs work and looking forward to the campaign.Made it to day 23 yay!			"

								At this time of review Long Dark is still early access, so much will change.My initial experience however has been fantastic. There is a definite vision here and a really fun atmosphere to the game. I feel like I am working to survive in the cold and that's great.There is a bit of roughness to the user interface, and plenty of things that will need to be expanded to really provide a long term experience. More skills, and more renewables or endless territory so that resources are not simply based on map size.Dev team appears to be very quick to respond to ideas and patches have been steadily added more to be excited about. Worth supporting if you can. Story: n/a - not released as of yet, just survival engine testing.Visuals: 8 - very nice smooth graphics, looks great in the dark and stormSounds: 9 - Huge part of feeling the cold is that awful whistling windReplayability: 7 - Needs deeper elements for established survivalistsDev team: 10 - Great first impressionsCurrent buyit score: 7/10			"

 10/10      The Long Dark is really cool and really relistic game with nearly endless things to do. In survival mode you can either try to survive as long as you can, or just watch the gorgeous views. In the manifold challenge modes you can try to kill the nefarious bear before it kills yo, or collect massive amounts of food so that you can survive the storm that is coming, and as the reward you get buffs to the survival mode.     This game can also be extremely scary, I have gotten jumpscared by bears, wolves, and even rabbits. If you are on the last bits of your health, trying to walk to the closest nearby house, and you see a bear guarding the house who starts running after you, you feel your heartbeat around your entire body and you feel really scared.     The Long Dark is one of the best games I have ever played, and I certainly do recommend it to anyone who likes real-life-like survival games, or likes snow.     The only thing the game is missing is a co-op mode and player models, so that it looks like that you are walking in the game, not levitating, or that you are holding something, not that the item is floating on the bottom right of the screen.

Found out if I clicked the mouse button fast enough I could fight him off and even possibly mortally wound him and then harvest his corpse.Found a Bear, decided to test Bear fighting mechanics. There are no Bear fighting mechanics, the Bear will ♥♥♥♥ you up and leave you there bleeding clinging to life. 10/10 Best in it's Genre. Best deaths of any game.

								I never buy early acccess games and personally, I hate early access games.That being said, this game has sucked up most of my winter break already and I just can't step away from it. It's incredible. It's fun to learn what works and what doesn't work - realize what mistakes you made, etc. Take advantage of the journal in the game and write down as much as you can when you get enough time to do so. You're notes will help you see what went wrong if you end up dying.So far, my longest sandbox character made it 58 days. I made some dumb choices and got myself killed, even though I was pretty well setup. The game is serious business - it doesn't matter if you are 1 day in or 50 days in, you can always find yourself in a bind and end up dying if things go wrong.So as of right now, this is the only early access game I'm going to recommend you buy. The existing sandbox mode is enough of a game to justify the cost. (I don't even care if they release the campaign mode.)			"

Early Access Review
								This game will get you, it is not a matter of if, only a matter of when....Day 27.Close call. My starvation had gotten the better of me, I needed food soon or else I would pass out and possibly never wake up. I had taken residence in a lake side cottage some 15 days before, it had, at the time, been a god-send. Food, water, shelter, and plenty of chairs and shelves to break down for wood, I had made it. Now the food was all but gone, my cottage ran cold most nights, and without the ability to distill water (lack of feul; aka chairs) I had a verrrrrry serious risk of disease from drinking the water that, at this point, probably contained some kind of stool. I was nearing the breaking point, but I had just enough supplies to go reset my traps and possibly live throughout the night to try and catch something, it was all or nothing. I wake up on the 27th day, and the wind is howling, I look outside and it seems as though I am staring at a blank peice of paper. Great. Here I go to die. I decide that I would rather die frozen in the ground somewhere ( I could be one of those people in someone elses game perhaps) than starving to death in a shadowed cottage so, I take my chances. The long trek begins, I set off across the frozen lake to the spot I had designated for traps when I had first arrived in the area. I am bundled up with the best clothes that frozen people can buy (very comforting when you are trying not to freeze), and set off, resiliently into the morning (or night, honestly couldnt tell it was such a storm). I make my way slowly through the howling winds, unable to detect any landmarks on the edge of the lake, and am effectively, lost. Finally I spot a small island that I had seen days earlier in the middle of the large lake. Great, I am halfway there. I was numb before I left the cottage in the first place so, at this point, I would be lucky to be able to count my toes on one hand (depending if I had fingers either). Finally I limp through the cold to an outcropping off the lake bed, and I see three rabbits frolicking through what must be 2 feet of snow that has fallen within a few hours. Three small, little, tasty, little, small rabbits. In a fit of anger I run after them, I would just eat them raw if need be, im sure cold raw rabbit meat is super tasty anyways. I run out of breath in about two seconds and am forced into the realization that I still need to set my traps, and that this stranded experience has neither turned me into Usain Bolt, or an experienced, versatile hunter. I set three traps, one for each rabbit I was so longengly looking after, and set off back across the frozen tundra. This was a short lived task however, I hear a howl through the wind, but a different kind of howl. This was not wind, this was the hunting pack. I had seen them skulking around the lakes beaches a few days before, and now they had found their chance to take on little old feeble me. All I could think was, ""I walk through the shadow of the valley of death, and I am definitely F****** afraid of this evil"". I took off, well as fast as my ice blocks of legs could carry me. I had the general direction of a cottage I had seen a few days ago eariler, in relations to my trapping ground. Luckily for me this hunch was correct, I came upon a small abandoned house with the wolf pack in hot pursuit, and slammed the door in their face. Great! Then I realized that I had a grand total of an axe and a flair in my pack, as well as some currently useless medical supplies and about half a slatine cracker. You better believe that was the best damn cracker I have ever had. I had to wait, the wolves were at the door and there was no where to go. I contemplated my options: 1) Die inside 2) Die outside 3) Chop off arm, give to wolves, then die.Well I went with numbero dos on this one. I ran outside, straight into a wolf. He was one of the ones from the pack but had strayed a bit from them and was more or less on his own. He saw me as easy prey and charged. I fumbled around in my pack for the last flare I had found and chucked it at him right as he was bearing down upon me. Smacked him across the top of the head and scared him off, only he wasnt the only one. Guess who was back. His friends. Well now I am a nice refrigerated raw meat sack to them, and I just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off one of their buddies, so they were slightly aggravated. I took off across the lake (I could kind of see now, the blizzard had gone from blank page white to more of a constant blast of confetti to the face) and headed for the woods to try and lose them. They slowed but didnt stop giving chase and forced me to look for a quick fix to the situation. As I wheezed my way through the forest, being stalked by the two wolves that were still interested in this easy meal, I finally came upon train tracks of some kind. I saw a derailed train covered in feet of snow and decided to hunker down in that as night was falling. By the time I had pulled myself up and into the train car it was pitch black and I couldnt see my hand in front of my face. I rolled out my sleeping bag that I had luckily brought with me and tried to not freeze to death in the process of sleeping. I woke up at the crack of dawn, essentially dead in every way but spirit. My core body temperature was probably colder than the ice I had slept on. I was, as always, close to starvation and exceedingly dehydrated. I decide to look around this abandoned train car and see if I can somehow survive this disasterous situation.There it is. The one thing that could have saved me. I had on and off been looking for this singular item since the game began. It is the rifle (now for people who have never played this game, the moment you find a firearm is about on par with winning the super bowl 15 times in a row, 20 if it has ammo) and guess what, it has ammo. (I can see the super bowl rings now....) I feel a type of elation that is impossible to describe. I MAY JUST LIVE. Now comes the trying to live part. I make my way down the tracks as I remember my cottage being relatively close to a set of tracks, whethere these were those, I was completely unsure, but its all I had to go on. Then the second best feeling ever in this game, I saw a red flag flapping against the white nothingness of the crisp air and snow, the flag that adorned the top, of a small shadowed cabin I called home.10/10 You feel as though you are the character (minus the frostbite)(SEE COMMENTS FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW, AS WELL AS MY UNTIMELY DEMISE)			"

Early Access Review
								I hesitated a lot before buying this game. Being not much of a crafter guy I had misgivings. Furthermore, being in early access and all, I had some bad experiences before. Last, I feared that it would not be that much interesting or challenging. No real ennemies and all that. Boy, I was WRONG!I thought I knew about survival, I thought those zombie games had prepared me. Not in the least, they hadn't.First try, I found a gun, went all rambo after I missed a wolf and decided to track it down. I got lost, got surrounded by wolves and got killed. Ok I learnt to respect them. There were some ennemies after all. New game, I thought I knew what to expect but no, I still hadn't met the most fearsome foe of all: the cold.After I found a very comfy cabine beside a frozen lake I decided to go to one of the small fishing huts. It was 500 meters away, tops. So I decided to dump most of the clutter in my backpack (you know, silly useless things such as spare clothes,wood, soda cans, food in general). So here I go in the bright morning to do some fishing. I did fish, but when I looked up from my fishing hole an end of the world blizzard was bellowing outside. Complete whiteout, I started to get very cold. So I looked through my pack, found some wood and (I was lucky there was a heating apparatus in that hut) started warming up while cooking the fish. Two hours later, visibility still a big fat zero.So started the most adrenaline filled, terrifying moment I've had with a video game in a long time. I decided to hoof it back to the cabine through the wind and the snow.Five meters toward the shore. Ten. Can't see the hut behind me, cant see the shore either, I'm hoping I'm not getting lost. At last I see some trunks. I take a right to get back to the cabine. I""m getting colder, I start shaking then growing numb. Rocks, trees, snow, still no cabine.AT LAST over there I think I can see the roof... No. Just another boulder. At that point I was completely exhausted, badly dehydrated and almost frozen to death. It felt like I'd been going for hours. I kept telling myself ""nah, its just 500 meters, that's not much, you must be real close!"". And when I could barely walk anymore, my bag seemingly weighting a ton, then I saw it. THE CABINE only 10 PACES AHEAD! I made it. It was really useful to try and memorize how I could use the  shore as a rail to go back but still... I was shaking with relief as my character collapsed in a bed to get ten hours of shuteye.Last thing, I thought I'd never say that but it's the first game to make me go ""OMG YES, A FROZEN HALF ROTTEN DEAR! T'IS MY LUCKY DAY!"". For a game in early access it has a great feel to it. It already beats a lot of AAA titles, the replayability looks great from where I stand. Buy without hesitation, support the devs!10/10, will go die a silly death ten meters from shelter while getting eaten by wolves again			"

								Get this game right now if you like survival games, you will definitely get your money's worth at full price and it often goes on sale if you're cheap. I myself love survivals a lot and have had this game for a while. It can be a bit challenging, but half the fun with any survival game is that it challenges you.Pros:+ Really beautiful art style. Amazing looking for how simple it is.+ Being able to survive for a long time has a really rewarding feeling that is hard to get in many other survival games.+ Game is very stable despite being an EA title. I honestly don't recall running into a single bug and it doesn't require a top notch PC to run.+ 3 difficulty levels have been added, no longer are you forced into one difficulty.+ Lots to explore if you want to. Quite a large world, but you don't have to play all areas if you don't want to, though I'd say that's half the fun. More maps coming as well.+ Steam workshop allows for player made language packs.Cons:- Can be very easy to get lost if you're not 100% familiar with the map you're playing on.- Sometimes you get really crappy spawn luck and you either have to try to deal with it or start over. This is pretty much not an issue on easiest difficulty as resources are so common and wildlife doesn't attack.- No tutorial yet, so some things can be sort of confusing at first.- No customization at all, which is a con for me since I do love customizing things.- When you die, it's over, you have to begin anew.Neutrals:= Very little music, which could be good or bad depending on the person playing. I don't mind it so much, it helps to hear stuff around you.= Sometimes the sound effects are a bit irritating because of the repetitiveness, but overall they're not too bad.= I'm not a big fan of the inventory/conditions/crafting interfaces, but they're functional.= The environment can be very cruel, even on easiest difficulty. This can be a big con for people new to survivals and not good at managing themselves in-game. To me it's just part of the game, though, so at worst this is a neutral point for me.= Map setup doesn't change each play through, other than actual items you pick up (though some locations have exclusive or almost guaranteed spawns so they need to be checked for certain items). This can be both good and bad because it makes the maps predictable once you're used to them, which hurts replayability a little, but also allows replays to go smoother.= No story mode for the moment, but that is in development.= Development has been a bit slow lately, but it's not a huge team and there's a lot to do in the game in it's current state, so I would still argue it's still a worthwhile buy.---The pros greatly outweigh the cons in my opinion. It does get frustrating when you've made good progress and some random fluke of a thing kills you, but for some reason that doesn't make me stop playing it, when most games would frustrate me to the point of not being able to play again by doing that. Perhaps those with rage issues should pass this game up, though.I highly recommend that anyone new to the game uses the community made maps. None of them are 100% accurate and you may need to make note of the differences yourself, but they will give you a pretty good idea of where you're going at first and eventually you won't need them because the maps don't change each playthrough. I still find them useful though for planning where I'm going to go when I start a new game or for when I have to stop playing, I can cross off the locations I've visited so I don't forget.			"

I cannot ask more from the developers, but maybe as ideas or wishes from me.- When you have weapons, you can see them on your character.- Have different backpacks that you can find? or Craft!- I always love to see more new items come into the game, especially clothing or new weapons.

								Awesome Game, Something i have been waiting for a long time. The most interesting thing in it for me is how well they implemented fighting for survival. Other survival games(Early Acces especialy) focus more on building stuff and fighting mutants/zombies/whatever while this one is more realistic. It simply focuses on our basic needs like food/water/body temp. and really makes it challenging while in others its only an addition.Pros(+)- Finally good game on Unity Engine(both graphics and sound)- Surprisingly innovative- Low price compared to other survival games- Quite immersive (especially when u're lost in a blizzard)- Huge worldCons(-)- No jump button- You need too much food(my character's daily need is arround 4kg of meat or up to 8kg of fish)- Too many wolves ( Its just stupid as u go for around 10mins u will surely meet at least 2 wolves on your way, It would be better if they were in groups or at least a bit more clever)All in all as in every survival game you can find yourself sitting in one place and having stuff to survive for over 20 days. Then you starts wandering why should i keep playing as i'm quite safe here. Then you get bored and start exploring leaving a lot behind. - what i ment by this - for now you can't be rescued and there is no plot in game(as far as i know) so only thing you can really do is explore this dangerous but beautifull world. Yet still for me it's experience worth 20 euro!			"

								Buy this game. This is easily the best survival game I've played, one of the most earnest and worthy examples of what an Early Access game should be, and one of my all-time favorite games. And it's only going to get better. The developers are highly dedicated, major updates are coming steadily, and the community is growing.The game's designer once commented that this game offers a ""vulnerability fantasy"" as opposed to the ""power fantasy"" of most games. And that it does. It's beautiful, stylistic, comforting, terrifying, fulfilling, lonely, and you will die. And you'll love it.			"

So far I've died of hypothermia alone in the cold about 3 or 4 times.This is by far the best dying of hypothermia alone in the cold simulator that I have ever played. The game starts you at a different place on the map each time you play, and each game can be quite unique. It's fun finding out where you'll be and what you'll be doing next time you die of hypothermia alone in the cold.Currently, I've died of hypothermia alone in the cold while trying to start a fire, and I've died of hypothermia alone in the cold while scavenging from a deer carcas. I once got attacked by a wolf, recovered, then died of hypothermia alone in the cold.In my latest game I've managed to make a fishing line which I plan to take on a trip where I will die of hypothermia alone in the cold.There's an achievement for surviving for 50 days, but currently I'm not sure if that's a joke or not.

								This is a very promising game if you like certain types of gameplay. Let me clarify what type of gameplay this game has so you get the idea of whether you want to play it or not.---------------------------------At this CURRENT moment the game only offers the ability to play in sandbox mode. In this mode you spawn in a random area at a random time of day. The goal is to survive as long as you can and that's about it, however, it's not as easy as you'd always assume. The loot around the area is also random so you may be lucky or unlucky as to what you will find. I don't think you can be soo unlucky that you will die right from the start but you may not find something as valuable as a sewing kit.You have to deal with many issues in this game such as starvation, dehydration, fatigue, injuries, freezing, etc. There is food within the game as random loot as well as raw meat from animals which you can cook on a fire. Having something to drink can be random or you can melt snow to get water and you will need to boil water to purify it for safe drinking unless you have a water purifier. If you carry too much weight you will get fatigued very fast as well as running around everywhere and burning your calories which is another thing in the game. Depending on the quality of your items and what they are changes how well you can survive outside for extended periods of time and being by a fire isn't going to help you if it's windy and freezing outside so going indoors is always a good option.This alone wouldn't be much of a challenge but there are also wolves in the game and they are quite brutal. If one attacks you then you must build up strenth then attack it which can do 3 things: hurt the wolf a little, hurt the wolf enough to make it run away, or kill the wolf. If you are very tired and run into a wolf you are screwed because you cannot build much strength up at that time and you will be overpowered and killed.The weather can be mellow, windy, or there may be a blizzard which will freeze you VERY fast if you are outside.There will be more options and there will be a campaign but at the moment there is only sandbox survival which is still fun.---------------------------------The art style is nice in this game and is different. The sounds are great and this is an overall nice game. Should you buy it? Completely up to you but at the current state $20 is a bit much but there is more content coming and I've been seeing 1-2 updates a day since launch so things are actually getting done and I believe my money was well spent so far.

								Day 1: I awake to find myself in a frozen wasteland. Alone, cold and getting colder. What do I do? I need food, water, shelter. Trudging through the thick snow, I decide my best bet is to find some high ground and hope I can spot something that may be of use. As I reach the peak I see a small wooden structure next to a pond. Eagerly I rush down the side of the hill, hoping that I may find something of use. Inside is a can of beans, and not much else. Quickly I collect my prize and scavenge a small bundle of sticks that may be I can use for a fire if I can't find some place to hold up for the night. A little ways in the distance I see a flock of crows cawing, and circling over something. I decide to check it out. There in the snow bank, right under where the black birds hover is a man, dead. Covered in ice and snow. Most likely lost his way in a storm, looking for shelter or food, the same way I am. Is this my future? No, I won't end up like him. All I need to do is find some place to hold up and eventually, surely, help will come. I search his body, no time to pay respects. The sun is setting and I need to move. Maybe he has something that will help me avoid the same outcome as him. A smile spreads across my face. A pocket knife! Jackpot! I need to move now. I think I see something in the distance.Night 1:The house must have belonged to a trapper. Inside was a rifle, with a couple rounds, and some wire traps for small game. I've never hunted in my life, but necessity demands that I learn on the fly now. I tore the cabin apart, scavenging whatever I could use. I'm so cold though. Snow clinging to almost every inch of my clothing. It took a few tries, but I was able to get a fire started in the stove in the corner. Good thing I had those matches on me during the crash. There's only a few left though. I'll need to be careful how I use them. Right now these are the most precious tools to me. Each small stick is precious to seperate me from death. As I warm myself by the fire, I decide to melt some of the snow to give myself a small supply of drinking water. As the water boils I also use my newly found pocket knife to open the can of beans. Heating them on the fire I gulp it down as soon as they're done. Back home this would barely pass as a snack. Here it's a gourmet meal. It's time I get some sleep. In the morning I need to hunt. Other than a small package of jerky and a candy bar I found in the cabin, I'm not very well stocked. Hopefully my first hunting trip will pay off.Day 2:Maybe I should've watched somet hunting shows when I was back home. It occurs to me I know almost nothing on how to hunt and trap. I set up the wire trap in the woods, but unless a rabbit just happens to strangle itself in it I don't think I'm going to have much luck. I'll come back and check in awhile. In the meantime I'll try to track down one of those deer I saw yesterday.The trap is empty. Go figure. My stomach is growling. The candy bar did little to slate my hunger. What the hell am I going to do? I pick up the trap. Maybe I'll have better luck somewhere else? What's that? Out the corner of my eye I see movement. A buck! Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ No way! Maybe someone up there is looking out for me after all! I crouch trying to hide my presents as I bring the rifles sights up. I've only ever fired a BB gun before, but it's the same concept right? I line the sights up, centering them near the deers heart. I let out my breath slowly, as I go to pull the trigger...Night 2The irony isn't lost on me, even as I sit here, the Long Dark creeping in on me. My head hurts, I can hear my own heart beat pulsing in my ears. I killed the deer. One shot. It went down like I was an expert. I even was able to skin it, gut it, and harvest the meat, something I never thought I'd ever do. I had a feast all laid out in front of me. Yet in the end it wasn't lack of food or shelter that will do me in. Fire. God damned fire. Something that the earliest man knew how to use somehow eludes me. I couldn't get the fire started again. I had two matches and both times the fire only flickered and died. I have no way to start it. In a panic I ran outside to go look for something to start it with, but it's midnight and a storm hit. I can't see a foot in front of my face. I'm lost, I think I've been going in circles. I don't remember where the cabin is. I chuckle as I think of how bad I am at this. I couldn't even survive 2 nights on my own. No ones coming for me, there won't be a rescue party, and in the end I'm destined to die here in the snow. I close my eyes and wait for the end. I just hope that the darkness comes for me before the wolves do. PROS:-Fantastic survival simulator, even at this early stage of development. Already have put 4 hours in and will continue to put in more.-2 large maps-Each playthrough feels different-Challenging. 2 days is the longest I've survived so far-Great atmosphere, and feeling of lonliness and isolation-Wolves stalk you, and at night their eyes glow and makes you feel like you're in ""The Grey."" A+ for that.-No map. I count this as a pro because you have to rely on your own memory of where things are. When storms hit you can quickly become disoriented and lose your way which is thrilling.CONS:-The coastal highway map feels a bit too easy. I came across a town with several houses and have found a virtually endless supply of food, water, and great clothing. Not to mention it's next to several fishing spots. When your supplies are in abundance the game loses it's sense of adventure and danger, and thus loses a large amount of fun-Items are randomly placed every game, but structures are not. This means you can eventualy learn the map and find all houses quickly just from memory. Though it's random what you'll find, knowing where to look eliminates some of the challenge of surviving. -Only animals you'll currently see are deer, rabbits, and wolves. Here's hoping we see some new fauna additions in the future.-Not a lot to do when you're well fed, and stuck inside during a blizzard. A way to level up your abilities with out having to repair/craft something would be nice, like reading books, etc.			"

								If you're afraid of a challenge, this game isn't for you. It won't terrify you or provide you with a cheap thrill. Instead, it will continuously put you in disadvantageous scenarios that will test your survival prowess.It's unfortunate that other maps must be unlocked by exploring the default map given the seemingly enormous size of the default map but I suppose that would make the unveiling of new areas much more rewarding.I'd really like to see a multiplayer aspect going forward.10/10, absolutely recommend for non-zombie survival enthusiasts.

								I was introduced to this game by my cousin. I was reluctant to try it at first but when I finally got it and started playing I was immediately blown away by the imagery and design. That was and remains to be my favorite part of the whole game. The graphics and landscape design aren't incredibly realistic but I believe that is what makes this game stand out. To me it's like everywhere I turn I'm looking at a beautiful painting that someone made with their own hands and imagination. Besides the imagery, I am impressed with how challenging the game is. There's no cutting corners here. I must admit, I am a known rage quitter, but I have yet to quit this game. No matter how many times my throat is ripped out by a wolf, I just want to keep trying, because unlike many other games this one is not monotonous. It's not trying to redo the same level over and over again every time you fail. Every time you die you come back in a completely random location with completely random gear. The whole world is shuffled. I have nothing negative to say about this game, in all honesty. If you like survival games and you have an appreciation for the outdoors and snowy mountain peaks, you will love this game. "

								Early access review:After a few stumbling attempts ending in death by falling, hyperthemia, wolf attack, exhaustion coupled with food poisoning and more wolf attacks, I finally got the hang of things.With an ever-present sense of peril, I chose to leave the forrest with all its delicious untrappable rabbits, embarking on a journey in search for better pastures and -- dare we hope? -- a gun. After a few days of scavaging, I eventually found a tunnel through the mountains, leading to a large lake. Along its shores I found a small town and was finally able to make camp on a more permanent basis. There I spent my days fishing and forraging, each day trekking back to my pleasant little homestread. Life was good. On the seventh day I finally found a gun next to a corpse and... it all went down-hill from there.With a sense of delusional self-empowerment, possessing the means to ascend to the top of the food chain, I shot and missed a few wolves. On the 9th day, on my day home from an unusually unproductive expedition, I came upon a bear that had annoyingly blocked my path during the morning. Taking aim, I shot (and probably missed yet again) believing that I could get to a nearby house if I couldn't get it to bleed to death. And oh boy, bears can apparently sprint pretty well, for it quickly pushed me to the ground and mauled me repeatedly, leaving me for dead. Within an inch of my life, I crawled my way back to the house. The next morning, a wolf waited outside my door, making easy pray of my already wounded form. And so yet another story ended.----------Perhaps a little repetative with the same map every time, but as long as you're actually exploring its a very enjoyable experience.			"

								Very good survival game, however there are a few things that get a bit annoying. The food and water system makes the game a bit of a chore. If you take a 2 hour nap you're dying of thirst and almost starving. A few kilos of meat won't even satisfy your character for a day.  The fatigue state is  also a major annoyance and seems only to be there to slow you down. Overall this game is amazing and a very fun survival game, a bit limited right now, but it is easily worth $9.99 (on sale).			"

								This is by far one of the best wilderness survival games I've ever come across. Having actually spent a good deal of time in the wilderness, I can say it's super damn accurate. Fire is difficult to make. Food is hard to come by.Hunting requires real skill. And Nature wishes your demise. After a few hours of playing this game, the environment and immersion is so damn good that I am usually confused if it's not snowing outside. I actually have way more time on it then it says I do, because I played it a ton on a friend's account before I could afford it. If you like realistic survival with an amazing atmosphere, buy this game.At one point I was trapped in a fishing hut at night, with a wolf just outside... Just hoping that it somehow got scared away by my slowly dying flare. It had me on a gloriously terrifying edge.			"

								Don't go into it expecting a 100% realistic survival experience.... there are some sacrifices of realism for the sake of more compelling gameplay.However, it's a good game.... as does a much better job at realism then most video games. If you're at all interested in the premise, I'd recommend it. It's great fun.			"

								Ultimate survival experience. You're alone, hungry, thirsty, tired with no shelter and freezing to death among wildlife that also wants to snack on you. Scavenge for resources, manage your supplies and try to stay alive for as long as possible. If you die, game ends. Very challenging but immersive simulation. You truly will feel alone and hunted going through this.			"

								This game is really promising. The things I enjoy the most are the atmosphere, the landscape and the graphics. Everything looks amazing and feels alive. It is one of the most immersive games I have ever played. That is in my opinion the key to making a good survival game. I also really like how the develepors have been able to make the game challenging and make you feel like there is always something you need to do so that you don't die, without using something abnormal like zombies or anything unrealistic really. Weapons are well balanced and feel right to use. Hitting targets is not always too easy, which makes the hits you land feel like an achievement of their own. Wildlife feels alive and look good and there is just the right amount of it. The amount of stuff there is to explore is amazing. So many caves, hills, houses and forest for you to explore. The survival mechanics work very well, with many things to danger your health, but not too many to make it confusing. And the challenge modes add a nice amount of extra content for you to enjoy.There are just a couple of things that I don't like about the game. Sometimes most of the time goes on walking from house to house, without really seeing anything in the between. Upgrading your gear can be difficult, because you might need some drops from certain animals that they don't always drop. I also think that the wolves could use more ways to behave. They just always simply walk or run towards you and attack if you don't do something about it.Overall I really like the game. I bought it two years ago and it has taken so many significant steps from back then that it makes me very impressed about the whole package. I amreally looking forward to the story mode and I hope it gets out as soon as possible.A very immersive and realistic survival experience with beautiful graphics and a lot to explore			"

								Great Game, Very challenging.A lot of the early game survival is luck, but once you find shelter and learn where things are, you can plan your outings into the wild better. Use your time constructively, by looting, hunting, and gathering the supplies like timber, and horde it at your favourite shelter. This is very important for when there is bad weather.Make a mistake, or take too big of a risk and expect to the severely punished!!Planning is the key. Fun challenging game. Highly recommended. "

Early Access Review
								Before i start my review id like to say that i bought this game blindly. I had very little knowledge about this game when i bought it. I had some money to spend and i like open word survival games. (probably the extent of my knowledge) Now ill describe my experience in this game. I would also like to appologize for spelling, grammar and punctuation mistakes. (I don’t English good) -This review may not be suitable for all audiences.Attempt 1: spawn in a wooded area. I feel familiar with my surroundings (Im canadian). Lots of snow, big trees and vacant, not a creature in sight. The strong cool breeze blowing through my clothes onto my testicals, causing them to suck back up into my stomach. I dont mind honestly its kind of refreshing. I pick a direction and walk, i walk for about a minute. When out of no where i get attaked from behind by an angry Horse with a growing disorder and sharp teeth! I try to fight him off by pleasuring his♥♥♥♥♥♥with my foot. He just continues to try and eat my face like he is a fat chick at McDonalds. I then try to casually finger his bellybutton while still fisting his booty with my foot. It was no use. I died. I then thought to myself ""Do baby donkeys have belly buttons?"" I do not know what i was fingering. I guess ill never know.After completely failing within the first 5 minutes i stopped playing and proceeded to cry. I had lost all hope in life. Maybe my mother was right and i should just kill myself. I thought about it and realized that me and that short necked baby giraffe are the same. we are both hideously deformed creatures living on this planet trying to survive. Feeling much better i decide to have a short intense masturbation session to barnyard pornography and go back for attempt # 2.Attempt 2: Back again, in the Canadian wilderness. I see a rabbit, and i do what any sane person would do and chase it. The rabbit runs down a steep hill so without thinking, i continue chasing it. I run down the hill and i break my ankle and have an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ simultaneously. The rabbit got away as i continued to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ i hear a growl, so turn around and a F#cking anorexic black bear jumps on top of me! I am now in the missionary position with a hairy Ferocious sea otter. I didn’t even have time to complete my previous ♥♥♥♥♥♥ yet. So i definitely was not ready for round 2. Thanks to Scooby Doo and his hairy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of mystery i died. Over-dosed on ♥♥♥♥♥♥sAfter attempt 2 i sort of gave up on the game for a while. I tried again eventually and figured out how to play. I thought i would just share my starting experience of the game. It becomes more fun when you figure it out. So i do recommend this game even in early access.			"

Early Access Review
Price (regular):  $19.99 (EARLY ACCESS)Price (lowest): $14.99 (25% off)My overall rating: 9.5/10Easily one of my favorite games of all time. Great play value, but could be better.Value: 9/10This game can be constantly replayed and has endless fun, the developers work hard on this game and post updates often, adding more value to the game. There is a great amount of good gameplay involved that is SLIGHTLY (0.000005%) impeded by constant wolves, but once you get a knife, oh, then its their time to worry.Singleplayer: 10/10Amazing singleplayer. Singleplayer is so far the only mode available, but still one of the best out there in the survival standpoint. All games seem to go for zombies and nuclear fallouts, while this game takes realism to a new level, its just you and the evilness of mother nature.Co-op: - No Co-op yet, I really hope that the developers will eventually bring co-op to the table, as there would be even more fun. Its always more fun if you have great friends trying to survive also. Now, lemme get more in depth to why it has probably not been released: Resources. For two players you will either require double the resources, or have them left for dead to survive for mere days. There would have to be a lot more loot on the map or the friends would have to split up, one on Costal Highway, and one on Mystery lake, which would not be as fun.Multiplayer: -Same with Co-op, there would be great balancing issues, but If the devs could overcome that it would be so awesome to have multiplayer.Content: 9.5/10Hunting, Scavenging, Foraging, Creating Fires, Taking Antibiotics for wolf attacks, this game has already such an indepth system of scavenging and everything. (It even includes infections :D)Length: 10/10Extremely long playthroughs are possible with proper management of health, condition, food, water, and a hefty supply of resources. You can probably sleep to day 50 on just one map alone before resources get extremely low.Story: 8/10Not much is known about the charachters. I know, they are making story mode. I cannot wait until it comes out, especially since they say it will be in episodes and seasons. If they make me pay for them as DLCs...Gameplay: 10/10Very good, open gameplay. Basically an open world that allows for lots of fun.With freinds: -No co-op and multiplayer yet. I hope for them very soon.Graphics: 8/10Strange and Mixed about the Graphics. Its like they tried to go BL style on some things as it looks like they tried to convert a cartoon to real life (Much like the SFM MLP models and such) It doesn't look as good as it could, but its ok. Graphics will hopefully get a huge overhaul to get more realism, or they will focus on a cartoon-like atmosphere. (I do not know which they will go for)Physics: 9/10Physics are ok, every once in a while I have a deer glitch through the rock (No joke I can upload a video of it right now, just add me and tell me to) and other problems. Lemme delve into realism here, because that is what the game is trying to do, you can run up hills, albeit slowly, not as realistic as you would severely hurt your ankles almost instantly, but in this game they survive. (Those are just nitpicking details)Performance: 10/10Here is the problem for me: I run on a 8 month old gaming computer that is still better than most out there that are up to date. I cannot accurately tell you how much memory usage or stuff it uses as I do not check. This is what I can tell you: It runs flawlessly, transitions into houses (new levels/maps) are flawless and only take but a second or two, I have not tried crossing into coastal highway nor have I played coastal highway.Sound: 8/10Sound is good but maybe a little rough here and there.Polished: 8/10Nothing majorly wrong with it but I still have not found the bunker, which is kinda annoying. (Overall great game, just a few flaws. I have heard of wolves invisible, but that is probably a graphics card problem not game problem)Atmosphere: 8.5/10The vast landscape gives you a good immersive feel but could be better if they didn't have so much of the same trees making it all feel the same.Objectives: 9/10Objectives are pretty basic. Pretty much survive. The sub-objectives of that objective are vast and indephth, so the game is really good because of the mechanics and playstyle.Clarity: 9/10No problems with knowing where to go or what to do. (The story line will probably linear and very easy to follow when it comes out. I cant wait!)World: 9.5/10Unparalleled world. Massive world (Split in two so far) with mountains, caves, vast foliage, and tons of wildlife to try and kill you. Although most of the landscape has the same trees and plants so a lot of it looks the same. (More diverse?)Characters: 8/10Not much is known about the characters. Once the story mode is released my rating will probably go up, unless the details we learn are useless and add no effect to the story or charachters.UI: 10/10Great UI, I think It could have a pause feature while in the TAB menu, but that is just me.Controls: 10/10Great controls, can change key bindings to personal preference. (All buttons/actions are customizable)Freedom: 10/10As much freedom as you could ask for. You can do whatever you want, such as going for a nature hike.Influence: 10/10The Gameplay is very dynamic and not linear at all. Your only objective is to survive and you can do that many ways. Scavenging DayZ style, or hunting Forest Gum style (yes I misspelled his name, and yes that was a horrible analogy as it was just meant to be a joke) Could have more maps or loot to make surviving longer possible.Settings: 9/10Settings are great, many different Graphic options (have not tried any but maximum) and key binding changing is easy. Audio and everything else in the menue is also great.Character progression: 6/10No character progression, other than trying to survive.Weapon selection: 8/10Has limited weapons. Shotguns and (better) sniper rifles should all be added eventually. So far only 3 weapons or so.Customization: 7/10No weapon or item customization, only repair or harvest.AI: 8.5/10For the most part the ai is fairly intelligent. Every once in a while are there weird glitches in the ai. Wolves have howl animation which in my eyes is pretty cool.Up to date: 9/10Constantly evolving as it is in Early Access, which is why I am being careful of what I state in this review. Everything might eventually change.Replayability: 10/10Entire game as stated above can be played up until forever if you get enough resources. The fun of surviving drives me to constantly replaythis.Pace: 10/10You can do everything at your own pace. No one rushes you. (Except for your Hunger, Thirst, Condition, Wolve Population and about 70 other things trying to kill you.)Repetitiveness: 9/10I guess some people can find it repetitive to constantly day after day survive in this game, but thats basically how life works, there are rarely any fun moments and mostly just work.Realism: 10/10Realism is very high in this game. Must I say more?DLC: -No DLCs so far, MIGHT be some for the story, but I will be very sad if they make you pay for it. It it is like a free dlc then I will be happy even though its a DLC.Achievements: 10/10Track how long you have survived with achievements. Its really exhilarating and a great feeling of accomplishment. Tip: for extra realism and feeling of accomplishment reset your achievement stats for The Long Dark.			"

								Get this game right now if you like survival games, you will definitely get your money's worth at full price and it often goes on sale if you're cheap. I myself love survivals a lot and have had this game for a while. It can be a bit challenging, but half the fun with any survival game is that it challenges you.Pros:+ Really beautiful art style. Amazing looking for how simple it is.+ Being able to survive for a long time has a really rewarding feeling that is hard to get in many other survival games.+ Game is very stable despite being an EA title. I honestly don't recall running into a single bug and it doesn't require a top notch PC to run.+ 3 difficulty levels have been added, no longer are you forced into one difficulty.+ Lots to explore if you want to. Quite a large world, but you don't have to play all areas if you don't want to, though I'd say that's half the fun. More maps coming as well.+ Steam workshop allows for player made language packs.Cons:- Can be very easy to get lost if you're not 100% familiar with the map you're playing on.- Sometimes you get really crappy spawn luck and you either have to try to deal with it or start over. This is pretty much not an issue on easiest difficulty as resources are so common and wildlife doesn't attack.- No tutorial yet, so some things can be sort of confusing at first.- No customization at all, which is a con for me since I do love customizing things.- When you die, it's over, you have to begin anew.Neutrals:= Very little music, which could be good or bad depending on the person playing. I don't mind it so much, it helps to hear stuff around you.= Sometimes the sound effects are a bit irritating because of the repetitiveness, but overall they're not too bad.= I'm not a big fan of the inventory/conditions/crafting interfaces, but they're functional.= The environment can be very cruel, even on easiest difficulty. This can be a big con for people new to survivals and not good at managing themselves in-game. To me it's just part of the game, though, so at worst this is a neutral point for me.= Map setup doesn't change each play through, other than actual items you pick up (though some locations have exclusive or almost guaranteed spawns so they need to be checked for certain items). This can be both good and bad because it makes the maps predictable once you're used to them, which hurts replayability a little, but also allows replays to go smoother.= No story mode for the moment, but that is in development.= Development has been a bit slow lately, but it's not a huge team and there's a lot to do in the game in it's current state, so I would still argue it's still a worthwhile buy.---The pros greatly outweigh the cons in my opinion. It does get frustrating when you've made good progress and some random fluke of a thing kills you, but for some reason that doesn't make me stop playing it, when most games would frustrate me to the point of not being able to play again by doing that. Perhaps those with rage issues should pass this game up, though.I highly recommend that anyone new to the game uses the community made maps. None of them are 100% accurate and you may need to make note of the differences yourself, but they will give you a pretty good idea of where you're going at first and eventually you won't need them because the maps don't change each playthrough. I still find them useful though for planning where I'm going to go when I start a new game or for when I have to stop playing, I can cross off the locations I've visited so I don't forget.			"

								A great game for anyone who likes the feeling of saddness and lonelyness, with nothing but the chill on your spine and the fear in your mind. Never knowing what may be your downfall; an animal attack, starvation, the endless cold... Very well designed and the game play is great. Perhaps the best thing about this game is the several regions that you can explore, crafting and hunting ability, and the need to have shelter. I have played over 60 hours of this marvelous game, and I consider it the best game I have ever owned on Steam. Have fun! :D			"

And it's only going to get better. The developers are highly dedicated, major updates are coming steadily, and the community is growing.The game's designer once commented that this game offers a ""vulnerability fantasy"" as opposed to the ""power fantasy"" of most games. And that it does. It's beautiful, stylistic, comforting, terrifying, fulfilling, lonely, and you will die. And you'll love it.			"

								On day 9. Started in forest part of map. Started in the middle of a blizzard in the middle of a frozen lake with like 5 meter visibility(thanks game). Took 9 days to find a rifle and a lot of running and fighting wolves. Now have several houses with assorted equipment, need to consolidate. Just need to be careful from here on as you can make a split second mistake and be dead. You learn fast that wolves are really trying to kill you. When you leave a house make sure its not sitting behind the house waiting to jump you......seriously. Be prepared to die or sprain your ankle a few times early on.10/10 so far. Not really anything I can say I dont like about it.-Great atmosphere due to sound and graphic style. The sky really is the most beautiful part.-Since your alone its a great game to play if you just dont feel like jumping into a fast paced multiplayer game or need a break from humanity.-Keep increasing regions or map sizes.-Obviously can still use improvement. More diversity in items, crafting, and animals(bears, squirrels, chipmunks, birds, hell get some beavers, ITS CANADA. More plant life would be huge as well. More sounds, especially bird sounds.-Your totally alone so the best way to be immersed is through sound and artwork.-I haven't really checked but I dont think animals leave tracks?-Love the concept just need replayability and things to do once you are master of your domain.-Why can't you jump or climb ladders?

								A great game for anyone who likes the feeling of saddness and lonelyness, with nothing but the chill on your spine and the fear in your mind. Never knowing what may be your downfall; an animal attack, starvation, the endless cold... Very well designed and the game play is great. Perhaps the best thing about this game is the several regions that you can explore, crafting and hunting ability, and the need to have shelter. I have played over 60 hours of this marvelous game, and I consider it the best game I have ever owned on Steam. Have fun! :D			"

								Well had 4 attempts at the sandbox mode and just about getting used to the maps, wish game had a compass or had the ability to find one, I seem to get lost a lot....lolBut loving this so far, so much potential and so much hidden mechanics which bring the game alive. Have to stop playing like a game at times and think what may happen in real life (to a degree).Only suvived 8 days, was going good until a wolf attack and then blizzard straight after, supplies to far away in safe house and slowly drained away. Was doing so well. Just need to get a rifle or bow as I havent managed that yet! So far probably my favourite survival game, it acts so simple but underneath are a lot of workings. And no zombies...Yay!9/10 Will keep up to date on devs work and looking forward to the campaign.Made it to day 23 yay!			"

								This game is unique compared to its genre. Enough said, Fantastic! Most real you can get, now with that said, I'm annoyed to see people going around trying to beat that generalization up saying the game isn't realistic. It's the most you can get towards it. Yes you have stuff that falls apart fast, yes you get hungry fast. Heck, you are in freezing wheather, in all reality that does mean you are burning calories a LOTTT faster. Maybe the game isn't perfect but it's fun and enjoy it for that purpose, it's a hardcore game and I'd rather have tons of food I have to eat more of than finding no food at all when I need to survive. I'd rather have a can opener that breaks than twnety of them and no worries the rest of my game. (With that, I'd l ike to say stuff doesn't even fall apart that fast anymore, on top of that you can REPAIR things. Which everyone freaks out saying clothes don't fall off you and knives don't break. Um, I never once had clothes fall off or a knife break in game, because I notice it is breaking and fix it. You fight off a dozen wolf attacks and expect your knife to be okay, alright?)For those who don't enjoy survival or don't like exploration or don't like a challenge, that just means you're a book reader going to a magazine store. You're in the wrong genre buying a game you don't like! If you do enjoy all those aspects that this game supplies, then awesome cause I do to and this game just blows me away. It's replay value is higher then you think. If you start and read all about the places and how to play, then yes you probably won't have as much fun, if you just start and learn about it and explore without cheating online you're going to have a blast. I have yet to find every single location and I barely even played on the second map still. They have randomizing locations for loot and a special location that makes it that much more exciting to explore after each playthrough.Wolves is a big one. I love them, another challenge to overcome when trying to survive. If you want to say what the hell wolves don't attack people, then move on. Because a hungry wolf in the middle of a post DISASTER scenario who needs ot eat will attack someone. Which brings me to another part, the mechanics of the wolves are awesome. Because at times they WILL NOT attack you. Instead they see you and run away. Very rare but it does happen. They come at you, you can still scare them away, stand your ground don't rush them, light a flare and they are gone. If you don't ask me that sounds realistic. If you just want to be that character that lights a flare and chases down the wolf and it attacks you, then complain about it saying it's not realistic. Then you sir, are a moron. Any person who understands the makeup of animal instincts will understand that a threatned, cornered animal will fight back. The wolves in this game almost act the exact same way. Their mechanics are perfect tune with this game. I love it.Which brings me to one point, Post DISTASTER! Everyone misses the very first part of the game. Clearly a disaster has struck, and storm where your plane crashes. THIS is why dead bodies are everywhere. This is why it is cold. Not just because you are in Northern Canada. It is a disaster which explains all the destruction and death that you see. So don't go bagging the idea of its location in canada or the cold being unrealistic. The cold... Is amazing. I just one review about not being able to put on layers? Um you can... its called wool sweats under pants. Sweaters under heavy coat jackets. When you find enought of the right clothes you are able to layer them if game allows it. Yes you can't wear the biggest heavy ski vest over another heavy ski vest. It's to prevent the obvious ""I'm going to run around with 50 sweaters on and be perfectly okay with absolute no challenge."" The mechanics of the game are set, to limit your ability from nerfing the settings, so that you will always have a challenge in the game. Because whether you want it or not, challenge is what keeps a game afloat and enjoyable mulitple times through.Basically said, if you want to enjoy the game for what it supplies, then awesome because it gives an experience you can't really find in most survival games. To me and to it's genre, a hardcore survival game with actual challenge other then threat of CONSTANT PVP shooting and absolutely no other obstacle like you see in all these games around us with literally no genuity or originality. This game sidesteps that completely and instead of becoming an online killing game it has become a single player REAL survival compared to that genre's name now. Basically if you want to be that player that says oh a ""realistic"" game okay... Then play and go ""Omfg wolves attack me, oh what is this I get hungry fast, oh my gosh I'm staring at a screen playing a game this isn't real life this is so not a realistic game"" Then you really should rethink your gamer life and learn to understand the fun individual originality that many games, not just this one, give to you.

								Even in alpha, this is a masterpiece. I never really review games, so that should tell you how much this one excites me. Others have described the details extensively, so let me just say that if you think you might like it then you will be in love.Worst game, I died in less than 2 hours after I fell off a small cliff during a blizzard and then froze to death before I could limp to shelter.Best game, I survived almost 27 days. I stayed in place for weeks, living on canned foods and toilet water. Survived more than 3 weeks before ever finding a rifle. Killed my first wolf with my knife when he attacked me two consecutive times. Survived at least a half dozen wolf attacks during this game, spent three nights outside under the stars or in a car. Made some awesome boots out of scavenged deer hide. Walked maybe 20 miles. Finally died, weakened and hunted to death by wolves while I was lining up my kill shot on a buck. 10/10 Would stare into the cold and lonely darkness again			"

								The Long Dark is one of the best early access games that I've ever played. The game certainly needs some polish (certain textures flickering), but even with some minor issues the gameplay remains solid. The survival mechanics are thought out very well, and the unique setting requires you to rethink strategies that you may have used in other survival games. The areas may not be randomly generated but the sheer amount of places to explore is insane (about 13 hours in at the time of writing this and I've only been in 1 zone and have only seen roughly 15% of all the locations in the game).Also,I highly recommend that you try turning off V-Sync if you get bad performance as it seemed to keep my fps at 35 (60+ frames with it off).

								I've been following this game from quite a bit earlier in its development, and it was still fun and totally replayable at that time. With the most recent big update, coupled with what I see on the roadmap[hinterlandgames.com], I've never been more excited for the development of a game. The sandbox is so right up my alley and could possibly turn into the most satisfying survival/exploration game I've ever played if Hinterland keeps getting support to build the world they want to realize. The music score kicked in as the snow drifted down gently and I realized how much I love The Long Dark.			"

								TL,DR: If you like survival games, you must play The Long Dark. If you like tough, atmospheric games, play The Long Dark.I've only played The Long Dark sandbox. The story line is in the works and promises to be good. The sandbox is a pure Player vs Environment, and the Environment is a beautiful and cold beast.Since the sandbox has a fixed map, I suggest starting out without reading any materials or wikis (wikies?). Go in blind and learn the area and mechanics. It is intuitive enough to jump in and try to survive. You will die and have to restart. Take what you learned and live again. Even though the map is fixed and you will learn it after a while, the looting and enemies are random. The mechanics are tough enough to give veterans a fun challenge. The cold will punish the foolish, and the cold is always there. After a while you will get better gear and go from surviving to thriving, but death is always close. I feel comfortable with the map and mechanics and I still clench up when heading out to find more gear. Death isn't random. It will come because you weren't prepared or pushed too hard. The cold is always there.Some of the best moments for me were being close to starving or freezing and pushing out to find more gear. You get to a point where you must go forward or die. I've died in many snowbanks or watched myself eaten by wolves, but that great feeling when you find a cabin or abandoned car that helps you live, even for a few more moments, is as real as a game can create. That relief is temporary, however, because the cold is always there.As you can see from the screenshots, the graphics are wonderful. The art direction makes for a beatiful game, but don't let the beauty fool you. The world can be punishing, and the cold is a more brutal enemy than you've faced in a long time. Did I mention the cold is always there?The Devs are responsive and give big updates regularly. They have a goal for this game and are moving there nicely. Jump in on the early access and enjoy the cold with them!I've enjoyed my EA time on The Long Dark, and I know I will be revisiting it many times. I hope you enjoy the cold as much as I do.			"

								This game is great, challenging, and fun. Well thought out. Would like the option of being able to save the game whenever i would like to instead of just when sleeping or entering a building.Most of the updates have been good HOWEVER there was recently a new update that included a stamina meter that only allowed you to run for a short time. This is unrealistically short and doesn't last long enough for you to run anywhere! Also the fatigue meter fills up way too fast. I wasnt even carrying a full load, i had only about 18 kg worth of stuff and i went from tired to exhausted (on mystery lake which is a flat surface) in literally less than 30 seconds. Terrible! I liked the rate of how fast you got fatigued before the update and think that it fit nicely. Some adjustment i think might be necessary.			"

								Day 29.I had survived off nothing but dog food and a couple of granola bars for days, survived several bouts of hand to hand (Paw?) combat with wolves, survived dysentery, survived food poisoning from eating meat off a ravaged deer corpse, Fluffy the friendly wolf hugged me too tightly in the dam, I was mauled by a bear, I fell off a ledge and damaged my ankles, went back with a rifle and murdered the aforementioned bear out of spite, taking its pelt as a trophy and placing it next to my sleeping bag every night.Then I got caught in the mother of all blizzards in an unfamiliar area and had to take shelter in a car, as the total whiteout made me lose all sense of direction and the windchill was at factor turbodoom. After all the trauma, bada**ery and lonely nights spent next to my campfire and the skin of Bozo the Bear, it was nature itself that did me in. I slowly froze to death in the passenger seat of a purple lada whilst sobbing quietly and eating chocolate bars with the last of my strength.10/10, would (And will) shamefully freeze to death again.

								I was walking through a blizzard for an entire day and could hardly see a few feet in front of me, stumbling up hills and across frozen creeks. I finally found some train tracks and followed it until I found a derailed train and a collapsed tunnel, took shelter just inside the tunnel. Realized that I had no wood and it was almost dark, I scrambled to gather some wood nearby and literally minutes from freezing to death I built a big fire, enough wood to last most of the night. I rolled out my bedroll and slept til the fire was out. After I woke up, I finished off my food and drink most of my water and with only the moon as my light I wandered off in a random direction. Wandering past trees, rocks, for what seemed like a few hours I am already freezing again I see an opening and there on top of a cliff sits a hut, the trappers hut. With releif I ran there got inside and started a fire, stoked it to last a few hours, gathered some food and boiled water. After several hours of patching up, eating, drinking, I crash due to my condition being so bad. Woke mid day and scavenged the rest of the hut and now I'm up to day four and after hunting I've got food and water for a while. Now just have to worry about the condition of my clothes!So far this is my expereince with the first playthrough on the sandbox mode and I'm in total love!			"

You can freeze to death, dehydrate, starve to death, break your bones falling or get eaten by wolves. As  an early access game it lacks a bit of content, but idea is brilliant in its simplicity.

								The game is NOW definitely playable in Alpha mode. They've added some more content and depth to the game, and the biggest factor of all, they finally increased the character's endurance when running (although there is still a lot of running/walking/traveling in this game).Day 23I'm on my way back to the dam's control room to collect a bunch of items i dropped since i couldn't carry them all back in one trip. After filling up my inventory, I begin to head back when i notice that this door is actually usable... I use this new door that leads to the back of the dam. Once out, I begin to look around to get a feel of the new environment. To the far left i see that there's another platform that may hold some promising items. To get across I'd have to hug the dam and tip toe across the protruding ledge. A few steps onto the ledge and I fall off the ledge onto the dam itself (the dam isn't completely vertical but at an angle)! I take only 15% damage, sprained my wrist (of course never my ankle when falling for some reason), and my clothes are a little ripped, no serious harm done. I'm off the ledge but still on the dam, so I take off all my clothes to prevent any damage to them. I take little jumps down the dam, slowly but surely. Eventually, I make it all the way down and begin to find my way back up to dam's door so i could try again. I tiptoe across the ledge once more. Yes ! I'm across the long part of the ledge. Now all i need to do is turn the corner. There's 8 more steps I need to make before i can be safe on the platform. Sure enough I fall again ! This time the injuries are more severe. I'm left with 12% hp left ! But I will not give up ! I head across to the other platform once more. Success ! I scour the platform and find nothing of value. Brrrrr... It's cold... What is this?! I'm suffering from hypothermia! FML I FORGOT TO PUT MY CLOTHES BACK ON !! My hp is slowly ticking down... After putting my clothes back on, I race across the ledge once more, to  the dam's back door. WTF !?!? I LOCKED MYSELF OUT OF THE CONTROL ROOM?!?! WHO DOES THAT ?!?! I'm panicking ! My life's slowly dropping by the percent. Down to 8%... My vision's blurry and my character begins to wobble. He's blacking out and coming back. I attempt to make a fire, but no, it's too windy ! I run around the place looking for cover from the wind ! I travel down the  mountain on a path and finally manage to get the fire going, but am left with 4% hp. I throw some logs onto the fire and warm myself up entirely. I check the time, there's 4 hours left. I've got to reach some kind of shelter before nightfall or else i'll freeze to death. Perhaps I messed somthing up and the back door actually does open? Still blacking out and wobbling, I decided to head back up to the back door to check again. I take 4 steps. OWWWW, burning damage inflicted !! I WALKED OVER MY OWN FIRE ! IS THIS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE?? KILLING MYSELF BY WALKING OVER MY OWN FIRE??!!? Thankfully, I'm left with 2% health and minor burns... I travel upwards, towards the door, but alas, the door does not open... The only way to go is down the mountain and follow the frozen river. My character's still disoriented, I'm having trouble walking and navigating my way through this maze of a river. I take every turn, only to be led to a dead end. It seems like there's no way up and out of this river system, so i push through looking for some kind of exit... I finally reach the end.... I found the tunnel system. It seemed to be the only way out, so i went in. Bad idea. 10 Steps in and i literally could not tell which way was up or down. I see a frozen corpse. Ha, i guess he'll have a friend pretty soon. I personally, begin to get motion sickness. I'm lost and i honestly can't tell if i'm going forwards into the cave or going back to where i came in from..... I give up... I exit the game and decide to reload from my last save spot (where ever that is i do not know). It happens to be the moment i entered the cave. I quickly turn around and exit. Surely there has to be another way out of this river system.... Welp, time to go online and look for a map ! There's no map. I did however, find out that there are two entrances/exits to this river system... The cave and A MFING WINDOW ON THE OPPOSITE PLATFORM TO THE DAM'S BACK DOOR!!!! I begin my journey back through the river/maze.... I'm beginning to feel tired... I'm forced to drop some inventory.... A dead end.... Another one.... Eventually i see open space. There's no mountains ahead. Sure enough, the dam appears. I travel up the moutain pass and reached the back door. Okay... I could barely cross the ledge at 100% health.... Now i've got to do it at 2% health.... I'm still wobbling, my screen is still fading in and out. I tip toe across the ledge and make sure i hit every wall there is to hit. I'm safe on the platform. I search for the window and slide my way inside of the dam. I recognize this area.... It's the deepest room inside of the dam and darkest..... I'll need a light source through the entire dam... I have a few matches and a flare.... I light the flare and race my way through the dam. I pass through the piles of items that i was supposed to retrieve. I pass through the door that started the entire journey. A few more minutes and i reach the front door of the dam. I drink and eat as much as i can. I check the time, less than an hour left of daylight ! It's a race against time ! I leave the dam with nothing but the clothes on my back and the single flare which only has 30% of it's original life left. I'm outside and it's dark. The time says less than one hour of daylight, but that's only referring to the temperature... I walk straight until i see the railroad. I place my feet on the railroad and look towards home, but i can barely see now. It's too dark ! I walk backwards, i've lost the railroad ! i look left or was it right? I see the way that isn't home and look the opposite direction. I see the bridge and railroad so I begin to walk. It's a long trek home. My flare dies out. The icon that tells me i'm suffering from lack of sleep appears. I march on. I reach a checkpoint, the trees that have been cut for lumber. I see that familiar corpse on the left side of the tracks.I reach the next checkpoint. The derailed carts. I walk around the carts and around the branch that blocks the way. From here on it's a straight path until home. I literally can not tell If i'm moving or not. I can only trust that i am. I march on. Waiting for some sign, for that opening in the mountains to the left that signifies that my cabin is there. I march on. Finally, i see the opening ! i see the black silouhette that resembles a house. I recognize that flag figure flying proudly atop the house. I run towards the house to the side i know the front door is on. I put my face against the side of the house and move left and right searching for the door. Is my face even against the wall or is it on the fence of the front porch?! I don't know, i can not see ! I try the back door which has no fence to protect it. I can't find that one either ! I back off from the house, trying to position myself to where i know the back door is, but i lose the house itself !! I see nothing but blackness. Am i touching the house or is it the mountains behind the house?!? I can not tell.... In time, i'm able to see that familiar silhoutte once more. I reposition myself and check my inventory to see if there's ANYTHING that can light the way... Apparently I left some matches in my backpack !! They must have been too light to throw away ! Thank god I was too lazy to toss them out ! I light a match against the wall of the house and am able to find the back door.... i light another match inside of the cabin so i can locate the stairs.  finally i'm safe at last.... I rest for 6 hours, not wanting to die of thirst or hunger. I wake up well enough to sleep for another 12 hours. Alas, I am home and rested, ready to journey once more...			"

								The Long Dark is by far the best in the survival genre. Hinterland Studios has done a great job listening to the users and fans in alpha. The sandbox mode is constantly getting better and worth many play throughs. Each experience is different and there is multiple approaches to survival in game. As an avid outdoorsman I thoroughly enjoy this game, as a gamer it is a challenge to survive over 100 days.			"

								So, I've only got about 5hrs playing time so far, but it's obvious this game is a bit of a gem. Beleivable and beautiful styleisation and setting and fun to play. So far I've died of hypothermia alone in the cold about 3 or 4 times.This is by far the best dying of hypothermia alone in the cold simulator that I have ever played. The game starts you at a different place on the map each time you play, and each game can be quite unique. It's fun finding out where you'll be and what you'll be doing next time you die of hypothermia alone in the cold.Currently, I've died of hypothermia alone in the cold while trying to start a fire, and I've died of hypothermia alone in the cold while scavenging from a deer carcas. I once got attacked by a wolf, recovered, then died of hypothermia alone in the cold.In my latest game I've managed to make a fishing line which I plan to take on a trip where I will die of hypothermia alone in the cold.There's an achievement for surviving for 50 days, but currently I'm not sure if that's a joke or not.

								Buy this game. This is easily the best survival game I've played, one of the most earnest and worthy examples of what an Early Access game should be, and one of my all-time favorite games. And it's only going to get better. The developers are highly dedicated, major updates are coming steadily, and the community is growing.The game's designer once commented that this game offers a ""vulnerability fantasy"" as opposed to the ""power fantasy"" of most games. And that it does. It's beautiful, stylistic, comforting, terrifying, fulfilling, lonely, and you will die. And you'll love it.			"

								I love this game I'm so serious I'm so invested in this game. I don't know why I love it so much more than other survival games but. Maybe it's the simple but beautiful graphics. Maybe it's the depth of realism in that you die easily to a lot of stuff. Really, I think, it's everything. The detail of wind in your ears, fog rolling in, wolves howling, the sunset changing colors... After almost 50 hours and numerous files and deaths, I still find things I haven't before. I am still awed and humbled by the beauty of this game. Bravo, Hinterland. Bravo. You are Da Vinci; this game is the Mona Lisa.			"

								Awesome Game, Something i have been waiting for a long time. The most interesting thing in it for me is how well they implemented fighting for survival. Other survival games(Early Acces especialy) focus more on building stuff and fighting mutants/zombies/whatever while this one is more realistic. It simply focuses on our basic needs like food/water/body temp. and really makes it challenging while in others its only an addition.Pros(+)- Finally good game on Unity Engine(both graphics and sound)- Surprisingly innovative- Low price compared to other survival games- Quite immersive (especially when u're lost in a blizzard)- Huge worldCons(-)- No jump button- You need too much food(my character's daily need is arround 4kg of meat or up to 8kg of fish)- Too many wolves ( Its just stupid as u go for around 10mins u will surely meet at least 2 wolves on your way, It would be better if they were in groups or at least a bit more clever)All in all as in every survival game you can find yourself sitting in one place and having stuff to survive for over 20 days. Then you starts wandering why should i keep playing as i'm quite safe here. Then you get bored and start exploring leaving a lot behind. - what i ment by this - for now you can't be rescued and there is no plot in game(as far as i know) so only thing you can really do is explore this dangerous but beautifull world. Yet still for me it's experience worth 20 euro!			"

								A beautiful crafted game about survivial in the wilderness. Being able to choose which location to start from, choosing the difficulty makes this game worth the while. The gameplay itself is fantastic, searching through dead frozen corpses, going through people's cabins, houses just to survive. Being able to hunt for your own food, fish for it and either eating it raw or cooked, reparing your clothes makes this game unique. This is probably the better survival game out there. Worth a try!

								Favortite game. I honestly thought that I was going to just scrape by graphics wise but I have been running the game at ultra and haven't experianced any lag what so ever. The more you play the more you get hooked into it. It is kind of weird because you start to develop this bond I guess with you avatar where you really don't want them to die and I haven't had that happen before. The landscape is amazing. It's kind of sad though cause you are the only person still alive (as far as I know). I do wish there weren't so many blizzards and a slightly bigger weight capcity (maybe like 35 Kg) but I am sure they will fix that since this is in Early Access. Highly recommended. All survival sims should be like this. Just you verses nature. They should make a tropical version where you have to survive the aftermath of a hurricane (just a thought?) Check it out on youtube if you aren't too sure about it. I gaurantee you will be playing it by the end of the week.			"

								Extremely good early-access game. Normally i don't like early access games because they feel like they are missing most of the main game, but this game is different. It has a very versatile environment which is challenging even on the easiest difficulty. It already features a lot of content and an incredible world to explore. The roadmap looks promising and during the steam sales the game is very worth buying it :)What is missing at this point is some sort of multiplayer or a single player campaign, only sandbox is available (sandbox is a ton of fun already). Edit: This game is going to leave early access soon, so now is your time to buy it for 50% off before they increase the price.			"

								A fantastic game, and still in its early days. I highly recommend if you enjoy survival simulators, exploring beautiful enviroments and managing a characters very life, than purchase this game and help these independent developers continue doing what they're good at.The visuals of the game are beautiful, the art style suits the tone and really helps to immerse you into its cold, icy world.The developers have really nailed all the little details in the game, small things that I suppose are not usually thought about but make a world of difference each time you discover one. I can only hope they continue to think of the small details and impliment more. Crafting could also be improved upon as I find it quite basic and I tend to search for new items rather than build my own.As for one example of these little details: I found myself wandering aimlessly, time was running short and night was approaching. My character was fatigued and hungry. I saw a church tower in the distance, made my way to it, hoping to find refuge from the hammering storm. I found little supplies, and a man, a daunting frozen statue, sitting on a bench where he had prayed for help, or death to come quick. Hope left me of surviving another night about this time.I am in love with the atmosphere, the immersion, the weather patterns and the dangers (from the wildlife and the weather itself). I found myself wandering in a snow storm, I ended up falling through thin ice, getting all turned around and ending up back at the same small hut i'd started in, gaining nothing but a loss in important stats (hunger, cold, tiredness).The fact that in its current state, it has no real purpose other than to see how long you can survive, has me wanting to go back for more only shows how addicting it can be to put yourself in the shoes of a lost survivor, desperate to see that next sunrise.

								While this game is far from perfect, I have to say it is probably my favorite survival game. You really have to push yourself to find the balance for exploration and hoarding. One of the first things you notice about this game is that it is fantasically, deceptively beautiful. I have lost myself in the art of the game only to find myself wandering off a cliff or into a den of wolves. There are only a few things I have issues with, the main being weapons. This isn't a first person shooter or anything, but one of the only weapons in the game is a hard to find/maintain gun. You can find knives, crowbars, and axes, but cannot use them for defence against wolves. The developers seem to always be updating and improving the game, so this could easily change. Overall, I think this is a fantastic game for casual or intense gamers.			"

								The game is NOW definitely playable in Alpha mode. They've added some more content and depth to the game, and the biggest factor of all, they finally increased the character's endurance when running (although there is still a lot of running/walking/traveling in this game).Day 23I'm on my way back to the dam's control room to collect a bunch of items i dropped since i couldn't carry them all back in one trip. After filling up my inventory, I begin to head back when i notice that this door is actually usable... I use this new door that leads to the back of the dam. Once out, I begin to look around to get a feel of the new environment. To the far left i see that there's another platform that may hold some promising items. To get across I'd have to hug the dam and tip toe across the protruding ledge. A few steps onto the ledge and I fall off the ledge onto the dam itself (the dam isn't completely vertical but at an angle)! I take only 15% damage, sprained my wrist (of course never my ankle when falling for some reason), and my clothes are a little ripped, no serious harm done. I'm off the ledge but still on the dam, so I take off all my clothes to prevent any damage to them. I take little jumps down the dam, slowly but surely. Eventually, I make it all the way down and begin to find my way back up to dam's door so i could try again. I tiptoe across the ledge once more. Yes ! I'm across the long part of the ledge. Now all i need to do is turn the corner. There's 8 more steps I need to make before i can be safe on the platform. Sure enough I fall again ! This time the injuries are more severe. I'm left with 12% hp left ! But I will not give up ! I head across to the other platform once more. Success ! I scour the platform and find nothing of value. Brrrrr... It's cold... What is this?! I'm suffering from hypothermia! FML I FORGOT TO PUT MY CLOTHES BACK ON !! My hp is slowly ticking down... After putting my clothes back on, I race across the ledge once more, to  the dam's back door. WTF !?!? I LOCKED MYSELF OUT OF THE CONTROL ROOM?!?! WHO DOES THAT ?!?! I'm panicking ! My life's slowly dropping by the percent. Down to 8%... My vision's blurry and my character begins to wobble. He's blacking out and coming back. I attempt to make a fire, but no, it's too windy ! I run around the place looking for cover from the wind ! I travel down the  mountain on a path and finally manage to get the fire going, but am left with 4% hp. I throw some logs onto the fire and warm myself up entirely. I check the time, there's 4 hours left. I've got to reach some kind of shelter before nightfall or else i'll freeze to death. Perhaps I messed somthing up and the back door actually does open? Still blacking out and wobbling, I decided to head back up to the back door to check again. I take 4 steps. OWWWW, burning damage inflicted !! I WALKED OVER MY OWN FIRE ! IS THIS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE?? KILLING MYSELF BY WALKING OVER MY OWN FIRE??!!? Thankfully, I'm left with 2% health and minor burns... I travel upwards, towards the door, but alas, the door does not open... The only way to go is down the mountain and follow the frozen river. My character's still disoriented, I'm having trouble walking and navigating my way through this maze of a river. I take every turn, only to be led to a dead end. It seems like there's no way up and out of this river system, so i push through looking for some kind of exit... I finally reach the end.... I found the tunnel system. It seemed to be the only way out, so i went in. Bad idea. 10 Steps in and i literally could not tell which way was up or down. I see a frozen corpse. Ha, i guess he'll have a friend pretty soon. I personally, begin to get motion sickness. I'm lost and i honestly can't tell if i'm going forwards into the cave or going back to where i came in from..... I give up... I exit the game and decide to reload from my last save spot (where ever that is i do not know). It happens to be the moment i entered the cave. I quickly turn around and exit. Surely there has to be another way out of this river system.... Welp, time to go online and look for a map ! There's no map. I did however, find out that there are two entrances/exits to this river system... The cave and A MFING WINDOW ON THE OPPOSITE PLATFORM TO THE DAM'S BACK DOOR!!!! I begin my journey back through the river/maze.... I'm beginning to feel tired... I'm forced to drop some inventory.... A dead end.... Another one.... Eventually i see open space. There's no mountains ahead. Sure enough, the dam appears. I travel up the moutain pass and reached the back door. Okay... I could barely cross the ledge at 100% health.... Now i've got to do it at 2% health.... I'm still wobbling, my screen is still fading in and out. I tip toe across the ledge and make sure i hit every wall there is to hit. I'm safe on the platform. I search for the window and slide my way inside of the dam. I recognize this area.... It's the deepest room inside of the dam and darkest..... I'll need a light source through the entire dam... I have a few matches and a flare.... I light the flare and race my way through the dam. I pass through the piles of items that i was supposed to retrieve. I pass through the door that started the entire journey. A few more minutes and i reach the front door of the dam. I drink and eat as much as i can. I check the time, less than an hour left of daylight ! It's a race against time ! I leave the dam with nothing but the clothes on my back and the single flare which only has 30% of it's original life left. I'm outside and it's dark. The time says less than one hour of daylight, but that's only referring to the temperature... I walk straight until i see the railroad. I place my feet on the railroad and look towards home, but i can barely see now. It's too dark ! I walk backwards, i've lost the railroad ! i look left or was it right? I see the way that isn't home and look the opposite direction. I see the bridge and railroad so I begin to walk. It's a long trek home. My flare dies out. The icon that tells me i'm suffering from lack of sleep appears. I march on. I reach a checkpoint, the trees that have been cut for lumber. I see that familiar corpse on the left side of the tracks.I reach the next checkpoint. The derailed carts. I walk around the carts and around the branch that blocks the way. From here on it's a straight path until home. I literally can not tell If i'm moving or not. I can only trust that i am. I march on. Waiting for some sign, for that opening in the mountains to the left that signifies that my cabin is there. I march on. Finally, i see the opening ! i see the black silouhette that resembles a house. I recognize that flag figure flying proudly atop the house. I run towards the house to the side i know the front door is on. I put my face against the side of the house and move left and right searching for the door. Is my face even against the wall or is it on the fence of the front porch?! I don't know, i can not see ! I try the back door which has no fence to protect it. I can't find that one either ! I back off from the house, trying to position myself to where i know the back door is, but i lose the house itself !! I see nothing but blackness. Am i touching the house or is it the mountains behind the house?!? I can not tell.... In time, i'm able to see that familiar silhoutte once more. I reposition myself and check my inventory to see if there's ANYTHING that can light the way... Apparently I left some matches in my backpack !! They must have been too light to throw away ! Thank god I was too lazy to toss them out ! I light a match against the wall of the house and am able to find the back door.... i light another match inside of the cabin so i can locate the stairs.  finally i'm safe at last.... I rest for 6 hours, not wanting to die of thirst or hunger. I wake up well enough to sleep for another 12 hours. Alas, I am home and rested, ready to journey once more...			"

								If you're into atmospheric singleplayer games, this is pretty sick. Even without the story mode the game is wonderful to play, especially when you're looking for something casual in evening. Can be as relaxing or as difficult as you want it.			"

								Amazing survival game! Exciting and realistic in its survival mechanics, and I can't get enough of the beautiful art style. The Long Dark is really life-like- like I said, it is realistic. You must survive the wilderness almost like you would in real life: breaking down branches to make tinder for a fire, melt snow for water- but must boil before drinking it to make it safe, gather animal meat for eating and hides/guts for crafting gear, but every hide and gut must be cured indoors for 5 days before you can use them. Then while crafting- it is not instant when you click 'begin crafting' (you have to work on a pair of deerskin boots for 12.5 hours). Right now the sandbox mode is the only one available, which is self-explanatory. Soon to come is the story mode (which, from the latest teaser trailer, looks super exciting) so the game can only get even better from here. If you like survival and/or adventure & exploring games, this game is a must have.			"

								This game is the Oregon Trail of first person shooters.There's really no other way of describing it.  Though it's not really about getting from one specific place to another, it's about exploring and surviving when the odds are entirely against you.  Hours in you realize so many small choices are life and death: using that cloth to repair your clothing, keeping you warm, or tearing them up for bandages, in case you are attacked.Or staying where you are, which is safe, but your food sources are running out, or hiking through the blizzard down an unknown path hoping to find game, something to eat, or an abandoned house to raid.Even the miniscule amounts of ammunition you can scavenge adds to this:  do you use your last three bullets hoping to take down the wolf at a distance? Or do you get closer, improving your chance to hit, but giving it a chance to charge you?It ook a few hours to fully get the experience, but once I got it, I was hooked.			"

								While this game is far from perfect, I have to say it is probably my favorite survival game. You really have to push yourself to find the balance for exploration and hoarding. One of the first things you notice about this game is that it is fantasically, deceptively beautiful. I have lost myself in the art of the game only to find myself wandering off a cliff or into a den of wolves. There are only a few things I have issues with, the main being weapons. This isn't a first person shooter or anything, but one of the only weapons in the game is a hard to find/maintain gun. You can find knives, crowbars, and axes, but cannot use them for defence against wolves. The developers seem to always be updating and improving the game, so this could easily change. Overall, I think this is a fantastic game for casual or intense gamers.			"

								Thank you so much for making a survival game that does not have zombies in it. It's just you versus nature. Satisfyingly difficult, and I find myself enjoying each achievement I earn.  Very smooth for an early access game too. I've personally encountered no issues other than the occasional floating seat cushion. "

The game has an active and engaged Development team who listen and respond to the player base in a very positive manner.  With four levels of difficulty it's as challenging as you want it to be and the long list of game achievements and new 'Challenges' game-play are a blast that and will keep your mind in the game.  So far I have over 800 hrs in-game, and its only getting better.   (Updated)			"

								I wrote my original review (included below) for The Long Dark based on only a couple weeks of play, and so I felt it was a good idea to come back and update this review now that I've spent over 85 hours with this game.In that time, the developers successfully upgraded the engine from Unity 4 to Unity 5 over the course of a few weeks, bringing added multi-core cpu and gpu support and increasing overall performance, therefore increasing the range of computers that can support this game.  In my case, I have been playing exclusively on a custom-built rig with the following specifications:  ▪ AMD K10-8750K ~3.7GHz 4-core + R7 APU ▪ Gigabyte GA-F2A88XM-D3H microATX motherboard▪ Corsair 16GB DDR3-2400 RAM ▪ Crucial MX100 512GB SSD (Windows 7 installed) ▪ Crucial MX100 256GB SSD (Linux installed - at this time The Long Dark is not natively supported in this OS)▪ AOC E2727SHE 27"" LCD monitor w/ 1920x1080 resolutionWith the above system I have been able to play The Long Dark using the Ultra graphics setting, and all effects enabled, without any significant performance issues aside from occasional, slight stuttering in certain interior environments that are using special lighting effects.  I also stream the game from this computer via Steam on my late 2006 MacBook Pro over my local network (whenever I don't feel like playing in my office) with no significant performance issues.The first thing that you should bear in mind is that this game gets continuous attention and responsive updates from the development team.  I am confident that Hinterland Games is committed to completing this game and feel that my money was well spent, enough so that I purchased a separate copy for my oldest daughter when she expressed interest in playing.  A big plus is the rapid release of bug fixes following each new release, and special effort is repeatedly made to assist those who have lost their loot in the process of upgrading to the latest version.The Long Dark is very immersive, enough so that I have felt it in my fingers, hands, wrists and arms when the main character sprains an ankle.  This is primarily due to the spectacular voice acting.  Some people may be a little put off by the stylized graphics, but I do not find that they detract from immersion in any significant way.After being punished by my first few tries playing the game in Voyageur mode, I switched to Pilgrim in order to explore the maps and get a feel for how the game should be played.  Upon exploring the majority of the maps (and the new connecting area released since my initial review), I decided that I was no longer being challenged by the game and returned to Voyageur mode, which has since been a constant learning experience.  My longest run so far has been in Voyageur with 41 days completed at the time of this writing.This is a survival game, and as such it approaches survival in a way that (in most cases) makes sense.  Some notable exceptions are the ability to carry a mug of coffee in your backpack without spilling it, the ability to craft a bow and arrows but the inability to fashion a basic spear, and the amount of food that must be consumed each day in order to survive might seem excessive.  These exceptions do not detract from my experience, however, and do not necessarily reflect the final version of the game when it is released.That said, the player is rewarded by finding, repairing and crafting better gear, tools and shelter, all of which dramatically raise his or her chances of survival.  That said, it is still quite possible to make a bad decision that leads to your demise, and therefore every decision should be made with care.The sense of danger that remains prevalent in Voyageur has been more than enough to keep me interested, and even though only Sandbox mode is currently available, the little stories that are created in day to day play are cool enough to share with others later.For example, I discovered that wearing a wolf coat may surprise and frighten off a wolf, but it will come back to attack you when you are not expecting it.  After learning this the hard way (and surviving the event), I unexpectedly came upon another wolf who was frightened off by my sudden appearance.  This time I found a safe place to wait for the wolf to return, and after it failed to reach me, I successfully dispatched it with my rifle.  As I was building a fire in preparation to harvest the wolf's meat and fur, I was surprised by the arrival of a black bear.  I ran back to my safe place and shot it twice, the second time directly between the eyes.  Now I had more than enough food to last me for several days, and also the opportunity to harvest the necessary materials to make a bearskin bedroll, but I had to act quickly before the body began to decompose.If you are at all interested in survival simulations, I cannot recommend The Long Dark strongly enough.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Bearing in mind this game is still in development, I've been hooked for over two weeks and played this to the exclusion of everything else during my spare time.  I like the pace, I like the challenge of surviving the elements, I like the concept of a massive CME knocking out the power worldwide, I like the option to choose a difficulty level without completely eliminating the challenge of the game, and I like the exploration elements involved.  The artistic styling of the renderings is simply gorgeous.The ability to unlock maps by discovering them is a nice touch.  I can't wait to see what the story mode will have to offer when it becomes available.   I hope the devs will make it possible to play either gender in story mode as well as sandbox mode, because the voice acting by Jennifer Hale for this game is superb.			"

								The first time I played this I didn't realize you could melt snow to drink and panicked I would die of dehydration so went out in a -45C blizzard and found a can of orange soda. Died of hypothermia.Kel loves orange soda. 10/10Got a LITTLE better and just slogged through surviving for 19 days, my current best. It's not a lot, but I have EXTREMELY bad luck and getting to aim a gun and shoot at the same time when my mouse pad locks up up all the time means wolves keep slaughtering me - that and I always seem to leave my shelters at the worst possible times, y'know, like when I'm starving to death to look for food.Though you can survive without food for a few days, I think the hunger mechanic is a little over the top, I understand all the extra calories you'd burn in such a cold environment and walking on snow and yadayadayda, but it is a little annoying to be starving just hours after polishing off 9kg of deer meat (not all in one go, but tbh I don't think it would've lasted much longer anyway.) This dude must've been in eating competitions and have t-shirts from every steakhouse in the US for how much he needs to eat to stop complaining! Overall I do really love this game, it's interesting and just plain different, the permadeath is an element I love and hate at the same time, but it really does make the game, you HAVE to survive. Sometimes it's luck, where you start out, which caches are open to you, whether you catch any fish during a 5 hour stretch and whether a big bad wolf will flip it's biscuits and attack you three times in a row so every item of your clothing is ripped to shreds and you're out in North Canada wearing, assuringly, nothing. Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you will read this and assume I'm horribly bad at the game and maybe I am, but you gotta try it for yourself and see how well you fair! It's like nothing else and you kinda enjoy being such a horrible masochist to yourself.Good luck out there, it's f***king cold!			"

								I know that there are some details and aspects that aren't realistic (many are), but the game does, y'know... FEEL real! You will feel a satisfying shiver shake down your spine when you huddle up to a fire after coming in from a blizzard. You will feel the warmth and the cold even though it's not really there. The best part of this game is you just keep moving, and you can. Games get boring when you stay in one spot all the time. There's so much to explore that I don't even know if I'll survive long enough to see all of it. 10/10 will keep exploring.Oh, and a word of advice: BEARS ARE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TANKS, NOT EVEN THE RIFLE WORKS ON THEM. DO NOT MESS WITH BEARS. THEY WILL F YOU UP. I somehow miraculously survived that though, in critical 6% condition. Was back up in high spirits again in only a few hours, so now I feel pretty badass. ""Meh, got mauled by a bear, I'm okay, it's just a scratch, I'm gonna go kill me some wolf meat now."" 10/10 would feel badass again.			"

 This game is overwhelming, I don't even know where to begin.  It's brutal, cold, and poetic. The artstyle is perfect for the experience, mostly cold muted tones.With a good pair of headphones, and a decent enough imagination you are absorbed into this vast and quiet world. Without modern technology, you are no longer the top of the food chain, and mother nature is quick to remind you of this with her unrelenting winds and snow. Survive long enough to wonder what the point is, or die early on as one of the countless victims of nature's beautiful wrath.The game mechanics are pretty awesome and detailed. You're walking uphill? You slow down. Downhill? Speed up, but be careful not to slip and hurt yourself. Wind's blowing and your take cover by a big rock, standing on the downwind side? Good job, you're sheltered from the biting wind. Good job indeed because the biting wind is as bad as the biting wolf. If you're survival savy, you might just live past the first month. Or you might just fall into the long dark.The game gets regular updates, mostly small tweaks, but a few big ones here and there. The community is also quite pleasant. It's well worth the $20 for the alpha. If you want it, get it fast before the price goes up :P Love this game, all the ups and down. Be prepared to feel cold though. I have to play it with a blanket on. TLDR; Get the game, you really won't regret it.			"

								[h]This review is based on Early Access Gameplay. Because of the changing nature of the game, parts of this review are very likely to change.[/h]When you first start the game, you are greeted with a disclaimer:This game starts by greeting you with a disclaimer.""The Long Dark is a post-disaster survival simulation. Although we strive to provide an experience steeped in realism, the game is not a replacement for proper wilderness survival training. As the result of the geomagnetic disaster which serves as part of the fictional foundation of the game, we have taken liberties with the potrayal of wildlife behaviour. Hinterland Studio Inc. does not condone the wanton destruction of wildlife.""And then you are taken to the main menu, with a delicious quote from one of many inspirational people that set the tone of the game.Since this game is in early access, there are parts of the game that are being worked on or missing entirely. The Story Mode is nothing more than a button at this point on the main menu, which tells you that it will be available upon the game's final release when you click on it.So you're forced to play in the Sandbox.Which I love - because you pick a starting location, and then from there you let your own story unfold.And what is the Long Dark? It is entirely Man vs. Nature. And nature will always win. It's simply a quesiton of how much you can take.Taking place in the Canadian wilderness after a geomagnetic disaster that throws everything out of balance, you find yourself fighting for your life against frigid temperatures, debilitating weather patterns, starvation, fatigue, disease, and wildlife.This game is so spot-on with its survival requirements, that it reminds me of my own small adventures in the area around Lake Pend d'Orielle in Idaho. To combat the dangers of cold (read: exposure), you first need shelter. You start with little more than the clothes on your back and your mostly empty backpack, with a gallon of water and maybe a couple snack bars or a sewing kit to start you on your journey. That hoodie and jacket aren't going to keep you warm in the zero-degree gusts of wind blowing in your face for long. A car is better than being outside, but not by much - you'll be far better off in a house or a mineshaft, but sometimes you will have to make do with the lee of a rock.I so want to continue on with a lecture of what you need to do to survive - but both in this game and real life, it's not just knowing what to do, it's having the tools to prevent whatever might befall you. And that's part of what I love about this game - there's so much that can happen, from eating only half-cooked venison you hunted yourself and getting sick, to falling too far and breaking a leg, to freezing to death in a building that was the only source of shelter but was still far too cold, and you couldn't get that fire going in time. Or, perhaps, a chance encounter with a bear that was going so well - but went south far too fast.And that's the thing. All the dangers in this game are purely what you might face in nature - save, perhaps, getting charged by wolves. There's no special monster, no group of cannibalistic tribesmen, no mechanations out to kill you simply to provide a focal threat. Because nature is fearsome enough.And yet, there's so much to love about nature. The visuals in this game are simplistic on the Unity engine - but it's a distinct, appealing world, desolate but so vibrant all at once. There are crags with frozen rivers that you just can't help but look down; iced-over forests that sparkle in your eye; and vistas provide some amazing views, especially if there's a frozen lake nearby where you can see the ice stretching off to the horizon.And when you find your flow - not if, when - you'll be able to appreciate those beautiful moments more and more, as you find the systems that tax your character's body less obtrusive, less wanting to kill you as you find your own place in this frozen paradise. Your choice whether you wish to keep some of the modern amenities, or go full tribal and make your own clothes from animal hide and fashion ""primitive"" tools that get the job done just as effectively as the factory-made ones we use today.I enjoy Miasmata, but The Long Dark is the survival game I'll be coming back to again and again five years down the line after I've played through it a dozen times. Especially since the developers keep adding more to the systems of this game, fine-tuning things that are working but need that extra bit of polish, and adding whole new systems that could easily turn the tide for or against you in your next playthrough and make it more interesting. This is easily my favorite singleplayer survival game of all time, and I'd be hard-pressed to find one better.Can't recommend it enough.			"

								This review is written as of May 10th, 2016. It's my first review.The Long Dark is a single-player survival experience that takes place in a cold wasteland following a ""geomagnetic disaster"". You're cold and alone, and the game truly captures that. It has fantastic visuals, a lovely soundtrack and ambience that will make you think you're really struggling for life in this doomed world.You scavenge for food, clothing, fuel and hunting gear. You have to pry open lockers and crack open safes for the next meal. If you've run the house dry, you plan your trek to the next one between the snow storms and the migrating wolf packs that are hungry and hostile. If you're out of food, you may have to try to hunt your own, but be careful; the wolves may either take your prey, or choose you for their next meal.The game as it currently stands has an open-world sandbox that will let you choose your own ""adventure"", of sorts. A story mode is in the works, but by and large, many of the players (myself included) are simply in love with the sandbox mode. I've already spent over 400 hours playing this game before it has even launched. I've definitely gotten my money's worth.I highly recommend this game. The developers appear to be on top of the game, interacting with the community and listening to their feedback, as well as taking care of major issues with hotfixes as soon as possible. I don't think this game will fall by the wayside like so many others have before it.Good luck and, if you buy the game, try not to die!			"

								The first time I played this I didn't realize you could melt snow to drink and panicked I would die of dehydration so went out in a -45C blizzard and found a can of orange soda. Died of hypothermia.Kel loves orange soda. 10/10Got a LITTLE better and just slogged through surviving for 19 days, my current best. It's not a lot, but I have EXTREMELY bad luck and getting to aim a gun and shoot at the same time when my mouse pad locks up up all the time means wolves keep slaughtering me - that and I always seem to leave my shelters at the worst possible times, y'know, like when I'm starving to death to look for food.Though you can survive without food for a few days, I think the hunger mechanic is a little over the top, I understand all the extra calories you'd burn in such a cold environment and walking on snow and yadayadayda, but it is a little annoying to be starving just hours after polishing off 9kg of deer meat (not all in one go, but tbh I don't think it would've lasted much longer anyway.) This dude must've been in eating competitions and have t-shirts from every steakhouse in the US for how much he needs to eat to stop complaining! Overall I do really love this game, it's interesting and just plain different, the permadeath is an element I love and hate at the same time, but it really does make the game, you HAVE to survive. Sometimes it's luck, where you start out, which caches are open to you, whether you catch any fish during a 5 hour stretch and whether a big bad wolf will flip it's biscuits and attack you three times in a row so every item of your clothing is ripped to shreds and you're out in North Canada wearing, assuringly, nothing. Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you will read this and assume I'm horribly bad at the game and maybe I am, but you gotta try it for yourself and see how well you fair! It's like nothing else and you kinda enjoy being such a horrible masochist to yourself.Good luck out there, it's f***king cold!			"

								I've always been unsatisfied with singleplayer survival games when it comes to the survival aspect. For example, I love how immersive The Forest can be, but its so easy to survive that ends being a shallow experience to me. This is not the case with The Long Dark.The game makes you feel the need to constantly move when the resources begin to run out in your current location.Can't wait for the Story Mode.			"

								The greatest attribute to The Long Dark, is the talented and dedicated developers who are constantly working to improve this game. The gameplay is superb and you won't be disappointed in the first ten hours of playing. However, the reason why you are seeing many positive reviews, with those who had spent over 100 hours, is because the game is in constant update, with added content, that gets us coming back for more. This game is hardcore in nature and you will find yourself dying often in the beginning. But the beauty of such gameplay, is the replayability that leaves you with many rooms for improvement.  The Long Dark is beautiful, immersive, and harsh. There are no other games quite like this one, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anybody looking for a challenging survival game that tests you through every footstep.			"

								Personally, I tend to have an awful time getting immersed, and I can never play a game for a long period of time without getting bored and quitting or moving to another one. The Long Dark is the first game in a long time to change that. The environment and atmosphere are beautiful and brutal; the sounds and feelings of ever-present danger all around you are crystal clear 100% of the time. The snow that falls genuinely looks like snow. They did a great job of putting you in a place, as opposed to you feeling like you're playing a game about a person in a place. I can't wait for the story mode to be released, because this is a true survival game, done entirely right.			"

								Of the three maps currently in Early Access alpha, I've only explored most of the first one, Mystery Lake, so far, and yet what I'm seeing of the game based on just the first map is extremely promising. Even after you know what to do, bad weather (say a blizzard or just the wind coming from the wrong direction), a wolf/bear attack or just plain bad luck in finding equipment may leave you near dead when you were planning on trekking for the remaining daylight hours and making most of the day. It is a tough game, but, even without any way of actually 'winning' yet in place, thoroughly enjoyable.It also has a sort of Moominland Midwinter aesthetic going on, which is always a plus for me.10/10 would have my campfire extinguished by a blizzard and get eaten by a wolf again.

								I think the complexities of social living in the modern world lead me to find great peace in the simplicity of this game.  You are stranded in the wilderness and are only concerned with survival.  You must find shelter, keep warm, gather food, purify water, avoid hostile wildlife.  There are many ways to do these things, and many challenges that arise organically within the world.  A routine trip through familiar territory can turn deadly if a blizzard strikes, freezing you and closing in your visibility, testing how well you really know the landscape.  You can catch a disease that takes weeks to cure as you struggle to maintain your normal routines with a dramatically weakened body.  A surprise encounter with a bear can leave you critically wounded and desperate while damaging the warm clothing you've come to take for granted.  But all of these obstacles can be overcome, and if feels triumphant to do so.  So often the simple beauty of the game's environment makes you stop and just admire.The upcoming story mode promises to add a whole new dimension to this game, but I can strongly recommend it even without that promise.

								Graphics: 7.5Gameplay: 8.5Replayability: 8At first i was unsure of the game and almost refunded the game but after saying screw it I decided to head back in for my 3rd game, the best way to review this game and let you know of some game elements is through my story so far.I woke on a small ice island in the middle of what was once the sea. I looked around looking at the sheer artistic beauty of this Canadian wasteland and saw in the distance a small green hut and ventured forth across the ice to it and upon arrival was met by great luck with a hunting rifle and a bullet being inside this small hut. upon exiting i see a large cabin on top of a large island and move towards it cautiosly, luck doesn't last forever. To my suprise i enter the house with no problems and inside find several days worth of supplies, a lantern, 5 more bullets, some better clothes and some food and drinks. I spent the night in this homely cabin and spent the next day exploring other green ice fishing cabins returning to my house at night. Knowing I would have to leave I cooked my raw food and kept my tinned produce for the days walking.After a short walk collecting a few bits of food and drink from a gas station I venture up a snow track lane and walk off to get to a small ranger station to see my surroundings. I reach the station and look out spotting a new place to discover, but I here footsteps behind me and a bear begins to charge me! I ran from the killer bear and when there is some distance between us I start to fire my gun at it's face striking 4 times before being mauled and thrown about by the bear like Leonardo Di Caprio in the Revenant. After a minute of being maulled in a brutal and beautiful animation i accept my death when the black screen comes only to discover that my clothing may have saved me. I'm bleeding and have just 30 seconds to heal myself. Frantically, through blurred vision, I grab my rifle off the floor and my peaches, the bear just 15 metres away, and sprint to a nearby rock so i can bandage myself. A moments respite.The bear begins charging again and I sprint down some rocks spraining my ankle, thankfully I see a trailer to dive into for safety the bear right behind me. I get in and rest for a few hours to heal. Upon leaving the trailer I begin to celebrate, my fight with the bear was won! The bear led on the ground dead from blood loss and i begin my newest chapter. A day later a wolf attempts to attack me but i quickly light a flare and throw it at the wolf scaring it, feeling like Liam Neeson I Crouch down and put a bullet in the wolf's face. The same evening another experience with a bear went much better the last of my bullets in the bear I run into a building and sleep.Day 10 now I have become a survivor and I now wear the pelts of the bears as my clothing.

								Survival diaryDay 1Always thought I will end up surviving zombie apocalypse, but Mother Nature used a plain old herself on humanity, and now we're in a constant winter state. Hoped to escape somewhere on ecvator... Joke on me; thanks to that storm my plane crashed in Canada! Of all places... I scraped all I can from crash site (wasn't much, but at least I have some food, water and a badroll). Hell it freezing! I was outside for only 3 hours and already can't feel my hands, no shelter either, only trees and snow. Here's an idea: Instead of wasting time writing down this useless diary, I should just harvest some of those sticks and try to start a fire.♥♥♥♥ you nature! Three attempts to lite a decent fire and all failed... I am going to die here! Frozen to death...Now that was unexpected; When all hope was lost, I found this nice lil lighthouse. it's so warm inside. I also found food, better clothing and to me luck -- a bow and two arrows. On my way here I saw some deers and rabbits, might go hunting. It's not like I can survive on crackers and soda alone.Day 2Night was quite. Unlike day that met me with ravaging storm! But storm or no storm, I need food, after moring meal I only left with two granola bars... Still have enough water though (not a big problem actually since I can simply melt snow, and in case of lacking water purification tablets -- just boil water on a same fire).Ha-ha! Tremble in a presence of mighty hunter -- me! I shot two deers; Meat, guts and hide... Now if only I had a workbench here, could've craft a decent pants and maybe a fishing rod. But hey, at least I won't go hungry today. The cold was a big problem however. It's warm inside, but I better make sure I have enough fuel to keep stove going for a while.Day 3♥♥♥♥ me running! I heard wolfes howling and walking outside this night. Everyone are hungry nowdays, so I better make sure to be extra carefull.Nothing much happened today; found some mushrooms, shot a rabbit, gathered some sticks. You know dear diary -- I think tommorow I will go exploring nearby territories. Maybe there are other survivors, or at least abandond village somewhere. Day 4Exploration ho! I have bow, supplies, sticks and lantern -- nothing can stop me.Nothing but freaking blizzard! Can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥outhere. So I took an advantage of my skills, build a sick snowcover and made a fire. Think I heard wolves outthere... but it maybe just my imagination and it's simply wind.Ow-ow-ow-oweee! No it was not ♥♥♥♥ing wind, those were ♥♥♥♥ing wolfes! A whole bloody pack of critters. Managed to kill two and scare the rest, but one took a bite out of my hand. It hurts badly. And I don't have propper medcine to treat bites.Day 5I thought, I was going to die, but it seems luck again at my side -- found a gas station with workbench, first aid kit and a nice stack of food, broke down some boxes and chairs into wood, and even found crowbar and saw. Tools!I treated bite wound as best as I could -- it feels better now, but I still feel a little weak and unwell... Hopefully that wolf had no rabbis. Otherwise, yeah I am ♥♥♥♥ed.Day 6Exploration ho? I moved my body all day, stoping a few times to take a quick bite out of beef jerky, refill myself with water and warm up (I am getting quite good at making fires outside). Still no signs of any other living humans or any large cities or vilalges. Screw you Canada, you suck. I actually found some humans, hardly alive -- most were froze to death, but at least two looked like they were kileld by IDK wolfes? Claws and fangs marks however were far too big for them to be wolfes. Well day is almost over, and I am still in a wild. Will have to sleep outside.Day 7Lucky me... Woke up from growling. It was a bear... Seemd friendly, untill I (like a genius) decided to eat my cooked vension in front of him... Those eyes! Those claws! My body is torn up... Have no medcine... no food, clothes are less then protective, cold is killing me quicker than those wounds and bloodloss makes it hard to concentrate... I think I will just take a quick nap under that tree... Yeah, just rest my eyes for a minute......You were taken by long dark!			"

								The Long Dark is pure survival sim. Very little realism sacrificed for simplicity or gameplay purposes. If you like punishing surivival, you'll love this. It's a little bare-bones as of early 2017, but the devs promise a story (currently the only option is sandbox mode) and other new features before release, and seem to be consistently adding to the game.If you like survival sims, buy it.

								Very fun and addictive survival game.  This is still in early access so there is not yet a story mode to play.  The only way to play currently is in an open world sandbox environment where you try to survive for as long as possible.  There is a leaderboard to keep track of the longest survival times.  Since this is still in early access, there are lots of changes being made and functionality being added.  The game is very playable in its current form and should only get better as improvements are made to game mechanics and new territory is added.  There are currently three zones to explore.Hinterland Studios is a very attentive developer.  I have been playing this early access game for almost 6 months now, and Hinterland regularly releases content updates and hot fixes.  They are active on the forums.  Hinterland is one of the best game studios I've encountered, and this is by far the most worthwhile early access game I've ever played.			"

								A fun survival game, I start my first playthrough off in normal mode and try to survive for as long as possible. I wander around and see a house in the middle of a frozen lake. I trekked to the house carefully and set up camp inside. I scavenged every drawer in the house. I found a survival knife stuck to the top of a dresser. Fascinated by this blade, I keep it in case anything attacks me. I sleep for 3 hours and wake up hungry. I go out to scavenge for food and I find a frozen over fishing hole. I break the ice and while doing this, I catch 2 fish. I set up a campfire outside the house and cook the fish. I go back inside as the fire burns out. I hang around until I decide to go to sleep. Again, I wake up hungry and go back to the fishing hole only to find a wolf outside my door. The wolf attacked me and I ran back into the house all bruised and bloody. I clean and bandage the wounds and I go back to sleep to attempt to let the wounds heal. Doing this, I die peacefully in my sleep. 10/10			"

								For three days I struggled, bro. Three days. Everything was going good, bro. I was walking around a snowy land, playing this game on the easiest difficulty. As I walked around the map, I saw train tracks. Them train tracks led me to a nice shack, bro. It had all kinds of good stuff, bruh. Food, shelter, all that good♥♥♥♥♥♥ So I traveled from place to place during the day and went back to the shack to gather these supplies, bro, and all was good, but then on the third day I decided to explore more areas to find more crafting supplies. So I followed the train tracks in another direction, which led me to a ravine. I looked around for more supplies bro, then for the sake of exploration, I decided to explore, so I tried to get across to the bottom of the ravine, but I couldn't find a clear path.So bro, I found this fallen tree and tried to cross dat♥♥♥♥♥♥to get to the other side of the ravine, and hopefully find a way down, but then as I was about to approach dat tree, I fell off the ledge and was stuck on a natural platform near the cliffs. Now bro, I would have tried to get back up IF THE DEVS ADDED IN A MUTHA ♥♥♥♥IN JUMP BUTTON! but I couldn't jump, so my best bet was to climb down the cliff without any climbing equipment (cuz I had none). So bro, I tried to purposely fall off small portions of dat cliff, but things got so bad that I had to fall off large portions slowly. So I broke an ankle and a wrist, so by the time I got down to the bottom of the ravine, had 65% health left. Damn.So bruh, I took painkillers, so it helped. But health was still 65% and it was night time as soon as I was at the bottom of the ravine. So bruh, I used my torch to light up the path and look for supplies and all dat♥♥♥♥♥♥but I didn't find much of dat. All I found was cat tail plants and a waterfall between the ravine at the very back of it. Bruh, it was getting dark and I was getting tired, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find a way to get out of the ravine, so I decided to turn off my torch and save it for later. I climbed over a few obstacles went near the waterfall in a last ditch attempt to find a way out, but didn't find♥♥♥♥♥♥ so bro, I found nothing there. My character was getting tired and cold, bruh, so I tried to make a fire. Then I realized that the fuel I used to start my torch was gone, so I couldn't make a ♥♥♥♥in' fire no mo bro. So I tried to light up my torch to find a way out of the water fall, but bruh, I forgot that I ran out of matches to light up the torch. So no torch fo me. So I tried to climb my way out of the rocks blocking the waterfall, BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO JUMP BUTTON I COULDN'T DO♥♥♥♥♥♥TO GET OUT.Then I realized I was stuck and had no light source or fire 2 stay warm, and my character was chilly 'n tired, so I decided to use my sleeping bag. I figured I could get enough rest and warmth, so I decided 2 sleep for like 7 hrs. I'd try to find a way out of the water fall and hopefully out of the ♥♥♥♥in ravine the next day, but ♥♥♥♥ that♥♥♥♥♥♥ cuz while I was sleepin' I died of hypothermia.Moral of story: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ADD IN A JUMP BUTTON			"

								Very fun and addictive survival game.  This is still in early access so there is not yet a story mode to play.  The only way to play currently is in an open world sandbox environment where you try to survive for as long as possible.  There is a leaderboard to keep track of the longest survival times.  Since this is still in early access, there are lots of changes being made and functionality being added.  The game is very playable in its current form and should only get better as improvements are made to game mechanics and new territory is added.  There are currently three zones to explore.Hinterland Studios is a very attentive developer.  I have been playing this early access game for almost 6 months now, and Hinterland regularly releases content updates and hot fixes.  They are active on the forums.  Hinterland is one of the best game studios I've encountered, and this is by far the most worthwhile early access game I've ever played.			"

								Of the three maps currently in Early Access alpha, I've only explored most of the first one, Mystery Lake, so far, and yet what I'm seeing of the game based on just the first map is extremely promising. Even after you know what to do, bad weather (say a blizzard or just the wind coming from the wrong direction), a wolf/bear attack or just plain bad luck in finding equipment may leave you near dead when you were planning on trekking for the remaining daylight hours and making most of the day. It is a tough game, but, even without any way of actually 'winning' yet in place, thoroughly enjoyable.It also has a sort of Moominland Midwinter aesthetic going on, which is always a plus for me.10/10 would have my campfire extinguished by a blizzard and get eaten by a wolf again.

								The Long Dark is an interesting game to me. With a story mode due somewhere in the future, the finished product of this game might be something fantastic. The game looks great and as opposed to facing Zombies or Humans, you're completely by yourself trying to survive in the wilderness. Wolves and the freezing cold weather will be your main enemies, and they will not be easy to take on all alone, but that is what makes this a strong survival experience. It's great to see a survival game where nature will rip you apart in every way possible if you're not always working hard to be prepared.			"

								CHECK OUT THE WHOLE REVIEW AT ETHNOGRAPHIX: https://ethnographix.squarespace.com/ ""Extinction is the rule. Survival is the exception""  - Carl Sagan I was raised in Alaska so, not at all ignoring my own subjectivity, I'm just going to say that this is one of the best survival-genre titles out there. Even from the early access days of The Long Dark, I could tell, based on the awesome attention to detail in the quasi cell shaded yet realistic portrayal of bit-like pixels, that this game was in a league all its own. Erie, quiet, and insightful; these quotes are the first and last bit of civilization you'll encounter that isn't a frozen corpse for the entire game. Your life will consist of three essential goals at all times:Stay rested, warm, and fed. Your chief adversary, like in the real wilderness of the Great North, is Old Man Winter himself. A tireless and incremental devil who will constantly whittle away at your desire to continue forth; lulling you into a cold yet eerily peaceful death. Crafting, hunting, trap laying, and scavenging. It's all here. The game consists of a number of ""levels"" that are teeming with wildlife both apex and otherwise that will keep your head on a swivel as you search for firewood you can gather or breakdown from chairs, boxes, and the like. If there's an idea you've had for a harsh winter survival title, The Long Dark has likely done it. You need to play The Long Dark just to see how immersive and harrowing it is to believe for yourself.So huddle close inside the abandoned car you found alongside the desolate highway of a frozen lake as the wolves circle nearby. Let the The Long Dark take you to the edge of Humanity before the inevitability of death wraps its cold fingers around you.

								So this game is pretty cool, pun intended. great concept for a game, I’m a 44-day survivor so far. I have almost died 4 times, 2 by bear mauling’s, freezing, and falling off a cliff. There are a few things I would like in the game, as I am from Montana and know a thing or two about winter and extended camping. 1. the ability to make jerky or pemmican so all the meat I get doesn't go to waste. 2. the ability to make a sled to haul things, i.e. wood, dead animals. so I don't have to harvest where it died...like real life. the ability to move the stoves you find in fishing huts to cabins or the fire barrels to better locations that make more sense. (you want to warm a small room vs a giant dam for example) Oh and some of the tasks take WAY too long.  even ones you think are ok I find annoying. 5 min to break down a branch into 3 sticks?? I can do the same task in about 10-15 seconds real world without a tool. 27 min to tear up a cardboard box?? really?? 1-2 min tops, with my hands, and more moveable/harvestable objects. I also think you get tired a bit to quickly...even when you do nothing but read them books you find. should have a better fatigue meter vs being actually tired. If a football player runs 100 yards he should not need to sleep for 3-4 hours to be rested again, it’s just fatigue. Also, why are we limited in rifle to an old .303 British rifle. the Canadians have better technology than that. bring in a .444 Marlin for them bears...heck even an old Winchester .22 long rifle would be sweet for the rabbits. maybe a pistol of some sorts....357 or a .44 mag. As far as the skills that get better with use. surprised there is a rifle skill but no bow skill. and how about Endurance? If I have to carry 50-60 lbs. on my back and person all the time I am going to get stronger and such. the Mountain men of old used to carry 100lbs of gear on them without breaking a sweat. strong as an ox and tough as a honey badger. With all this said, I am still enjoying the game			"

								What's to like about something that puts you deep into a sense of discomfort? It's lonely, barren and relentlessly cold. I've literally had to put a cardigan on, so well does this game depict the harsh brutality of an arctic winter. As far as sandbox survival games go, this one is one of the best so far. Perhaps it's the simplicity or the sheer level of difficuty. Regardless, I've started the game multiple times, each time trying different tacticts but I keep failing. It's not so heartless that it doesn't give you a glaring reason why you failed. So we keep retrying. For those who've played The Forest, imagine a similar experience but without the ridiculous bugs. Which brings me neatly onto the standard of this game which is essentially an early access title. It's polished already and I've not been privy to any bugs at all. There's just some limited content, but otherwise this is a fantastic title with a bright future. Thoroughly recommended.			"

A deer, but I have nothing to hunt it with. I survived my first meeting with a wolf at night but not the second time in daylight. Yeah, it's difficult to survive the cold, the hunger, the wilds but then it is a survival game so that is expected and somehow it doesn't feel too hard.  So far I really like this game and the snowy-landscape-survival-theme. I am looking forward for the release and to be able to play story mode.			"

Even from the early access days of The Long Dark, I could tell, based on the awesome attention to detail in the quasi cell shaded yet realistic portrayal of bit-like pixels, that this game was in a league all its own. Erie, quiet, and insightful; these quotes are the first and last bit of civilization you'll encounter that isn't a frozen corpse for the entire game. Your life will consist of three essential goals at all times:Stay rested, warm, and fed. Your chief adversary, like in the real wilderness of the Great North, is Old Man Winter himself. A tireless and incremental devil who will constantly whittle away at your desire to continue forth; lulling you into a cold yet eerily peaceful death. Crafting, hunting, trap laying, and scavenging. It's all here. The game consists of a number of ""levels"" that are teeming with wildlife both apex and otherwise that will keep your head on a swivel as you search for firewood you can gather or breakdown from chairs, boxes, and the like. If there's an idea you've had for a harsh winter survival title, The Long Dark has likely done it. You need to play The Long Dark just to see how immersive and harrowing it is to believe for yourself.So huddle close inside the abandoned car you found alongside the desolate highway of a frozen lake as the wolves circle nearby. Let the The Long Dark take you to the edge of Humanity before the inevitability of death wraps its cold fingers around you.

Early Access Review
								I teach a survival simulation course to children and adults.I work at a camp where we have a variety of programs that we offer to grade-schoolers who come and take field trips at our site. Among the fun ones like ""Log-cabin Building"" and ""Pioneer Cooking"" is ""Survival Simulation"". What does that look like? Very similar to this game. We are open in the spring and the fall and are in the northern United States and often find ourselves doing this in the snow. As a matter of fact, on first looking at it, I was convinced that some items had been taken from my manual. But that was silly. Smart survivalists all say the same basic things.Before I take the children out, I give them a quick lesson on all the things they will experience in the simulation. How to find water, how to find or create tinder, kindling and fuel for a fire, what a fire needs to live, what we need to live, how to build a lean-to, how to find what direction the wind is coming from, how to build an S.O.S. signal and how to create a splint, stop blood loss and treat shock. Pretty rushed though, but that's OK because we are going outside and going to practice everything that I just showed them.So, at our camp, we have ""The plane crash"" in a wilderness area (no houses around sorry) and the burning wreckage is going so hot and heavy that the survivors only have time to grab five items out of a long list of things that was on the plane. We are looking basically for them to chose: Matches, Knife, Metal bucket, Rope, Tarp and not choose things like: Flashlight, Popcorn, Toilet paper, and the like. They only have a few minutes before the plane catches all the way, and then sinks into the bog.The main good news during my Survival Sim is that there are no wolves. Not real ones at least. The pretend ones come later. We do, however, put them to the test. There are around ten children usually and they are given fifty ""Life Points"" per group, each child accounting for five of those points. I will give them twenty minutes to find water, get a fire going and bring their water to a boil. Fire accounts for: Light, Heat, Ability to melt and boil water, Ability to cook food, Safety, Ability to dry wet clothes, and most importantly: Hope.If they fail at the first task the rest are ultimately harder. And I take away half of their Life Points. Then I have them search for food, erect a shelter, someone ""has an accident"" and breaks their leg and bleeds everywhere and goes into shock, and then I have them build and S.O.S. and get into the shelter before the wolves come.Usually around half of the children die. But we go inside out of the snow and discuss what happened and they write down the things they did that were successful and the things that were not.All of that prepared me for The Long Dark. In the game, I found myself learning new and inventive strategies that I did not know I was able to invent. I felt as if I were a child and the game makers were myself, being patient and ever so helpful. Wait. No. There was no help. Only the savage fangs of the wolves. And the snow. The long dark? The long snow-blind, wolf-infested, frozen-soul dark. Dark and dirty... And damn cold.My first experience with this game was my wife screaming from the other room. ""Oh my gosh honey! This is totally you!"" she went on and on. She was so happy to have found something that looked like I would play it over and over. That was two weeks ago. It was to be my Christmas present... Heh. I've been enjoying it a little early.Enjoying it? Obsessing over it? Living it? I caught myself looking up dog-food prices the other day. On the top of my review, it shows how many hours I have played of this game. Does it really reflect the thirty hours I've spent scouring maps and watching youtube videos? No. You ♥♥♥♥♥rdly hour-counter. How dare you scoff at my lack of total commitment! I love this game and have recently purchased it for my brother and one of my closest friends.Do I recommend this game? Yes. Only if you want to live.			"

								I have only played 5 and a half hours.This game is an 'Early Access' title.It is visually gorgeous, and far more solid than you are expecting.Let me quickly relate two memorable experiences to you, in the hope you may find they strike a chord with your tastes......I knelt, freezing, behind a tree beside a lake. I knew I was harming my health. And I also knew the longer I crouched there, the shorter my life would ultimately be. I was starving. I was desperate.But the black ghost out on the ice, the shapeless tear in the pristine white and powder blue world, crippled me with fear.The wolf stalked back and forth, paralysing me into a kind of suicide. I needed to raid the ice fishing huts. But I just hid there, enslaved to dread.More than the cold and the starvation, the wolf robbed me of the only fuel I had.It tore my hope from me......I found the corpse at the top of the stairs, slumped with it's head against it's knees. It wasn't the first body I'd found. The wilderness was dotted with half-buried cadavers, partially covered by the scouring blizzards, as if mother nature herself was trying to offer them a small shard of dignity. None of them really spoke to me of anything other than failed last attempts at survival. The need to keep walking. The hope of discovery.But the corpse at the top of the stairs....Why? There was a small amount of food present. There was fuel present. There was a bed, so even death needn't have been so vulgar for him. But...why? He had more time, all he had to do was reach out and grab it.But therein was the answer.He chose to surrender. Hopelessness overcame him. Who knows what memories of family life haunted him? Who can say what grief brought him to his knees and slowed him to a crawl? What bleak misery shrouded his soul as he lowered himself to the ground, closing his eyes for the last time?But I do not know how to feel about this.Do I curse his weakness as I struggle on, lauding the bravery of the ones sealed in the snow face-down like silent witnesses, turning their backs forever on a scene too horrible to contemplate?Or do I honour the bravery of his conclusion, his stark realisation that there is no tomorrow in this dead world, there is no tearful reunion, there is no bright safe dawn?I found the corpse at the top of the stairs.And I also found endless questions in my own soul......Please support the developers by purchasing this game.Thank you for reading.

								This is a fantastic game, and even unfinished, it's well worth your money.  I'm really looking forward to the story mode and more maps, but wandering around figuring how to get from one area to the next just scavenging is a thrilling challenge.  It's already good enough as is to warrant a purchase, everything else the developer is putting out may as well be just some neat extra perks.I have yet to find a gun and can barely defend myself when attacked, and the stress of seeing a wolf off in the distance near a building you need to get into is nothing compared to the paranoia of losing track of it in some nearby woods and then hearing a low growl behind you.  The survival aspects of the game are very simple to manage, just temperature, fatigue, hunger and thirst.  My biggest criticism is the hands off approach with things like foraging for materials.  You go into a menu, set what you want to do, the screen fades out, some time passes in game and you're done.  I'd like it if there was more effort required on the part of the player.  Like if you needed firewood, you had to take your axe, go up to a tree and interact with it to chop it down.  As is the game is somewhat exploitable, since you can go out the door of a chosen shelter, not take a single step, open the menu to harvest firewood, turn around, walk back inside and suffer absolutely no danger from the environment or the elements, which is counter to the whole point of the game.Besides that minor gripe, The Long Dark is shaping up great, and I look forward to continue surviving.

								If you spend very much time on Steam, you will see a LOT of early access games in the store. Unfortunately, most early access games have been long forgotten by the developers and in turn, the players lose their interest in the game. The game never releases, then becomes stuck in an early access purgatory while the players weep in sorrow and the devs get same sex lapdances in dark, diesease ridden taverns, enjoying their stolen fortune. But the developers of The Long Dark care for their game, and keep their goal fresh in their minds. They sincerely want to release their completed game in full quality.I started playing The Long Dark in hopes it would be entertaining enough for me to not lose interest within the first minutes, and I have to say, it was very enjoyable. I dont want to spoil much about the game, but it is a constant fight for survival against many different dangers. the world is filled with tons of places to explore-buildings, trappers shacks, abandont towns, caves, forests and bunkers. You must eat and drink to stay alive, all the while you also have to be wary of the weather and evil creatures that lurk in the wilderness. I call the creatures evil, because they usually attack on sight. Most people complain about this in their reviews, claiming things in the game to be unrealistic. Thats true, wolves dont generally attack without reason, and people usually dont get hungry 2 hrs after eating a 3 pound trout, But isnt this why we all play video games? To escape reality? Its why I do at least. Please try the game. If hardcore survival isnt your thing, you can play it on peaceful mode, where animals dont even attack you. Its lovely.			"

								Authentic Finnish (weelll Canadian if you want to be strict :P) wilderness survival simulator. Looks artistically really nice, everything has this painted look with very gorgeous lighting, and the sound design and its athmosphere is really where the game shines. Basically the objective is to just survive as long as you can using your own wits. The game world is huge with loads of different shelters, and even different zones to explore (I've never gone far enough to actually get into a new map, but you can select different zones to start from once you've played more).Recommended to grab on a sale, seen it go for around five euros and it's very well worth that at least. Best played without knowing anything about it, it's fun to just see how long you can initially survive. Playing on the hardest difficulty after a couple playthroughs and the game feels like a legit challenge so far, anything could go wrong at any point.Regarding early access, it's probably because it's only playable as a sandbox so far. As far as I'm concerned though, the sandbox feels very complete for what it is. There is an actual story mode planned to be added in a future patch.			"

								DISCLAIMER: I REVIEWED THIS GAME WHILE IT WAS IN EARLY ACCESS (it still is), SO THE GAME ISN'T FINISHED YET. There's something about The Long Dark that makes me love it. I don't know if it's the graphics, the gameplay mechanics, or even the survival experience of it all. The graphics have a calm feeling to them, and they're beautiful. When you die, you have to restart the entire game, which is great. You can be a boy or a girl, and you get to pick one of two maps. There are three different survival experiences you can choose from. One is based on survival, and the other is based on exploration. The third option is a mix of the two. You will get eaten by wolves a lot, but that just makes it more fun. This game is true survival in the Canadian wilderness. If you drink unpurified water (yes, you can drink toilet water in the game) then you can get sick. You can also get sick from raw meat, or getting bitten by a wolf. Then, you have to have the right supplies such as bandages and pain killers. The game has a nice crafting element in it as well, which adds to the survival experience. If you're buying this game thinking you'll get something like Rust or Minecraft, you're wrong. This is a unique game, and I can't think of a single other game like it. This is one of my favorite games ever, and I highly reccomend it.10/10 Stars			"

 Early Access Review In the real world, I wouldn't live for more than two days in the wild.However, this game will allow you to feel like a real survivor as you search for food and water, just to live one more day in the harsh conditions of the canadian wilderness.The graphics of this game are amazing and the sounds along side put you in the protagonist's place as you Rambo your way through the night with an old .303 rifle in search of a place to rest safely.Failure to start a fire is unforgiving. You will often find yourself burning through many usless cardboard matches trying very hard just to get a fire to keep warm as you curl into a ball on the ground and wait for death.If however, you do get a fire started and don't freeze to death. You will find yourself wondering around the outdoors looking for food, and nealy pooping yourself every time a wolf attacks you.I rate this game: 10/10 Graphics 9/10 Gameplay 9/10 Ambience 9/10 Overall "

A Year Later in ReviewThis game has grown so much in the last year that it is almost hard to believe it is the same game. I don't speak for it in terms of graphics, it remains to be stlylistic and purposeful in that realm in which I love; but I mean mechanically, the UI, the intenisity, the realism. It no longer feels like a narrative in which I had to craft in my own head as I struggled across these limited maps--it now feels like a world, a whole world of explorable territory in desolation and meager tugs of inspiration. A year has passed and I only recommend this game even stronger. I can not wait for it to be officially released.November 2014 ReviewThis is a breath of survival game fresh air. The art style is pretty great and the loneliness, the atmosphere, the choices for time management in order to survive that pressure you--these are all the things that make simplicity great. I hope it continues down the hyper-realism route. I put a few hours into it and saw everything it has to offer AND enjoyed it. I am only recommending this game for as long as the Devs continue to develop! I am often wary of dropping dimes on early access games. And it takes place in Canada, ey?Play this game and survive long enough. It only takes one stupid mistake. For example:I had found the best cabin ever, it was stocked full of everything I needed, but I needed to eat and drink. I had gotten a bunch of deer and wolf meat. I cooked all of it, but one (ran out of fire).I quickly opened my inventory and twitch clicked to my pile of meat... I had eaten the ONLY uncooked one.My face turned white as it filled with idiocy and immediate regret.I got food poisoning. I had nothing I could do. I tried everything. As the night became day and having tried sleeping it off, I decided to accept my fate and ran outside to find a wolf to fight it to the death. It killed me, but I had the last laugh, because now that wolf had food poisoning as it ate my flesh. hahaha.			"

								This is probably my favorite game ever. If vanilla survival is your thing, then this game is a must-have just for the sandbox mode (and the story mode is looking to be absolutely awesome!) as almost ever game you play promises to be a different experience. While the wildlife does add a certain horror to your gameplay depending on the mode and level of difficulty you play, the coldest killer is quite literally the environment and weather; I've lost many a game being forced out into the wilds in search of food, getting caught out in a blizzard, and unable to find my way back to shelter (which most of the time I am certain is only just out of reach from me, but completely obscured by the snow and fog), feel dread as I watch myself freeze to death. It's FANTASTIC!The graphics, textures and lighting are absolutely gorgeous, which makes my dying not so bad I guess. I believe the craft system can use some improvement with additions (I really wish I could do more with forging for instance), and there are times I wish I could run faster, further, for longer (because I really DO need that rope and that gun, and all of these things! I promise!), the devs present the situation to us realistically and I have to give them props for that.			"

								After more than 300 days Voyageur survival in one game there's still something to explore. Despite having fully mastered the game mechanics, with safehouses packed with fur and survival tools in every map, there are still those near death experiences. Yesterday I fought off one wolf, but he left me injured and unable to wield a weapon. When another one started barking, I started running. I could hear him coming closer, and the moment I grabbed the door he must have bitten me in the behinds - clothing got teared.The maps are awesome, Timberwolf being my favorite. Can't wait for Story Mode, hope it will still have the same sense of loneliness though.			"

It makes you geniunely question your safety in the only places that keep you warm.Great game			"

Oh and one more thing they need to be able to make a touch. A flare gun would be sweet to. how about the forest fires or storms like flooding or falling threw ice and drowning or freezing in it. New maps would be good to or DLC or two.			"

I will deffinaly see how this game progresses in the future over its alpha develpment. I realy hope that it follows a creative path over its development so that the story of the game can be explained giving the player a sence of abandonment and lonelyness which i feel the developers are trying to acheive.

It's got great atmosphere, the graphics are beautiful, and even in alpha it's complete in sandbox mode. There's three maps and they keep adding more. There was just a gun, now there's a gun and a bow. Each update (and they update almost every month) adds intelligent tweaks and often new gameplay mechanics (such as recently, hypothermia). It's a very zen game: fight and kill bears and wolves for their meat and useful hides, deer as well, and rabbits can be trapped. As usual the object of this kind of game is: survive. But I've never seen one so pure about it: no zombies, no horrific mutated Forest style humans, just you and mother nature and the question of who'll win out.			"

								At first, it sounded like a stupid idea: doing pretty ordinary stuff like making fire, gathering food, boiling water didn't sound  too exciting.Then I watched somebody do a Let's Play of this game, got hooked and bought the early access game.It is actually refreshing that for once you don't have to worry about zombies, monsters or other people, the only thing you have to worry about is the enviroment (the weather and the wildlife) and your own capabilities. Making plans about going out in the freezing cold and try to explore the surrounding area I haven't seen yet, made me connect with the in-game character more, than running around in zombieland with an M16. Small things, like gathering enough food for several days by chasing a wolf away from its prey, or getting out of a snowstorm alive which catched me offguard out in the woods felt like a much bigger experience than ones I had in other survival games - even if they were related to supposedly bigger events.Absolutely love it even in its current form (which I think pretty much can be considered full), and would recommend to anybody who likes survival games with a strong atmosphere!

								I enjoy this game very much, but i must say, if you don't play on easy, this game is gritty and challenging and instills real instinctual fear into you, something most games lack. The overall graphical design is beautiful in my opinion. The devs knew they couldn't make everything hyper-realistic, so they went for a cartoon-like design, which, you don't really notice unless you pay close attention to things.   There are some flaws to the game, mine being that you can't improvise weapons, i.e. swing your hatchet at a wolf unless it is already on top of you, and you can't hunt anything until you find a rifle or craft a bow, you can snare rabbits but i haven't bothered with that. I often find myself complaining about how often i feel fatigued so quickly and how a couple hours can't do much to restore yourself in the long run. But i then think that these factors that make me (irl) able to operate on 5 hours of sleep, couldn't be possible in a survival situation, let alone subzero temperatures.   But my favorite aspect of the game is the weight and pressure of risk that goes into nearly every decision you make. Such as, you may plan to go out and get firewood the next day, but tommorrow comes and a blizzard rolls in, and you know that if you dont get firewood you could freeze to death or dehydrate. I once choose to go out and gather a couple logs just to last me, and what seemed like 30 meters away from my home felt like a vast tundra. The weather can make it impossible to see, you can get lost, and wander into a wolf, and what was planned to be a simple run for wood, turns into a nightmare. Starvation leads to some pretty tough risks too. You may decide to go out to fish, and then get snowed in a fishing hut, with no wood and you freeze. Or you may take the chance of attacking a wolf in order to take its fresh deer kill, or even try to kill the wolf.   Every action has consequences, and those consequences can instill legitimate fear into you. But it is nonetheless beautiful and stunning and it brings you somewhat closer to mother nature, despite her relentless effort to kill you. It's gritty and real and I highly recommend it.			"

								This game...This game....This game manages to have the perfect balance between difficulty, and fun that I can just not escape.This game, made by a small Canadian company known as Hinterland, has managed to captivate me to no end.This game, mixed with its rare save-game, slow movement, food shortages, and beutiful graphics allows it to strike a certain ""realism"" with me, even though the wildlife is a tad agressive. (This isn't a bad thing, as it has to do with the story).This game, even in its early alpha stage, is a great by to the gamer who is sick and tired of the bog-standard FPS or RPG, and wants something challenging and realistic, but doesn't want to die every four seconds.This game, is great on just about every level, and should definately get a GOTY release when it finally comes out.

								I shimmy up a rope, wind beating me into the rock face. A blizzard of huge proportions surrounds me. As I walk away from the recently-climbed rope, I gather sticks and things to burn. I find the tail section of a cargo plane, or an airliner, and I start a meager fire. I know this fire will only last for a pitiful 30 minutes before the blizzard's harsh cold consumes it. I boil a cup of coffee, leaving the fire with 7 minutes.As it crackles away, I drink the coffee, and await death, but then... The storm clears, and I'm on a panoramic summit of a large mountain, I can see the wings and engines of the same plane scattered across the land, a wolf chases a deer in the distance. I see a case with a flare gun in it, I take the flare gun, load a flare into it, and fire it, hoping for a rescue.This was only my most recent experience in The Long Dark. It's a very cozy, very immersive game, and survival only adds to the feeling of 'being there.' Buy this game as soon as you can, it will change you.			"

								The Long Dark is a very niche game. So before buying it, you should ask yourself: ""Just what kind of game do I want to play?"". As someone who thoroughly enjoys survival games, and had become rather good at staying alive (at least most of the time), The Long Dark provides new challenges, and a new atmosphere. To me, there are key points to consider when you are contemplating getting The Long Dark. These are the sense of realism, the atmosphere, the art style (for those of you who care about that), and, of course, the challenge.Realism: As far as games go, TLD is very, very realistic. So much so that it can be a double edged sword. Perhaps the main goal of the game is to keep your calories up, while avoiding death via cold, wolves, or even bears. Or falling off of cliffs. As far as food consumption goes, the game is about accurate. You need to consume roughly 2000 or so calories per day to stay healthy. I am currently in a trapper's cabin leaving snares out for rabbits, because I used all of my ammo for my rifle, and lost my only arrows for my bow. The constant need for food is a pressing matter, and realistically done. The same applies to the cold. The cold itself will make you cold if you're unprepared (not wearing adequate clothing), but the wind will expedite the process. What was interesting to me, is that I found that by standing by a wall of other surface while the wind was blowing (on the other side), it actually created a wind shield. This can become very important for when you need to build a fire. You can't do so in the middle of a gale of wind. The realism as far as mechanics go is really solid. However, then there is the other side of it. Playing TLD is not a rapid paced game most of the time. You often choose to walk to avoid burning necessary calories, you will often have to stop traveling and find shelter when a blizzard comes in, and avoiding the hostile wildlife is often better than fighting, as things can go wrong really fast. What you end up with, is a very realistic experience. This is a battle against the elements, not tangible foes. As such, the game can sometimes feel like work. It can feel slow and lonely. You have to be ENTIRELY self-driven. If you are the type of person that likes this level of realism (like me), then you will likely enjoy this aspect of the game. If you are the type of person that prefers faster paced games, then TLD may not be your cup of tea.Atmosphere: The atmosphere of TLD is phenomenal. From the sound of the wind, to the voice actor's brilliant work, to the gradual lighting of a sunrise or sunset, TLD have a fantastic atmosphere. I first really noticed during a blizzard in the game. I had gone inside of a camp ground cabin to avoid the cold. As I stood there, I could hear the wind raging outside, the house creaking under the wind, and my character's labored breathing (I had sprinted to the cabin). The general lack of background noise is often a boon as well. It is just you, surviving-not thriving, but surviving-in the middle of nature. When the background music occasionally surfaces, it only adds to the feeling of cold and isolation. The atmosphere is a strongpoint for TLD.Art Style: TLD uses a paint-esc art style (I'm not sure what you would name it). It is consistent, and achieves a good effect. Rather than focus on core realism, the art style comes across as realistic, without having to be as graphically intense. If you truly care about the art style though, watch a video rather than read a review :PChallenge: The challenge is always there in TLD. Whether it's food, warmth, or safety, you will unlikely become a Fat-cat while surviving. Thanks to a sort of leveling system for various skills, such as fire-starting of carcass harvesting, your character will gradually get better at survival skills. This is a boon. There is also a wound and sickness system to watch out for, and bleeding to death or getting mauled by a wolf sucks. My one complaint, however, lies with the perishability of food and items. Things spoil in TLD. This normally wouldn't be an issue. However, when you pick up matches, canned food, or even a freaking sardine can, you would expect those to last for a dang good long while. Instead, as if your character has some kind of entropic aura, everything you touch (aside from tools) gradually goes bad. I found this out when I examined my canned food stockpile and it was all going close to rancid. Even lighter fluid goes bad. You can maintain certain tools, light a lantern, a hatchet, a gun, etc. But your means of doing so are limited, and I am sure that once my magnifying glass, fire striker, and matches go bad (because in this game a magnifying glass breaks via using it), I will end up shivering in a shack and eating raw rabbit meat, as I fist fight wolves for the rabbit's intestines. It's not a pretty picture.All in all, The Long Dark is a fantastic survival experience that I would strongly recommend. If you are willing to overlook the attrition rate of items, it will make for a wonderfully good time.Pros: - Great atmosphere - Very realistic - ChallengingCons: - Things spoil that shouldn't (at least not as quickly as they do) - There is not yet any true long-term sustainability (as far as I am aware)I would give it a 9.5/10			"

								This game is an interesting one. Despite the plethora of first person survival games on Steam, and everywhere else to be honest, this game changes the formula. While most games might have a focus on crafting and an overall threat of zombies and alike, this game takes the divergent path. The crafting system is somewhat muted and can be played entirely without, and the only real threat is the elements. While there are prowling bears and stalking wolves among the vast frozen wastelands, they are easily scared off with a flare or a torch, or even a gun. The real enemy is nature itself, as the player is made to survive the cold, harsh winds, freak blizzards and minimal shelter. The gameplay essentially breaks down to traversing the areas looking for shelter, food, water, and other essentials in order to keep death away for another day. The tricky part about this is that in each area the food and water are minmal enough to make it so players feel the need to move on in order to survive. While one can subsist on melted snow and the animals of the area, eventually either boredom or lack of rescources will cause the player to move on. This is where I find the one real problem I have with the game. Because of the need for exploration, I found myself often moving through areas quickly in order to find more useful materials. This is good for the first few hours because I was always seeing something new. Then I died, and respawned. The problem now was I had to traverse the same landscape I had. This wasn't a major problem because the game is well varied in each area. There was certainly never a moment where I could become complacent, because the game doesn't let you. The moment you think you have the game down, it decides to rain the all singing all dancing♥♥♥♥♥♥show of this games brutality upon you. Allow me to demonstrate: I was backed into a corner with a flare in front of me and a rifle in my hand, two bullets to my name. There were, conveniently, two wolves ahead of me. The ultimate gaming challenge of ""but I might need it later"" was on my mind so I hadn't fired. Then my flare died, and the wolves began inching towards me. As I fired my first shot, the other wolf broke into a sprint. I fired again and missed. Now I was fighting off a wolf with my knife and barely got it off me in time to survive. I then walked back to my cabin with a scrap of clothing still intact and blurred vision, staggering through the snow. About half a mile later I collapsed, and faded into ""the long dark"". This game is wonderful. The graphic style hides the low budget well and the sandbox nature meant I never felt I was retreading the same path. The surprising depth of this game kept me pushing forward, and so I would give this game a 9/10.			"

I am playing on linux and with the Intel 4400 it is working very well.First I played on the easiest level to learn basic concepts, now I am playing on the medium level where the wolfes can attack you.I learned that everything has consequence, If you miss something, later it can be very painfull. Always you should make plan, what is the next step.Maybe modding and multiplayer support could increase the gaming experience but atm this game is 10/10 for me.			"

								Review: Play the hardest mode on your first run (just what I did) to get an idea of how brutal this game is. I survived for under 3 minutes and then got mauled by a wolf. This game is also the most realistic survival game out there that I could find believe it or not. No base building, no no no, you gotta make-do with the crap that's already there. It is an amazing experience too.My story/experience with the game: On the hardest difficulty, I got to a point where i was missing two things. Food and heat. I needed tinder, but going outside to retrieve some was suicide. I'd get frostbite and die, probably not even returning with proper tinder, as it wasn't too common where i was sheltered at. I also needed food, but i had to go outside for that too. I was too cold to risk finding another settlement in an attempt to find nourishment there (which may not even be there anyways). I finally got to the point where I couldn't wait any longer, and ventured outside. About a minute after attempting to gather tinder (and failing) I saw a deer get murdered by a wolf. I slowly crawled up the slope it had been slain on and the wolf was gnawing on the carcass. I waited around ten minutes for the thing to mosey off, but it didn't. So i lit my only flare and tossed it at the beast. It ran and I went to grab some meat off the carcass, which would've taken around an hour. I tried to light a fire, but alas, still missing the materials to do such. So I simply took the risk and began harvesting meat. I stopped in the middle of it because I had just realized if I kept going I would freeze to death. I don't know how long I was going at it, but when I stood up I swear I couldn't even feel my legs. I saw my shelter and began to stumble down the hill towards it. It was about 75 feet away, but it felt like a kilometer having to drag myself to it. I kept stumbling backwards, left and right and falling over uncontrollably. By the time I made it to the door I couldn't feel anything, yet I knew it was all over. I knew my time was coming very soon. I got up to open the door, but stumbled backwards, fell over to my right, and struggled to even grip the knob correctly before getting in, taking another minute away from my shortened time left. I finally got in, pulled out my lantern, and set it up on a bench in hopes that it would warm the room enough to help me recover. I struggled to reach the fireplace, and opened it. I was going to attempt to start a fire, but then i remembered I had no tinder. I scrambled around for one last option, and finally thought to make a torch. I struggled to piece it together, but once I did, I squatted in a corner and hoped that the lord would help me or a miracle would happen, because I didn't think much else could save me now. I still kept getting colder and colder, and at that moment I thought ""No, this can't be the end, I can't die in the middle of nowhere in some cabin! I need to find help and I need to get back home! What about my family?? I've got to do something!!!"" and something I did. I threw myself around the tiny shack furiously, in a fit of rage and in hopes of generating some warmth. I thrashed around inside the building for like fifteen (realtime) minutes, before the world began to start fading in and out of darkness. I finally calmed down, got back into my corner, and looked around the room. I didn't think much. The only thing I could do at that point was reflect on my life. I shed a tear (an actual tear) as I thought about all of the things I could of done better. I regretted so much. I wished I would've paid more attention to my children, wished I would've respected them more, and most of all, wished I would've been able to give a final ""goodbye""...The light of the room slowly faded into darkness, and the only thing I could see for a solid thirty seconds was the fire emitting from my torch. Everything became calm, and I started to feel peace flushing through my veins. I stared at the fire...It was...pretty...the light guided me....and I couldn't look away....""You faded into the long dark...""9/10 would die tragically in the wilderness and shed man-tears again.

								At this point I'm just going to paste a response I wrote to why someone should get this game versus another game I won't mention. I just left in the part talking about this game so far.The Long Dark - Hell of a fun game right from the start...graphics are different that what most of us are used to...but I like them; they seem to work with the feel of the game very well. This game is much bigger than I first thought after playing for a few days. There are several zones... there is a wiki about them somewhere...ought to have a look... plus maps online. The concept is excellent and it delivers and you learn that more and more as the game continues...with weight of objects playing a real role, temperature playing a real role, item durability playing a real role, needing to eat and drink cooked and fresh food and water very important. I could go on and on about the good things they have done in this game. The modes are great...just want to explore and not get attacked by wildlife? There is a mode for that. You also need to be careful how you travel you can sprain your ankle, wrist, break something or just flat out die if you don't travel right. Lucky for players there are bandages, antibiotocs, and antiseptics.....bad enough injury...you will also need to sleep...very cool.A ton of detail to player experience...very impressive. My one ♥♥♥♥♥? You can't save games incase you screw up....I've never been a fan of that...you die...you lose it all and start over. Took me two days to come back because I was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off when I found out. I hate that mechanic and think even a 'noob' mode ought to be made with saves or maybe if you fall and break a leg you always walk slower, maybe if you get too cold you wake up with a lung problem that causes you to get winded faster...etc... until you essentially can't play anymore because your character can't do much... I don't know I think that would be more fun than....start over after a ton of hours of collecting only to fall 10 feet to your death....in the snow...anyway..Yeah, it's a great game besides the perma death thing being crammed down your throat...in every game I've played like that I've never played again after my first death...except this one. That says something about this game. It is an exceptional game imo at this point...and with the detail to which the devs have paid attention to the game I only expect it to get better.---- I will add....best value for the dollar I've had in a long time...got it on sale a while back for around $10 I think... easily worth full price imo.

								After 2 hours of gameplay and as of 28/09/2014I have only been playing this game for a few hours now but i have to say it is amazing, at first i thought it was just a survival exploration game but after awile i found out its actually a survival game with intense beauty realism as well as total terror. When you first enter the game you choose wether you want to be a man or a woman (simple but good) you spawn (or should i say crash) in a random area (usually a cave) and are given some basic supplies to survive, on my first spawn i started near a large lake, i looted the cabins around it and found nothing much (just alot of beef jerky and canned peaches) i then continued along a railway track untill i found a dam i, i decided to enter to see what there was and to get away from the snowstorm that had started outside, inside i could see nothing but darkness, i decided to light a match and start looting. However as i was searching through old lockers i heard the sound of foot steps behind me, just as i turn around my match burned out. As i scaned the room i saw two piercing green eyes staring at me, i froze with terror but before i knew it i had a wolf on top of me riping my through out.Yeah this game is great, you can tell its in development as the world isnt all that big and there are alot of features missing that need to be added (i.e. a larger map, snow shelters, fishing, and choping trees down) but all in all this game is great. Just buy it already.			"

								THANKYOU HINTERLAND!!To gamers looking for a simple, beautiful, yet very intense, wilderness survival game.. this is it!The long dark is really an amazing game. It is maybe the first game I have ever played that focuses on the true ""monsters"" in the world. Weather, predators, hunger, thirst, disease.!!  no ALIENS! besides the player ;)The people who are being so negative may be just be pissy bc they die so quickly and get bent out of shape, while realizing surviving is not easy. And for those who think this is another minecraft/rust.. ha, try playing it and let us know what u think then.. You will probably not understand why sleeping out in the cold wind, with no food/water killed you :)Yes, some things in the ALPHA are not perfect, duh people. And yea, some mechanics of the game are simply not realistic(metal tools easily breaking). But!, They are trying to build a dynamic that forces you to make smart decisions with your tools, so breaking creates issues that you can't get with an infinite tool. ""Should I use this knife to get the meat from this deer? If I do I lose the knife but get food.. or I can eat my last jar of beans and try and save the knife"".. its beautiful that they make you think this way..survival.This is an alpha game. Some of you people are sooo rude, I just dont get you.   Instead, Tell the devs that you would love to see ""knives becoming too dull, instead of breaking"" 'This would burn energy/resources to sharpen"" etc. ""CONSTRUCTIVE""!!!   Instead you guys give a do not buy review bc you didn't get your perfect way.I have been searching and playing survival games endlessly for years. Some have great attributes while lacking in other ways. The Long Dark is one of the 1st to focus on simulating the simple horrors of survival. So why don't you support them, we can show off to other devs or even just Hinterland, that it's ok to have a game without MONSTERS every once in a while.Beautiful game! Makes you think like a survivor in a cold wilderness!My recommendations,-Dulling of knife and axe, instead of breaking. Makes knife worthless or not worth the calories to cut for an hour :)-Add sharpening items, etc-Possibly remove dead bodies and just have scattered loot, so people can't complain that its unrealistic.(unless its apart of story later)Oh and to all you rude, whinnies..  please link me to better wilderness survival games/sims that are actually this hard.. or go make your own so I can play them			"

								I've got 13 hours.In those 13 hours, I have to keep warm, fill my belly with enough nutrition, avoid the wild beasts, and work on my equipment.Oh, what's this? Someone left a rifle bullet! ""That will come in handy!""Damn! A blizzard just started! No way can I go outside, not in my torn jeans and skiing jacket... If only I remembered where I shot the wolf yesterday... But the wind was blowing and I ran towards my safehouse... Once the storm passes, I really have to find the wolf carcass, get its hide and try to make a coat from it.Damn, only 8 hours of daylight left, and I still haven't eaten anything today...=========================The Long Dark is a very stable game, no crashes or graphical glitches whatsoever. The number of locations is solid and offers 100+ hours of exploratory fun.  Locations are plastically hand-crafted and filled with useful landmarks - you will get lost from time to time, but after a while, you'll remember the easy to miss path that begins directly behind the fallen tree, or the two collided cars.For hard-core challenge, try to make your own maps based on landmarks; otherwise, download the detailed maps available in the Guides portion of Steam community hub.There's a reasonable variety of plants and wild-life: cat-tails, mushrooms, rose-hips, trouts, bass, rabbits, deers, wolves and bears.The animals act in a way that differs from real-life, which is explained by the game lore. Depending on your difficulty level, you can either walk carelessly among the animals, or you need to be very careful, maintain a supply of torches and practice your hunting skills.An important component of this game is the crafting of equipment and clothing; this part is still being overhauled [early access], and new ""recipes"" are being added.My first character survived for 94 days before tragically dying, during which time he suffered repeat injuries, got mauled by 4 different bears, fell into water, got food poisoning... ... but at the same time managed to visit all the iconic locations, locate all parts of the crashed airplane, make a complete set of animal hide clothing and an animal bedroll, and had over 100 kilograms of cooked meat stashed around the world at key safehouses for repeat visits. It was a satisfying struggle for survival.Highly recommended!			"

								Promising game, definitely check it out.Keep in mind that the game is STILL IN ALPHA, so you should look at this review as constructive feedbackand I'm not trying to tear down the game.They still have a lot of polishing to do texture wise, but the overall color scheme and atmosphere is very nice.Same for game mechanics, I see where they are going for, but they have some work to do. It's not broke or anything, it's a fun game, but it can become a little dull and repetitive.Some things that annoy me:- you can't jump- you can't save -> permadeath, I know this is part of the mechanic, but i would like it better if I can save in some way.- limited weapons, also a hunting knife or axe can't be used as a weapon for some reason- no AI survivers (hostile or friendly)- limited wildlife- characters look horrible (like Charlie Brooker once described someone: the back of a spoon with a face drawn on to it)I look forward to an update!

								The Long Dark - RECOMMENDEDThis one is a breath of fresh air for survival / scavenging games.  Where the popular genre is with zombies or lots of weapons, the beauty of this one is its simpliscity:  You versus Nature.You are left with a sense of fear for well being.  The unease felt as repercussions begining to roll in on prior decisions made.Why did I roam the forest...at night...in a blizzard...with poor clothing...and no food supplies...when any single one of these  in isolation can mean ""the long dark"" for you.Of particular note are the sunsets.  Yes...  In honesty, its like an oil painting each evening on Mystery Lake :)19 hours in....have survived 50 days, not thinking it would be possible.  Enjoyed every minute, and still going.  Had to google how to save game...when you sleep, it creates a save game where you can then logoff after waking.  And then resume game next time you login.GRIM			"

								short: It's The Good♥♥♥♥♥♥My Dudes (story mode isn't out yet but the sandbox is neat as heck)long: A very interesting take on the survival early-access genre that's been sweeping across Steam the last few years, swapping out a focus on crafting and combat for a style that focuses more on resource management and general survival skills. With a unique setting that forces the player to be constantly planning ahead, you're very rarely on easy ground. Even something as simple as trying to get firewood needs to be thought through, with exposure to the harsh sub-arctic elements being a constant drain on your abilities, not helped by the near constant presence of wolves. While this becomes less of a factor later on, as the difficulty plateaus and players become complacent in their means and abilities (a problem with open-world survival games as a genre), the presence of permadeath and the ease that one mistakes slides into many mistakes can keep players on their toes even as their time in the sandbox enters in-game weeks. The tense and desolate atmosphere helps accomplish this as well, with a mostly silent soundtrack that focuses more on the sounds of the world around you. Borrowing from games such as Minecraft, the music kicks in at random and for short bursts, which can accentuate an otherwise normal in-game moment. When the ambience isn't being drowned out by the sounds of a crackling campfire or the harsh winds of a blizzard, it helps ground the player as a solitary figure inside of a vast landscape. basically it's a very neat experience and while it's very much a Survival Game, it manages to nail the atmosphere and setting in a way that sets it apart from the crowd. combined with gameplay mechanics that work semi-realisticly (it's still very gamey, what ya gonna do) and maintain an appropriate level of stress on your resources, it takes the Survival genre places I'm surprised nobody had executed this well before.

								The Long Dark is a game. It's a game about survival against Mother Nature. It's not DayZ. It's not Minecraft, Rust, The Forest, or any other survival game. This is The Long Dark.When I came to this game's page, I saw the reviews as overwhelmingly positive. So, of course, I had to check this game out. I bought, downloaded it, and then booted it up. Long story short: The Long Dark is a very, very immersive game. The sound and music are spot on. The art style is beautiful, as well.Buy this. You won't regret it.			"

								This game is so so so good. It says early access, but the sandbox plays so smooth it feels like a finished product. I've only found one or two bugs, which is more than can be said for a lot of finished games (*cough* bethesda *cough*). And they're also putting out a new story mode??? And new features for the sandbox?????? Updates come slowly but that's because they're focusing on quality, not deadlines. I prefer to stay on pilgrim (aka weenie) mode in sandbox, but the challenges also seem great! The graphics are stylistic and gorgeous and complement the gameplay well. I can't recommend this game enough and I'm super excited for the updates still on the studio's roadmap! I don't care how long it takes, the fully finished game will be a masterpiece.EDIT: I've got more play time than it looks like, I just haven't been able to connect to the internet with my gaming PC for the past month because of router troubles >.<			"

								PRO: * Good atmosphere and environment. * Big congrats to the artists for implementing their own style so beautifully.* Tension is achieved in the harder difficulty settings thanks to angry bears and perma-death. CON:* Game is mainly a scavenger hunt.. which seems regressive to me in terms of the development of video games in general.* No base building is a gaping hole in the content of a survival game. * The game is lacking in combat options and is limited in terms of strategic gameplay. * Easy mode is boring as heck.* Currently no multiplayer.Radial menu added for immersion?? Please.... nothing to do with XBOX controllers? They're creating a console version of an unfinished game which delays progress on the original steam version that people paid for and are so patiently waiting for. That's the main reason for a thumbs down.			"

								Its a good game but i think you should be able to get a bow and arrow or be able to make one . All so how come you can't defend your self with the hunting knife when attack that would be cool , also  i would love to see more ways to die and  live by the adding of new stuff to make and find.  Oh and one more thing they need to be able to make a touch. A flare gun would be sweet to. how about the forest fires or storms like flooding or falling threw ice and drowning or freezing in it. New maps would be good to or DLC or two.			"

								This is a really interesting game, with hardcore survival mechanics that work extremely well. This is probably the best survival game since the likes of The Unreal World and Deus. And no zombies! (although someone will probably mod them in at some point) Be warned though that at this stage of the Alpha, the game is almost unplayably difficult. If you do buy the game at this stage, be warned that you will die a lot, and very quickly. The gamemap is sparse - I've died several times simply because I couldn't find any shelter or resources. It also needs plenty of balancing, crafting options, and even things like a map before it will be more playable. The core mechanics are sound however, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this game develops.Edit: I had decided to explore, looking for a gun, or another source of food. I'd ransacked the cabins on the lake, and my supplies were low. I was in a small clearing late in the afternoon when the wind picked up. Fast. I was cold, tired, hungry. Unable to move fast, the sun was setting, and it was getting colder. I marched through the snow, desperately looking for shelter. The only thing available was a small shack, mostly destroyd, only two walls standing, with a pot bellied stove in the surviving corner. It would have to do. I spent the next few hours scavaging wood from the structure to feed the fire, and trying to get some rest, desperately huddled in the corner with  the slight warmth barely enough to stay alive. Finally I decided to risk it - the storm wasn't breaking, and I couldn't find any more wood for the fire. I packed up, and went out into the storm. It was a long trek, I wasn't sure of the direction in the dark, I had to find real shelter. Finally, luckily I found my way back to something I recognised - a clearing that looked familiar. Hope rising, I followed it back, and sure enough, the camp cabin appeared out of the darkness. I had survived another night. Emergent gameplay ftw.After a few hours of playing, I've got to say I'm more and more impressed. The lack of a map - something I thought was a huge flaw is actually a big plus: This is the first time in a long time I've actually had to learn a map, rather than just glance at a minimap, or a little arrow on the screen pointing me where to go. It's extremely satisfying, and a cool throwback to games like Morrowind. I hope that when a map is implemented it doesn't have the 'You are here' icon most games have now. The game is not actually as difficult as I first thought - just has a steep learning curve, and, as said before, is unforgiving to mistakes. Just remember that the biggest killer is the cold - you can survive hunger, thirst, and tiredness for quite a while, but cold is something that will get you quick. Other features - brilliant voice acting and sound design - the sound of wind whistling when you're in shelter is the most realistic I've ever heard and makes me feel cold hearing it. Graphics are stylistic similar to Borderlands - a good choice as it doesn't try to be photorealistic which would obviously balloon the budget and system requirements, but it also makes buildings a little hard to spot against the rocks - maybe higher contrast colour would be better for buildings?Ultimately my opinion hasn't changed that this has the makings of a great game. You'll have to click into a more 'old-school' style of gameplay as the game doesn't hold your hand, but honestly, that's a breath of fresh air.			"

Early Access Review
								Survival-Crafting Alpha releases seem to be a dime-a-dozen on Steam lately, so does The Long Dark stand itself apart?(TL;DR? We talk about the game and all of its features and shortcomings HERE on Steampunks) (Coming soon)	Though the story mode is the main feature promised once the game exits Early Access, we’re given a taste of the scenario that lands you in the game’s events. You’re a solo bush pilot, navigating his or her way over the Great White North when a geomagnetic disaster devastates the landscape, enrages the wildlife, and knocks your plane out of the sky. It’s a simple but effective setup that pits you in the classic man vs. wild conflict in a terrain so compelling that we’re honestly surprised we haven’t seen more often in the genre. There hasn’t been much to go on, but it’s obvious that the episodic narrative on the horizon will be a warm welcome. For now, there’s a lot of satisfaction to be found in creating your own stories of survival in Sandbox Mode.There are distinct exploration styles that players can adapt and combine in order to forge their path. Most are likely to spend the bulk of their early playtime scavenging through abandoned settlements for food and supplies while simultaneously beholding the sights and sounds. This type of point-and-click-while-smelling-the-roses playstyle is very reminiscent of Gone Home, though here players are piecing together what objects are most valuable to their longevity rather than uncovering a core narrative. The potential for that type of story progression to fuse into the existing gameplay is certainly viable once the game is complete.Hunting and fishing become available once you’ve persevered long enough and found the materials necessary, though sometimes this can occur from simple luck of the draw. The game places higher emphasis on discovering treasures and keeping the key items in your inventory in top repair after you’ve found them, rather than gathering loads of materials and crafting towards better equipment over time. That isn’t to say there aren’t craftables, but for now these remain as mostly clothing items to keep you warm, rather than tools such as improved firearms, hunting knives, or hatchets. As it stands in the current build, these tools need to be found in the randomly generated mix of items spread throughout the map. It’s once these items are collected that the game starts to really switch gears, and will become the preferred playstyle for most. Explorers eventually become well equipped with a hunting rifle, fishing tackle, flares, and other necessities. There’s a certain pride to experience in building yourself up to be a self-sufficient hunter. Evolving from vulnerability and feeding off scraps to feeling like a legitimate threat to the wild carries a big payoff. Most of all, it quickly becomes the most likely way to keep your stomach filled.The game measures your survival in almost every imaginable way. Hunger, thirst, cold, and fatigue can all be observed from the in-game quick menu, and are rapidly and appropriately impacted by your decisions. A separate calorie counter keeps track of the energy left in your body, meaning you can intake low-nutrition food items to spike your blood-sugar, but these won’t hold you over for the long haul. Unsafe water sources need to be disinfected through the use of collected additive pellets or boiling, or their consumption comes with the risk of infection. First aid supplies can be found and created in order to tend to these ailments and keep up your condition, complete with medication, bandages, antiseptic, and painkillers. Your warmth is affected by the quality of the clothing articles you find and their condition, meaning you’ll be rewarded with being able to spend more time in the great outdoors once you find and sew up some proper winter gear. This becomes vital since actions such as fishing and foraging for wood are time-lapsed, with the effects taking place on your person after the fact.When these features all come together, keeping every part of your well-being in check derives a legitimate sense of desperation. Almost every action you take is based on the necessity of the situation. It’s a real accomplishment for an Alpha development, and it manages to do so without a single zombie. Other than the need for a graphical user interface regarding your player’s clothing, the only problem we found in all of this was the somewhat ghastly strength of the game’s only aggressive mob, the wolves. More often than not you’ll find your play-through at the mercy of their jaws, even if that’s only because you had to make a risky move to go find more supplies. They’re the dreaded creatures that they should be given the context, but it still feels disappointing to have a good run come to a sudden conclusion from a blindside attack. The non-optional permanent death may sour some to the experience, especially in this respect, but it feels necessary in creating the true survival immersion that these other features go so far to create. Separate difficulty settings allow for play with more or less punishing hazards, giving you the freedom to choose if you want more of an adventure experience.The finely crafted exploration extends its way into the game’s artwork as well. The visuals are unmistakably Canadian in a way that has to be seen in order to be given proper justice. The distinct palette combined with the carefully placed polygonal edges and etched shapes make you feel like you’re exploring a genuine piece of Inuit artwork. Fine tunings like the rhythmic puff of breath in front of your face or the feel of your stride stiffen as you enter thicker snow constantly remind you of the harsh nature of the surrounding climate. Daylight casts through the windows of the cabins in which you seek refuge, revealing specks of dust flickering in the sun. Some of these dwellings even proudly carry their national flag above their front door. The attention to details like these help cement the feeling that you’re stranded in the real Canadian north instead of a powdered sandbox filled with things to keep you busy. Some individual textures themselves may not exactly amaze anyone, especially the graphic-savvy, but they still make for endearing log cabin interiors, and beautifully ominous outdoor scenes. Animations with many objects leave a lot to the imagination, mostly due to the lack of hands or any viewable body part. Certain interactions such as lighting fires and reloading rifles could really benefit from this extra attention, but omissions like these can be forgiven due to its Early Access status.The choice of music implementation is scarce and careful. Sparse atmospheric tones are brought in occasionally as you stomp around or discover a new locale, highlighting the experience. When the entire recipe is brought together it can make for some remarkable cinematic endeavors despite not yet having any real narrative backbone.The Long Dark is certainly a refreshing treat after a recent sea of mediocrity overtaking the survival/crafting genre. As this brand of game continues to grow, we can only hope that more titles take inspiration from this piece and create finely-honed experiences of realism that remain faithful to existing real-world culture.SCORE : 8.8/10			"

								this game have a charm on his own, shines from the rest of early access games...but not too much.the developers seems to really interest on the ip they are bulding in so the effort of pulling up every hotfix and update is really a thing.but as always the way im pointing out seems to be too good to be true? indeed it has it own flaws but still is somewhat refreshing from the tired ol' rutine of early access ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"".let's breakdown a bit the game, positive points:-the core game is already present...so there are not broken promises to finally add a ""master update that fixes the mess"" because they are selling you almost the finished product.-like i said shines from the rest, the plot is simple you crashed on an airplane on some part of canada and you need to survive, but can you survive from the stalking eyes of the wildlife?so there is no creppy uncle♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥chasing you or zombies epidemic on the plot.-the atmosphere..huh good one, you really feel desolated on that white nightmare but at the same time i found the game quite relaxing, after a long day of work playing a few minutes does the job.-The cons of the game:-lacks of content (such as items) but still they have been adding a few since i brough it.-after some period of time you will eventually have everything needed to survive and makes it easier and somewhat frustrating and repetitive, you reached to the maximum that the game have to offer. -it's sold as a true sandbox experience and indeed is but the maps(is divided on several ones but all are conected) are somewhat short, but the maps are full of details and give the proper immersion to the game.well that's so far my experience with the game if you like challenges this game may be suitable to you, surviving is challenging and fun.but as of mayority of sandbox survival games after certain point you reach a peak where no longer is needed to do certain stuff, but here you always need to do something to survive but gets boring and repetitive.8/10.good game, worth the price of the 20 bucks. dont hesitate it take it now!

								I was unsure at first because I'm not 100% into survival games, due to the fact I always die. but I decided this one looked worth a try atleast. Was glad there was a gamemode where I wouldn't be attacked by animals, I also liked the fact it was easy to get into and I am sure in the days to come I will playing a lot of this game. Looking very optimistic to future development, wishing for co-op one day too. Only one negative though, the voices get really repetative after a while, but this is nothing compared to how awesome the game is!			"

								short: It's The Good♥♥♥♥♥♥My Dudes (story mode isn't out yet but the sandbox is neat as heck)long: A very interesting take on the survival early-access genre that's been sweeping across Steam the last few years, swapping out a focus on crafting and combat for a style that focuses more on resource management and general survival skills. With a unique setting that forces the player to be constantly planning ahead, you're very rarely on easy ground. Even something as simple as trying to get firewood needs to be thought through, with exposure to the harsh sub-arctic elements being a constant drain on your abilities, not helped by the near constant presence of wolves. While this becomes less of a factor later on, as the difficulty plateaus and players become complacent in their means and abilities (a problem with open-world survival games as a genre), the presence of permadeath and the ease that one mistakes slides into many mistakes can keep players on their toes even as their time in the sandbox enters in-game weeks. The tense and desolate atmosphere helps accomplish this as well, with a mostly silent soundtrack that focuses more on the sounds of the world around you. Borrowing from games such as Minecraft, the music kicks in at random and for short bursts, which can accentuate an otherwise normal in-game moment. When the ambience isn't being drowned out by the sounds of a crackling campfire or the harsh winds of a blizzard, it helps ground the player as a solitary figure inside of a vast landscape. basically it's a very neat experience and while it's very much a Survival Game, it manages to nail the atmosphere and setting in a way that sets it apart from the crowd. combined with gameplay mechanics that work semi-realisticly (it's still very gamey, what ya gonna do) and maintain an appropriate level of stress on your resources, it takes the Survival genre places I'm surprised nobody had executed this well before.

								THANKYOU HINTERLAND!!To gamers looking for a simple, beautiful, yet very intense, wilderness survival game.. this is it!The long dark is really an amazing game. It is maybe the first game I have ever played that focuses on the true ""monsters"" in the world. Weather, predators, hunger, thirst, disease.!!  no ALIENS! besides the player ;)The people who are being so negative may be just be pissy bc they die so quickly and get bent out of shape, while realizing surviving is not easy. And for those who think this is another minecraft/rust.. ha, try playing it and let us know what u think then.. You will probably not understand why sleeping out in the cold wind, with no food/water killed you :)Yes, some things in the ALPHA are not perfect, duh people. And yea, some mechanics of the game are simply not realistic(metal tools easily breaking). But!, They are trying to build a dynamic that forces you to make smart decisions with your tools, so breaking creates issues that you can't get with an infinite tool. ""Should I use this knife to get the meat from this deer? If I do I lose the knife but get food.. or I can eat my last jar of beans and try and save the knife"".. its beautiful that they make you think this way..survival.This is an alpha game. Some of you people are sooo rude, I just dont get you.   Instead, Tell the devs that you would love to see ""knives becoming too dull, instead of breaking"" 'This would burn energy/resources to sharpen"" etc. ""CONSTRUCTIVE""!!!   Instead you guys give a do not buy review bc you didn't get your perfect way.I have been searching and playing survival games endlessly for years. Some have great attributes while lacking in other ways. The Long Dark is one of the 1st to focus on simulating the simple horrors of survival. So why don't you support them, we can show off to other devs or even just Hinterland, that it's ok to have a game without MONSTERS every once in a while.Beautiful game! Makes you think like a survivor in a cold wilderness!My recommendations,-Dulling of knife and axe, instead of breaking. Makes knife worthless or not worth the calories to cut for an hour :)-Add sharpening items, etc-Possibly remove dead bodies and just have scattered loot, so people can't complain that its unrealistic.(unless its apart of story later)Oh and to all you rude, whinnies..  please link me to better wilderness survival games/sims that are actually this hard.. or go make your own so I can play them			"

								The Long Dark - RECOMMENDEDThis one is a breath of fresh air for survival / scavenging games.  Where the popular genre is with zombies or lots of weapons, the beauty of this one is its simpliscity:  You versus Nature.You are left with a sense of fear for well being.  The unease felt as repercussions begining to roll in on prior decisions made.Why did I roam the forest...at night...in a blizzard...with poor clothing...and no food supplies...when any single one of these  in isolation can mean ""the long dark"" for you.Of particular note are the sunsets.  Yes...  In honesty, its like an oil painting each evening on Mystery Lake :)19 hours in....have survived 50 days, not thinking it would be possible.  Enjoyed every minute, and still going.  Had to google how to save game...when you sleep, it creates a save game where you can then logoff after waking.  And then resume game next time you login.GRIM			"

								The Long Dark has a feel to it that I've never experienced in any other game, hence making it a bit difficult to define. Hinterland Studios has done an excellent job creating an open sandbox world in the current state of the alpha with the perfect crisp winter chill to it, forcing the player to do the best inventory management and vitals tracking they can. Loot, but don't loot too much. Stay fed and stay hydrated. Keep warm and don't freeze. Hunt for your next meal, and try not to die. Keep exploring but know when it's time to call it a night. What'll lead to your inevitable demise will likely be completely unexpected. I really look forward to what Hinterland's got around the corner. I recommend this game wholeheartedly.P.S. watch out for Fluffy.			"

								This is a wonderful game. I think that a lot of other survival games have attempted to pave a road, so to speak, and fallen a bit short. Whether they happen to be uninspired, or downright cliché. (Don't worry, I love zombie games as much as the next nerd, they just get a tad tiresome after the 45th version). I'd say this game already has a lot going for it, despite it being early access.The pros are as follows:   1) A weight system, forcing a realistic management of your supplies and how much you carry  2) A crafting system that includes human error, meaning sometimes your character might actually fail to craft items  3) The ability to recycle old tools, clothing, and what have you into materials for repairing your current gear I'd say this game is a 9/10 in my book, I honestly cannot wait for a story line to go along with the already beautiful landscape that has been developed.

								I awoke in a mountain passage, it was freezing and I needed to find help or shelter as quickly as possible. I headed down the pass, taking my chances. I luckily came across a camping office. I spotted wolves in the distance so I made haste towards the door. Inside, the air was stale, but warm. I searched through the dusty office taking everything and anything I could find.After getting warm and some rest, I decided to head out again, due to my creeping thirst. I spotted a derailed box car in the distance, already beginning to freeze I headed over and investigated. Inside was Corey the corpse, a young gentleman much like myself. I lit a fire so we could get warm, and we shared many tales and good jokes. But it soon became time to leave, as it seemed Corey had not bathed in some time, and so we wished the best of luck to each other and he lended me what he could. I headed off. It was starting to get dark, and I could hear the wolves howling. I made my way across a train bridge, and spotted a hydro dam. The wind started picking up, and I wasn't taking any chances. Inside however was vast goods to be indulged in, from sewking kits to med-kits, from canned beans to denim jeans. Upon reflecting on my good fortune, I heard a faint whisper, ""This is my dam, you're not welcome here mister"". All of a sudden I was thrown to the floor, and was quickly helpless as a wolf aggressively made me feel unwelcome, its teeth pierceing my flesh. Soon it was over, feeling my life spilling across the floor. In my last few moments, Corey walked toward me through a bright door. ""Come on...It's time to go"".10/10 Good times			"

								I remember watching the trailer for this game when the Kickstarter page was up a good while ago. The trailer was enough to get me excited to pledge, but I couldn't afford it at the time.Now, I'm finally able to put my (basic) boots on and walk the cold winterland of northern Canada.Currently, the game only has Sandbox mode unlocked (Story mode isn't available in Alpha).In Sandbox mode, you're the sole survivor of a plane crash (no, not Malaysian Airlines), and you're simply supposed to survive in the unforgivable climate of northern Canada. There are no monsters or ghosts. Your only enemy is the climate, yourself and the wolves that inhabit this God-forsaken area.Simply put, you run around in a fairly small map (they are to expand it and add more areas in the future) where you need to survive by looking for edibles and beverages. You are to avoid wolves unless you can kill them (with a rifle, which is the only weapon the game has at the moment). You can hunt deer and gut them for meat that you can cook by a fireplace or stove. You can explore and loot multiple indoor areas and exciting outdoor environments at the moment.The whole survival aspect of this game is masterfully done with multiple parameters such as your condition (overall health), calories (energy), hunger, thirst, fatigue, and cold. To keep your calories up you need to stay away from the cold and eat/drink. To maintain your hunger and thirst, you have to find food and drinks. To rest, you must find a bed or roll out your bedroll. And of course, to not freeze you have to find amd wear warm(er) clothes, start fires and stay near them for some time, and stay indoors for as long as you can before having to go on another search for supplies.Combat in the game is something I haven't gotten to explore too much as I haven't been able to get my hands on a rifle yet. And as it is the only gun, I can't tell you what it's like to shoot in this game, yet. However, I've been attacked by wolves mutliple times and I can tell you what I think about the melee combat; it's nice at the moment. I like that you can build up strength for an attack, and then hit the wolf. It seems a bit unrealistic to be able to kill a wolf with my bare hands by punching it (since I'm not Chuck Norris), and to have that aspect be unrealistic in this otherwise realistic game feels a bit odd and out of place.I also like that when you fight with a wolf, you have to tend to your wounds by following some simple steps.Visually, this game does it for me. I love the way this game looks. It's very simple, yet it's gorgeous. The colors of the sky can be absolutely stunning! However, the area that you play in is very white as it is snow covered which can get a bit boring after a while to run around in and look at since a lot of the areas are very similar in the game.The map is rather small, which is one of my biggest complaints. It's easy to run around the entire map and then have nothing to do. However, the odds that you'll survive long enough to not have anything to do are low, but when you beat the odds the game becomes rather dull quickly as you've looted everything and you've seen all that you can see.To conclude, this game is well worth it's money. While it's in Early Access (and you should always be critical of games in Early Access) it definitely delivers some great gameplay for what it currently is; an Alpha. I trust the developers enough to keep releasing great updates and keep us players and followers up to date with what they're working on.If you enjoy the survival aspect of games like DayZ and the Forest, but without zombies and monsters, then this game is for you.I'm looking forward to see what more they'll add to this experience in the future!

								This is an early access review so this is subject to change along the way.First impressions right off the bat; it is visually beautiful. Its cell-shaded style in a grundy post-apocalyptic frozen world brings out the creepy feeling of isolation and the grim situtation I find myself in within the game. First thought immediately? ""I need to live"". The gameplay is both interesting and immersive; once you slowly learn the ropes, you have to really think how you have to survive and make sure your crucial items doesn't either go to waste or last as long as they can for you to make through another day alive. And as you can read from my review so far, I've only had one nitpick (which is the fault of my own graphics card to keep up with the beautiful world) but nothing worth to damages the game's credibility. I'm loving what I'm seeing and experiencing in this game so far.The basics are there and the need to survive in a sandbox world can keep you glued to this game for hours until more content come out. So what else Hinterland Games plans to bring out, I eagerly look forward to them.			"

								This game... Has torn me to pieces but sewed me back up, The Long Dark is a survival game, but what sets it apart, is that there is no zombies, no undead human alien mutants that chase you everyday and night, you try to survive the strongest force us humans know, Mother Nature, you fight against cold, disease, and wolves to survive yet another day. Finding items are hard... But when you do it's extremely rewarding, I've been in the night; freezing, dehydrated, without food, light, but when you find shelter, it is the most rewarding and satisfied feeling on Earth, I highly reccomend this game, despite my lack of hours on this game, for the little amount I played it for, I enjoyed it completely, it's a bit rocky at first, there are times where you wanna give up, but if you persist you'll eventually start loving the game.

Early Access Review
								I got the Long Dark when its release first game out, and i played it but not to a full extent until recently. Why i didnt start playing longer until now is a question i do not know. This is one of the games where early access is actually playable for more than 10 hours. Im currently an eagle scout of BSA so survival is one of my hobbies. This game has a lot of survival aspect to it, for sure. But what got me most playing this is winter. Winter is my all time favorite season. And the worst time to get lost or caught in a natural disaster, is winter. Winter you fight the cold more than anything else. This is why i love this game so much. Its not too easy and not too too difficult. You actually have to look for supplies. Not to mention you start with absolutely nothing so its up to your wits about surviving. Which would be in a real life scenario. Full thumbs up from me.			"

								Day 1:I wake up in the dark of night, surrounded by trees. I start to wonder, coming across a hunters perch, with a hatchet inside. I keep walking, seeing a wolf in the distance, I sneak past, only to discover a logging camp, with three trailers. ""Awesome"" I think, as I make my way through them. I find a lantern, some lighter fluid, jerky and a soda. I sleep on one of the beds for a few hours before having to go back at it.Day 2:I continue down the road, coming across train tracks. I can see a bridge in the distance, so I make my way to it, only to see a dam down the river. I enter it, warming up instantly. I take a second to eat some jerky and drink my soda. First time I've felt safe all day. As I go to search through a locker, I hear something behind me, and as I turn and look, a wolf, someone able to open doors, has made it's way in, and is now eating my foot. I died from blood loss and shock of a wolf being so damn crafty.10/10 would get jumped by a wolf again.Edit:Would love to see a game mode where there's someone hunting you as you're trying to survive. Fires and such give away position, as does maybe foot prints in snow. As scary as wolves are, but stuck in the dark knowing someone could be behind me with a knife sounds terrifying.			"

								    The Long Dark is a survival game set in the cold winters of canada, With in depth survival and crafting systems, for example keeping up your hunger, warmth and hydration. This game is pretty hard core i would not recommend this game to someone who does not have much expirence with survival games (ex: dont starve, minecraft hardcore mode) this game gives you a modivation to keep going because if you die you die you can never come back to that save.The game is extremly atmospheric if you play in the dark with headphones on when you go up and start a fire you feel a warmness and satisfaction.  (WARNING: if you dicide to play with the lights off and your headphones on prepare to be jumpscared by them wolves)I give the Long Dark a Canadian Pancake/10			"

								This game is awesome! You want to know why/how? Here are the stats:PROS:- Smart Ai (for the most part)- Beautiful graphics!- Free roam- Survive/scavenge (This game is survival based: You crash your plane because of a weird geomagnetic wave... thing. You have clothes, a bandage, some food, and the greatest of all, your wits. You will have to survive numerous threats, (no... there are no ZOMBIES!!!) wolves eating you, starvation, freezing to death, falling from high places, dehydration, wolves biting you, falling through thin ice, getting lit on fire because you were stupid enough to light the fire on top of you or near you, wolves mauling your face off, lack of sleep,  or when Fluffy murders you.- Massive environment- Knowing your character's condition at any given moment (calories, temperature, hunger, thirst, fatigue aka: sleep)- Many hours of fun, re-playable game-play- Devs working hard to finish and update the game (That's what makes the game even better, hard working developers. Knowing that they will improve the game constantly to make it your money's worth, THANKS Rock, Paper, Shotgun!)-Wolves will track you down, and kill you (That's right Kiddies, growl growl growl means run yo a$$ outta there! - Similar quote in Fallout 3, another awesome game)CONS:- Your character gets REALLY hungry and thirsty REALLY fast!- Wolves are hard to kill- Only 1 weapon you can equip (the Hunting Rifle, and only about 7 bullets in the entire map)- When wolves attack, all you do is spam click to push them off of you)- ITEMS DO NOT RESPAWN! (Even though it makes it realistic, it sucks when you're on day 28 and you've run out of food, ammo, and medical supplies because you've already scavenged the entire map.)- Flares DO NOT scare wildlife away, unless you mean deer.- NO Multiplayer (I hope the devs add multiplayer even though they said they didn't like the idea)- Does not have story mode as of now (It's Alpha, c'mon)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The cons are very very very very very very minor details, I'm sure they'll be fixed in the future (minus the multiplayer part). If you like DayZ, Rust, Minecraft, or any survival based game, you WILL like this game. Please buy it and support the devs in what they are doing. I can't wait until the story is added!

								If you're into survival games at all, stop reading reviews and just get this game already!I've played several survival games (The Forest, Don't Starve, zombies) and this is by far the best and most addicting of them all.There are 3 difficulty levels, the easiest is great for starting out because wolves and bears don't attack you on sight. Stuff you need for basic survival needs (hunger, thirst, warmth, tiredness) is fairly plentiful on most maps, so you can horde up on things and be set for several days of just exploring. It's challenging but accessible; if you die it's always obvious what you could have done differently.Here's one of my memorable stories from this game: I was out exploring one day when I noticed a wolf chasing a deer. I sprinted over to the scene of the murder, chased the wolf away (I was on Pilgrim difficulty), and harvested all the meat etc. for myself. But it took over 2 hours and by the time I was done a blizzard had come through, making it impossible to see beyond about 10 feet. And in my frantic rush to steal the deer, I didn't pay attention to which direction I ran, so I was totally lost, cold, and quickly getting colder. I wandered around for what seemed like forever until I finally stumbled onto a familiar birch tree all by itself. Eureka, that marks the way home! By now I'm numb and starting to risk getting hypothermia. The wind is whipping and the snow is coming in sideways. I sprint down the forest clearing until tired, rest while walking, and then sprint some more, to the frozen lake where my cabin sits on the far side. All the while my character is occasionally saying things like ""Oooh it's cold"" and ""I don't think I'm gonna make it.""As I finally approach my cabin, I'm frantically clicking on the door trying to get it open and get inside ASAP. Once inside, I bee-line to the fireplace (walking, because I'm too exhausted to sprint anymore) and get a nice big fire going. The orange glow in the room, the crackling and poping sounds of the fire, and my warmth meter rising rather quickly now, all combine for a symphony of artistic brilliance that actually makes me shiver as I sit at my computer, as though I actually DID just come inside from freezing temperatures and lit a nice warm fire.Get this game. Just, yeah.			"

								I started my day with high hopes of surviving. I found some supplies and kept on trecking, I started looking through a car when all I hear is a growl following with a Jump Scare from a Wolf, mind you I was crapping myself thinking a Deer was going to kill me. Anyway, this Wolf tore open my leg. I ran into a near by Hut hoping to find a Gun. I bandaged up my leg and found a lantern. Walked out it was gone. (Thank God!).This brings me to Day 2. All I did was freeze myself in a Fishing Hut on the frozen lake and catch and cook the fish, it got me through the night, all was going to plan.Day 3 has now arrived. I had so many supplies you could bring Donald Trump in to win the Election and I would still survive somehow. I had 5 Fish and many bottles of Water and Soup. I thought it's about time I head inland. This was the worse mistake I have ever made. To start things off I hear a loud roar, I was pooping a bit. Than the loud thuds start happening. Turn around and a ♥♥♥♥ing Bear runs around the corner and starts chasing me.""THE CHASE IS ON!""I am running as fast as I can, dropping bait to lure the sucker away. Turn around hes still coming, I have just wasted so much food, I turn around and fall off a Cliff. Sprain my Ankle. Than it begins again. Another Bear comes out of no where and starts chasing me. I can't run by this point. I am done. I literally have never screamed so much, cringed to the point I had to look away as the bear is eating me.So now my last week has been explained I will review the Game at hand.10/10. Graphics are Mint, Quality is literally to Die for, would recommend it to my Grandma so she can experience my #IRLMOMENT.			"

								I think that where this game shines is how the survival element focuses solely on the player with calories and temperature being the main factors. Very few games are doing this right now and I believe this is perhaps the next stage for survival games. Although I do not suspect other traditional survival games to lose steam, this at least compliments them by staying in the same genre but trying something different enough that it probably should be in your library. Recommended and hoping the game continues to improve.A quick Let's Play of The Long Dark in which I stumble around like an idiot for a short length of time, doing no justice whatsoever to the game! Seriously, try it for yourself!

								The Long Dark is a true survival experience, though not like most other survival games, The Long Dark boasts a beautiful world that will leave you speechless, behind this beautiful world lies a disturbing world in which you have to overcome hunger, thirst, cold and fatigue, you must hunt for food or scavenge nearby buildings for clothing and other survivalequipment, you must either fight or sneak past wolves to help you navigate your way through this unrelentless world and look for a place to rest and find food.Melt snow for water, use purification tablets or boil the water to make it safe to drink, heat up coffee or cocoa for extra warmth and cook food for added warmth and fatigue, loot vehicles and corpses for extra supplies and cut the meat from an animal carcass for even better food, go fishing in the nearby lake or take your chances at the dam, everything you do has an advantage and a disadvantage, stay indoors and the wolves will circle the area or you'll run out of food, stay out too long and they will hunt you or you'll freeze to death.In The Long Dark you are tasked with the goal of surviving for as long as you can, hunt the safe house or explore the world in this beautifully built world with atmospheric sound and superb voice acting from David Hayter (Metal Gear Solid) and Jennifer Hale (Mass Effect) who both gave you audio clues to whether or not you are Cold, hurt or hungry, as wellas when it's getting Dark or Light.The Long Dark is an indie title developed by Hinterland studio with some of the crew who have worked on some triple A titles such as Mass Effect to name one of them, they are constantly updating the game to bring new features, items and maps, The Long Dark currently has 2 maps which can be explored on one save by travelling past the dam, both mapsare visually stunning and are full of danger with a lot to explore.My verdict on The Long Dark is that it's a stunning game with some of the best voice actors, the gameplay is amazing and will have you playing for hours on end and is a true survival experience.For more reviews follow our Curator Page "

								The Long Dark may be one of the most polished Early Access titles I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Each difficulty level renders a different level of challenge for the player and gives the sensation of playing a completely different game. The easiest difficuty allows the player to wander and discover the handcrafted world at their leisure. With each increasing step up in difficulty, the game becomes less about exploring and more about desperate survival. The limited resources truly give the player a feeling of desperation and helplessness. Depending on what the player wants out of the game, the game can be as challenging as they want. The art takes some getting used to but quickly becomes a very enjoyable viewing experience. I have spent a great deal of time simply taking screenshots every couple of minutes. Hinterland Studios has done a phenomenal job at building the world.  The sound design is top notch as well, roof tiles rattling in blizzards and snow crunching under your feet as you hike through the frozen fields. The character voices are also just present enough to remind the player of their basic needs without repeatng too often. While it is still in early access, I would wholeheartedly recommend the game in its current state and with the quality of work so far, it can only get better from here.			"

Early Access Review
								Where to start?This game is incredible, and probably what the survival genre need. The graphics are one of a kind, and kinda minimalist which is something I'm always fond in videos games (but some people might find it weird or odd, specially when a wolf is trying to eat you). The sound design work is incredible, if you have good heaphone I swear you think you are in a real blizzard. The voice acting is great for what we can see of it, but it's just sandbox so it feels random and out of place sometimes.Yeah, by the way, you will pay quite a lot for just sandbox and a bunch of challenge that can be done the eyes closed. Because the game is trying to be realistic in its survival part (which is great), it's really easy to understand how all of this work and what you need to do to survive. In 16h I ""finished"" the game and felt like I had played whatever could be played of it. But it wasn't scary back then to have this feel, the story mode was supposed to be published later this year. But it didn't. And Hinterland made a point to be either rude or complete dimwit in their PR. At first I really believe they just wanted to publish a game that was exactly like they wanted. But soon the update for the sandbox mode got bigger and bigger. ""it's great! Don't complain!"" Oh, yes, I didn't complain at first even if my eyebrow rised a little. Because apparently they are just a bunch of programmers. It's the perfect argument for the late release. But it doesn't make sense, if you are so outnumbered, to work massively on your sandbox when it has been two years people wait for a story mode. They make enough money with it, and the sandbox being not so bad, people don't complain. I'm not saying they don't work on story mode (even if three years later I'm starting to think yes), but they obliviously neglect it. And when confronted to the facts, they just evade the question.So, yes, I have given up on the game and regret deeply to have bought it. Not so much for the late release, but more for the way Hinterland handle it. This studios doesn't take their customers seriously nor their engagement.And they doesn't accept critic of it. Sure, there was going to be delay, it's an indie game after all. But not three years. Three years with pathetics excuses is just another Day Z or War Z. I'm a big kickstarter fan, and backed a lot of game. There were almost always delay, it's even logical to have them, but they always at least tell you were they are in the developpment, and don't make any more money until it is released, pushing them to actually publish it and not just wash their hands with the money of a sandbox. And they keep you updated on it. Look at Prey for the Gods. They are even less than Hinterlands and yet they do incredible work in taking their fans seriously and respecting them at least by keeping them updated on the progress (for Christ's Sake they even did a update to explain why there wasn't one in two weeks).So believe me, if you want this game even though Hinterlands are a bunch of ****, wait for the story mode being released, because you will get bored real soon in the sandbox if you are not completely stupid and can comprehend gameplay mechanics. It will probably have a rise in the price, yes, but simply don't buy it on Steam and it will be even less pricy than it is now without the official release. TL;DR: Game is awesome but just sandbox so you ""finish"" it really quick if you are not an idiot, studio is a bunch of as**** who seems to not care anymore for story mode since sandbox is making enough money and good reviews. Waiting to buy it for the release will force them to work on it more (if at all).			"

								The sandbox game is good and well developed, however the campaign mode, was supposedly coming soon. This was over a year ago, then it was revealed to be episodic, so the game i bought expecting the full campaign mode, is now just chapter one of an episodic story mode which was to be launching this spring.... well summer is here, and its still nowhere to be found. Yes the sandbox is getting a constant trickle of updates which is a good thing, but the campaign mode i purchased was a bait and switch, and now i'll have to keep buying episodes for a game I thought i purchased(complete) a very long time ago. Delays are one thing, but the bait and switch business model added onto the endless delays, mean i can't reccomend this game currently. What you pay for now, may not be what you get when its finally complete.Again, the content that is there is good, and always improving bit by bit, but i have to suggest some buyer beware during early access. Doesn't feel good to be sold a game with 'full access to the campaign' and later told, just kidding, you only get the first season/chapter. Perfect example of why pre-order/early access games can often be a very bad idea. I wish i had just waited to see if/when the full game is released and purchase then.			"

								Overrated gameGreat survival elements, but what's the point to survive? There isn't a real objective and it's not rewarding at all. The game is also extremely slow and developers didn't deliver the story mode that they did promise a big while ago.			"

								This is one of the best games I've ever played but it's been 3 years with minimal progress, and no real additions besides a few new areas. This game is easily going to forever be one of the best I've ever played but I'm genuinely upset of constantly spending money on games that never get finish, and this appears to be headed that way.While their is consistant updates, they are minimal - with minimal progression to getting through to Version 1.0You guys need to pretend like you're going to get this out of alpha/beta some day.Edit: For example, since writing my original review 2 years ago I've noticed that there is a new video, the second one on there. None of that♥♥♥♥♥♥on there is apart of the game yet, it's just a video that finally describes that apparently something bigger has happened, which I don't think seemed like it was the original story. It was kind of just like ""Oops crashed my plane"" Now it's ""Oops the whole world is dying"".EDIT/RESPONSE:40 hours isn't totally accurate, because I played it for months at a time after I lost internet for a few months. Steam doesn't log properly offline. Now, if you read - it being a great game isn't the problem. It's the fact that the developers haven't done much besides add a few more areas in 3 straight years. It's at this point become to me, another one of many early access games that is abusing the fact that they can make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of money without doing much in return. There is no excuse for not getting it to a 1.0 in 3 years, that's also not including development prior to release, which gave us more than the 3 years it's been available. Like I said, amazing concept, poor production. I'm not going to keep giving good reviews to Early access games that don't ever go anywhere.Here's one the problems, I don't think it was intended to ever even get a story mode. When I first started playing this game the first week it came out the story was you're plane failed and it crashed and now you have to survive. They only recently changed it to something bigger. They did so much work prior to getting it onto steam, and since then it's been utterly disappointed. Amazing concept, Great gameplay, poor production.			"

								The Long Dark has a lot going for it, but it ultimately playing it feels irritating and a bit boring.The good - The world, while not incredibly realistic-looking, has a painterly quality that's quite beautiful. The setting feels realistic, and it's difficult to survive. Finding supplies or bringing down kills feels satisfying. There are some nice realistic touches and a strong effort toward producing a genuine survival experience. The lighting and weather are beautiful and really impact gameplay.The bad - To me, more realistic details and animations would help round out this game. After an animal has been harvested by the player, its corpse should look different. Fishing should have animations, not just a picture of the fish caught appearing on-screen. Players should not need to eat such massive amounts of food. The player should be able to climb or jump a little, at least. But the biggest thing that keeps me from playing more often is how slow the player walks. I know people walk slowly in snow: I grew up in New England. I get that. But walking in snow is annoying and tiring and slow in real life, and these aren't things I'm looking for in a game. I literally get hand fatigue just from having to hold down the forward arrow for such a long period of time as I walk forward. A building you can see clearly can feel like it takes an eternity to reach - even on ice. The story mode would be a great addition, and I hope it includes the plane crash scene with the ability to scavenge in the wreck. I think The Long Dark still needs to find the right mix of realism and fun. Overall it's a good start, but I've grown tired of it after a week or so, so I can't recommend it right now.			"

								The Long Dark is a survival game that leaves me wanting more... a lot more. It has a lot of the basic core elements of a survival and is definately very unique compared to the other survival games out there. Sadly as much as I wanted to really enjoy this game and have fun with it, I was left with having a more boring experience of traversing the winter wilderness and dealing with frequent bugs. Some of these bugs worth mentioning at the moment, would be a few wolves would pass right through me as well with deer. Looking at the price and how many other reviewers and gameplay videos I've seen, I gave the game a shot and it just wasn't as enjoyable as I expected it to be for me. Not saying it won't be a joyous experience for anyone else and for the sale price I would be more than happy to recommend you to get it. To me though, The Long Dark is a limited, search and discover, slow survival game that I find disappointing as much as I wanted to like it.			"

								3 words to describe the sandbox mode: artificial difficulty and unrealistic.- You cannot jump- You cannot climb a small tree- You cannot drag a medium branch- You cannot learn to make a fire without matches or a lens- You need to eat more than a bodybuilder- You need to sleep more than a child- You are a weakling who constantly gets tired and cannot rest- You are freezing while you are running or cutting wood- You don't sweat- You jump from 10ft into the snow and injure your legs- Your clothes are made of paper- Your tools are made of plasticThe world is static and therefore boring. I might change my review and opinion if the story mode proves to be much more compelling. I really like the concept of this game. Man vs Nature. Alone. In the wilderness.			"

								I'm going to start off saying that this game is truly incredible. Not only are the graphics absoulutly beautiful, with a really nice artistic style, but the game play is exremely addicting. Probably the most realistic survival game on steam. The Injury/First aid system is revloutionary, i havent seen a game yet with such a good injury system. The Long Dark can also be very stressful and suspensive. I'm suprised every time i play this game that it is still in alpha, if this were the finished game i would gladly play as is. From my experience bugs have been very rare to nonexistent. Due to the type of graphics that are utilized it can be played on most computers, not just gaming ones. I am usually the multiplayer/co-op kind of guy, however I gave this game a chance, and really love it. The game play is always keeps its players on thier feet, there is never a moment were there is nothing to do. As far as I'm concerned, there are no cons to this game, and as far as i know, it being worked on every day to improve an already great game. Hunting in The Long Dark is WAY harder than it looks on the trailers XP. Overall this might be one of the best and most addicting games i have ever played: 15/10, please buy this game, because its awesome. Or at least give it a chance ;)			"

								Wow! That's the first thing that came to my mind moments after I fired this up. For such a small footprint, this game nails what it sets out to do...to provide an immersive survival environment in which you can't help but be pulled into. To begin with, this game is absolutely beautiful aesthetically. Beyond this beauty lies imminent horror, as you quickly grasp the reality of your situation in game. There is no hand holding here, but that’s what you would expect given the “survival” moniker stamped on its front cover. The Long Dark succeeds at an extremely high level where other games that fall within this genre have sorely missed the mark. Yes, it’s frustrating once you recognize that there’s only one end game in your demise, but I believe therein lies the genius at the root of its design. TLD will invoke many emotions throughout your short time in its environment. Bouncing between depression, despair, elation and achievement is all part of the dance. I recommend you dress warmly before taking the leap into TLD, as the lines between reality and fantasy will quickly become blurred. All this, and we are still in early access. I cannot recommend the experience waiting for you inside enough.			"

								This game is simply amazing. With all the areas to explore and things to discover, it has an immense replay value. The art-like graphics and simplicity of the game make it one of a kind. The Long Dark is also a very rewarding game. Every day that you survive gives you a sense of accomplishment. The longer you survive, the more resources you have to work with. Then comes the disappointment. It comes when you've worked so hard to survive and then just like that, you're dead. It's like surviving 53 days and 7 hours, with all your stuff neatly arranged on the shelves and tables, and then not being able to see anything so you can't get to your medicine in the bathroom after a bear attack. Anyways, all around the game is very fun and will take all your time. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good challenge.			"

You have to find food, water, shelter, fullfill all the basic needs. All while surviving in the very cold and very deadly Canadian Wilderness. Wolves are still being tweaked to try to find their sweet spot, but for the most part I would consider run ins with wolves and in general, wild animals to be fair. I personally have encountered no game breaking glitches and this game has impressed me with what they currently have. I drool with the thought of all the additional content they are going to put in.

								If you are into base building/survival crafting games like Rust, 7 Days to Die, etc ....  I dont know how you'll feel about this.  I love survivial crafting sandbox games - but this game def. was a bit more than I was anticipating.  It is very challenging, the open world is medium sized and the terrain can be a bit annoying at times - your only enemy apart from mother nature and your human needs are wolves (only on med/hard setting).  Pros:Interesting stance on survival mode gameplayExploration/ChallengeGraphics are pretty/neat buildings to exploreCrafting (though it is a bit limiting from what I can tell in my 6 hours of gameplay)Cons:Lack of interaction with environment (I want to be able to pick up tin cans, break furniture with my hatchet for fire wood, etc).Map is not randomly generated - so if you need a gun or crowbar, you pretty much know where they will be each start of a new game.So many wolves for the map size - they are very hard to fight off if you haven't found a knife or gun yet (punching them or fighting them should knock them off you .... or do more than it does currently).Calorie burn is way fast if they are going for realistic.All in all - I would wait till this game goes on sale, for $5 or less it is a good buy with some enjoyment to be had.  It is an early access so hopefully with more tweeks and details put into your interactions with your environment it can be as good as I think it could be.Happy surviving!			"

								Have you ever stared at a painting of a scene from somewhere you've never been, and imagined what it would be like to leap into that world? Well, this game allows you to do just that. It's like diving into a 'Group of Seven' painting and wandering beyond the confines of the frame, deep into an expansive, mysterious wilderness. The scenery is breathtaking and vibrant -- like being immersed in a living work of art. But don't let the beauty of this world fool you into thinking it's a simple nature walk... it can end you in so many ways if you let your guard down (i.e. hypothermia, wildlife, a cliff, thin ice, starvation, dehydration, etc, etc.). Game play is seamless with intuitive menus and orders that feel like a part of your character's existence without feeling like interruptions -- I stay completely immersed in the game, until I choose to leave. I really like survival games, and this one is by far the best I've ever played. Really quite amazing for an early access production.			"

								Probably the most fun you'll ever have while slowly dying of starvation/dehydration/exposure/hemorrage/infection.EDIT: My two major complaints:- Antibiotics: There is NOTHING anywhere in the UI that says a dose is 2 pills.

								Started out on the Coastal Highway...this is my story:Day 1 :Walked down the roads, found a car, took some mittens. Found a cabin, got a little food, almost got eaten by wolves. Was an okay day.Day 2: Ate some peanut butter, got sick. Went out to go get some medicine, was stalked by wolves. Found meds, slept off the food poisoning, raided a small village of houses for food. Found about 3months worth of food, feelsgoodman.jpeg. Was a great day.Day 3: Walk across frozen lake in amazing clothing and see a house on an isolated hill, get curious and head for it. About to walk into the door, half a second from left-clicking, get jumped by a pack of four wolves. Die within 3.52 seconds. GG NO RE 10/10 will play again in a little bit. "

								Awesome game concept, and pretty good execution so far.  But someone definitely needs to educate the developers on the realities of wilderness survival...  Slipping in deep snow while going down a hill will almost never break or sprain anything and definitely won't tear your clothes; what it will do is get snow all inside your clothes and mean you need to get warm and dry pronto.  Dysentary from drinking melted snow?!?!?  What am I doing wrong, following the wolves and collecting their yellow snow?  Single wolves that somehow have the mass and power to take a man down?  A hatchet that can't be used in a pinch to easily brain any wolf dumb enough to approach you?  Plus for some reason they believe you need to eat and drink WAY more than any human ever has.  On the other side of this imbalance, walking in snow is way easier and less exhausting than it would be IRL.  Perhaps they should add skiis and/or snowshoes...  With some clean up of minor details like this, and maybe add in viable enemies(yeah I read the disclaimer about the wolves, but if you KNOW they don't attack people, then give us a REAL enemy guys), I think this one can be a real winner, and a rarity amongst the early access crowd as an actual playable game.

								This game is gorgeous. I love the idea of it, and they seem to have thought of a lot of different issues that you can run into. Last night I found myself making decisions like ""Okay, I need to get to this place by dark, which means I can't stop to warm up, but it means that I'll need to pick up fire wood on the way so I can warm up when I get there, which means I'll have to leave some gear behind, but definitely not the accelerant.""I love how much thinking is involved in this game, and there really are no short cuts. You either figure it out, or you freeze or starve.			"

								I just spawned into the world, hoping to make my way around this grand Canadian wilderness, avoiding the wolves in fear that they'll tear me to bits and I couldn't find a single shelter... And I was getting colder. I was at the point where I was freezing to death, hopelessly trudging through the snow when the snowstorm started coming through. I didn't know if I would survive. I had no idea where I was, where I had been, I could barely see and I was sure I was unintentionally backtracking through places I'd already been. I still hadn't found any shelter. Nothing would make you more desperate than I was at this point.But, then I saw a blurred construct, quickly coming into sight as I moved forward. Could it be? It was, a trapper's house! I rushed in, and I was blessed with a cornucopia of supplies! Wood, food, drink and even my own gun. I quickly made a fire, ate and drank everything that I had collected and decided to have a little sleep while the fire was going in the wood stove right next to me. I woke an hour later and took a look at myself, reflecting the early moments of my life here and I realised I was going to be okay. I was still alive.The Long Dark. Day 1. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								During the 15 or so hours i have played The Long Dark I have died several times. This is not meant to be a walk in the park. It can be fairly hard to survive at times. Over all the game was fun but challenging. I Feel they have done a good job with loot balence ( you find items where they would actully be most of the time). The wolves could use some fixing. They sometimes attack twice in a row or ignore flares thrown at them, and sometimes even ignore the fire and attack. The crafting system is well done makeing it possible to maintian your items making it easyier to survive. There are a few things i would like to see them add or fix. Other than the wolves being a bit bugged sometimes the only other fix i would add is that some items respawn after a set amount of days, because there are only so many rifle rounds and flares on the map. This means after a certain amount of time all your defences will be gone making it extremely hard to continue playing. It would also be nice to see them add maybe  like a polar bear to each area to add more wildlife. There is no map or compass so while navigating it's pretty much just by memory or landmarks. In costal highway it appears that there are three island you can go on but the third is across weak ice and im not sure you can actully go there. There is also in coastal highway a hiddin location called rabbit grove it can be tricky to find but its near a stream near the campground. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes a challenging survival game. Please remember this is in an alpha build so some of the things i said may be fixed or added it. OVERALL 7/10  needs some fixes but still fun. Personal Best 30 Days 11 Hours. DEATH BY WOLF			"

The first day a blizzard struck as i trecked down the road, My feet and and my hands went numb and my vision was blured. After 3 hours of treking i find a cottage in this cottage i found somthing terrorfying, a corpes layed on its side near the door frozen the poor sod had frozen right next to a box of matches and a flare. I sat next to the corpes cotemplating what was going to happen but evetually i got up and continued my quest for a home. 5 days later my condition is an 13% and im missing shoes my rifle is damaged and a pack of wolfes is hunting me down. I had two choices, Let the wolfes get me or be overwealmed by the frozen wasteland  I chose the wolves and now i sit here waiting for death in a pool of my own blood and now i am finnally warm again			"

								After 75 hours of play, I guess I can say that it is a really good one. At first, you have to understand how to survive: the first few tries are extremely hard and seems like it's impossible to survive a week in this environnment. But when you undrstand some basics rules, you can make it to a 100 days without problem. And it's at that moment that the game become boring. At that point, the only interest is to know how many days you can survive doing exactly the same thing over and over again. So, the pros:- You have at least 20 hours of play trying to figure out what to do to survive. The anxiety that comes from it is really awesome. And that is the main reason I recommend this game. - The map is really good and fun to explore.- The developpers listen to the fans to improve this game and every updates are made in the right direction so far. - Really good immersive environment. Cons:- You can survive way to long if you know how to avoid the wolves. So it's not that much a battle against nature, but a battle to avoid wolves, you should not die from anything except that. - For now, every ways to get food (trapping, hunting and fishing) gets repetitive and boring quickly. - Alpha stage... it can change a lot in the next few months. - Most of the time, you sleep or walk and nothing is happening. - Lack of ressources diversity for now and not many things to craft. Overall, good games, that should continue to improve. I recommend it mostly for the first 15 to 20 first hours of play, after that, it depends on how much you like to do the same thing over and over again.			"

								What a wonderful game! I'm really looking forward to the finished release of this. The sandbox is amazing. Having said that, I have some comments after about 15 hours of playing in standard mode: 1. Lots of other people have mentioned the balance issue with wolves, so I won't go into it except to say that I broadly agree with them. I especially think that if I win a fight with a wolf, it should not be able to automatically run away. I earned that pelt, damn it. 2. If I find a human corpse, there should be an option to butcher it. Yes, this is distasteful, but when you're starving meat is meat. History certainly bears this out. 3. More flexible crafted clothing options would be nice. For example, I could make a coat out of deer, wolf, or even rabbit (with a whole lot of rabbits), and each kind of pelt would have different properties. 4. It shouldn't be necessary to melt snow before consuming it as water. I'm a veteran hiker and I can tell you from experience that eating snow hydrates. It also leaves you feeling colder, obviously. I recommend allowing people to eat snow off the ground, but with a risk of hypothermia (and the usual possibility of bacterial illness). 5. More diversity of animals. Bears, musk-oxen, foxes, caribou, and lynx are all found in northern Canada. It would also be a nice touch to add in tern nests with eggs as a discovered food source.			"

								So I played a few games on easy to get a feel for what I had to do, played my first REAL game (on the med difficulty) and died real quick. So I get a feel for it and play my actual first real game.I move around, avoiding the wolves while I check huts on the lake for supplies. I get lucky and grab some firewood and the like, clothes to stay warm, etc. Even a shotgun (though no ammo). I keep moving carefully, checking houses and cleaning them for supplies. No ammo, no weapons, few tools. I keep playing safe, being a newbie, staying at houses perhaps too long as I make sure I stay rested, warm, fed, etc. I even repair some clothes for the first time, make some tea, blah blah. After searching many houses in the area and coming up short in terms of hunting tools or weapons, I decide after resting up that it is time to move out and search for a new area. I walk out of the house and see a wolve across the way, but it runs off. I am relieved, and turn left to head out. A wolf. In my face. It pounces on me and I freak out. I start bashing out it but soon enough I die. And I felt good.I made it a full 27 hours and I felt like a champ. This game puts you on edge for survival, and as soon as you get comfortable you realize you are still nothing. The odds are all against you and you gotta work your♥♥♥♥♥off just to get a little lucky. But it is fun. It is about the challenge or survival and overcoming the odds for as long as possible. It is still in Alpha but I have high hopes for this game.			"

								Im writing this after my first playthrough.I watched the video and  read many reviews before deciding to play the game .i managed to survive for 2 days and 5 hours. I started out in the highway area.There were several wolves far enough away that i could safely travel the raod and access many houses.i got a decent amount of food and  supplies to keep warm for a bit and keep fed .My main problem was  i was finding mostly canned foods which required a tool to open them .I decided to venture onto the lake where the wolves were because i saw several cabins on small islands and i was hoping for a tool that would be useful .I got halfway onto the lake when 2 wolves spotted me .They started chasing me and as luck was on my side a blizzard came on suddenly and i lost them and made it to the first island with  a cabin .No such luck with any tools save for some sewing repair kits. I continued to go from island to island after resting till dawn from the first night .More supplies but no  knives or axes or even a can opener. I went out onto the ice and  started a fire in an ice fishing shack and cooked some fish and brewed some herbal tea.After the fire died down a wolf found me an attacked me.I fought it off but had to use most of my supplies of healing items to stop the bleeding .I made it back to one of the cabins on a small island and  tore up several unneeded  clothing items to repair my damaged  worn clothes  using the sewing kit .Then i rested till day 2 .At this point i went back to the road and follwed it up to some train tracks .I decided to  follow the tracks .They ended up taking me  to the mystery lake which is the other starting point in the game .My fatigue was getting high and i spotted a dam .I decided to duck inside to see what i might find .I found a lantern immediately  on a shelf and picked it up .As soon as i picked it up , my fatigue level was so high it said you are encumbered and then i heard a howl.I turned around and  a wolf inside the damn attacked and killed me . What i like about the game is the  sound effects and the feeling of definate isolation.You actually do feel like your desperate and you have to watch your stats like hunger and thirst plus fatigue or you will be in trouble.I read the disclaimer about the  wolves intentionally  being made to attack humans ,but stepping inside of a building and instantly being attacked was sort of annoying.All in all  the weather,and the feeling of the game that you need to keep moving and finding  neccesary items to survive is fun and keeps you wandering around hoping you find that 1 needed item to get you through till the next day .I  definately reccomend this game.

								You must purchase this game realizing that it is far from finished.  But be aware you are previewing what IMO will be a very unique and successful survival simulator.  I have found the early access sandbox mode of TLD to be very rewarding in it's current form.  While I have already become bored of it after 30 hours I don't regret my purchase.  This is the sort of game I've been waiting for.  There is so much obvious potential here and from what I've seen the developers are on track to make this game happen.  The up and coming story mode and the added immersion that will come with it is what i am most excited about.  This game is so far well thought out and well designed.  The art style is refreshing and beautiful.  The sound is fantastic and really adds a lot to the game-play.  There are plenty of things that should be added or ironed out but the developers are on the forums asking questions and taking advice daily.  I may be done for the moment with TLD but I assure you I am eagerly awaiting any updates and it's final release.Buy it. "

								I've spent a decent amount of time playing this game over the past couple of days and i must say I'm a bit blown away by what I've seen so far.  For a long time I've looked for a very realistic survival game that preferably was in first person and this game is definitely it.  It is obvious that the survival elements of this game are extremely well thought out and the player must survive in a manner very similar to what one would have to do in real life. Now I have spent most of my time playing on the ""easiest"" difficulty because I have neglected the violent aspect of the game in favor of pure survival.  This brings me to the wolves.  Throughout the game (even spawning in buildings sometimes) wolves are freaking everywhere.  You still see the beasts in easy mode but they run away (like a wolf would possibly do for real) instead of mauling you to death because thats exactly what they do.  If you can beat the wolf off you'll have likely sustained injuries that makes medicine and first aid required though this seems to be less common than simple death at least for the novice.  In short, this is an excellent game but it can be punishing in multiple ways.			"

								A survival game without the zombies for once!Although still in early access (at the time of this review), this game still provides hours of fun.  It's realistic and unforgiving - just what you would expect of a survival game that plops you into the middle of a Canadian winter.  You must find food, shelter, clean water, and warmth all while steering clear of hungry wolves that make your life much harder - or much shorter.Beware that this is a one-life game!  Once you die, you start over.  There is no going back to the last save before you were mauled by that wolf, or foolishly walked out into a blizzard without pants on.  Let this make you more wary, stealthy, and smart about every action that you take.It's a lonely adventure, as you're the only living person around, but it's worth the trip.  The stylized graphics are really quite beautiful - reminiscent of a painting.			"

								I'm always interested in survival sandbox games. This one is different from the rest because its not about a survival zombie game. Almost feels like you're Les Stroud on survivorman. The game has a long ways to go to feel complete, but I've had a ton of fun playing it. I even bought it for Xbox one too!			"

								I'm not kidding when I say that this game is frustrating. But it is so frustrating that it is good. It's like one of those puzzles that you just have to keep working on, not because it's a particularly interesting puzzle but because... Actually I have no idea.Let me illustrate for you how a typical game goes (for me). You start, somewhere where you have no idea. Yes you can google for maps, but you still have no idea where you are. OK, so you try to find some landmark that you can remember from the last however many times you've died. Great! A shack with a door! It's got a stove inside! Yes!Everything goes swell for a couple of days. You scout out the local area, discover some fishing huts and loot a whole bunch of cabins. Then you start running out of supplies (food, wood, whatever), so you decide to venture out a bit further.Then a blizzard hits and you're lost in 360° of white. Or you're heading out to fish, and you get attacked by a wolf or a bear or whatever. You might be able to stagger back, frostbitten or actually bitten, to shelter and live out a couple more days, but you know it's game over.And then you try again. Because the game is that good. The concept is brilliant and the execution great. The game is early access, and the promised Story Mode looks like it could be good, but it is ready to play and enjoy now.I also just wanted to comment on the visuals. It seems to me that, a lot of the time, you look at the screenshots for a game and they're all cinematic. Not so with this game. The visuals are entrancingly beautiful. Day time, night time, if it weren't for the fact that the outside is genuinely going to kill you, I would be perfectly happy to explore around just to immerse myself in the environment.All told, The Long Dark is a great game and I highly recommend it.Please note that this review is based on the Early Access version of the game, specifically the Timber Wolf Mountain update. Things may change before the game is complete. I'll update this review when the game is complete.			"

								Needless to say I haven't spent an exorbitant amount of time playing this game, but I thought that I'd share some of what I've experianced during my first playthrough.First off, I'm a stickler for good graphics and was initially put off by the splotchy, water colored look of The Long Dark. Call me vain, but I that just what I tend to like. But I was pleasantly surprized by how well it works for this game. With my gaming PC down at the moment, I did my first playthrough on my regular laptop, with the graphics set a low for better performance. Even then, they wern't bad due to how the game is designed. Within two minutes of playing, I was no long conserned about how the graphics looked, but was more focused on staying alive.The weather is cold and unpredictable, going from standstill wind to biting cold fronts with subzero wind chills. You're always on guard as to how much firewood you have scavanged and are forced to move through the in-game world to find other suplies, due to thirst, hunger, exposure, and fatigue. There is no stumbling onto a well stocked cashe and riding out the apocalypse in some bunker. Food is a major concern as well, because you're constantly burning calories by moving around, gathering supplies, and just trying to stay warm. Finding a candy bar or a can of soda is like hitting the lottery. Without a high caloric intake, you won't be able to carry as many supplies or have the energy to move through the frozen wasteland. Often you'll come across some decent gear that you don't need, and will need to make a decision as to either take it, and deal with being encumbered, or leave it. Sometimes you might be able to break it down into a useful componet, but that takes time, and time costs you food, warmth, and daylight.Daylight. You can see for miles during the day, but when the sun goes down, it's pitch black. You can't see your hand in front of your face. You need to find flares or a lantern, and it leaves you terrified when outdoors. Hearing random sounds in the woods, the not so distant call from a pack of wolves, or suffering the freezing, subzero temperature drops... you must find a place to hunker down well before sunset. Something that struck me the most was the complete lack of people in the game. Starting off, I had the feeling that I'd probably see some NPC somewhere, sometime, but the longer I played, the more it sunk in: that I was truely alone. I figured that at somepoint I would come across someone that I could possibly trade with or talk with to figure out what happened in the world. If they were there, I couldn't find them (I know, probably might have something like that in the actual story mode, not the sandbox Alpha version). This caused me to be pretty excited when I thought I saw a person, and I had to carefully run down the side of mountain to get to them. Turned out that it was a person, or at least used to be. All I found was a frozen body not too far from a ditched car. Almost felt bad as I scavanged his corpse and stole his wool socks. I thought that this added so much to the game and made it strangly unique. Similar games might not have NPC's but you can play online with people off your friends list, but here you're utterly and completly alone. Having to rely solely on yourself made this game in my opinion.Eventually my adventure came to an end as I knelt shivering and tired by an old potbellied stove in a random ice-fishing hut, desperately trying to keep it lit, while a wolf stalked and howled just outside. Running out of fuel, freezing, hungry I made a mad dash across the ice to the shoreline fishing shacks as the sun started to rise, just to be knocked down and mauled by the wolf, who had so patiently circled my campsight all night. Dead by bloodloss from a wolf attack 20h 41m.I was thoroughly impressed by this game and would love to see it fully developed with a complex story mode. There is so much potential and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who asks. For $20, I'll get more use out of this game than I would a large pizza lol. Here's to dieing in most horrible fashions imaginable and to the chance of living to see another day.			"

								This game is really cool, and definitely one of the best survival games I have ever played.While playing this game you'll have to explore a lot, which is something I love about it.I also really love that it's not just death and destruction, but a beautiful world, that is really dangerous.As mentioned in the description of the game, there are no zombies, the threats this frozen world has to offer is wolfes and bears that will make you constantly look over your shoulder, and the merciless cold.Also, it looks like story mode is going to be awesome, and I really look forward to it!I've only experienced a few bugs, but they weren't game changing at all.This rewiew will probably change as the game is still being updated, but so far, I love it!

								Extremely immersive and very, very well done, a game that actually makes you gasp with relief when you see the faintest glimpse of your cabin through the blizzard, hunch over your keyboard with finger taut on the W key as you slowly fight your way to shelter through the whipping winds, and sag in your chair when you finally reach the door and get inside. Decently realistic and detailed too. The accelerated timescale (12x IRL time) and set duration of some actions means you have to plan ahead with quite some shrewdness. All items have durability which decreases over time depending on use and abuse. And of course, to keep your character healthy, you must keep track of body temperature, fatigue, hydration, and caloric intake. Every action has its consequence, and you must weigh your choices carefully - just as you should, if you had to survive indefinitely in the wild.  And best of all, it's damn beautiful. Love the art style.			"

								I've got a mental list of my favorite games over years of playing. Somewhere near the top is The Long Dark. Even in its unfinished state, hell, even when it was first released to early access and only had a single map, this was an excellent game. The graphics, soundscape and music all focus on creating a setting that really drives home the bitter loneliness and quiet desperation of trying to survive, alone, somewhere in the frozen north. I've grown a little concerned with the amount of time it's taking them to finish the story mode, but this won't really begin to bother me until another year has gone by. Even without it, the game is absolutely worth the money and a must-buy. Highly recommended.			"

								This is not a game you want to play when you're in a rush.It's slow. Walking, freezing, starving, hoping that ""house"" you see on the horizon isn't a rock with snow on it as your overall condition worsens (colder, more thirsty, more hungry, more exhausted...). Repairing your gear, getting better gear, managing carry weight, avoiding poisoning and infection from food and water. Praying the fire you're trying to build doesn't fail...I would like more maps in sandbox, but the visual style is beautiful, and it's the only game I know that's brave enough to be this slow-paced. It's not boring. It's tense. And it can be stressful. And even after surviving for months, with a base full of food and equipment, a stray bear or wolf can still kill you.I would buy this survival game before I bought any other survival game I've played.

You will die at least a few times early on while you are learning how to survive, so don't get aggravated. You will soon find out that dying is part of the fun. I did not get this game early in development, but I still have seen many positive changes implemented. Hinterland is a great game developer that has shown they care about their consumers. I just wish I could give this game two thumbs up!!! (Come on steam ;) )In short, Just Buy It! You won't regret it!			"

								One of the most realistic survival games on Steam, and it's still in early access. No monsters, or jumpscares; just you and mother nature.  The best way to play this game is by setting the difficulty to Stalker (Hard in-game), because the other ones are just too easy. Also, with there being no tutorial, be prepared to encounter trial-and-error situations numerous times. I'm aware that some people aren't a fan of trial-and-error, but it just works in this game. Remember that it is still early access with the story mode possibly containing a tutorial coming out soon enough (currently the only gamemode is Sandbox). If you're a fan of difficult or realistic survival games, or maybe even both, ""The Long Dark"" is perfect for you.			"

								I see a lot of potential in this game. In it's current form, I say it is well worth the $20 right now.My ratings (Alpha version):Graphics: 9/10 - I absolutely adore this graphics style. It reminds me of a picture-book.Performance: 7/10 - You have to have a fairly decent machine to run it on high or ultra without lag. Though my gaming PC is about 6-8 years old, so I should have expected as much. It's quite bug-free too even for an alpha.Gameplay: 8/10 - Right now the gameplay is quite bare for a survival game. But this is an alpha so I can't complain. But my god, what it does it does very damn well. Though I haven't gotten that far.Immersiveness: 10/10 - This is the very first game I've played since Skyrim (and any other survival-type game) that I've actually felt immersed in a cold and icy wasteland. The lighting inside the houses makes you feel so alone as you try to huddle up next to a fire. You can even see the footsteps you make in the snow and the icy breath of your character. I would love to see Occulous VR and controller support for this game.Sound/Music: 9/10 - I love the sound design in this game. There are plenty of sound effects for rummiging through drawers, to your character's teeth chattering when it's getting too cold. It adds an important effect to the immersivness that most games can't quite seem to capture.I must applaud the people who made this game. I can clearly see that this game was made out of a labor of love. I'm looking forward to the story mode of this game and seeing all the new features that this game has to offer. "

								I don't write reviews very often but this game definitely deserves it!It features very thought-out mechanics and a polished feel of gameplay and visual/audio design. The decisions of what to simulate in a realistic way (weather, hunger, etc.) and what is still meant to be a game (wildlife behavior, balancing of timed actions) are chosen so well that I feel absolutely immersed in this game world - which is what I want from any survival game!It's also nice to HEAR what's going on in the game world. The sounds make such a difference to the immersion and TLD also pulls this off in a great way. Visually, too, of course. The textures and models are kept in a style that's doable for a small studio and still look great. Also the effects and lighting are really well done and support the immersion further.I also love that the different areas of the game are connected and can be explored in one playthrough (if you survive long enough). Though it's a sandbox the gameplay feels meaningful, with looting, crafting, exploring and the occasional fight or hunting trip. After a time you try to be a as self-sufficient as possible because man-made resources start to deplete (since you looted it all) and it's great that the game supports this instead of just spawning new loot items after a time.Not to mention that Hinterland steadily pushes new updates and adds, tweaks and improves content.

								Early Access Reviewnot much to do yet, story mode is locked out. only walk around in sandbox mode.Very interesting art style. Sort of cartoonish water color look. I like it.Sound is very effective, with good use of surround sound from specific speakers behind you.Looking forward to this one. Hope the money helps for the devs to finish it.			"

								After over 100 hours of gameplay, I thought it would be nice to write a review. This is a review about the sandbox gameplay.I truly enjoy surival games, and I can say that this one is by far my favorite. From the moment I start the game, it pulls me in with its beautiful graphics, atmospheric music and amazing gameplay. I really recommend finding out for yourself how good this game is. For me, it was definitely worth 20 bucks. And don't be scared of the 'early access', even if the developers would get bored of the game and release it in its current state, it would still be a damn good game.			"

								One of the only games where you fear mother nature more then whatever else is out too get you. The cold, the freezing wind constantly blanketing everything in deathly white snow far outweighs my fears of being eaten by wolves or even bears, honestly I feel as if those creatures were just added in as an aftertbought, because even without them this game would still be one of the most unforgiving survival games I have played in awhile. Nothing beats the feeling of leaving the warmth of your shelter and being welcomed by the bright sun illuminating everything in sight, you think to yourself what a beautfiful day it is! Nothing could go wrong! So you decide to go explore brimming with confidence knowing your bound too find another place to stay in by nightfall. -__- Then you notice the bone chilling wind whipping past you, look back to see nothing but white as a snowstorm engulfs you and you freeze to death before having found any REMNANTS OF CIVILIZATION!

								No zombies, no monsters, no PVP, just real (as real as a video game can be) survival. This game nails the survival feel. Looting for food and water, struggling to stay both warm and healthy, and finding shelter at night. The game hits every aspect of what you would need to do to survive in a cold and lonely land.			"

								For an early access title, this game is pretty fantastic. In its alpha stage, it has been completely playable and the exploration is a very satisfying experience. I'm a man located some distance away from snow and I have only occasionally seen it. This game's aesthetics and settings brings back memories of cutting down Christmas Trees up on a snow covered mountain near a favorite travel location of mine. That exploration/travel is what I enjoyed much about a lot of open-world games such as Grand Theft Auto V and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The graphics aren't as advanced or realistic, but it's still very pleasing.On the survival note, it's pretty smooth and fairly simple. It still requires your constant attention, though, having to eat and drink and sleep. In this alpha stage, in which the Coastal Highway was just released, the gameplay feels pretty solid. This only leaves me wondering how it will get better and how it can be adjusted to be more difficult. It can be quite easy (my first sandbox game is still going and it's possibly too easy) and from what I hear, it can be quite grueling.Great game to get into, even in early stage. I enjoy this a lot more than when I had played DayZ, mainly because everything is very grounded and actually smoothly playable.At full release, I really hope that they release mod tools. I can already see this game reaching pretty well into the sky, but modding can take this game to the bloody stars. Bring in the yetis and dinosaurs!			"

								I see a lot of potential in this game. In it's current form, I say it is well worth the $20 right now.My ratings (Alpha version):Graphics: 9/10 - I absolutely adore this graphics style. It reminds me of a picture-book.Performance: 7/10 - You have to have a fairly decent machine to run it on high or ultra without lag. Though my gaming PC is about 6-8 years old, so I should have expected as much. It's quite bug-free too even for an alpha.Gameplay: 8/10 - Right now the gameplay is quite bare for a survival game. But this is an alpha so I can't complain. But my god, what it does it does very damn well. Though I haven't gotten that far.Immersiveness: 10/10 - This is the very first game I've played since Skyrim (and any other survival-type game) that I've actually felt immersed in a cold and icy wasteland. The lighting inside the houses makes you feel so alone as you try to huddle up next to a fire. You can even see the footsteps you make in the snow and the icy breath of your character. I would love to see Occulous VR and controller support for this game.Sound/Music: 9/10 - I love the sound design in this game. There are plenty of sound effects for rummiging through drawers, to your character's teeth chattering when it's getting too cold. It adds an important effect to the immersivness that most games can't quite seem to capture.I must applaud the people who made this game. I can clearly see that this game was made out of a labor of love. I'm looking forward to the story mode of this game and seeing all the new features that this game has to offer. "

								One of my all time favorite games. And I don't say that lightly. Just brilliant. Truly groundbreaking.It had my attention before it even came on early access with the gameplay concept and the art style. I've since played a fresh round with every major update, and I've never been disappointed. ""Survival"" has become something of a dirty word of late. No less so than early-access. Don't worry. The Long Dark has an uncompromising aesthetic vision, a strong sense of what it is trying to achieve. The devs are professionals from the industry, and not people trying out their first game after modding something else. It is not a me-too crafty-sim in Canada, but an ""experience"". Visually, audially, and in terms of play. No other game has you actually trying to just survive like this game does.			"

								This is an excellent game all around. I am waiting in anticipation for the story mode. If you are looking for an immersive survival experience that can be either an adventure or a thriller, then this is the game for you. There are different maps to explore which can be reached from other maps and differing difficulty levels. This keeps the game interesting and challenging even if you have mastered a certain area. I highly recommend this game to lone survivalists. I did read online that it is or will be possible to bump into other players. I have not seen any others.I have not tried to use a steam controller with this game.			"

								Before i start this review im just going to say that this game is one of the best survival games on steam.  This is not a scary game in any way but the fact that you are alone and the only humans that you encouter are dead puts you on the edge of your seat. 10/10 for atmosphereThe sound design on this game is great. Every single noise makes you scared that there is maybe a wolf around the corner.One complaint on the sound design is that when you open your door to see if there is any blizzard you hear the sound of a blizzard and that made me not go out exploring on perfect days. 8.5/10 for sound design.The visuals are not the best but the art style on the models also dont allow that. For me they are very good but everyone has their one tastes on art styles and visuals. If you have not watched the trailer go watch it because it has exaclty the same visuals and art style as the game itself. Another great thing about the visuals of this game is that it makes even average computers be able to run it on high settings. 9/10 for visualsIf you are looking for a survival experience with lots of atmosphere i stongly recomend this game. I give it an 8.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								Let me start off with a simple pros, cons, and mixed chart:Pros:- Very vivid, beautifully detailed game. Mainly artsy and has a hand-drawn feeling to it (because it is!)- Realistic, for the most part, has many considerations to take into account such as hunger, thirst, warmth, fatigue.- Very fleshed out mechanics, an example would be: You are out at night, hauling home supplies from a second base. You are freezing to death, and low on condition, so you strike up an outside fire. Little do you know, it takes time for the ambient temperature to warm up and actually provide you with warmth. You drop plenty of health waiting for the fire to gain traction and heat up, and even then, you need to huddle by until your cold meter drops.Or:You are out in a blizzard, and doing this absolutely shreds your clothing durability, so you must hurry. There is a home against the wind, quite a ways out, and a house a little bit farther, of the same variety. Which do you go to? The best choice would be the slightly farther one, because running with the wind, downhill, or on a snow-clear surface (or all together), you run slightly faster. Imagine you are running on a downhill road with the wind. Rather fast, right?- Plenty of tool and clothing variety, and tiers of protection and tools- Wildlife interaction, and many methods to exploit them for food, such as using a torch to scare a wolf away from a kill.Cons:- You WILL die. This may be intended, but you literally cannot live forever no matter what. It starts gradually. You run out of canned food, so you must hunt. How? With the rifle? It eventually breaks. Use a repair kit? Yeah, you can fix it until the kit breaks. Use your hands? Sure, but you will run out of materials. Magical rifle? Too bad, running out of bullets. So you decide to hunt other ways. Fishing? Only as long as you have tools to break ice. Snares? If they don't break, which they will eventually. Going after used carcasses? If they aren't frozen. Alright, you got a little bit of food, around 1.2 KG's, or 3 pounds. Use some matches to light up a fire indoors? Tough luck, they have decayed or have all been used. Firestriker? Gone. Magnifying lense? Gotta go outside bud. So, now you have a blazing fire. You manage to collect wood with your hands and keep it going, and the wolves manage to stay away. But now the deer are hunted out for a while, and you have to wait until a kill comes nearby. You are too low on food to wait, so you go out to hunt wolf. Use the rifle? Broken. Use a knife or hatchet? Broken. You decide to fistfight it. Clothes on? They slowly get torn up throughout many hunts and blizzards, to the point you are naked and it is too cold inside. Clothes off? You prolong them slightly longer. So, now you killed a wolf, you harvest it, cook it on the same fire, but now your condition is extremely low due to being naked with no weapon. You go inside to sleep and heal, but it is too cold. You sleep until you are frozen to death. The end. So no matter what luck and abundance, you will die from some factor. This is very annoying.- Wolves are too hostile. Yes, the game has a disclaimer, but a single wolf chasing you down and trying to eat you immediately is ridiculous, and especially considering the main male character is roughly one hundred and eighty pounds, at my guess, the wolf would be absolutely destroyed by a kick to the head.- Wolves are too strong. Explained in the above.- Hand-to-hand combat currently consists of clicking very fast, then clicking again to release it and damage the wolf. Then you do this is a few times or more, depending on weapon, then it runs. From there you have to chase it down. From there it is likely a second will spot you. RIP. There needs to be a better combat system IMO.- Deer and wolf barely give you any meat, especially considering calories. You get about eighteen to twenty pounds off a deer, and fourteen to sixteen off a wolf. For perspective, to heal from 35 condition back to 100, in eight hour increments, requires about three steaks, maybe a fourth right away when cooking is done. Each steak is 2.2 pounds. So after healing, you are left with about two to four steaks with a wolf, and you can burn those calories just sleeping all day.- I fear that story mode will not be released until sandbox finishes, which does not seem anytime soon as the game has endless potential.- Very monotone cycle of forage, make a base, eat, drink, boil water, cook food, sleep, go out for items, come back, eat, drink, sleep, eat, drink. I know survival is realisticly just this, but a player can not get the real life feeling of constant threat of horrible death by starvation. There needs to be something to actually do.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VERDICT: I believe that game has tons of potential, and it is highly playable already, so I do recommend it as of Early Access, this April 17th of 2015. I do, however, fear it will be in Early Access for a long while ahead, and while you can certainly act as if it is a finished survival Sandbox game, there is much to be desired in the long run.			"

								Pros:- constant development of game (i bought it early and remember how it looks like one year ago)- addictive- atmospheric - felling of natures power- lights/shadows/graphic issues- sounds of natureCons (for the 21.01.2016) ***IMPORTANT - IT'S JUST MY WISHLIST AND THING I FIND ANNOYING***- lack of regrowing feature- bow shooting is pretty hard to learn and vital resource (which do not regrow) is needed for the arrows...and arrows decay after every taken shot- unable to repair bow- unable to get gasoline from abandoned cars- only one forge (vital for arrow heads production) in whole area of game- fishing is uselles and takes too much time giving poor calory effects. MAybe it's just my luck but im loosing more calories while fishing than catching - unable to chop down trees, new system with branches is cool in comparison with how it looks like at the beginning but it's still not the best solution- time flies away too quickly- decay of sodas and bubble drinks ? seriously? it's made of pure chemistry xD- lack of bag size widening - i think we should have opportunity to craft own bags - overpacking could destroy them in time- soundtrack could be better (and more)- drag and pull mechanism could make this game easier - in case of fire sources / benches / forges "

								Great game for the survival genre. I have enjoyed it so far. I actually pirated the game before hand to try it out and ended up buying it on here. Once the game gets bigger, I suggest a demo or something.Pros-Graphics - really nice artistic type look instead of the usual gritty realistic visuals-Realism - you have to watch what you eat, make smart decisions, even one wolf encounter at the wrong time can leave you dead-Constant updates- The devs are constantly updating the game which is good to see for Early Access. Keep it up guys!Cons-Realism - it would be nice to have actual animations when doing things in the game instead of just loading bars. this disrupts immersion some for me.-Can be monotonous- Once you die a couple times, the exploration aspect has worn off a bit. The game didn't get really fun for me until I found the hunting rifle. -Non Procedural world- A random generated world be amazing for this game.  After you've seen the same place 20 times after 20 deaths, it's not so exciting anymore.Overall, I enjoy the game. Is it worth 20 dollars? Maybe. Once the game is released, yes. Of course with Early Access, you're usually investing in the game instead of buying the finished product. I made the investment and am happy so far. Can't wait to see how much more the game evolves!Thoughts and suggestions--One big gripe I have is with the temperature and freezing. I moved to Canada from South Carolina, USA and the -5C weather doesn't make me freeze to death. Even the -20C weather wasn't terrible as long as body parts were covered. May just be me being nitpicky but that seems off to me.-Needs random generated or dynamic world at the least, either that or y'all will end up adding plenty more regions.-More content as always			"

								Overall... i have a lot to say, but dont have enough patience to write it. so ill focus on the basics. The game its self is great. the graphics are quite enjoyable, and the sounds are on point. With that being said, and i know this is an early access game but this is my review pertaining to this moment, there are a lot of improvements. A couple times when i was running through the woods i would just randomly sprain an ankle. I would have some painkillers to counteract that but it got annoying after the third time. The map size overall is a little disapointing as well. I found myself walking in circles a good amount of times within the hour and a half i played. I could also add that I never saw a wolf once in that time period, and that seems to be the main component for fear and survival in this game. but aside from all of that i would love to keep up with the game to see if it improves, which i know it will. It happened with the Forest whenever i got it Early Access. It sucked. Everything glitched and i fell through the floor, you couldnt build anything really. Now, a couple months later, you can build treehouses! and they dont glitch!!! Theres not even a story mode in the forest and theres one coming up in the actual release of The Lonely Dark. So my suggestion is if you like a game to a certain extent to where you dont mind it being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the beggining, then go ahead and get it. but be prepared. if you dont like it that much then just wait a little while. I recomend this game and really enjoy it and might be playing a couple more hours. Great game, Needs a lot more work. Keep it coming. "

								The Long Dark is a fantastic addition to the survival genre; instead of there being zombies or mutants its just mother nature, with a few predators, against an honourable surviver of a dystopian post-apocalyptic barren Earth - you!Pros: . No zombies or mutants. Excellent theming and inconrous use of corpes.Realistic nature of game positively influences the player's actions allowing them to develop an increasingly accurate representation of the western Canadian wilderness.Cons:.It is often very difficult or impossible to combat aggressive animals esp. wolves.Several bugs and glitches were noticed e.g. the superman-like ability to resist health damage when jumping whilst bending knees..The game is still being worked on by its developers and it may take several months until its full debugged release..Not Really a con, but in my opinion this game should have stayed as a PC game and not become an Xbox One GameOverall I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good survival game without zombies, mutants or an Early Access fiasco.9/10 As I feel that this game's advantages far outweigh its deficiencies.

								I simply cannot get enough of this game.  Just the idea of being alone in the wilderness is truely terrifying.  I would recommend this game to anyone, it has quite possibly the most rewarding and exciting grinding experience i have ever had in a game.  The difficulty settings are just right.  I cannot wait for the story mode to get here!!!!!!!  One of the most unique and exciting games i have played.  Mods for this game would put it over the top.  The crafting and constant exploration for materials is thrilling and i always know that death is right around the corner, it may be a blinding freezing blizzard or a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off pack of wolves.  A must buy in my opinion!			"

								Probably the best pure survival game I've ever played. The realism is impeccable as far as video games go the cold and lack of resources is rather immersive considering the situation your in. In real life you wouldn't just find cabins full of edible food and wardrobes of warm clothes. Everything you get in this game you appreciate. Every hurdle makes you feel as though nothing can stop you until you need to hunt and a blizzard hits. Darkness is honestly scary and its not because it has monsters but the weather is a force to be reckoned with. Your true enemy is the cold and poor decisions. Anyone who wants a challenge and love problem solving and hard choices this game is for you.			"

								A very enjoyable and atmospheric survival experience. I really enjoy the art style and sound design, and the game controls and runs well. This game makes exploring fun and occasionally quite tense. Scavenge for supplies, try not to freeze, and watch out for wolves!I'm starting up an exploration focused series (the wolves are set to non-aggressive), so here's the first episode if you're interesting in checking out some gameplay (with commentary) from the beginning:

								I like this survival game and that says a lot, I will tell you why.I like graphics that reflect realism not cartoon or anime, etc, so for me to even play this game says some other values must have encouraged me to play it. Yes its earned my giving it the right to be called a ""survival game""! I do not give a review unless i think it stacks high, say on scale 1 to 10 I work in the range of 6 to 10, anything below I do not even worry about. This is all just my personal way, i am not associated with any company nor ""encourage ($$) "" to give a review for favors, etc, so when you see a review from me, its true Blu and American too hahaha.Anyways, this game is a time killer, if you want long lasting play and very rich game-play and be forced to fall for a cartoon like graphics and still feel the realism from survival in the wilderness, this is an 9 in my book and that's big cuz I really do not care for the type of graphics BUT in this games case, these graphics suit it perfectly!It doesn't show me for the hours because I play on family PC's on family accounts so I have hours missing but it don't matter to me on the time, at my age of 51and PC gaming (and more) exp from b4 cyan was color, when Maxtar was a PC name brand  lol, it don't take me long to know a hit from a flop lol... I plaid games on  640 kb 5 1/4inch floppy when MSDOS OS 4,5 and six ran your PC and you had to type WIN if you wanted to use windows :P In-fact windows didn't start automatic less you knew batch and config.sys file commands with lil knowledge of ram, buffers and then you configured windows to start by Autoexec.bat , wow I feel old now hahaha...Well anyhow, That's my story and I'm stick-en to it lol, its worth the price and you will not mind the graphics if your not a fan of these graphics, trust me you will get a chill! This game you will like these graphics, after 20 minutes playing you'll forget the graphics and focus on settling with hot cup of somethin and prep for a long journey of hours to come so don't start this game say 10 pm, you may watch the Son rise hahaha.Later yall !

								The Long Dark is by far a great game that needs only develop some of it's realism aspects, but as it is, this game is a solid piece of work that I truly hope succeeds and is played for many years to come. It's a nice mix of the survival aspect we see in other games with the cold splash of reality many video games fail to deliver upon.The game has one con, that being the lack of multiplayer or co-op, and it will never probably be added for the sole reason that the game's current mechanics will have to be changed, and because of that it has very little replay value. I understand what they're trying to go for with the whole individualism approach, which at first was a welcomed relief to an already over saturated co-op based genre, but after awhile the game just begins to feel repeatative. The addition of new maps is cool, but until the campaign is added in it's probably not a game I'll be visiting again for awhile.If you find the game on sale or are a fan of the survival genre, then I'd recommend the game. It definitely excels at making you feel like you're all alone in a vast world as death slowly, but surely, creeps towards you.			"

								This game is definitely fun if you like the idea of a simple survival game that merely pits you against nature and nothing 'supernatural'. I really enjoyed the game and learning things from trial and error, such as which direction the stats bar is indicating you are freezing or hungry. There are some things I don't like a whole lot about the game as well, such as it seems some fires don't do anything to help with warmth. The potbelly stove for instance didn't contribute an ounce to my warmth. It was outside in a fishing shack, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't contribute to warmth at least a little.Anyways, I think the game is headed in the right direction, gives you some pretty good options and quite a bit a freedom. I'd like to see the ability to pick up random trash and use it torwards something useful. Cause unless I thought there was absolutely no way that trash would help me survive I would be picking it up and figuring out something for its use.			"

Single player game at its best - and for a survival game, for not having zombies, is a big bonus:) As a developer, Hinterland is great. Feedback and updates are at a level I almost cant remember to have seen before. Please support this game by bying it - its a gem.			"

								There is a good game here. It is innovative. It is done extremely well in spots. As far as the survival genre, it has the potential to be in a class by itself. After saying that though, you should know what it is you are getting into. In places the game is exciting, immersive, and beautiful. It can actually give a jolt when a wolf drops in unexpectedly. The buildings that you find while exploring look beautiful. The landscape, when it is free of trees and the developer put some thought and design into it, is very beautiful and thought provoking. Walking into a clearing and seeing the sun rising while a flock of birds flys over you in a v formation is pretty cool, indeed.  Where the game does not do so well is what it seems to have the most of. The trees can span for what feels like actual miles. What seems to make that fact worse is there is single digit tree models. Therefore you go through literally hours and hours of looking at exactly the same tree. Take the fact that the encumberance mechanic makes you walk like you are carrying a gallon of milk with your sphincter, and you can see where this might get pretty boring and frustrating really quick. Also, no map function that I am aware of. The weather keeps throwing blizzards that leave you snow blind. Forget about setting a base and then exploring. Get ready to get lost, see the same thing and double back, see the same thing and double back, see the same thing and double back, etc for infinity. I'm sure with a little more investment you could possible set your own landmarks or drop food on the ground to make a trail. But dang, I just wanted to play a game. I found a perfect little base (Max's last stand). It was great. But I didn't have the rifle and needed a couple other tools. Went walking for a bit feeling confident I could find my way back. Next thing you know blizzard hits, walk for 2 hours seeing the same trees, sprain ankle by bumping a tree, become hypothermic, hit by blizzard again, weight limit decreases to 15, start walking like I'm keistering a pine cone, etc. No rifle found, never found my base again, found bow with one arrow, shot twice with no reticule, bow broke, could probably draw all three tree models from memory. Quit game.  I like this game. I would recommend it as I feel there is enough here for the twenty dollar price tag. But if you expect to have fun then you might be disappointed. Fun isn't necessarily what I felt I got out of it. It would be fun if there was more to find while exploring, and less trees. Or more variation. Also a map function is almost expected in this type of game. Not to have one really sucks. It wouldn't really break the immersion if where you had already discovered was mapped, a la minecraft. Setting up your base would be much easier this way, and would lead to prolonged gameplay/ greater enjoyment for the user. Traipsing through hours of trees to find more hours of trees just isn't fun to me. A reticule for the bow would also be nice. Also for the twenty miles of trees, is there only one dang rifle? I found so many rifle rounds. No rifle. I found a huge farm. I was like ""This is it, no farm in the wilderness exists without a rifle"". No rifle. Another cool base. Dropped all my gear into a bookbag lying around. Forgot to pick up my bedroll. Left. Remembered bedroll. Went back to find it. Never saw farm again. Wandered for hours till sleep deprivation. Weight limit decreased again. Testes attached to Mjolnir. Also work that encumberance out, please. My goodness, once you have close to the full set of tools, you are already at the limit. A few food items, some wood, and instant turtle. It does have it's moments. With some improvements, could be best in class.			"

								By far the greatest game I've played on steam... AND its still an early access, which means it can only get better. I adore this game: the atmosphere, the art, the chill I get when staying up the play the game till early hours of the morning. I don't think I can recommend it enough. The body heat mechanics and weather work perfectly in sync and I haven't run into any problems yet. This game can get tense. I remember gripping my keyboard as I urged my character to go forward. It was before I reached the coastal highway and I had no food and no wood. In game I was close to freezing to death as irl I sipped at a warm mug of tea, close to tears, since I had down so well so far. And then it happened. I saw a shadow of a trailer through the blinding blizzard and I can assure you, I've never been happier. I found enough food and wood (for heat and water) to hole up in that little safe haven for 10 days waiting for that raging blizzard to calm down enough to continue. But my god was that blizzard beautiful. Deadly, sure, but gorgeous. The world fell dark and for the first time in the game, I felt extremely alone. What if I saw a bear? What happened to everyone? Why am I alone? Those questions circled in my mind. But when there wasn't a blizzard and the setting or rising sun set a golden glow on the world, I felt at home. Peacefully happy and it aww at how this game was developed. Haunting questions didn't circulate my mind this time, instead I mused what other gorgeous weather phenomenons I'd experience. I go to this game all the time: when I want to have a break from my hectic life, when I have free time, when I want the tense survival experience of being alone in already isolated world. This is the only steam game I have ever deemed good enough for me to a review on, the only steam game I'd pay way more than it's worth for, and the only steam game I keep coming back to without ever getting bored. Please get this amazing game and start your own beauifully tense experience.			"

								If you are interested in a first person single player survival game without any zombies or monsters, this might very well be the game for you. In this game the cold, starvation and predatory animals are your enemies. That means you have to find shelter, food and clothing. You have to find things to make a fire so you´re able to cook the rabbit you caught or heat up a can of tomato soup you found. You can skin animals to make new pieces of clothing so you will have better protection against the wind, snow and animal attacks. And of course a wolf coat is just simply warmer than and an old ragged shirt. The graphics style is beautiful, it´s like a painting. Just check out all the screenshots here in Steam to see if it is for you.The sound backdrop is awesome as well. It is still in early access, so a lot may change all the time, but usually in a good way, cos the devs listen to the players in my opinion. And if there happens to be a game breaking bug, the devs are really quick in fixing it.And even though the real story mode isn´t out yet by the time of this review, the sandbox mode with its different difficulties and especially the challenges make it an awesome game already. You gotta check out the challenge “Hopeless rescue”. It is so cool (ha, wordplay, cool!).But you can play however you like. Just, more or less, casually walking around in the snow or you can choose the hardcore survival life. And yes, some things need a readjustment, but in my opinion that´s ok, cos I already got a lot of value for my buck and I can see the potential of this game and I look forward to further development. And no, in my opinion, the last thing this game needs is multiplayer. I could imagine coop, but I can´t see people running around just shooting each other. That´s not what this game is about.			"

								No zombies, no other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mainstream survival things. Just you, the wild, and the darkness. I have had my share of camping...outside...in a blizzard....with wolves and bears all around me...nothing beats the comforts of an abandoned home stocked full of food you pillaged and raided from everywhere else.Rifle ammunition....hehehehe *proceeds to roar with laughter*...you'll never waste ammunition in an FPS again since those bullets are your source of real meals. First play through I found about 30 rounds of rifle ammo, but no rifle. Thereafter I proceeded to starve to death, stumbling through the forest into a trappers cabin, where I decided to take a nap, and never woke up; ""You have netered the long dark"", was the message across a black screen. Second play through, I'm almost day 90...I'm still afraid of the dark.			"

								This game right here, is one of the best survival simulators I've played in quite a while. Not only are the graphics beautiful,(which can also be played on most laptops/computers with decent fps), but the atmosphere is incredibly astounding. If you play this game with headphones on, you're in for a good time. You'll get to experience some very realistic sounding noises,(heavy breathing when you run, occasional lines your character says, and most importantly, the atmosphere around you.) Even during blizzards, you can't help but appreciate how great it sounds. Aside from graphics/atmosphere, the gameplay is great. The crafting system is creative. In terms of diffuculty, this game varies. Play on easy, you get easy. Play on normal, your experience will be a bit challenging. Play on hard, prepare to punch your computer/laptop in frustration. Aside from difficulty, you're given the chance to play in different maps, which are all conected to each other. (Each map is harder to survive in from each other.) Personally for me, my favorite part of this game, is the danger. The danger in this game is REAL. Trek on a journey to your next safe house, and you just might get burried in a blizzard. Step out in the open at the wrong time of day, you might freeze to death/run out of supplies, etc. Make one wrong step, break your ankles and tear your clothing, exposing you to more cold, and slowing you down. So many things could go terribly wrong, forcing you to really play your cards right. The replay value in this game is great, where you can waste hours upon hours trying to survive as long as you can. All in all, if you want a TRUE survival experience,(and you like the cold,) this game is definitely for you. Personally the price is certainly fair and worth it. I would rate this game a 9/10. "

								While this game falls into the generic ""sandbox crafting survival"" niche everyone is so fond of looking down on, it - thanksfully - doesn't strictly conform to most criteria. It's not about the vicious cycle of mine-shoot-kill-loot-craft, rinse and repeat. The Early Access plaque it's been having for a couple of years is mostly related to the Story Mode which it still lacks, whereas the game's been here all this time along in the form of the Sandbox mode. If you want the original story, wait for it. If you want your own little experience, try this out.One might argue that this one is a ""Dead Souls of a crafting survival genre"" in that you'll gonna be dying the first N tries, N being a two-digit number. Don't let that put you down. Don't google all those user-created maps for game locations, because ultimately game content is a limiting factor on replayability for some, and part of the game is about getting familiar with your immediate surroundings and doing proper orienteering - without ingame maps or compasses or whatever, mind you. This is exploration game, after all, with usually no end goal set in stone. Well, apart from not dying.Have good headphones of you. Audio gives you so much spatial awareness here, and ambient sound quality is so good, you'll be recalling the game for the next couple years of yours when you're in your bed bed trying to sleep and you hear wind howling behind your window. I'd say the latter alone a clear and definite indication that this game is worth it.PS: don't look up the name Fluffy if you don't want to spoil your pants-crapping experience at some point. If you're easily scared, though, go for it, though Fluffy will not be pleased.			"

								This game is really breathtaking, a huge open world, easy to learn mechanics, and difficulty levels to suit all types of player. The art style is truly unique too, I sometimes find myself just standing still and seeing how the world changes, as time passes! Hopefully the story mode will be added before long, but the sandbox mode and challenge modes still offer plenty to do.			"

								Its a good game but since it early access theres going to be more stuff added in the game. It does get boring a little because the map is not large. The Long Dark is a fun game when you buy it i played it for 11 hours. My friend and i was talking about the game and we was said ""If they added Multiplayer it would be a very fun game"" I agree to that because exploring together and other servers would be fun. It a good game overall i recommend this game. Thanks if you did read this or if you just read if i recommend this game. <3 "

								The Long Dark is one of the only games I've ever written a review on Steam for. Why? Because this is a game that deserves to be played. The survival genre has seen a boom in the last year, but none so eloquently capture the real struggle of surviving in a harsh, unforgiving environment such as The Long Dark. This is a game that - unlike most - can and should be played without a walkthrough, taking in the breathtakingly stylized visuals, scavenging for food and supplies, and figuring out how to survive in the wilderness all on your lonesome. If you want to play a game where your main objective honestly and truly is to survive, this is the game to do it.Having said that, you should know this game is in Easly Access and in the alpha stage. You should expect to find bugs, and you may be put off by the learning curve associated with the game. In the current build (v .183), there are several complaints with the AI (Hinterland doesn't seem to understand what balance is), as well as some real issues (e.g., AI behavior not being reset such that a wolf will be in a constant state of aggression at the bottom of the stairs even after resting for hours). Because of this, the game can be incredibly unforgiving in a way that may or may not seem fair. As well, story mode is not implemented yet, and the sandbox has ""only"" two maps. This isn't much of an issue, as the equipment you find acts on a weighted-chance loot table, where the gear is randomized with certain stuff more likely to show up in certain containers (e.g., you're more likely to find a flare in a metal box in an industrial area than in a cabinet in the kitchen). However, there is a noticable lack of wood-burning stoves in buildings despite this being the cold wilderness.The mechanics are actually quite nice, such that you organically learn to do new things (as a player). There is a certain level of ""skills,"" such that your chances of starting a fire are low to start, until you do it enough and it becomes easier. However, from the player perspective, it works very organically: you, like the real you, slowly learn the right ways to approach situations, when the right time to go out and forage is, how to find starters and fuel for fires, and so on. As well, all of these actions take in-game time and it becomes imperative to properly manage what you're doing for the day, planning resource gathering and management to maximize time spent alive. The Long Dark makes me excited because it does what I've been looking for in other games. It makes me afraid to leave the safety of the cabin, despite knowing that I have to if I want to survive; it forces you to face its world, and doesn't coddle you. If this game is on your wishlist, you should just buy it now. It's worth the asking price, especially if it's on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								Just plain awesome. I started out on the most difficult setting thinking ""no zombies, no PvP, how hard can this be?"" Well, its  effing hard. I didnt last long. So then I kicked it down to the medium difficulty and still didnt last too long. Im determined to stay away from the easy difficulty.I thought this game was going to be textbook survival and I didnt think I would see anything that was too new and different. I wont giveaway the best aspects of the game but certain features like being able to ""harvest"" even the smallest amount of helpful material, even from your own clothes, is nicely done.Character movements and actions are fluid (one of my pet peeves). So that meaning running and walking both feel like they are the right pace. The crafting menus are thorough and the medical HUD (when you pull it up) looks nice. Ive only put an hour or so into the game but it does a great job of creating that uncontrollable urge to progress further; no matter how far youve made it, its never good enough. You always want to find more items and craft more things. Only because you have to constantly plan ahead. Time goes fast. And with time you will deteriorate.I got this on sale for $10 and I think it was well worth it. If I was a real survival game junky then even hte full price of $20 wouldve been just fine. Also, more options are planned. Right now, only one mode of game play is running, the solo sandbox.			"

								received this game as a gift, although I already had an interest in it. The Long Dark is beautiful in its presentation of the beauty and deadliness of winter/snow hell. I liked this game because it is very brutal to the player in its medium difficulty (I haven't mustered the courage to go for hard), and it is extremely intense when death is near or wildlife is chasing you. The usual lack of basic necessity such as warmth, food, drink and protection from the cold/wildlife will usually always get you killed. This is not the only thing that will get you killed though, lack of thought and calculation will lead you off of cliffs and onto thin ice. The learning curve on this is not so difficult for those who are familiar with slower game play and having to calculate moves like a chess game, since most things require sacrifice and trade.I would recommend this to someone who is ready to invest a considerable amount of time into actually learning how to be good at this game. If you prefer to point and shoot at things in a very fast paced style, I would not recommend this game to you.That being said: the more support behind this game there is, the better the finished product (I hope) will be. Do not sleep on this one.			"

								The  Long Dark is a survival game. Not a zombie survival game, not an apocalypse shooter with survival elements, it's plain old survival at its purest. It drops you in the middle of the Canadian wilderness and says ""Good luck, jerk, watch out for wolves."" It has a little blurb at the beginning about it being apocalyptic, but other than the occasional frozen body and a few abandoned buildings you'd be hard pressed to tell.It works because the survival system is surprisingly intuitive and the game feels smooth and surprisingly refined for early access. I spent less time trying to figure out systems and more time thinking about survival. Unlike other survival games *cough cough* it doesn't feel clunky, which makes the survival elements feel more relevant.Only complaints so far is that the animal AI is a little bit overly simplistic and due to the fact that there's very little randomization (even in loot locations) and only two maps, replayability is currently a little low. I'm sure both of these will be addressed by the devs as the game grows.			"

The atmosphere is great and I love the way everything looks. I also love that my only ""enemies"" are the wilderness.

								Thank bloody christ for game that invovles a catastrophe but not zombies. For that matter, I'm glad the catastrophe isn't another god damned virus outbreak or nuclear war. Granted, I'm sure we'll just end up killing each other with Mother Nature sitting back and eating her cous-cous or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ a metaphorical mound of dirt would eat, but while we still have our imaginations and aren't♥♥♥♥♥♥♥leashed by another corporation, I like the idea that a massive snowstorm has rendered a little Canadian town absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing useless. Long story short, a super massive sun spot appeared causing a huge geomagnetic storm. This one is so strong that it eliminates all life forms (except rabbits, foxes, deer, wolves, fourteen types of fish, and you) leaving the land barren and hopeless (except for the dozens of intact homes, perfectly fine flora, and a mostly intact railroad system that probably just needs some good elbow grease). You must survive by scrounging the land for food and water. Yet, you know what else you have survive against, which probably makes this game one of the best I've seen? The ♥♥♥♥ing cold. (Sidenote: I refuse to a believe a Canadian can't handle some snow). I'll get into the cold later, but let's examine the food and water. You have a very standard hunger and thirst meter. You have a fatigue meter, too, but at the moment, I think sprinting and scripted-event foraging are the only things that really drain your fatigue in any significant degree. Anyway, so you gather food to stuff your face with, and you drink plenty of water found conveniently in toilets all over the abandoned - yet oddly undisturbed - homes (Yum yum!). Run of the mill. It's nothing new, but it's done rather well.The cold: every time you step out of any structure you are stricken with the winter winds and will continuously suffer - for a lack of better terms - damage. You find ways of warming yourself either by ducking into homes, foraging for extra thick coats and gloves, or by starting a fire somewhere (I think). However, as simple as this sounds, the cold feature is what makes me god damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the most. It's one thing to have simple enemies (Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those wolves), and it's another thing to have basic survival needs (technically, Minecraft had a food meter). However, it's another thing to have the entire world be against. Why? Because it gives you a sense of urgency. Taking Minecraft for example, there's no real threat once you've armed yourself well enough; get enough enchants and weapons and you can make the Wither your freakin' butler. In The Long Dark, you can better prepare yourself, but in the end, you're still suffering the cold. It's like holding your breath now versus when you were a kid; you can probably hold your breath longer now because you've better control over you body, but in the end, you still need to breathe. No matter how well you prepare yourself, there's always a threat. There's a sense of urgency and need when you're outside in the harsh cold. You have to complete an objective, or you're just wasting energy in the cold. ""But Jay, you can just catch more food, yeah?""Well, yes, but oddly, there's seems to be a finite amount of resources available. While food may infinitely spawn thanks to deer and rabbits, means to make fire or bullets or such seem to be limited. Clothes, too, aren't entirely infinite. So, there's a vague idea present that may suggest your death is inevitable, and yet, the idea is obscured enough that it gives you hope; that just because one person died on day 15 doesn't mean you will. What does all this mean?The Long Dark doesn't give you a chance to just wander around and waggle your♥♥♥♥♥♥at everything. You have to find shelter; you have to find food; you have to find tinder; and you have to conserve your resources or the last bit of bait you'll have for fishing will be your very own♥♥♥♥♥♥sicle slathered with O'Canada maple syrup.

								The Long Dark is a ""Post-Disaster Survival Experience."" Experience is the only word that can be used to describe this game. Among the rabble of poorly thrown together ""survival"" games that have flooded the market recently, The Long Dark stands out. It's a harrowing, depressing, lonely experience. Something most other survival sims fail to capture. In The Long Dark, you truly feel alone, it's you against nature. Wolves, Bears (and I'm sure more to come) all want your blood, should you wander too close, not only that, but mother nature wants to starve and freeze you to death. The game plays very well, making you choose whether or not to press on for that little longer in the hopes of finding some supplies, or to set up a makeshift camp and pray that you survive the harsh, freezing night. Considering this game is only in early access, and is still in it's alpha stages, I have incredibly high hopes for it, the devs are brilliant, constantly updating, and fixing the game based on customer feedback. The Long Dark is a brilliant survival simulator, with an amazing cell shaded style that completely captivates the player, and immerses them into the cold, bleak environment that will surely cause their end.(Also, it's a survival game with NO ZOMBIES. +100000 to the devs.)			"

								If this game has grabbed your attention at some point and you're wondering whether or not to go for it.  I'd recommend giving it a go.  I got it on special, and it's well worth ten bucks as is.  The fact it should get even better as it moves out of EAP has me rather optimistic.I've only played two hours, so far, on the easiest setting (no wolves from hell) in sandbox mode.  The atmosphere of the game is quite impressive, to the point where wandering round inside a dam, being pretty sure there was nothing that could attack me, still had me nervous as all buggery.My first try consisted of starting a fire, in a cabin, then wandering off, finding my way up a hill, being unable to find any firewood (Ohhh, forage!  And there's a tab for softwood and hardwood.  Found that the next game...) I eventually threw myself off a cliff to avoid freezing to death.  My second attempt is settled into a comfortable rhythm, although my only attempt at longer range exploration nearly ended in disaster when I found myself in near whiteout conditions, with a sprained ankle, and still half an hour away from home.It's one of those games where you're going to spend more time sitting round regaling each other with your 'best' deaths.

But let me say, i've put quite the bit of time into this game and i can say i havent been dissapointed yet. Alot about this game is unique in the sandbox survival game genere. I'm very exited for story mode to come out. I dont know if its likely, but a co-op could be very fun. I have a couple of freinds who play the game and i'm pretty sure they all feel the same way. I would definetly reccomend this game to others and I think this game could have a bright future!			"

								I've owned the early access release of The Long Dark for about a year now and it is hands down one of my favorite games. After longing over 90+ hours on my computer and a couple 50+ more on my girlfriend's, it's fair to say this is my go-to destress game after classes. The game play is lovely, intuitive and quick to learn. Between the various, intersecting levels whether it be the Costal Highway or the more barren Lonely Lighthouse, the level design makes for a fun and diverse gameplay that is well paced. While the specific obstacles may be repetitive (survive the wildlife, hunger, thirst, and cold) how you get past or avoid or overcome those obstacles is completely dependant on your style of gameplay and how you're feeling. My GF loves to go in guns blazing and is enjoying both the rifle and the gun. I enjoy the scavanger aspect and try to avoid wildlife at all costs. We both have a ton of fun with this game and find it rewarding.			"

								So yes this game will be awesome when its done or at least once the story mode is here, but right now i would not recommend buying it because after a few hours, you have pretty much done everything there is to do and there is not really anymore point to keep playing. I still give it a thumb up because the mechanics of the game are really excellent for any survival fan, the visuals fits very well and the sound design is also pitch perfect, so yes you can have high hope for this game, and make sure you buy it once its more complete.

								I hardly ever write reviews, but I felt that this game deserved one.  This is the best early access game I have ever played.  Things I love:- Great setting- Fun ""monster free"" exploring (other than the wolves)- Enjoyable graphicsThings I don't love:- No map? It would be nice to be able to pin locations you want to be your base camp, or areas that you want to explore.  I don't have a problem having to find a map or craft a map, but having one in general would be nice.- Weapons are hard to come by.  I don't expect to have a military weapons drop, but being in the Canadian wilderness, I figure every home that you come upon should have a gun in it.  Still, not a big complaint.Overall I highly reccommend this game.  It is so much fun to just explore.  You have to plan your routes and make sure you have enough food and water to go exploring.  You need to plan ahead in case you get stuck in a blizzard too.  Great game.			"

								First of all, this game is gorgeous. The style is beautiful, and it's well worth taking a glance over the horizon at any time of day.I've only played on the Pilgrim setting so far (The Long Dark's version of an Easy setting where wildlife doesn't attack you) and even without any combat elements this game is incredibly fun. I get excited about finding new places. Surviving is challenging but not so much that you just want to give up (that said, you have to be smart; i wasn't watching where I was going and fell off a cliff, and there's no respawn here.)  And despite knowing I had combat off, walking down the long dark corridor at the Hydroelectic plant made me a little bit uneasy. The atmosphere in the game in unrivaled. "

								I got lost in a snow storm, and stumbled through a forest. I couldn't see 3 feet in front of me. I came to a clearing and discovered an abandoned cabin. In the cabin I warmed myself by the fire and took a rifle from it's spot on the shelf. Stepping outside the cabin the next morning, I spotted a deer in the snowy meadow. I lifted the gun and shot the deer. I inpected the deer, but I had no tool to harvest it. I ventured into the forest, hoping to find something useful. I stumbled upon the body of some pour soul who seemed to have met his match in the wilderness. I took his hatchet, now ready to harvest the venison.Returning to the cabin with some new tools, and some fresh meat, I hunkered down for the night, crafting and cooking, and finally slept for a few hours. I woke up, and decided to get some firewood, after all, I was running low. As I foraged for some logs to feed my fire, I fell over dead, claimed by the long dark.This is a very good game, although unforgiving. Once you get going, it is very satisfying and interesting. The atmosphere is what gets me, though. The erie wind and the calming snow. It is very unsettling. I love it.			"

								Im writing this after my first playthrough.I watched the video and  read many reviews before deciding to play the game .i managed to survive for 2 days and 5 hours. I started out in the highway area.There were several wolves far enough away that i could safely travel the raod and access many houses.i got a decent amount of food and  supplies to keep warm for a bit and keep fed .My main problem was  i was finding mostly canned foods which required a tool to open them .I decided to venture onto the lake where the wolves were because i saw several cabins on small islands and i was hoping for a tool that would be useful .I got halfway onto the lake when 2 wolves spotted me .They started chasing me and as luck was on my side a blizzard came on suddenly and i lost them and made it to the first island with  a cabin .No such luck with any tools save for some sewing repair kits. I continued to go from island to island after resting till dawn from the first night .More supplies but no  knives or axes or even a can opener. I went out onto the ice and  started a fire in an ice fishing shack and cooked some fish and brewed some herbal tea.After the fire died down a wolf found me an attacked me.I fought it off but had to use most of my supplies of healing items to stop the bleeding .I made it back to one of the cabins on a small island and  tore up several unneeded  clothing items to repair my damaged  worn clothes  using the sewing kit .Then i rested till day 2 .At this point i went back to the road and follwed it up to some train tracks .I decided to  follow the tracks .They ended up taking me  to the mystery lake which is the other starting point in the game .My fatigue was getting high and i spotted a dam .I decided to duck inside to see what i might find .I found a lantern immediately  on a shelf and picked it up .As soon as i picked it up , my fatigue level was so high it said you are encumbered and then i heard a howl.I turned around and  a wolf inside the damn attacked and killed me . What i like about the game is the  sound effects and the feeling of definate isolation.You actually do feel like your desperate and you have to watch your stats like hunger and thirst plus fatigue or you will be in trouble.I read the disclaimer about the  wolves intentionally  being made to attack humans ,but stepping inside of a building and instantly being attacked was sort of annoying.All in all  the weather,and the feeling of the game that you need to keep moving and finding  neccesary items to survive is fun and keeps you wandering around hoping you find that 1 needed item to get you through till the next day .I  definately reccomend this game.

								I've spent a decent amount of time playing this game over the past couple of days and i must say I'm a bit blown away by what I've seen so far.  For a long time I've looked for a very realistic survival game that preferably was in first person and this game is definitely it.  It is obvious that the survival elements of this game are extremely well thought out and the player must survive in a manner very similar to what one would have to do in real life. Now I have spent most of my time playing on the ""easiest"" difficulty because I have neglected the violent aspect of the game in favor of pure survival.  This brings me to the wolves.  Throughout the game (even spawning in buildings sometimes) wolves are freaking everywhere.  You still see the beasts in easy mode but they run away (like a wolf would possibly do for real) instead of mauling you to death because thats exactly what they do.  If you can beat the wolf off you'll have likely sustained injuries that makes medicine and first aid required though this seems to be less common than simple death at least for the novice.  In short, this is an excellent game but it can be punishing in multiple ways.			"

								A survival game without the zombies for once!Although still in early access (at the time of this review), this game still provides hours of fun.  It's realistic and unforgiving - just what you would expect of a survival game that plops you into the middle of a Canadian winter.  You must find food, shelter, clean water, and warmth all while steering clear of hungry wolves that make your life much harder - or much shorter.Beware that this is a one-life game!  Once you die, you start over.  There is no going back to the last save before you were mauled by that wolf, or foolishly walked out into a blizzard without pants on.  Let this make you more wary, stealthy, and smart about every action that you take.It's a lonely adventure, as you're the only living person around, but it's worth the trip.  The stylized graphics are really quite beautiful - reminiscent of a painting.			"

Just you smackdab in the middle of the Canadian wilderness in the dead of winter.

								While I'm normally loathe to play, let alone recommend an Early Access title, The Long Dark is not only well into a playable state. Not only is it playable, but it is exactly what a wilderness survival game should be: cold, unforgiving and lonely. Your survival will depend on your ability to make snap desicions, your ability to spend your resources well and your ability to navigate. The Long Dark is not without its flaws however: it is not exceptionally well optimized, I experienced fps drops on a  machine that ran the new Wolfenstein at 50-60 fps, navigation can be a chore as the shadow system is not working properly though there is dynamic lighting, hunting is a little less realistic than it should be and it is a little jarring, on medium difficulty wolves survive .303 headshots. All things told, the game is an 8.5/10 in its current state, and it looks like it's only uphill from there. A definite buy.As of writing this review I played 113 minutes, surviving a 5 days ingame.

								Overall a very good survival game capable of producing some very tense moments, whether it's cresting a hill and coming face-to-face with a hungry wolf or fighting through a snowstorm hoping to find a deer carcass so you don't starve to death.Pros:- Great atmosphere: the map isn't extraordinarily large, but even after 15 hours I still get turned around in snowstorms and get lost.- Very effective UI: looks good, is fairly intuitive, and does everything it needs to do.- High quality voice acting.- Unique and interesting graphics: the environment art especially is very good, frozen corpses could look a little better.Cons:- No jump button: for the most part, you can get where you need to go but there have been times where I've been stuck behind a waist-high obstacle.- Loot spawns could be a little better: most times I find a nice assortment of loot, but from time-to-time I die simply because the loot I need just isn't available (for example: I ran out of water because there literally were no matches / firestarters / magnifying glasses anywhere, I searched for multiple real-life hours and was unable to melt snow or cook tea - just bad luck but could be implemented better).I would definitely recommend, and am looking forward to future updates.

The developers must've spent alot of time balancing and stream-lining because everything you do in the game has so much gravity. There's isn't any hokey half-baked ideas like in alot of the other survival games, you actually feel like you're really surviving, not chopping down trees with a rock and fighting zombies. This is the best survival game so far, I highly recommend it and I'm very interested how the upcoming story-mode will be like. Not that this game needs a story mode, just some more end-game content and I would feel like this is a complete game.			"

								16th days of survival. You can't understand the fear I feel every time I put my nose out of my comfortable cabin, full of supplies so hardly found all around, for explore the wilderness just to be sure that I will live a day more.This game is... Incredible.Even with this singular graphics during the game you'll feel... Cold. Fear. Hungry. Everything that your alter ego is feeling in that moment.As I said you'll be so happy to find a house, a hot place where to sleep, instead of the freezing wilderness full of wild animals that won't show you mercy in an as beautiful as frightening landscape of a Winter in the most remote part of Canada.After this general introduction, a few details: for the moment there isn't the ""Story"" modality (they're working on it), there's only the ""Sandbox"" one, which is a kind of ""you'll generate in a random place in the map you've choose (there are something like 6-7 maps for the moment, but others have yet to come), with a few supplies and... Good luck bro"".There are 3 different difficulties (the Hard one is incredibly hard, I suggest to start with the Normal one).Buy this wonderful artwork and remember: NEVER understimate the distance when you're tired ;)			"

								It took me more than 3 decades of hardcore gaming to find a good game, finally. This shows that you WILL succeed if you never give up and try again and again (except death comes earlier).The Cons 1st: - In EA and alpha stage sandbox mode available only- I'm excited and looking forward to the release / story mode.- Actually this could be a Pro: Although alpha I saw 2 minor bugs only: One time my graphics card behaved funny, fixed by cold restart. At another time a wolf did the Michael Jackson moonwalk before attacking me (maybe not a bug, but a feature?)The Pros: + Nice and sunny ingame weather (most of the time). *hchch*+ Though alpha extremely stable: I experienced not a single crash up to now.+ Grafix works really good, quality and style.+ Balancing ok.+ Fantastic replay value.+ Bombastic sound environment.+ Unbelievable immersion. (Releasing with VR would probably fill the mental hospitals.)The last point makes ""The Long Dark"" really outstanding. For example when I was crawling through the cold night without weapons and hardly clothings, sure a wolf is near but not sure where he is, a plastic bottle next to my computer made a little noise. I was shocked and froozen, my heart stopped and gf thought about to call the doc. So do not play this game with a weak heart!!Or whenever I see the poor bunny in the snare I pray to him. (I do not want him to forgive me, because there is no excuse, but I explain his poor soul that I am in an emergency myself and swear to live  100% VEGAN  again as soon as I'm back into civilization.)I am very sure that you will not regret buying this masterpiece of a game, especially if you can withstand to read about the mechanics in the forums. (It would work like a spoiler and take out fun finding it out yourself what in a real life situation like that you would have to do.)PS.I promise I will never ever eat snow in real life again (because ""the cold would kill me""), but in exchange happily consume every coke i find next to a froozen ice hole at -20 Celsius!!

								     The game may still be in its early stages, but it still maintains consistancy and fluidity while you explore either of the two sandbox modes.  It is a great culture shock to those who want it all when in the game you can only carry so much before you overexert yourself and pass out from exhaustion or become easy wolf-bait, even abandoned buildings become dangerous and succomb to the will of nature.     I enjoy the openness and freedom of the sandbox, but I can't wait for the story mode to be released, though it will most likely be very similar to the sandbox but just with more goals than just staying alive.     The graphics and sound in the game, I might add, are beautiful.  I will willingly freeze my character to watch the sunrise and sunset of the game and listen to the howl o the wind and the wolves while I do so.  All of that can obviously be found by just walking out into the real world, but I find it impressive, to say the least, that all of these sights and sounds have been recreated into a digital format in such a pure way.

								This really is my kind of game. The atmosphere and general gameplay are great and the potential is through the roof. However, as mentioned in other reviews, the wolves really are an annoyance.  You spend half an hour in a building repairing your clothing, searching for supplies, sleeping, eating and drinking. You get yourself in good shape for an expedition to another building, and get mauled to death by a wolf the second you exit the premises. Time and time again. Part of me thinks if I want to break my personal record, i would be better off just staying in doors, dying slowly of thirst or hunger. Because surviving long term requires tools and you need to search everywhere and god help me if I spend more than 20 seconds outside, I've got a wolf round my neck. My last playthrough, i found a rifle for the first time and didn't even get a chance to use it because wolfie basically launched at me as soon as i opened the efin doorIt's a shame because every other aspect of the game, I love. Hopefully, the devlopers will adjust some scales so that i occasionally die a non-wolf-related death.			"

								FIrst off; This is an EARLY ACCESS GAME. As with any game in development it is not perfect, however I highly reccomend it even while it is in this stage because watching a game change over time and get better is amazing, and it's even more amazing if you are able to contribute to that process through the forums. Secondly, buying early access games means you're helping fund the developer to finish their vision!TL;DR: The Long Dark is a good looking game with a lot of potential to be hugely addictive. It is a good buy for the person who enjoys atmospheric games and/or survival games. Now, onto The Long Dark.So far in The Long Dark I've only played around with Pilgrim mode because I wanted to feel my way around the controls and the gameplay first, and I am really enjoying it! Visuals:The visuals are clearly unfinished but they have a certain allure in the state they are now. I really enjoy that everything has the feeling of a watercolour with foggy blocks of colour and overlapping textures. I really hope they stick with this art style as they update the textures in later builds, making it more refined and varied, but staying within the realm of expression over realism.  The animals, when you manage to come across them, are a little bland, but that's a minor point. Light sources are kind of inconsistent. Outdoors and inside of lookout towers you can see the sun and the incoming light is correlated to it, but once inside a house or other seperately rendered building the sun is irrelevant and every house is either lowly lit during the day and not lit at all at night. Audio:The sound in this game is actually very good. There is occassionally background music that helps set the mood, but usually there is nothing but you and the wilderness ambience. For some people this may be a turn off, but it is very easy to play your own music in the background (as I sometimes do), but for the most part it helps put you into the survival mindset. There is a lot of quiet contemplation as you walk around the empty wilderness trying to find food and shelter, and exploring to kill the boredom. One issue I've noticed is that you hear all of the sounds from outside even when indoors. In later builds it would be nice if the wind of a storm is cut back when inside, but increases when you get near windows and doors to indicate the storm, etc. Controls and Menus:The controls are a little unintuitive at first. Coming from Skyrim, for example, has me wanting to press Space Bar or E to interact with things, but although you move with WASD you interact with the mouse buttons. Maybe that's just me, but I hope to see the UI improved over time. The menus are a great start to be sure, but something about them is lacking for me. I am excited to see how they progress!Gameplay:In game the pattern can get a little repetative; find a building, loot it, sleep in it, move on, find another building, loot it, etc.Until you reach a point where you have sustainable food and materials you do a lot of that pattern. Even then, it's still more interesting than making a single base for several days. As of right now there are no boredom killers and that's the biggest hole this game faces. When the need ot survive is there, it's interesting; while exploring, it's interesting; when just passing time, it's easy to lose interest in. All of this being said, it's worth checking out if you're into survival, mood, exploratory, and atmospheric games. It'll definitely be one to watch out for as it finishes!			"

								The Long Dark is one of the only games I've ever written a review on Steam for. Why? Because this is a game that deserves to be played. The survival genre has seen a boom in the last year, but none so eloquently capture the real struggle of surviving in a harsh, unforgiving environment such as The Long Dark. This is a game that - unlike most - can and should be played without a walkthrough, taking in the breathtakingly stylized visuals, scavenging for food and supplies, and figuring out how to survive in the wilderness all on your lonesome. If you want to play a game where your main objective honestly and truly is to survive, this is the game to do it.Having said that, you should know this game is in Easly Access and in the alpha stage. You should expect to find bugs, and you may be put off by the learning curve associated with the game. In the current build (v .183), there are several complaints with the AI (Hinterland doesn't seem to understand what balance is), as well as some real issues (e.g., AI behavior not being reset such that a wolf will be in a constant state of aggression at the bottom of the stairs even after resting for hours). Because of this, the game can be incredibly unforgiving in a way that may or may not seem fair. As well, story mode is not implemented yet, and the sandbox has ""only"" two maps. This isn't much of an issue, as the equipment you find acts on a weighted-chance loot table, where the gear is randomized with certain stuff more likely to show up in certain containers (e.g., you're more likely to find a flare in a metal box in an industrial area than in a cabinet in the kitchen). However, there is a noticable lack of wood-burning stoves in buildings despite this being the cold wilderness.The mechanics are actually quite nice, such that you organically learn to do new things (as a player). There is a certain level of ""skills,"" such that your chances of starting a fire are low to start, until you do it enough and it becomes easier. However, from the player perspective, it works very organically: you, like the real you, slowly learn the right ways to approach situations, when the right time to go out and forage is, how to find starters and fuel for fires, and so on. As well, all of these actions take in-game time and it becomes imperative to properly manage what you're doing for the day, planning resource gathering and management to maximize time spent alive. The Long Dark makes me excited because it does what I've been looking for in other games. It makes me afraid to leave the safety of the cabin, despite knowing that I have to if I want to survive; it forces you to face its world, and doesn't coddle you. If this game is on your wishlist, you should just buy it now. It's worth the asking price, especially if it's on sale.			"

								Great game. Even though it's early access sandbox - I found myself spending 4+ hours the first night. Great mix of Reward / Exploration / Loot / Frustration mechanic. Makes you want to try again from scratch even if you spend an hour (real time) surviving and harvesting goods only to be taken down by a lone wolf.			"

								Just plain awesome. I started out on the most difficult setting thinking ""no zombies, no PvP, how hard can this be?"" Well, its  effing hard. I didnt last long. So then I kicked it down to the medium difficulty and still didnt last too long. Im determined to stay away from the easy difficulty.I thought this game was going to be textbook survival and I didnt think I would see anything that was too new and different. I wont giveaway the best aspects of the game but certain features like being able to ""harvest"" even the smallest amount of helpful material, even from your own clothes, is nicely done.Character movements and actions are fluid (one of my pet peeves). So that meaning running and walking both feel like they are the right pace. The crafting menus are thorough and the medical HUD (when you pull it up) looks nice. Ive only put an hour or so into the game but it does a great job of creating that uncontrollable urge to progress further; no matter how far youve made it, its never good enough. You always want to find more items and craft more things. Only because you have to constantly plan ahead. Time goes fast. And with time you will deteriorate.I got this on sale for $10 and I think it was well worth it. If I was a real survival game junky then even hte full price of $20 wouldve been just fine. Also, more options are planned. Right now, only one mode of game play is running, the solo sandbox.			"

								Very nice survival simulation.I travel almost all over the two maps and here is the list of objects or  function i suggest to include into the game without reducing the challenge for survive.Racket snowshoes will improve travel on snow, reducing calories consomption, they can be crafted from gut and wood or find on corps or in house.Cross country shi will be usefull for travel downhill or on flat surface improving speed,  but will be high calories consomption going uphill. Outside road or trail shiing will be also more dangerous to fall from rock or crash on trees.The rabitts are white in winter to be harder to see, create white clothe will help to avoid wolf or other predator if any.Map created from the travel you already do and location you discover will be a must.It is very hard to fight wolf, they kill me so many time before i find a way to manage them roughly two attacs on threes, why no be able to craft a mace or a cudgel from a hard piece of wood, or a tree branch, i suppose it will be my first weapon if i will be lost in a forest.Use a torch craft with wood, cloth, and grease collected from animal or oil find in house will help to travel during night and scare the wolf.All theses proposals are just for fun and to share with other players, the game is very pleasent and addictive as it is now. Realy good work.			"

								A very interesting game, in the vein of most of the survival games these days, but this is the best that I've come across. It has all of the bits and pieces to make it incredibly immersive, from shifting weather, to monitoring your character's body temperature, to making sure you have enough calories to weather a bad storm. If you're going to get a survival game, this is a good choice. My only complaint is that getting firewood is an automatic action in the menu; I would prefer to actually wield a hatchet and find trees.			"

								Realistic survival where you will die after finding a gun and a bunch of food by a wolf. The death is real and you don't respawn with all your items. I love this game and have played a fair bit. It's a lot of waiting around for the weather to calm down or risking death to go explore some more. You can die in so many ways and it is one of my goals to find every possible way to die. The days can be dirasticly different from day one being calm to full on blizzard. If you don't like these types of games then this isn't probably for you but I don't really like these types of games usually but I love this one. So Try it out for yourself if it sounds interesting. It can be very slow at times but if you like exploring this is fun. The only real thing that I would like to change at the momment is you can't have two players in the same game. There is no multiplayer. I would not like it if it was Massive multiplayer but two player would be interesting. Especially if you both spawned in different places.  It would feel less lonely that way. Or put in a dog/wolf you could take care of and it would help you. That would help if it never gets 2 player.			"

								(Early Access Review)Currently this is the best early access survival game on the market. No zombies, aliens, or multiplayer to be found here. The sole focus of the game is surviving in a harsh and desolate climate. You are more worried about how many calories you are burning and how quickly your body's temperature is dropping than a zombie or another player murdering you. This is a welcome change of pace from other survival games if you ask me. The graphical fidelity might not be AAA quality, but in my opinion it looks beautiful in its own minimalistic way. The developers update it pretty regularly and I think they can be trusted (they won't run off with your money and never update the game). Worth the asking price if you are into survival games. Watch out for wolves!			"

								To call this game immersive just doesn't do it justice. There are so many details that make The Long Dark what it is.You shiver when you're cold. Your stomach grumbles when you're hungry. You move slower going uphill or against the wind, and breathe hard after a run. You are in the environment, you are part of it.You have to balance the rewards of exploration against the dangers. Wolves will hunt and kill you. You will get lost and freeze to death in a blizzard. But you need to find the necessary tools for survival: clothing, weapons, medicine.There's a sense of progression without the usual tropes of XP leveling and unlocking skills. You'll learn more about survival, about the map, about your limitations. You'll settle down in a homestead, find a gun, stock up on food and supplies. You can start to live comfortably. But don't get cocky; make one mistake and you'll die, and all that you've worked for will mean nothing.This game is poetry.			"

								I've played this game for about 16 hours now.  I picked it up on steam sale and it was totally worth the price.  I'm not sure it is worth the full $20 in its current state but I'm hoping for more maps/wildlife/foraging/crafting options as the game develops. But for what I paid, this game has been well worth my time.  I thoroughly enjoy the one-life-to-live-so-don't-die aspect.  It made for a few 'intense' moments. I experienced a couple minutes of dismay when I got lost in a blizzard while ice-fishing near the coast. I've been filled with dread listening to the howls of wolves and then retreating from two of the beasts approaching from different directions -- forcing me to a new map in the midst of howling winds. I experienced the rush of relief when beating a wolf to the door of my cabin and lunging inside just in the nick of time.I don't mind the lack of mulit-player in this game.  It wasn't quite built for it.  But I've swapped several stories with a coworker by the watercooler as we commiserate over our lack of food, ammo, firearms, etc.  I'm looking forward to more developments and the storyline as this game leaves Alpha.

The best survival game on steam....or...well...on anything.Yes, this is very opinionative, but let me tell you why I love this game so much and what could be improved about it, hopefully in the future.Pros:	 Simplistic yet beautiful environment, while snapshots may show it looking kinda plain, they also do no justice for the pure beauty of the game and its situations. Holding out a lantern while standing on a hill and looking out to huge, tree covered mountains while the sunsets certainly looks really good. Realistic. The most realistic survival game I've played to date, it has no zombies or cannibalistic tribesmen. But rather nature itself. Yeah, wolves and bears may not actually attack people, but a wolf attack happens more often than being cannibalized by demons/zombies. Every single thing you do matters in your life or death. Plan ahead. This game is almost all about planning, think about where you're going before you head out, look at the weather and make sure its clear if you're going for a long haul, check your equipment to make sure you can get there and back without freezing to death. Take enough food and water to last you for a while, no one knows if a blizzard might come as soon as you make it to your destination. Realistic crafting. You really earn your bows, and since you wouldn't really know how to make a gun irl, thats the case in the game. Each deer killed was deservingly so and gives you a good amount of meat for several days. It actually updates, they didn't dump a half broken game on you and say that they're not going to fix it unlike tons of other games that are on early access. Updates come about once every 1-2 months and they are pretty damn big, adding things as game changing as bows, a smelting system, new maps, ect. They're not just ""Here's something small"" every so often then stopping and never returning. Some what difficult, but in the best kind of way. Keeping everything together and living through all of the possible threats (Freezing to death, starving to death, staying awake too long and dying from exaustion, dehydration, falling through ice, wolf/bear attack, ect.) can prove a huge challenge to pass through, but each day you get through feels like you actually made it through a real day on your own in the wilderness. Killing a wolf and taking its pelt, guts and meat not only feeds you for several days but you can craft great gear out of the pelt and guts to live even longer.Cons:	 I've had some, very very slight performance issues, so I'd reccommend you have a computer that isn't actually a toaster. Even still, my computers been breaking and not so good to start with, but I run it just fine, so it doesn't require much to run decently. Perma-death. Its an aspect of games that I don't really enjoy, I understand why its in the game, because it adds to the realism, but I don't enjoy losing progress in games. But if you don't mind that kind of thing, this could be considered a ""Pro"" to you. Its done very well to make you feel as if you lost your life was due to your own mistakes, so there is no unfair deaths. That and theres leaderboards and achievements for people that like to really get high in the number of days that they stay alive, some even getting over the year mark. But as someone that plays this somewhat casually, it'd be nice to have an option of living after a wolf tears me to shreds. "

								There is a good game here. It is innovative. It is done extremely well in spots. As far as the survival genre, it has the potential to be in a class by itself. After saying that though, you should know what it is you are getting into. In places the game is exciting, immersive, and beautiful. It can actually give a jolt when a wolf drops in unexpectedly. The buildings that you find while exploring look beautiful. The landscape, when it is free of trees and the developer put some thought and design into it, is very beautiful and thought provoking. Walking into a clearing and seeing the sun rising while a flock of birds flys over you in a v formation is pretty cool, indeed.  Where the game does not do so well is what it seems to have the most of. The trees can span for what feels like actual miles. What seems to make that fact worse is there is single digit tree models. Therefore you go through literally hours and hours of looking at exactly the same tree. Take the fact that the encumberance mechanic makes you walk like you are carrying a gallon of milk with your sphincter, and you can see where this might get pretty boring and frustrating really quick. Also, no map function that I am aware of. The weather keeps throwing blizzards that leave you snow blind. Forget about setting a base and then exploring. Get ready to get lost, see the same thing and double back, see the same thing and double back, see the same thing and double back, etc for infinity. I'm sure with a little more investment you could possible set your own landmarks or drop food on the ground to make a trail. But dang, I just wanted to play a game. I found a perfect little base (Max's last stand). It was great. But I didn't have the rifle and needed a couple other tools. Went walking for a bit feeling confident I could find my way back. Next thing you know blizzard hits, walk for 2 hours seeing the same trees, sprain ankle by bumping a tree, become hypothermic, hit by blizzard again, weight limit decreases to 15, start walking like I'm keistering a pine cone, etc. No rifle found, never found my base again, found bow with one arrow, shot twice with no reticule, bow broke, could probably draw all three tree models from memory. Quit game.  I like this game. I would recommend it as I feel there is enough here for the twenty dollar price tag. But if you expect to have fun then you might be disappointed. Fun isn't necessarily what I felt I got out of it. It would be fun if there was more to find while exploring, and less trees. Or more variation. Also a map function is almost expected in this type of game. Not to have one really sucks. It wouldn't really break the immersion if where you had already discovered was mapped, a la minecraft. Setting up your base would be much easier this way, and would lead to prolonged gameplay/ greater enjoyment for the user. Traipsing through hours of trees to find more hours of trees just isn't fun to me. A reticule for the bow would also be nice. Also for the twenty miles of trees, is there only one dang rifle? I found so many rifle rounds. No rifle. I found a huge farm. I was like ""This is it, no farm in the wilderness exists without a rifle"". No rifle. Another cool base. Dropped all my gear into a bookbag lying around. Forgot to pick up my bedroll. Left. Remembered bedroll. Went back to find it. Never saw farm again. Wandered for hours till sleep deprivation. Weight limit decreased again. Testes attached to Mjolnir. Also work that encumberance out, please. My goodness, once you have close to the full set of tools, you are already at the limit. A few food items, some wood, and instant turtle. It does have it's moments. With some improvements, could be best in class.			"

								Probably the best pure survival game I've ever played. The realism is impeccable as far as video games go the cold and lack of resources is rather immersive considering the situation your in. In real life you wouldn't just find cabins full of edible food and wardrobes of warm clothes. Everything you get in this game you appreciate. Every hurdle makes you feel as though nothing can stop you until you need to hunt and a blizzard hits. Darkness is honestly scary and its not because it has monsters but the weather is a force to be reckoned with. Your true enemy is the cold and poor decisions. Anyone who wants a challenge and love problem solving and hard choices this game is for you.			"

								This game is definitely fun if you like the idea of a simple survival game that merely pits you against nature and nothing 'supernatural'. I really enjoyed the game and learning things from trial and error, such as which direction the stats bar is indicating you are freezing or hungry. There are some things I don't like a whole lot about the game as well, such as it seems some fires don't do anything to help with warmth. The potbelly stove for instance didn't contribute an ounce to my warmth. It was outside in a fishing shack, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't contribute to warmth at least a little.Anyways, I think the game is headed in the right direction, gives you some pretty good options and quite a bit a freedom. I'd like to see the ability to pick up random trash and use it torwards something useful. Cause unless I thought there was absolutely no way that trash would help me survive I would be picking it up and figuring out something for its use.			"

								The Long Dark- here's my honest reviewAt first(I bought this game last year early December), I thought this game was the best. I loved the aspect of surviving and dodging hurtles that were thrown at you. But after a while it was the same, loot the same houses and push on. The thing that was the saddest about the game to me was how, I believe, one of the maps were so tiny that maps had been created marking where everthing is. But after awhile, I grew bored of this game, it was the same story, either I was forced to go hunt or I would freeze to death in the middle of the forest. The thing that I wasn't really aware of when I bought this game was how you earned items. In other game such as Rust, you must work for them and harvest say wood. While in the Long Dark, you could hunt or simply loot an abandoned house that had full cupboards and such.Pro's:-Very fun to play at first-The game provides a real-life aspect(*See con)-Game doesn't lag as much as other gamesCon's:-Repeats itself-Everything is given to you *-The map's are small and you can just google print outs of these maps to pretty much find the 'Best Houses'All in all, I hate to say it, this game seems like a zombie game. *Hate rolls in* Yeah, I know how it says it isn't, but this game has the perfect atmosphere. Zombies could hide in the attics, they could freeze 'hence this game is winter'. I would even get overjoyed if you guys said you added zombies but they froze to death and are under layers of snow, so you could be walking and then you'd be forced to fight a frozen-half dead creature un-willfully. Sounds weird but I like it.I'm neutral on the Yes/No reccomend, as that's whether you buy it or not in the end, so I'll leave it at yes,			"

								This game, even in an alpha state, is a game that I stand by fully. No other game has pitted the player against only nature itself and has made the threat seem so present. The smaller and finer mechanics of the game really makes you realize that even if you have all you need, it will inevitably be not enough. Kepp up the amazing work Hinterland, I look forward to seeing what this games potential will truly be.			"

								I'll start off by saying the visuals are amazing. The survival mechanics are very in depth and well-integrated into the environment you play in. Things such as wind chill, the amount of calories it takes to chop up a table for firewood, the fact that you cant just start a fire with one match and a log (you need a starter, tinder, and kindling, and even then sometimes you get unlucky and it wont't start), all make it apparent that there are some great minds behind this project.However, it is brutal. If you don't get some sort of purchase and I mean fast, the game will destroy you. In some ways this is good, seeing as they are going for realism, but in other ways its a bit too fast. The hunger and thirst guages, for example, get to critical levels after pretty much every time you sleep, which you have to do or else your exhaustion guage goes up. I get the idea that they want you to constantly be absorbed by a feeling of desperation, but when my character is on the brink of death from starvation after one day without food (people can go up to three weeks without food), it actually pulls me out of my immersion by drawing my attention to something not very realistic, reminding me that I'm only playing a game. Of course, once you start starving and can't sleep enough to restore your exhaustion guage, your survivor is basically moving at a crawl, which makes it almost impossible to find anything that will keep you alive, especially since your vision becomes so blurry you can't even see where your cursor is to pick up anything. At this point, I'm already out of my immersion state, so I usually just quit the game before I die, and that's the biggest problem. The whole point of the game is to stick it out as long as you can before the long dark, but there's such a tiny chance of you making a comback once you're at this point that you don't want to bother crawling around for five minutes, unable to see and waiting for your health to disappear.The reason I do reccommend this game is for everything else that there is, and for the awesomeness that I believe is yet to come. In the meantime, I sincerely hope some of these problems are patched, because it kills me to see a game so nearly perfect but not quite there.			"

								The Long Dark manages to make me incredibly anxious the entire time I'm playing. I often find myself swearing profusely at my screen as I inch across the snowy wilderness, angry at myself for not having left my resource-collecting expedition just a minute earlier than I had so that I might have missed the storm that caused me to walk for ten minutes in the wrong direction. I find it incredibly easy to immerse myself in the experience of being alone in the wilderness, and that's what I like most about this game. Survival is difficult, and once you're dead, that's it. No starting from a save point, no retreiving that rifle that it took you a week to find, you have to begin again entirely. And it's by no means an ""easy"" game. It takes planning, and a great deal of wandering around at the brink of death to get good at this game.  "

								As a growing genre of Y2K, survival games have shown to be a unique new type of gameplay. What sets The Long Dark apart from most, however, is that where many attempt to imitate minecraft, or overwhelmingly focus on crafting, or thinking survival == zombie apocalypse. Instead, The Long Dark focuses on an abandoned, frozen world where the player needs to survive not just enemies with increasingly powerfull weapons, but rather nature itself, as thirst, hunger, sleep and warmth play a vital role in this game, and every playthrough you'll learn new, different approaches. Well worth the play.			"

Making this game multiplayer might actually be a bad thing, and not just because of raiders like in Legacy Rust. However, it is seriously a fun game to play. If you love survival games, and do not like a set path or goal, this game is for you, my friends. Buy it, play it, and wear a big heavy wool coat...it's gonna be a cold, long, dark night.			"

								Realistic survival where you will die after finding a gun and a bunch of food by a wolf. The death is real and you don't respawn with all your items. I love this game and have played a fair bit. It's a lot of waiting around for the weather to calm down or risking death to go explore some more. You can die in so many ways and it is one of my goals to find every possible way to die. The days can be dirasticly different from day one being calm to full on blizzard. If you don't like these types of games then this isn't probably for you but I don't really like these types of games usually but I love this one. So Try it out for yourself if it sounds interesting. It can be very slow at times but if you like exploring this is fun. The only real thing that I would like to change at the momment is you can't have two players in the same game. There is no multiplayer. I would not like it if it was Massive multiplayer but two player would be interesting. Especially if you both spawned in different places.  It would feel less lonely that way. Or put in a dog/wolf you could take care of and it would help you. That would help if it never gets 2 player.			"

								The first time I purchase an early access and a survival game on Steam, and I'm not disappointed.It's a very atmospherical survival simulator in just about the worst of circumstances.The only other people you'll encounter in this melancholic game, are corpses.It emulates the loneliness of trying to survive on your own in these unforgiving weather conditions.Managed to kill a wolf, got so excited I forgot everything and died from the elements while butchering the animal xDWhile funny, this would not happen irl, you would quit long before that, go seek shelter, warm up, eat something, drink something and then return to the carcass. Not suddenly 'wake up' from butchering a few seconds before death, only to helplessly watch yourself succumb and die. The video is not from the wolf incident, but from my very first time playing, I did just about everything wrong and froze to death after only 6 hrs of ingame time :D My next game was 20 hrs, the one after that I survived longer than a day.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34ht3adwHNg "

								Great game for the survival genre. I have enjoyed it so far. I actually pirated the game before hand to try it out and ended up buying it on here. Once the game gets bigger, I suggest a demo or something.Pros-Graphics - really nice artistic type look instead of the usual gritty realistic visuals-Realism - you have to watch what you eat, make smart decisions, even one wolf encounter at the wrong time can leave you dead-Constant updates- The devs are constantly updating the game which is good to see for Early Access. Keep it up guys!Cons-Realism - it would be nice to have actual animations when doing things in the game instead of just loading bars. this disrupts immersion some for me.-Can be monotonous- Once you die a couple times, the exploration aspect has worn off a bit. The game didn't get really fun for me until I found the hunting rifle. -Non Procedural world- A random generated world be amazing for this game.  After you've seen the same place 20 times after 20 deaths, it's not so exciting anymore.Overall, I enjoy the game. Is it worth 20 dollars? Maybe. Once the game is released, yes. Of course with Early Access, you're usually investing in the game instead of buying the finished product. I made the investment and am happy so far. Can't wait to see how much more the game evolves!Thoughts and suggestions--One big gripe I have is with the temperature and freezing. I moved to Canada from South Carolina, USA and the -5C weather doesn't make me freeze to death. Even the -20C weather wasn't terrible as long as body parts were covered. May just be me being nitpicky but that seems off to me.-Needs random generated or dynamic world at the least, either that or y'all will end up adding plenty more regions.-More content as always			"

								Overall... i have a lot to say, but dont have enough patience to write it. so ill focus on the basics. The game its self is great. the graphics are quite enjoyable, and the sounds are on point. With that being said, and i know this is an early access game but this is my review pertaining to this moment, there are a lot of improvements. A couple times when i was running through the woods i would just randomly sprain an ankle. I would have some painkillers to counteract that but it got annoying after the third time. The map size overall is a little disapointing as well. I found myself walking in circles a good amount of times within the hour and a half i played. I could also add that I never saw a wolf once in that time period, and that seems to be the main component for fear and survival in this game. but aside from all of that i would love to keep up with the game to see if it improves, which i know it will. It happened with the Forest whenever i got it Early Access. It sucked. Everything glitched and i fell through the floor, you couldnt build anything really. Now, a couple months later, you can build treehouses! and they dont glitch!!! Theres not even a story mode in the forest and theres one coming up in the actual release of The Lonely Dark. So my suggestion is if you like a game to a certain extent to where you dont mind it being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the beggining, then go ahead and get it. but be prepared. if you dont like it that much then just wait a little while. I recomend this game and really enjoy it and might be playing a couple more hours. Great game, Needs a lot more work. Keep it coming. "

								The Long Dark is a fantastic addition to the survival genre; instead of there being zombies or mutants its just mother nature, with a few predators, against an honourable surviver of a dystopian post-apocalyptic barren Earth - you!Pros: . No zombies or mutants. Excellent theming and inconrous use of corpes.Realistic nature of game positively influences the player's actions allowing them to develop an increasingly accurate representation of the western Canadian wilderness.Cons:.It is often very difficult or impossible to combat aggressive animals esp. wolves.Several bugs and glitches were noticed e.g. the superman-like ability to resist health damage when jumping whilst bending knees..The game is still being worked on by its developers and it may take several months until its full debugged release..Not Really a con, but in my opinion this game should have stayed as a PC game and not become an Xbox One GameOverall I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good survival game without zombies, mutants or an Early Access fiasco.9/10 As I feel that this game's advantages far outweigh its deficiencies.

								I bought this game in late 2014 in hopes for a new survival game.  I got exactly what I expected.This game is an amazing game to begin with, and the new features and updates add even more amazing content.  I would recomned this game to anyone who likes survival and the outdoors, and does not get frustrated when you die quickly because of your unkowlage of game mechanics.  Also you have to be pretty patient becuase there is alot of waiting in this game.  It isnt anything like Minecraft were its unrealistic and blocky.  It is true wilderness survival with no creative or cheat mode.  It honestly takes awhile to master, but when you do, it is so rewarding.  If you are thinking about buying this game, dont hesitate if you are into this sorta stuff.  I have seen so many people buy the game and say it is stupid and stuff.  That means you do not like realistic outdoors experience and do not like to wait alot.  The graphics are pretty demanding so you will need a decent computer. Honestly this game is more of a beautiful kinda game that is meant to be taken in rather than played.  The music is very relaxing (but creepy at some points) and the scenery is so artful yet deadly.  The graphics are almost like a painting rather than real life but that adds an element of beauty.  It is so in depth about survival that every move determins you future.  10/10 defenetly buy it if your into survival games.			"

								I awake from a tragic plane crash to realize I am stranded in a snowy forest. I am already starting to freeze from the brutal temperatures of this world. Due to my knowledge from most survival games, I decided to try knocking down a tree. I came to realization this is not any survival game, but an extravagant and realistic adventure. Suddenly, I notice that I will die of hypothermia if I don't take action. I begin to run off into the unknown to hear a dreadful snarl to my right. A wolf leaps upon me leaving me to fight it with my hands. My blood began to trail behind me in the snow after managing to scare it off. My hearing begins to fade as my senses drift off. After 1 hour of being in a snowy forest, I die.Time to try again.I awake in the same situation, in a new area, mainly surrounded by large hills. The sight before me was fantastic. There were many downed trees and stumps in a clearing. There was a deer, a mountain, and upon that mountain, a manmade structure. At last! I have found shelter! Within the viewing tower, was a rifle, medical supplies, a fireplace, bed, and more. I helped myself by making a fire with some supplies I found and resting. I felt invincible. That was until I heard noises outside. Frozen in panic, I ducked down, took out my rifle, and snuck outside. I shortly concluded that the sounds were just the wind causing the building I was in to creak. As soon as I felt safe, in the distance, I heard the howl of wolves. I realized I ate my food, used up my firewood, and had nowhere to run. The structure I was living in surely wouldn't support my life, judging by the fact there was a man's corpse at the bottom of the stairway. I had to leave.After wandering around, the cold and my poor injured ankle from taking a fall off a short cliff, there seemed to be no hope. As soon as I was about to give up, a hidden hatch came into my view. My excitement began to climb higher than ever, as I climbed down the ladder.As I type this to you now, I am in the underground room underneath the hatch. My food and water supply is efficient. The amount of adventure and fun that I have picked up from this game has led me to write a review telling you how much I love it. I am positive I will continue playing along with the development and following the full release.Keep in mind, this game is in the alpha stage, as an early access game, and has a great performance. If you may think there is not enough in this game, I can see your reasoning, but there is still an excellent future for The Long Dark. I still think there are an incredible amount of objectives and strategies that may be used for entertainment.Also, keep in mind that when I wrote this review, I was in the middle of my first time playing it, and only, at the time, had about 20 minutes in it.  Plus, a story mode is planning to be added.This is NOT a stereotypical survival game. Great graphics, (for an alpha game). No zombies. No punching down trees. There are realistic features and it expresses the challenging aspects of survival. You don't just have the danger of starving or dehydrating, but you may be attacked by wild animals, you may die of hypothermia, or be crushed by something collapsing. Who knows.Trust me. This is a masterpiece, and if you love survival games, or any games, The Long Dark is for you.			"

								Ok so here's my review.Pros:1. A lot of potential if the developer does it right2. Somewhat realistic? It has hunger, thirst, warmth and  energy (calories) and tiredness which affect each other in one one or another.3. It's quite good for an alpha release.4. Graphics are cute. For me.5. Morbid. I shudder to think of me scavenging dead bodies just to survive. But we gotta do what we gotta do right?6. Helpful player community which helps alleviate Con#3. I wouldn't have survived my currently running three days/two nights long sandbox if not for you guys. I don't have a good sense of direction in games.Cons:1. No Multiplayer (idk if it's planned, i tend to ignore the plans of devs unless they present an actual date to release something because programming is hard)2. It's taking a long time for actual release.3. The game itself is not for noobs (like me) because of the steep learning curve.4. No tutorial which leads to Con#3. Luckily, there are guides.			"

								I've been playing this game for a while. Thus I can reccomend for everyone. It's very atmospheric and gives you this feeling of beeing alone in the harsh environment. The struggle of surviving, and everlasting cold snowy winter, with sudden blizzards. Your main goal is to survive the overwhelming cold, and sometimes a very ravenous wolf. Further the game will have a story mode, and sandbox will have AI npc's. It's still in alpha build, although playing over 20 hours, and haven't found a single bug, game never crashed. Developers keep updating the game, making it better and better.			"

								This game is absolutely awesome, even more so if you consider it's just in an Early-Access and Alpha stage! The atmosphere is amazing, and sometimes even exhilarating (when a  wolf is somewhere near you or chases you for example). The question that always comes to mind with this game is: what will I find around this corner or over that hill? I can't wait to get a story-mode in this game, or more maps in the sandbox mode!Another thing: I didn't find a single gameplay bug so far, which is really amazing if you compare it to some AAA-games that are full of bugs. If I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 8.5/10 or even 9/10, even before the actual release!Keep up the good work here! :D			"

								This game is by far the most perfect survival game. I've always loved the survival aspects of other games and wished there was a game that focused just on survival. Well, here is it. The atmosphere that consumes you as soon as you enter the game captivates the sheer panic of a survival situation. You're alone and you have the whole world to yourself, do you really think you can survive?I love the whole idea of the Sandbox mode. It gives you a chance to do a little better each time. Items seem to appear randomly after each new turn so each new game differs. My only problem with this is I'm afraid it will eventually be too repetitive after so many play-throughs. This happened for me playing Don't Starve, a game that has a similar style of gameplay.However, unlike Don't Starve, The Long Dark is beautiful and the atmosphere that completely engulfs you cannot be praised enough. When you first enter the game you have no idea what's going on, but you see the snow surrounding you and the wind blowing against you and it almost makes you feel cold. It puts you in a state of mind of survival. The soundtrack is morose and melancholic, appearing almost randomly at intervals, furthering pulling you into thought of your inevitable demise.My biggest hope is that the developers listen to suggestions of what Alpha fans think can improve the game, with only a few minor tweaks this game could easily become one of the greatest survival games of all time, if not #1. The only issues I have with the game are minor glitches and lack of content, nothing that couldn't be fixed with the future developement of this game. I really hope the developers are smart about this game, look through a fan's perspective and create content that truly matters to us. I'm extremely excited to see what the future of this game has to offer.The Long Dark is challenging and fun. If you're a fan of survival games or just survival in general, you need to check this game out. The graphics are pretty good, but the well place audio really takes center stage. However still in the early stages of development, it has extreme potential to become something extraordinary.  "

Early Access Review
								After 75 hours of play, I guess I can say that it is a really good one. At first, you have to understand how to survive: the first few tries are extremely hard and seems like it's impossible to survive a week in this environnment. But when you undrstand some basics rules, you can make it to a 100 days without problem. And it's at that moment that the game become boring. At that point, the only interest is to know how many days you can survive doing exactly the same thing over and over again. So, the pros:- You have at least 20 hours of play trying to figure out what to do to survive. The anxiety that comes from it is really awesome. And that is the main reason I recommend this game. - The map is really good and fun to explore.- The developpers listen to the fans to improve this game and every updates are made in the right direction so far. - Really good immersive environment. Cons:- You can survive way to long if you know how to avoid the wolves. So it's not that much a battle against nature, but a battle to avoid wolves, you should not die from anything except that. - For now, every ways to get food (trapping, hunting and fishing) gets repetitive and boring quickly. - Alpha stage... it can change a lot in the next few months. - Most of the time, you sleep or walk and nothing is happening. - Lack of ressources diversity for now and not many things to craft. Overall, good games, that should continue to improve. I recommend it mostly for the first 15 to 20 first hours of play, after that, it depends on how much you like to do the same thing over and over again.			"

								What a wonderful game! I'm really looking forward to the finished release of this. The sandbox is amazing. Having said that, I have some comments after about 15 hours of playing in standard mode: 1. Lots of other people have mentioned the balance issue with wolves, so I won't go into it except to say that I broadly agree with them. I especially think that if I win a fight with a wolf, it should not be able to automatically run away. I earned that pelt, damn it. 2. If I find a human corpse, there should be an option to butcher it. Yes, this is distasteful, but when you're starving meat is meat. History certainly bears this out. 3. More flexible crafted clothing options would be nice. For example, I could make a coat out of deer, wolf, or even rabbit (with a whole lot of rabbits), and each kind of pelt would have different properties. 4. It shouldn't be necessary to melt snow before consuming it as water. I'm a veteran hiker and I can tell you from experience that eating snow hydrates. It also leaves you feeling colder, obviously. I recommend allowing people to eat snow off the ground, but with a risk of hypothermia (and the usual possibility of bacterial illness). 5. More diversity of animals. Bears, musk-oxen, foxes, caribou, and lynx are all found in northern Canada. It would also be a nice touch to add in tern nests with eggs as a discovered food source.			"

								So I played a few games on easy to get a feel for what I had to do, played my first REAL game (on the med difficulty) and died real quick. So I get a feel for it and play my actual first real game.I move around, avoiding the wolves while I check huts on the lake for supplies. I get lucky and grab some firewood and the like, clothes to stay warm, etc. Even a shotgun (though no ammo). I keep moving carefully, checking houses and cleaning them for supplies. No ammo, no weapons, few tools. I keep playing safe, being a newbie, staying at houses perhaps too long as I make sure I stay rested, warm, fed, etc. I even repair some clothes for the first time, make some tea, blah blah. After searching many houses in the area and coming up short in terms of hunting tools or weapons, I decide after resting up that it is time to move out and search for a new area. I walk out of the house and see a wolve across the way, but it runs off. I am relieved, and turn left to head out. A wolf. In my face. It pounces on me and I freak out. I start bashing out it but soon enough I die. And I felt good.I made it a full 27 hours and I felt like a champ. This game puts you on edge for survival, and as soon as you get comfortable you realize you are still nothing. The odds are all against you and you gotta work your♥♥♥♥♥off just to get a little lucky. But it is fun. It is about the challenge or survival and overcoming the odds for as long as possible. It is still in Alpha but I have high hopes for this game.			"

								You must purchase this game realizing that it is far from finished.  But be aware you are previewing what IMO will be a very unique and successful survival simulator.  I have found the early access sandbox mode of TLD to be very rewarding in it's current form.  While I have already become bored of it after 30 hours I don't regret my purchase.  This is the sort of game I've been waiting for.  There is so much obvious potential here and from what I've seen the developers are on track to make this game happen.  The up and coming story mode and the added immersion that will come with it is what i am most excited about.  This game is so far well thought out and well designed.  The art style is refreshing and beautiful.  The sound is fantastic and really adds a lot to the game-play.  There are plenty of things that should be added or ironed out but the developers are on the forums asking questions and taking advice daily.  I may be done for the moment with TLD but I assure you I am eagerly awaiting any updates and it's final release.Buy it. "

								received this game as a gift, although I already had an interest in it. The Long Dark is beautiful in its presentation of the beauty and deadliness of winter/snow hell. I liked this game because it is very brutal to the player in its medium difficulty (I haven't mustered the courage to go for hard), and it is extremely intense when death is near or wildlife is chasing you. The usual lack of basic necessity such as warmth, food, drink and protection from the cold/wildlife will usually always get you killed. This is not the only thing that will get you killed though, lack of thought and calculation will lead you off of cliffs and onto thin ice. The learning curve on this is not so difficult for those who are familiar with slower game play and having to calculate moves like a chess game, since most things require sacrifice and trade.I would recommend this to someone who is ready to invest a considerable amount of time into actually learning how to be good at this game. If you prefer to point and shoot at things in a very fast paced style, I would not recommend this game to you.That being said: the more support behind this game there is, the better the finished product (I hope) will be. Do not sleep on this one.			"

								In a sea of terrible early access survival games this one shines. The Long Dark is an in-depth survival game where you must survive against the elements and natures animals. This game is completely immersive. The moment you spawn its go, no mucking around. You need to find food, shelter, warmer clothes, weapons etc. Each minute you play of the game feels precious and important; you need to keep warm, not get too tired, and satisfy your hunger and your thirst. But you've got to be careful. Wolves and bears roam around and you have to not be spotted otherwise they'll try kill you. This game is very fun, and there is quite a lot of in-depth content for an early access, but it's done very well, it feels polished (I've only experienced 1 glitch so far). I really hope the developers continue to finish off sandbox mode, and implement the story mode. If they do this has potential to be one of the best games for 2016. In its current state, this game is worth paying £15 for.			"

They should buy it if they are equally (If not more so) interested in the Sandbox version of the game. It is very slow to update, which is understandable since Hinterland is trying to develope the Storymode as well as add to the Sandbox version in order to make everyone happy.The game is amazing as it is and I can't wait untill Story mode comes out but untill then I can wait because there is still so much to see and do in all of the regions. Especially now that they have added the skills aspect to the game. But I wouldn't recomend getting the game right now if you Hve your heart set on Storymode because it WILL take some time before it's ready and Hinterland is happy with the results.			"

Only thing I see needing improvement is the balancing of food and water consumption.

								This game is amazing. I would hold this up as an example of the stage a game should be at for Steam Early Access. The world is well balanced, its is beautiful and infinately punishing. Everything is a risk. As a simulation it is comparabile to the feeling you get when playing Guitar Hero. You feel like you are doing the real thing without the complications of actually knowing how to do it. The game world is intuitive enough that you often feel like the events in the game would represent exactly how you would respond in that situation. Plus its hilerious...As others have said, you start, gather some peaches and a hatchet, start a fire, go to explore that cabin and get mauled by a wolf 6 hours into surviving. The brutality is such that you have to laugh.			"

								So, as far as an early access game goes, this game is pretty good. (And of course, it can only get better from there, right? Right.)The only negative things about it are that, after a certain amount of time playing, you may get a little bored because it gets a little repetitive. But it's a good game to leave and then come back to whenever you feel the need to play a survival game. The artwork is beautiful, the audio is amazing, and the survival instinct is definitely felt when you're stuck out in the middle of a lake during a blizzard when you can hear your person shivering and you can't even see what's in front of you.

								First off, amazing game.  Excellent sound design, perfect atmosphere and the gameplay is pretty well tuned for an alpha game.First game, survived for a couple of days before I got cocky and got lost at night and got myself killed by a wolf.Second game, spawned at dusk, alone in the woods ina blizzard.  Well at least I thought I was alone, until I turned around to see death growling at me just a few feet away.  Hello my furry friend, want to cuddle?  Survived a total of 11 in game minutes.  W00t!Third game, I think I've got the hang of this.  Going on 25 days with a steady supply of food and provisions.Loving this game more than I thought that I would.  I can't recommend it enough.10 out of 10 would get mauled by wolves again!			"

								   This game is awesome, and has a lot of potential. I enjoy survival games, but was sick and tired of zombies in every game. So this game was just right for me. There's a lot to keep you busy in game. It is challenging enough and there is a lot to explore.    I made it 14 days, but then the same thing that happened to another reviewer ('Jesus'), happened to me.    This was my best game so far. i had accumulated many items at my 'house'. I was going out and exploring all shelters on the map. I finally made it to the 'abandoned lookout'. I found the rifle and was ready to leave but wolves were nearby. After fighting a couple wolves and having to run back into the lookout; I licked my wounds and was ready to set back out again. When I would walk back down the stairs, there was another wolf; and it would not go away. This lasted for a couple days. (I tried saving and exiting game also of course) I was running out of food and water so I knew I had to face him. I waited for a good break in the weather and went down to fight him. I was in pretty good condition; no fatigue or anything. For whatever reason this wolf seemed to kill my quicker. I barely got one hit in and that was it, I was like 'wtf'. I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at first and I still don't understand why it killed me quicker; felt like I barely had a chance. (unless there is a setting/mechanic that allows the wolf a chance to kill you quickly) That might be something that needs to be looked into. (and of course the way the wolves waited for me at bottom of stairs)   That being said, I would recommend this game to anyone. There's a few things that need tweeking but I would buy this game again without hesitation. A really fun (but unforgiving) survival game that requires you to manage time (there's only so much daylight) and resources; and always has you looking over your shoulder.			"

								Pros:Great overall game with a lot of potential.The wolfs actually scare you.Lots of items to find and use.You can almost feel how frikkin cold it is.Weather changes.If you get hurt, you get hurt! If you don't have the right things, it's hard!Weight limit on the backback, I actually like this as it makes it more realistic.Cons:Doesn't take that long to learn what the world looks like and where to find shelter.Once you know where to go, you know where to find things and then all you do is eat, sleep and sit in a cabin and then it's not really that hard to survive.Can't jump, this annoys me.Things they should add:Ability to jump.Bears.More maps/bigger maps.Maybe .. more rifles as it is the Canadian wilderness one would expect more rifles in the huts.As I said at the start, overall a good game with lots of potential.Would recommend it AS IT IS NOW for about $10.

Early Access Review
								I've always been a big fan of survival games, ever since way back in 2002 when I was playing the isometric desert island game Schiffbruch. I was thrilled with Minecraft game out, and not long after that, we had games like DayZ. By the time DayZ became popular, the market was flooded with survival games of various quality (usually of poor quality, see War Z). They also almost always contain zombies, and to me, the whole zombie thing is overdone and unoriginal.When I look for a survival game, I look for a quality game where the devs actually care about the players and improving the game more and more over time. I look for a game that isn't rage-inducingly difficult, but not too easy and would get boring within a short period of time. Another important aspect of a survival game for me is the quality of its single player mode. I almost never, ever play online for various reasons (bandits, cheats, hackers, mods who don't seem to care). So the single player side of a game is very important for me. Unfortunately, a lot of survival games these days put the majority of the emphasis on the multiplayer experience, if they even design a single player mode.The Long Dark is one such game that meets almost all of my qualifications for a survival game I would enjoy. It's unique, plays well, is challenging but not too easy, and is a completely single player experience. Your enemies aren't zombies in this one, but are instead hostile wildlife such as wolves, and even nature itself. You'll be going around trying to keep warm while also satiating your hunger and thirst levels, all the while being ever diligent to look out for wolves, which will mess you up big time if they get ahold of you. Something I like about the game is that it doesn't hold your hand, and doesn't put emphasis on combat. There's only one weapon right now, a hunting rifle, and good luck finding that. Even if you DO find one, ammo is very scarce, so you'll be either finding ways to avoid wolves, scare them off using flares, or making every bullet you have count.My only complaints are as follows:- The limited weaponry. It's fine to not focus on combat, but if I run out of flares, I'm pretty much screwed if a wolf comes out of nowhere and attacks me. I'm especially screwed if I don't have any bandages. It'd be great if there was at least some way to fend off a wolf without being taken down by one first, such as using the hatchet offensively, or using the knife during the quick time event with the wolf. Perhaps even bows and arrows would be great. Such things wouldn't put significantly more emphasis on the combat, but would help balance things out.- Speaking of wolves, holy crap. Even when I'm extra careful and on the look out, I almost never see a wolf until it's too late. It's like they just pop up out of nowhere, and can spot you from a mile away unless you're carefully sneaking. I won't complain about how every wolf is always hostile, since I understand the devs wanting to put that in the game, but some minor variations would be nice. Maybe one out of every ten wolves or so won't immediately attack you, or will run away or something.That's all I have for now. If you want a true single-player survival game that challenges your wits and resolve and perfects you through trial and struggle, get The Long Dark. It's currently in Alpha but there's every reason to believe the devs are constantly working on improving the game. So, if you have any suggestions, feel free to throw them at the devs.			"

								Absolutely loving this game so far. The mechanics are simple enough to figure out but there's a lot going on so it takes you a while to understand everything. I love how there's no ""Tutorial"" just jump in and figure it out or die. First play through I survived for just over a day (maybe 1 hour of gameplay) before freezing to death. Really sad too cause I lucked out and had so much gear. Nice rifle, hunting knife, warm clothes.Second play through I've survived for 5 days and I'm still going. Lots of good gear but sadly no rifle and no food anywhere. Hopefully I'll find some before starving to death. Long as the weather holds up I'll make it... oh damn, here comes a blizzard! Such a great game already and they're still very early in the build. Can't wait to see what else they add. I much prefer this to Day Z though I do wish there was a multiplayer or coop survival option. Would be loads of fun in such a different way.			"

								The graphics and sounds create an amazing atmosphere, the crafting system and UI are the easiest and clearest in any game. I love the looting of every building you can find, crafting and repairing. The Long Dark also has a great story told through the level design, like corpses lying near their last settlements or a lonely cottage with wooden crosses in the yard. The wolves are scary as hell, but there is also a ""peaceful"" mode where they scare you, if you just want to wander around. I recommend this game to anyone who likes games like The Forest, Minecraft or atmospheric games.			"

								So far I'm loving this game. It feels nothing like what you would expect from a traditional 'early access' game, but instead runs wondefully and delivers compelling, tense, and hardcore gameplay. My longest life so far was 6 days, 4 hours, and 39 minutes. That life I explored more than ever, espcaped freezing to death multiple times, collected copious amounts of food which I put into emergency reserves at various locations, and even fought off a wolf at one point. Sadly, I wasn't careful enough during my second wolf encounter and as I scrambled to grab the flare I had dropped as it jumped me, it circled back around and shredded my neck. I loved it.I will certainly be playing a lot of this game. So far I've only played roughly 4 hours of Sandbox and I absolutely love it. Highly recommend this if you want a truly difficult, hardcore survival game.			"

The wind blowing, the wolves howling, all produce what has to be the best ambiance I've ever experienced.Gameplay:Intuitive, challenging, immersive.  What else can you ask for?Video:The video is very styleized, which I'm sure is what lends to the extreme smoothness of the game.  I haven't had a jaggie, or glitch yet.  I've owned this game for less than 3 days as of this publication, and have already logged 28+ hours.9 out of 10 for me.  The only thing that would make it better, is depth.

								I have some pretty limited time invested in the game so far (day 6 on guy 3), but I have to say it is really stunning. It is dense, atmoshpheric, dark, dangerous, and spooky without the need for survival tropes like monsters or ghouls. The premise is very simple: survive in the Canadian Wilderness in winter; but the execution is so much easier said than done. The cold is a constant threat as you remain vigilant for predators, structures, and supplies. The only hinderence to the game's approach is the random number generation. Yes, I know very well that that is the nature of RNG, but generally more limits exist to maintain balance and not produce huge extremes. On a given run you may have three hunting knives a rifle and a cabin with enough food to last you to 2025; conversely, you may become dehydrated and famished within hours and unable to survive a wolf attack. While the random chance adds serious replayability and really does make it seem like a new game each time, not all new games are created equal. Despite this minor annoyance (which is also one of its great strengths), the game holds up extremely well, especially considering where it is in the development stage! Pick it up while it is on sale!! Oh, and have fun inside the dam...			"

								The Long Dark is a ""Post-Disaster Survival Experience."" Experience is the only word that can be used to describe this game. Among the rabble of poorly thrown together ""survival"" games that have flooded the market recently, The Long Dark stands out. It's a harrowing, depressing, lonely experience. Something most other survival sims fail to capture. In The Long Dark, you truly feel alone, it's you against nature. Wolves, Bears (and I'm sure more to come) all want your blood, should you wander too close, not only that, but mother nature wants to starve and freeze you to death. The game plays very well, making you choose whether or not to press on for that little longer in the hopes of finding some supplies, or to set up a makeshift camp and pray that you survive the harsh, freezing night. Considering this game is only in early access, and is still in it's alpha stages, I have incredibly high hopes for it, the devs are brilliant, constantly updating, and fixing the game based on customer feedback. The Long Dark is a brilliant survival simulator, with an amazing cell shaded style that completely captivates the player, and immerses them into the cold, bleak environment that will surely cause their end.(Also, it's a survival game with NO ZOMBIES. +100000 to the devs.)			"

The man now stood there in the snow scared of what could be behind him......he heard somthing moving behind himHe ran like no one has ever seen to the cottage down the snowy road,he run throught the door and shut it as fast as he could.""w-w-what could that of been?"" the man said to him self quietly,he turned around and saw an open fire place with some wood next to it.After taking all the food and water from the kitchen he then turned his attention to the bedroom.He was not ready to see what he saw in the bedroom,laying at the floor of the bed was the body of a women next to her.The man now look around the body for anything he could use,he found a sewing kit and put that to good use imedatly.After fixing up his clothes he desided to take a rest in the bed.A few minites became a few hours and when he awoke he found that he was realy hungry and needed to eat somthing fast,after scoffing down a two tins of pork and beans he went to leave the cottage.Once he closed the door to the cottage he turned round and became face to face with what looked to be a wolf he tryed to open the door but the wolf jumped on to of him,riping the poor mans flesh and clothes apart but the man threw the beast off of him and made it back safely into the cottage.The man looked out of the windows to find that the wolf was not alone but had a pack all now waiting the man out.Minites turned to hours then hours to days the man now all out of food, bandages and had just finished the last of the toliet water,""is this where i die"" the man thought while looting the house for all its worth,just by some luck he had found a hunting knife, he went back to the bedroom and tryed to sleep.The next day......his last day.He walked to the door knife in hand and left the cottage for the last time.""come at me you furry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!"" the man shouted and with that he charge at the wolfs head on.........He did not live the fight.Some say he died with a smile on his face others say he was a fool.The Long Dark is a great game for any survival fans			"
