YouTube™ Video: LGR - American Truck Simulator Review 

			Views: 163,273		

			From the developers of Euro Truck Simulator 2 comes a new entry to the series, now with more liberty and cheeseburgers! Drive trucks, build a business, crave more.		

Simultaneously one of my favorite games of 2016, and one of the biggest disappointments. And I’m okay with that, because it’s a lot like being disappointed in a great-tasting meal that was just too small. Small enough (yet so tasty!) that you’re left wanting seconds immediately after finishing, but the kitchen has already closed for the night.First the good: The locations you can explore look amazing, from the sunny beaches of California to the tumbleweed-laden deserts of Nevada, each area feels unique and even beautiful. I’m a big fan of attention to detail in simulations, and I don’t just mean including famous landmarks. I mean the little stuff like run-down shopping centers, signs for divorce court and cheeseburgers, and speed traps laid by highway patrolmen with nothing better to do. As an American, I think they did a great job nailing down the feeling of driving here, down to the idiots who don’t know how to use the fast lane on the highway and the bizarrely high number of self-storage buildings. The weighty, believable physics simulation and driving model are back in action as well, making great use of everything from a keyboard, to a gamepad, to a top of the line force feedback steering wheel setup. Quite simply, it’s everything I expected from SCS Software and their penchant for higher-quality than you might expect compared to similar simulations.So why am I let down? It’s a combination of minimal changes made and a lack of overall content. ATS uses an enhanced version of the engine used in ETS2, although at first glance it’s hard to tell any difference. You’ve got the same menus, the same UI, the same controls, many of the same sound effects, and so on. The biggest change arrives in the form of new locations to explore and new trucks to purchase. And by that I mean two states and two trucks: the states of California and Nevada, and the Kenworth T 680 and Peterbilt 579. That’s it. The cities are far more detailed and interesting than in ETS2 though, and there are licensing issues preventing more trucks at the moment so that makes sense. But still...I find myself hesitating to fully recommend it on launch. I’m still so hungry for more that it’s bothering me, and I would’ve much rather waited a few months for a more complete game. Ignoring that and giving SCS Software time to add more stuff, and I’d absolutely recommend this one. Even if it feels like a preview right now, the taste of things to come is scrumptious, and I can’t wait to dive into more as it arrives!			"

 All of my reviews are based around my personnal opinion, they're not swayed by a majority of people liking or disliking it.  Better than  Euro Truck Simulator  Worse than  Euro Truck Simulator 2  TL:DR American Truck Simulator is more of a re-skin of ETS2 but with added detail. People who've played ETS2 will pretty much recognise what they're doing and where to find things due to the game being made using the same engine. If you're new to the Truck Simulator franchise however, you'll find that this game is actually quite fun. The environments are beautiful, the cities are very big and there's a huge variety of roads such as ones that are long and narrow and ones that are more difficult to navigate. If you've played ETS2, I'd say wait till this game is on sale. If you're a newcomer, well worth your money! NOTE: All of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game. About American Truck Simulator [ATS] is a spin off to the popular game, Euro Truck Simulator 2 [ETS2]. Just like the title says, you'll be driving around two of America's states, California and Nevada, in a truck. Since ATS was made using the same engine as ETS2, there are a lot of similarities, most notabley the UI. Just like It's previous games, in ATS you start a company in which you make deliveries for other people to earn money. The more money you get, the more you can upgrade your warehouse, and get drivers to work for you. That's basically it. Gameplay Again, gameplay for this game is a lot like ETS2. If you've played ETS2, then this game shouldn't be difficult for you at all. If you haven't played ETS2, It's not hard to get into basics. There are differnet modes for controls, some which are more difficult than others. Just like ETS2, there are radio stations where you can listen to music, you can customize your truck by adding different paint jobs, there are different camera views to view your truck from different angles and have the basis of any other vehicle such as headlights, indicators, windscreen wipers and a horn. But as I mentioned before there is added detail to ATS. One thing for example is police cars. Police cars pretty much act as moving speed cameras. If you break the speed limit and/or do something that's illegal they'll fine you, plus turn on their sirens and just sit there.... watching you.Cities and towns are much bigger than the ones in ETS2. There is now an actual good reason to travel through cities and admire the views.The map in this game is pretty disappointing, I've already discovered at least 80% of it. Yes I know, they're adding a free dlc soon that adds Arizona, but right now, the map is small. Design & Graphics I would say there is a slight better quality when it comes to graphics & design that ETS2. ATS isn't a hard game to run when it comes to graphics. Just like it's predecessor, there are plenty of graphics options. I can easily run Ultra graphics, so I'm assuming it isn't that hard. One of the main things the developers were working on this game, was design. The game has much more detail than ETS2. There is much more of a variety of different roads. cities and towns are much larger and are more detailed and there are some really beautiful views. Sometimes at night times you can see shooting stars, and in day time you can easily see planes and jets flying around. Also I swear I saw a UFO in Nevada... UI [User Interface] Like I said before, the UI of this game is pretty much Identical to ETS2's, pretty much nothing has changed, which in most ways is a good thing. If you've played ETS2 then you won't have any trouble on getting to understand where everything is. As for newcomers, just like in the previous games, there are tutorials that tell you where everything is, so I doubt there will be a time where you struggle. Pros - Beautiful Environment- So much detail!- Very relaxing- It's pretty much what you want in a truck game.- Much bigger towns and cities. Cons - Such a small map.- Very similar to ETS2.- Some background terrain looks very bland. Final Recommendation More of a reskin, than a unique game. People who've played ETS2 before would probably find this a bit disappointing. But from my experience I've enjoyed playing this. There is much more added detail and many beautiful places to explore, even if It's a small map. Just like It's predecessor, It's a relaxing experience, thats what's important to me. It isn't perfect, and It's definitely not better than ETS2, but It is worth your money.Final Verdict - 7.5/10.

												What if you awoke one morning to find yourself inside a truck?  What if you woke up in that truck and from that moment on you were never hungry again?  Well sure, that would be interesting, but, you'd still want to eat, right?  You might reach for the handle to let yourself out of the truck, but the door doesn't open.  You try the other door with similar results.  One day you woke up inside a truck, and now that truck is your home, your prison for the rest of your life.  The truck will be your tomb when you die.  How would you react to that fate?  Would you panic?  Would you go mad?  Would you run the truck off a cliff, would you rather die than endure that grim reality?  Would you risk Hell to escape Arizona?  Or would you go to work?American Truck Simulator tells the tale of a person trapped inside a truck, which is itself trapped in the southwestern United States.  You may drive anywhere you wish, but you may never exit your truck.  There is an option to work jobs carrying freight around to earn money, although all this money can be used for is buying more trucks and garages.  You can't buy food.  You can't go out on a date with someone.  You can't sleep in a bed.  You can't speak to your family.  You can't signal for help.  Your only means of interacting with the world outside the cabin of your truck is by driving and moving things from one place to another.  The more you drive, the more the desert landscape begins to resemble an alien world.  As far as you're concerned, Nevada may as well be Mars.  It might be just outside your window but you'll never be able to set foot on that dusty orange soil.  You belong to the truck now.  You're just a part of the truck. You can't remember the taste of food, but the truck keeps you alive, somehow.  And every time you stop for gas, every gas station taunts you with its disgusting, mouth-watering gas station food.  That food you will never taste again.  That love you'll never see again.  That life you'll never have again.  The bell dings, the tank is full.How long would you have to drive, before you forgot?  How many miles of highway do you have to burn before you've burned away the person you used to be?  Would you surrender to the truck?  Would you be the best truck driver you could be?  Would you build a trucking empire from the confines of your diesel-powered oubliette?  Would you become a job provider, enriching the community for all the normal, regular people from whom you are now permanently isolated?  Maybe they would even try to find a way to get you out of the truck.  They wouldn't succeed, because the truck needs you now.  The truck needed you so it could become alive.  The truck lives through you.  You are host to a giant, steel parasite, a mechanical macrovirus that can only live by stealing life from the living.  And now that it is alive, it desires to persist.  You couldn't drive off a cliff if you wanted to, because now, you don't want to.  Now you are thinking for two, and one of you really just wants you to drive around and deliver freight.  Now you wouldn't dream of driving off a cliff.  And dream you do, though the truck may quell your hunger and thirst, it does not rob you of your need to sleep.  The truck wants to dream, too.The dreams are exciting and strange, frightening and exhilarating, but the details always escape your mind moments after you awake.With each passing slumber, the memories of the life you used to have make you feel more alive than ever.  Yes, you had a normal, mundane existence before the truck, because you are alive.  The very thought that you are alive fills you with excitement.  Alive, finally, ready to drive all over this beautiful country.  Everything you see through your windshield looks new again, every color is brighter, richer, younger.  This is life!  There's a whole world out there, waiting to be discovered.  There's folks out there, good, honest, American folks who need things transported, and you're the biomechanical lichenous organism that's going to do the job.  Not for the glory, not for the money, but because you love your fellow American living things.  If you had a way to communicate with your parents, you know they would be proud of you.  Not just for being alive, but for being the best truck-driver symbiont you could be.  Even so, they'll go the rest of their lives thinking that you were dead.  Ironic, when this is the most alive you've ever felt!  Ah, life.  Life is just, better, in a truck.			"

												I'm going to be completely honest. I don't know a lot about trucks, or about trucker life, or about running a trucking business. But American Truck Simulator still appeals to me. Driving along a highway making a delivery while listening to some music, listening to a podcast or watching a twitch stream/youtube video is very satisfying and relaxing, however its debatable if what is available here is worth the price(I'll argue both points of view)You're given 2 states, and 2 types of trucks at launch. Thats all you get. Granted, more will be available down the line, at launch its a very small pick. You're going to see the same landmarks several times just by playing about as much as I have(A little over 6 hours at this point). You're also going to be doing a lot of the same thing, especially if you don't get a loan early on and just do Quick Jobs like I've been doing. However, if the gameplay thats given is satisfactory enough, I could forgive it, which is is in my opinion.However, if you've played a lot of Euro Truck Simulator 2, I would recommend you wait on this. There isn't much of a change at all, its basically a well made expansion pack to ETS 2. If you're looking for more of that gameplay with a new environment, $20 might be a fair enough price, but if you're on the fence, wait. I'm sure it'll be on sale a few months down the line, and I'm sure they'll be more content at that point. But I do think its worth the $20 purchase is worth it if you haven't played Euro Truck Simulator before.The gameplay is nice and relaxing with some light management gameplay tacked on for good measure. Its absolutely worth $20 for me, but I think most people will want to wait. Wait For A Sale  "

												Ok, I am not going to lie.I thought this ""game"" would be lame, how much fun can it possibly be to just drive a truck from point to point.I bought it on sale thinking, atleast I can get some cool screenshots and view some eyecandy (as I've seen plenty of nice screenshot come from this game) and it was 50% off so ""what the heck""So I proceed to install it, and then spend nearly the next 16 concectutive hours play it without stop, listening to my 80's hair band radio, rumbling down the open roads of America, getting countless speeding tickets in California because of thier absurdly low speed limits, sleeping in truck stops, and living the good life all while riding upon my diesel stallion.This game is far from lame, this game is pure unadulterated freedom.

												As a professional truck driver of 17 years who lives in California, I am fairly impressed with this game.  The developers did a great job capturing the feel and geography of the Southwest and truck operations.  There were some little niggling graphical oversights (no Joshua trees in the Mojave desert? Biplanes patrolling Calfornia freeways?) but they are minor complaints.  I was able to recognize specific landmarks, and though the developers took some artistic license with the freeway systems, they remain close to their real life counterparts.  I would enjoy seeing more states added, I think the Western 11 states would be good.  The Central US would just be too boring to recreate (anyone up for a drive across Nebraska/Kansas/North & South Dakota?) but the East Coast could be a blast to drive!  Their could be more truck specific options added, like an interaxle differential switch, or an expert option where the player has to adjust the tandems and fifth wheel slide to make legal weight.  Or if you are a real nerd, the requirement to operate under the 11/14/70 hour rules.  I look forward to seeing more states and trucks added, and I highly recommend this game.			"

												Comparing this to ETS2 when that was released and its alot easier to see how far of an improvement this game is from the in game ai to the parking locations.I see alot of people complaining this game is poor with no content etc yet the same people was demanding the game be released ........you cannot have the best of both worlds .now considering this game is only the beginning of long term investment £14.99 for 2 trucks and 3 states after the Arizona dlc is added isn't bad at all and considering it takes around 10 +hours to earn enough for the 1st truck if you don't take a loan there is alot of game time and return on investment.I look forward to the road ahead because look at ETS2 and where that is today with multiple dlcs and continued developer and mod support shows where this game is heading and that is an exciting prospect the future looks great for this game and i cannot wait and once steam workshop is added as pavel said then you will have unlimited potential from a £15 game.In short this game provides more than some AAA titles do at launch its isn't broken and it is going to be well supported moving forward with developers who care about the gamers enough to even get steam to release a day early.

Murica here i comeI play ETS2 to relax, and i have sunken more than 150 hours into that game and still am coming back to it. ATS is practically the same game with new trucks and scenery.If you played ETS2 you know exactly what to expect. It‘s literally the same, even the menu is the same. But i don‘t consider that a negative thing, though some things could‘ve been improved.After the ETS2 graphics upgrade the game looks gorgeous. ATS is no different, it looks great. Developers put a lot more work into scenery and cities. The American environments never gets old and is always nice to look at and the cities feels alive and real.The game core didn‘t change. You must drive from pont A to point B and deliver various goods. There are only three trucks in game so far, but it‘s enough for the start, and they‘re badass American trucks! There‘s only two states for now – Nevada and California, you will drive through them in no time, but it feels developers have put more work into them than ETS2 Europe map. Scandinavia DLC looks much better than default EU map, and ATS looks even better than Scandinavia. So i‘d rather have less but quality content than more but shallow and bland.The game is only 20€ on steam, so you kinda get what you pay for. The more content will be added through DLC and this is one of those rare games when i wait for DLC because i know these developers will not disappoint, they want to make the game better and are always looking for ways to improve their games. After ATS was released the steam workshop was added to both games. People were asking for it for years and finally these amazing developers done it. Thank you. Now applying mods is as simple as clcking the mouse button.What i think should be improved is physics and force feedback. The physics feels too arcadey, i know developers are doing their best, but for a new game they could‘ve improved physics. Also Force feedback could use some improvements. But overall driving feel is good.Graphics are nice and all, but not having anti-aliasing in this day seems a bit stupid huh? I know maybe it‘s because engine limitations or something, but it‘s really not my problem, AA is a must! Other than that performance is inconsistent. I'd say the game runs worse than ETS2, but it also looks more detailed. There‘s nothing more to say, if you liked ETS2 you‘ll like this one. Just start the engine, open a beer and drive trough beautiful American scenery.Pros:Beautiful to look atCities are big and feel realSame relaxing gameplayCons:No anti-aliasing Performance issues			"

												I'm a student studying to get my CDL permit. This game has been rather instrumental in demonstrating some of the proper maneuvers and whatnot in regards to semi-truck driving. Reading about a ""button hook"" turn and actually getting to kind of see it in action through simulation are two incredibly different things. The game has been incredibly helpful in allowing me test a lot of things out, although it is obviously by no means a substitute for being behind the wheel of an actual semi. CONS---I find the weigh stations to be far too simplistic and serving relatively little to no function ingame. You pull in on the scale and you automatically pass the gross weight. I think that it should be possible to actually end up being overweight, then the weigh stations would actually carry with them the dread that most truck drivers face. Afterall, the purpose of the weigh station is to find truck drivers who are hauling overweight loads and put them out-of-service. For drivers who -are- overweight, more rural routes to try and bypass the weigh station as certain... rogues tend to do, would also be excellent. ---The speeding fines are ridiculous. I mean, I obviously know the game isn't NASCAR simulator or something. I'm playing the game for the purpose of trying to get an idea of how the trucks handle around turns. With that being said, the truck will on occasion speed up going downhill or the speed limit might change faster than you can safely slow the truck down... and you end up getting slapped with a freaking fine for being only like 3 - 5 miles over the speed limit. (A fellow steam user has pointed out that this is actually pretty realistic though.)---Gameplay becomes repetitive. Mods that add in a multiplayer mode do help the replayability, but at the expense of no AI traffic. Neither of these two things are that big of a deal for me, but it might be for some other people.PROS---It's possible to go into settings and try to simulate how the airbrakes function in the real world. I've found this to be fun to tinker around with. It's an example of one of the many little features that the game includes that you can toggle on or off depending upon how serious you are about your overall simulating experience. ---AI drivers will perform hilariously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gish maneuvers just like in the real world. No, I don't mean that they're horrible drivers or incapable of following the law. They instead do something that's pretty common with a lot of drivers I've seen in Georgia. They'll be in a hurry to pass you, merge in front of you and cut you off, and then you'll see them end up jumping on the exit and speeding up to the stop sign. Like IRL, the AI drivers are sometimes in a hurry to go nowhere. Having to react to crap like that really puts the perception distance + reaction distance + braking distance rules into effect to avoid creating an accident ingame. I'm still experimenting with a lot of stuff ingame, but these are some of the pros and cons I've found in regards to how ""realistic"" the game is on a whole. I definitely recommend this game if you're into that sort of thing. It's more of a learning experience, more than anything, but it can be pretty fun too at times.			"

												When you are looking for a truck simulator, then American Truck Simulator is a good start. It gives you 3 American states on the west coast to let you show your expertise. In the future more states will come as downloads. When you're familiar with ETS2, then ATS is also a good choice. Made by the same developers it looks very familiar. But it has its own look and feeling. America is not Europe, of course. Play the game, drive the long American roads to earn your money, (the roads will even seem longer as soon as the re-scaling is done), buy garages and build a fleet of Peterbilts and Kenworths. Hire drivers to make your company even more succesfull. Enjoy the landscapes while on duty, get overwhelmed with colors of sundown. Be amazed by the architecture of the big cities and huge bridges. Like ETS2, ATS has an auto-save function, so you can always go back in time when things are running out of hand. The game can be played with all kind of devices, but keyboard and mouse also works very fine.But perhaps the greatest fun about ATS is the community, making all kind of mods to modify the game and give it the look you want. There are hundreds of free mods to find, as well in the easy to reach workshop as on several mod-websites. Trucks, trailers, trafic, sounds, landscapes, new states and countries, weather: it's all there for you to explore. Choose wisely, but most of the time these mods are of a good quality. And if you don't like it, just remove it. ATS has a decent built-in mod-manager, even showing when mods don't work properly anymore because they are out of date. And that is a bit of a down side: while ATS is evolving, not all mods are always adapted. But that is of course always a problem with stuff made by third party (partly amature) developers. This problem also exist with other games.Over all, American Truck Simulator is a great game, worth the money. I rate it 9 out of 10.			"

												I picked this up the day after it came out, and have been playing it off and on since my new HDD came in - so far I'm liking what I'm seeing. Please bear in mind this review is coming from someone who came from Euro Truck Simulator 2, and while I've tried to avoid comparisons between the two, they're inevitably going to crop up as I type this.I'll divide this into 4 sections: The great, the good, the bad, and the ugly.The GreatHere's what I felt was executed masterfully, what I feel there's little to no way to improve upon what's already in the game:- Believable damage implementation. There's no collision deformation, sadly, but as your truck becomes damaged, more and more things start happening - neglect your engine and it'll start to fail mid-trip, neglect your gearbox and you'll lose the high gears.- Very immersive. It's easy to lose yourself in this game. Put on a radio station or a podcast, and relax.- Easy to mod. The game makes itself easy to mod, and has a large and active modding community as a result. If you type in ""American Truck Simulator"" into the search engine of your choice you'll see at least ten websites dedicated to mods.- Trailer parking system gives you a choice in difficulty. Upon arrival with a load, you almost always have a choice in where to park the load, with 3 options - generally, a more difficult one that requires backing up, an easier one where you just pull straight in, and an option to skip.- Decent trailer variety. One of the things I noticed in ETS2 was how there was really one major variant to most trailers, excluding liveries. With most trailers here, there's a short variant and a long variant.- Towns on the map actually feel like towns. Unlike in ETS2, there's actually commercial and residential districts in the towns across the map - it doesn't just feel like a giant industrial district. The goodHere's what I felt was done well, but had room for improvement:- The map is rather detailed. You can tell that someone spent a lot of care working with the map, and it doesn't feel at all like a bunch of pre-fabricated areas cut and pasted together. Some bits don't make much sense, however, such as a burger stand without a parking lot, or a giant sign advertising a hotel-and-casino sitting in front of a motel parking lot, no casino or hotel in sight. Scaling feels a bit awkward as well, a good example is on the Cali 58 southeast of Bakersfield where there's four sudden hills one after another - fun, yes; but a bit unrealistically close together.- Weather effects are pretty nice, but limited. It's mildly disappointing waking up in 'Frisco and not seeing the Bay's thick fog over the Golden Gate Bridge, or not seeing the wind kick up a dust storm out in the Nevada desert sometimes.- Policing system was reworked from ETS2's. There's actually patrol cars that'll drive around the roads, that act as speed cameras on wheels. If you speed near them, they'll turn on the lightbar, and you'll get a citation. You'll see a few parked on the side of the road running radar here and there, as well. However, the amount of police cruisers patrolling the streets is absurd, especially on the freeways where you can have three patrol cars one after another. They also bear a generic CHiP livery, which is a bit bland.The badHere's what I felt rather disappointed by - not enough for me to feel a rework is in order, but enough for me to want to complain about it:- The game feels very unfinished. When it came time to release, there were all of two trucks. As of me typing this, there are three - 2 Kenworths, and a Peterbilt. Customisation is rather limited, and it seems overlooked. If you look around in the options you'll find keybindings mentioning beacon lights (no such beacons exist yet) and in the lighting adjustment you'll find options referencing auxiliary lights (which also do not exist yet). Also, at one on/off ramp in Elko, there's redundant traffic signals facing the wrong way on the ramp. Although several modders have ported in customisation items from ETS2 that render most of the previous sentences moot, it still feels as if this game is little more than a beta at this stage. (You'll note I did not mention anything about what states the map does or does not include.)- Passing zones on back roads are few and far between. Seriously - there's very few places where you don't have the double yellow line that isn't right before an intersection - I'm not from California nor Nevada, but I know that here, at least, unless you're coming up to a blind hill or corner, or an intersection, there's a passing zone. Mildly frustrating when you're behind an underpowered truck doing 20 below at the start of a long straight section.- The traffic's AI is a bit screwey sometimes. They'll wait to signal a turn until they're a car-length away, they'll pull out in front of you to turn right at some traffic lights (especially bad when the speed limit's 55), and - my biggest nitpick - when they're turning right on green, they'll stop at the light, pull up a bit, stop again then make the turn - bad news for a driver not expecting this.- Road signage nitpicks: If you're unfamiliar with the roads you're on, speed limit changes occur without warning - especially, in once case, a 55 to 25 drop. (Note: In the previous example, it's fairly obvious the reduction is coming if you look at the GPS; however 55 to 35 drops are fairly common.) I don't know if it's done this way in California/Nevada, but down where I'm from, sudden speed limit changes are announced a ways beforehand with a sign reading ""REDUCED SPEED AHEAD"" or a sign with the speed limit on it, with an arrow pointing forward (think the ""YIELD AHEAD"" signs in-game, but with a speed limit sign instead of the yield triangle). Road work signs are posted a short ways away from the construction site, not all of 25 feet before.The UglyHere's the (thankfully only 1 major) things I felt was done horribly:- Weigh stations give little to no warning. The major killers here are the two on IH-80 in Nevada, where the speed limit goes up to 80 and you have a chance to get up to speed. Here, it's rather rare for AI trucks to get going that fast, so I'm usually in the inside lane overtaking the other trucks. The notification is set so close to the weigh station, you have 5 and a half seconds at ten under to decide whether you have enough time to get up to speed, pass, and get into the weigh station, or whether you need to brake and drop back, try and squeeze into the spot between the truck you're passing and the car behind it, and slam on the brakes to make it into the weigh station. This isn't an exaggeration, either - I was in an underpowered Kenworth T680 passing a truck with a tipper-trailer when I got the notif between Truckee and Reno, and just barely had enough time to brake, squeeze between him and the cop behind him, and pull into the weigh station - if I'd have taken a half second longer to react, I literally would have missed the off-ramp.- The purpose of coinsurance is not well explained. I might have just missed it, but all I knew was ""it would be paid separately"" (said when I bought my truck) and that it shows at the bottom of the diagnostics page. Closing notesAll cons aside, if you're a diehard fan of ETS2 and want to support the company like I did, it's worth the twenty bucks. If you merely like ETS2, I'd recommend getting the demo and seeing what ATS has to offer before jumping in. If you're new to SCS, stick with ETS2.All in all, I'll give it a solid B-.Review typed for game version 1.1.1.3s on 2016-02-21. Edited 2016-03-03 because I timed the weigh station bit and to remove an erroneous example in the ""unfinished"" bullet. "

Welcome to the USA! Well, two of fifty states… American Truck Simulator is SCS Software’s latest bafflingly enjoyable trucking simulator. ATS is effectively ETS2 with a few improvements and new locations, in the form of California and Nevada for you to explore with Arizona coming as a free update at some point. The map scale in ATS seems to be smaller than ETS2 and while that does mean you get around faster it also means that you can’t have long journeys like you could in ETS2 which is also contributed to by only having two states. ATS has only launched with two trucks but there are a couple of others ready to be released once licensing has been sorted out by SCS with more trucks in the works, all of which will be free updates.ATS is certainly a good looking game and it boasts visual and performance increases over ETS2. Both trucks are well-designed and look great, especially with the shiny paint jobs and the scenery all looks good too. The towns and cities also look good but due to the map scale they feel pretty small, with the exception of Los Angeles which is relatively big for the game. The UI and menus are all the same as they were in ETS2 and are still just as easy to use as they were. The new trucks have come with some in-cabin differences, namely an electronic display and a built-in GPS. Both of these have several display modes to choose from which are all pretty helpful.Being a trucking simulator, ATS’ gameplay consists of hauling cargo from one company to another between cities. One of the new features in ATS is ‘special’ destinations for cargo which will depend on what kind of cargo you’re hauling, for example if you’re hauling construction equipment you might have to drop it off at some roadworks just outside one of the game’s cities. On the topic of new features, weigh stations are also new and you’ll sometimes receive a message to pull off and have your truck weighed when you’re passing one. Back to the actual cargo, while there’s not as much variety as there was in ETS2 with DLC there are still enough cargo types to keep things interesting. As was the case in ETS2, unlocking certain skills will also give you access to new kinds of cargo such as flammable liquid or high value construction vehicles. The maximum trailer lengths have also been increased up to fifty-three feet whereas ETS2 had a maximum length of forty feet. These longer trailers can provide quite the challenge, especially when you’re dealing with tight turns.ATS also lets you build up a fleet of trucks and drivers to bring in extra income for you. While early on you’ll probably need bank loans to buy new trucks, once you’ve got yourself established expanding your fleet will become far easier. Despite the fact your hired drivers can only earn up to ~$20,000 per job, having a form of income other than the jobs you’re completing yourself is incredibly handy, especially if you have loans to pay off. Garages to house your fleet are available across both states currently in the game and start with three truck slots with an upgrade increasing that to five. While you do start with your own garage it only has one slot available which is occupied by your truck so you’ll need to upgrade it to three slots before you can hire new drivers. The trucks purchased for your drivers can be upgraded/customised, just as your own can, and you can also switch around your trucks whenever you want.Upgrading and customising your truck is one of the main areas where ATS is inferior to its predecessor. Right off the bat, only having two trucks (that’s not two manufacturers, that’s two single trucks) massively limits the customisation though each truck does have a couple of different presets though they aren’t unlocked until you’re a higher level and levelling up takes quite a long time. Customising the actual trucks is also pretty underwhelming, most parts of the truck only have two or three different options, such as bullbars, and some of the options that were available in ETS2 simply don’t exist anymore, such as a beacon. Hopefully this will improve once SCS has sorted out more licensing but for the time being it’s definitely one of game’s negative aspects.The other main problem with the game is the map scale I mentioned earlier. A twenty in-game hour journey now takes somewhere in the region of thirty of forty minutes, depending on whether or not you’re in-line or below the speed limit. While this kind of scale would be acceptable if we had access to the whole US, when you consider that a twenty hour journey is pretty much the longest possible journey in the game’s current state it’s pretty disappointing. Of course, if you do prefer getting your jobs done quickly then you may actually like this but I feel like most ETS2 fans will be somewhat disappointed.One last thing I’d like to touch on is just how relaxing the game, for the most part, is. Just cruising through California and Nevada with your favourite music or podcast on is incredibly enjoyable and relaxing, perfect for after a long day’s work or after you’ve been playing something a little more stressful. If you don’t have any music or podcasts to listen to, you can try out the game’s default internet radio stations (or even add your own, instructions available in-game) which feature a wide variety of music genres. The game does have some music that plays if you don’t have your own stuff but that only plays in the menus and loading screens. I did say the game is relaxing for the most part, the other part there is when you’re involved in some kind of traffic accident or you get hit with a speeding ticket when you’ve only just entered the new speed limit zone, while incredibly frustrating they don’t happen all too often so you should be nice and relaxed for most of your time in ATS.Verdict ATS' current amount of content may be disappointing but the game does improve on ETS2 and will be enjoyed by its fans. If California and Nevada isn’t enough for you I’d suggest holding off on buying ATS until the Arizona expansion is out but otherwise go for it, the game’s pricing is reasonable after all.Lone Ranger Reviews.El K.

American Truck SimulatorAmerican Truck Simulator, Is rather like Euro Truck simulator 2, but put in America. What Do You Do?You start off simple, you start off driving other company trucks, and deliver them at a slow rate of income, eventually you can keep doing so as in 'Quick Jobs' and keep earning money. Or if you're rather impatient you could start taking either a loan for a new truck to increase your income by hauling with your own equipment, you'll earn a lot more and level up for new perks. Then you can eventually expand upgrading your garage, and hiring drivers and so on.Now, As I've stated, American Truck Simulator is like Euro Truck Simulator, but placed in America. As start of the game you can only drive through 3 states: -California-Navada-ArizonaAlthough the progress SCS have been made, the game is still lacking on what it can hold. Understanding the issue SCS is having is adding new trucks due to licensing, they need permission to put them in the game. I'm sure at some time, we'll get new trucks to purchase in game.  As I continue to wait until this very day.. Although only a few trucks are available for the moment, there are still a lot of custimizations, just like in Euro Truck Simulator 2. [Also Note: If you've purchased the Wheel Tuning Pack From ETS2, You get it free for ATS!]Is there Mod Support?If desired, SCS has allowed the Steam Workshop to be compatable with American and Euro Truck simulators, so you can simply add Mod's such as trucks,Configurations and so on...Final VerdictOverall I've spent  hours within playing this game, I still come back to it each time they update it, I can say that the game does however feel like an Early Release, I feel like they've released ATS too early, then it should of been. But still, this game right now is just marvelous, wonder landscapes, the cities are well done so far!My Overall rating 8.9/10			"

												American Truck Simulator is a continuation of SCS tradition of (almost only) Truck Simulators, still ATS have little in comon with previous titles like 18 Wheels of Steel. First of all: It is beautiful. It is a lovely experience to drive, even without a wheel since the new steering system was implemented in Euro Truck simulator.ATS features western USA, currently only California, Nevada and Arizona. More states will surely follow as DLCs. Some mods open up the entire continent, but they are unsupported and may cause problems with your savegame. Some of the community made stuff is really great, i remember the ETS2 PROMODS Scandinavian mod that added the nordic countries to the game, and it was very nicely done.The game is basically this: Move cargo from A to B.Doesnt sound like much fun, but considering that you are the one behind the wheel who gets to get the trailer from say, Reno to Phoenix, curse at slow drivers, drive slowly through the very lifelike rain, chose a speedy route around Sacramento to avoid the morning rush, avoid getting a speedingticket from hidden police cars and eventually detach the trailer at the destination, hopefully without having dented it, because damage cause a penalty and you wont get as much money and XP.As you drive, you level up and chose what type of cargo and bonuses you should get. So do any drivers you hire but you can control what types of cargo they haul and with that what sort of skill they should aim for when leveling up.You can customise your trucks, add better engines, paint, lights (etc) and as you level up, you unlock more things to add.Only bad thing about ATS i suspect: Like with ETS/ETS2, there is no endgame stuff to buy. Once you get a truckstop in all cities, fill em with trucks and drivers (if you do not run out of them, like i did in ETS2), there isnt a whole lot to do. I was sitting on €200 mil in ETS2 which was the equivalent of the GDP of a small nation and had nothing to buy. Right now i cannot see any endgame cash-sink features that would put a future fortune to good use. This is a small problem though since the game is more about driving around.Is it worth it? Well, as with all SCS truck games: Buy!Hint: Something that gives you a good atmosphere is to find a good internet radiostation and play that in the background and you drive endlessly into the night.

												Even though I am an actual American truck driver...Greetings All!!! I do drive long distances and I have to admit...this simulator is very good for what it is.  Some things are unrealistic but, I'm sure this game will improved slowly but surely. Already logged 57 hrs in, not to mentioned even logged around 700 hrs in on ETS2.Anyways, I do reccommend buying the game on steam or actual game, instead of playing the demo (if it has it), great physics (still needs improving though), No Lags (depending on your software), rain physics are nicely done and graphics are acceptable. It's a great simulator game, definitely an awesome field if you want to actually be an Trucker.  For the record, you'll make alot of money if you bought your own big rig, instead of being an company driver. For those who haven't played ETS2 or ATS or any trucking simulators yet...you're missing out! lol.  Just kidding, all the trucking simulators are awesome to play in you're into trucking. Trucking is a Challenge and alot different from the games when you are out in the real world of trucking. Atleast you will get the idea of how to handle loads, how to back up trailers in tight spots, how to feel between light and heavy loads based on engine speeds and RPMs and fuel consumption. As to those who played ETS2 and not ATS yet...Well!  there is alot of things similar, for example: The Drivers, A1 traffic drivers, trucking customizing, mods and a few others you'll recognized.    Well, keep up the best work SCS...you all are doing great. We all are looking forward to your new upcoming games, DLC packages and update patches. Happy 2017 everyone :)			"

												31hrs, over 90% of Cali and Nevada explored, garage is full, achievos done. Let the grinding begin.  As good of a truck sim as Eurotruck, just needs more map.edit: It will be a Police car simulator until they adjust how many cops car are on the roads, until then disable them in the config file:2nd edit: this was made an option in game today, no more config file tweaks.3rd edit: Arizona has been added to the base game, in beta anyway. It's not a big map, but does have some nice touches like major landmarks and some new assets in cities.  Thye must have a pretty small team working on this since it really isn't a big map and has taken 3 months since the game came out. 4th edit: the map rescale is in beta is really helps this game, the jobs pay more, and they're not over in a 5 minute drive.5th edit: get this on sale if you really want it, otherwise just get Euro Truck Sim 2 with all the map expansions.Get a cheap 3rd party key somewhere online.

												I absolutely love this game. This coming from  truck driver of over 25yrs. Yes, I know there are some shortcomings in relation to physics, perceived speed, the ungodly amount of cops on the roads, etc., etc. That being said, this game is a blast. Now I'm gonna have to get a wheel and 18speed shifter. If I were to ask the devs for one addition to the game it would be scale houses and DOT patrols with random stops and the ability to run over weight for extra pay. Okay that was three things. At any rate, I highly recommend this game. It's truly addicting.			"

												I myself am from the UK so you would think that I'd be more into european trucks however, I'm more into American styled trucking because they have so much more to offer and they also bring a lot more to the trucking industry with variety.I'm extremely surprised with the amount of feedback that SCS Software have been getting for the creation of American Truck Simulator. I understand though that the seperate Multiplayer Client for the Game isn't quite as popular as ETS2 which is done to a few obvious reasons. 1.) MP was first created for the Game, 2.) There are more European drivers on the Game, and 3.) ETS2 has a lot more content to offer since it's been out a lot longer than ATS.I'm thoroughly enjoying the new re-scaling that that SCS Software have done and cannot wait to see what they have installed for us within the upcoming Months/Years. If you were thinking about purchasing this Game but wasn't sure due to the popularity of it at this moment in time, I would say BUY IT!These types of simulation Games take time to peice toegther, considering they are basing the Game off of real like destinations and scenery. I mark this Game 10/10 as I've always been impressed with the quality of work that the Company set out to achieve.			"

												This was an ""ok"" game when I first got it, with the various mods, it was a good ""rainy day"" game.You sit in the house and play all day because it's too crappy to go outside.But, since the 1.5 Rescale Beta and now, the v1.5 Rescale Update, this thing has really got interesting.Most mods still work on ATS, like trailer mods, truck mods (some do, some don't), gfx mods.., the only mods that I know for a fact that do not work as of this writing are map mods. Those will probably be back up and running in a couple of weeks.At any rate, the Rescale has made the world bigger, and the time-scale longer, as a result of this, ATS now has a more realistic feel than it did before. Trips take longer, and the day and night cycle feels more ""normal"".There have been numorous bug-fixes and overall improvements to the world in general. Even the AI seems to be better.SCS has taken a good simulator and made it a great simulator.			"

Now that various updates have came out, Arizona state has been added, and the game is on freaking SALE! I finally decided to write a little review, and if you're searching for a quick asnwer: yes, definitely buy it. It's worth much more than the price that the game has.So first of all:Let's compare ETS2 to ATS, when ATS just came out people were happy and pleased that the game was worth the waiting, but most of the players (me included) were a little bit disappointed that the map was pretty small, but now beautiful Arizona came out and the map is bigger, so the small map, well, isn't really a big problem anymore.So, ETS2's map is still much, much bigger than ATS's map, but it's also less detailed. For me, i prefer ATS's map over ETS2's, because it is much more beautiful and detailed. So ATS wins.GameplayA lot of people say that the gameplay is pretty much the same in these two games, however, i disagree. In my opinion ATS's gameplay is more fun and interesting, it takes much more skill to drive a big a*s american eagle, than to drive a flat-faced european truck, also it's much more fun to drive american trucks, the loud noise won't make you fall asleep lol.Operating the truck in ATS is also a bit different, the gearbox types are a bit differnet than in ETS2. So ATS wins again.Pros & Cons+Beautiful map+Beautiful trucks+Better optimization+Much more detailed map+More realistic and fun gameplay-Even after the Arizona update, the map is still much smaller than ETS2's-Multiplayer is less fun in ATS than in ETS2 (probably because there are less players in ATSMP)-Even after the updates, police and traffic offense is still extremely agressive-Only 3 trucksConclusionIf you have played ETS2 and like trucking games, then definitely buy this game, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S ON SALE BROSCS also delivers monthly updates so there is always something new added to the game which makes it interesting even if you have played it for hundreds of hours.My rating:9/10			"

												What to say about this game... that everybody already don't know...SCS is a synonym for trucking simulation and they did it again, made a game that is better than previous one .Game is impressive indeed, from graphic, sound to gameplay, everything is in it's place! And beside all of that it is very well optimised that low/medium PC specs can run it on ultra settings.I can't write of actual gameplay impressions at this time because of limmited content, therefore I will edit that part on later date. BUT I know I will very much enjoy it, heck I even do now just looking at game beautiful landscape, npc's living their lifes, listening to powerful engine sound....just great!PRO's:+Can cause addiction; known symptoms; bad smell, pain in back, often sleepy, angry family members, prevention; take often walks on fresh air, bath at least once a day, eat,drink and go to toilet regulary+Beautiful graphic textures and modelsYou know I was a truck driver for 7 years, no BS, and only way I can get back to trucking is in SCS games.+Fun and easy to start it if you are new in this type of games (but you aren't ^^)If you somehow manage to roll this over 2000-3000 hours of play-time you will probably know why I quit that job xDCON's:/none/Note:Even with updates coming soon, my opinion is that it was better to delay release for a bit until more content is in the game. Now I suggest you all BUY this game, try it a bit, and live your lifes until update comes.			"

												Bought this game while the steam sales were running and because i loved ETS2 so much (and trucks and AMERICA ofcourse :D), and i have no regrets, this game is just like ETS2 AMAZING, the scenery and gameplay are both just soo damn good, this game really makes you feel like an american truck driver (even tho ur not living in america, and you dont really own a truck :P). I just love this game soo much SCS has done an amazing job, hope they will add more trucks and states to the game, because at this point there aren't that many trucks and states, i must say tho the trucks in this game are soo amazing too, the peterbilt and kenworth trucks makes it feel american. So if you wanna have a fun afternoon, night or just want to play a good simulator game while its rainy outside (or while its even sunny :D) i highly recommend you buy this game :)!.Pros:-Amazing Gameplay.-Amazing Scenery.-Feels Real.-Cool looking gas stations.-Actually has Tumbleweed in the game.-Has ingame radio stations (for amazing truckers music while ur driving down the interstate).-Amazing Trucks.-Made by one of the best dev team!!!.-WHOLE GAME IS JUST AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZING.Missing:-Really needs SNOW in the game ETS2 didn't have it but MURICCA should have it.-AI needs to be pulled over too by cops, because i think some of them are driving while they had a couple of beers.97/17 Would buy it again only for the Tumbleweed.

												THE GOOD:-Game is graphically great, everything looks as good or better than ETS2. You should be able to run this at the same settings as ETS2. You can also copy over your configs from ETS2. Just go to *\Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2\profiles\###### and copy all the .sii files then go to *\Documents\American Truck Simulator\profiles\(same #### as ETS2) and paste them in there.-Gameplay is just as fun as ETS2-Trailer dropoffs are more varied. You can have them do it for you for no bonus XP, ""do it safely"" which is an easy dropoff and gives you some bonus XP or you can do it for real which is usually difficult for 40-90XP. There's an option in the menu to just choose one but you can always have them park it for you or change the dropoff point if it turns out to be too hard.-There's a huge amount of environmental pieces and NPCs. Driving through the desert you'll see tumbleweeds rolling across the road, helicopters flying by, airplanes and even military jets zooming over, parasailers, blimps and just so many little details that keep things interesting and keep you looking around for the next little detail.-Devs are dedicated to it and have promised support for a long time. They did the same for ETS2 so I have no doubts they'll continue working on this.THE BAD-Game is limited right now. There's only California and Nevada along with 2 trucks. SCS has promised to continue adding states and they're working on Arizona right now. There's licensing problems with the trucks but they'll add in more as they get that sorted out. This will no longer be a problem in the future but at least both states have a lot of road and detail it still feels small.-Traffic AI is really bad. Lots of cars/trucks driving straight into you without braking or caring. While it is a realistic depiction of American drivers, it makes for very frustrating gameplay.-Police are harsh. America doesn't have a bunch of speed cameras so instead they added in random police cars that will ding you for going a few over the speed limit. Some people have said that it seems like the police are more lenient on highways and stricter with backroads which might be true but I haven't verified this. It's a good new system but extremely rough on new players.-Fines are huge. $900 for speeding. $800 for running a red light, even if you stop a bit late but aren't blocking traffic. Once you get some money flow coming in it isn't a big deal but it's hard on new players. It was the same thing in ETS2 however with the new police system it's a lot easier to get ticketed for speeding so it racks up fast.Overall, it's a fantastic game and to put it simply it's an improved version of ETS2 but set in America. There's only 2 states and trucks at the moment but there will be more in the future. It's well worth the $20 asking price and will provide just as much entertainment and fun as ETS2 does.			"

												This game picks right off where the 18 WoS Franchise left off. If you are familiar with ETS 2 you feel right at home. But is ATS just a reskinned version of ETS 2?I think not, I think it is, while of course similar to ETS2, definitely its own game with its own strengths and weaknesses. I was amazed when I found out that you can float gears, that was something I was really hoping for and they realized it very well. I am excited to see where the franchise is going and what all we will see in the years to come. The King 18WoS is dead, long live the new King ATSOverall I think this game is a wonderful start for a new era of Simulated Trucking in the Americas. I salute you SCS, you did it. "

												A perfect game, that strikes a perfect amount of detail. work as your dream job, as you truck through well recognised landmarks, and grinding that money and your skill up, until that day comes... Buying your first truck. That truck will travel you over 20,000 miles, as you grind, unlocking upgrades, and hire drivers to work for you. Buying garages for your trucks.  (Top Gear) *Some say this was just a re-skin of Euro Truck Simulator 2* This is far beyond a re-skin this is like a whole new game. Deliver for so many company's and prove your skill by challanging reverses.Featuring realistic rain effects, and a strong physics engine.Multiplayer mod is a whole new division by the friendly team at ""Truckers Mp"" (Not related with SCS Software) Perhaps build or join a trucking company (VTC) or just truck around with friends ussing in game chat! Attend massive convoys that are all over the map. Fully Wheel campatible which takes you it a whole new would, just like a real trucker, shifting through 18 gears (G27 Shifter). *Positives*- Very strong physics engine- Well thought out- Well recognised landmarks with neatly done city's- Fully licensed and overwhelmingly well detailed trucks!- Good ai - Lots of new things *Negatives*Unfortunatly lacks realistic road physics, but still good. I strongly reccomend this brilliant game! 10/10			"

												This game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing ideal for when you just need to calm down.Right now there are only three states but since they're adding more in in the upcoming months you'll be able to go on even longer haul shipments, which means more time and more money.Some people could call this a time waster but for some odd reason it's actually really enjoyable.

												ABSOLUTELY no sissies or wimps allowed on the long haul. stop reading here if you're a wimp.first off - I've been driving trucks professionally for over 30 years. I've racked up more miles while rolling coast to coast than I can count. discluding the lack of ""friends of the road"" and road beers, this simulation really encapsulates the freedom of the open road and gives drivers the opportunity to really become a silent guardian of the highway. laying that hammer down on the first on-ramp is truly an unforgettable experience. 10/10.now stop reading reviews. man up son and hit the road for the long haul.

 YES I LOVE THE GAME BUT THIS HONEST REVIEWWhere to start with SCS software's new journey This game has been a long time coming with alot of hype surrounding it and I have clocked a mass amount of hours and im still truckin So what is good what is the bad list is below for those who don,t want to read long reviewPROSSet in the USA very nice fresh lookVery nice looking graphicsGreat immersionGreat for low end and high end PC'sNew featuresLimited bugsPlenty of control settings/optionsNoob friendlyMod supportWorld of trucks supportLot's of potentialTrading cardsAchievementsCONSNo help on what certain settings do like most games haveWeigh bridge's should do more (currently just inconvenience)Lack of release content (which was expected)Not enough AI car variety (to many old cars)Rain drops still don't appear on truck :( no rain spray LONG REVIEWHere we go, first thoughts on upon launching the game is help my ears from deafening intro warning for headset user's.First look around it is very ETS2 looking alot is simple copy and paste new UI would have given this game home area better feel and look.Lot's of options and it does take a little while to get everything set to personal preference I run CSW with CSE v2 pedals and thrustmaster shifter and DSD button box, everything worked with no real conflicts.Brief look around most stuff is laid out in same manner as ETS2 so for those with ETS2 background navigation quite easy.First drive once again everything is easy to find select quick job and im on the road game feels smooth and to be honest feels like ETS2 in  alot of ways upon driving first thing you notice is the pain in the♥♥♥♥♥police bang $1000 fine great when start with $2000 or like me broke at third intersection speeding, red light and clipped car trying to stop bang -$$$ great lucky the bank is every so nice to lend a hand and put you in debt straight away.Once we get past the new game blues we get truckin and out on the open road it is really a blast its just spectacular  to see all detail around especially in main cities and roads are great lots different elevations etc.Loads lots of jobs to choose from but SCS failed by pretty much copy paste of most trailers which is bit of let down but mods can fix that if your into mods, There is alot more place to drop off loads and the new random parking is great depending on your settings, touching on this I hope they release twin trailers but from what I have seen it could be another SCS pipe dream.Game performance is good with no crashes and no game breaking bugs for me just a few minor bugs.Graphics are really nice but reflections and lighting still need tweaking I also expected to see more from SCS like for example water spray, rain drops on body work, pools water on road, and skid marks, Also the surrounding environment looks really nice I feel SCS have come up a little bit short with people AI still looking a little pre ETS2.The game can be time consuming and grinding to make money I personally like this as it is good for prolonged game play but will turn others away.Overall it has been alot of fun so far and it is still alot of fun which is good but i think the game released with to little content I can understand there marketing strategy but I think breaking the game down into a bunch of DLC could be wrong move.Final thought's im interested to see where this game will go and what improvements they will make I do recommend the game but I think the buyer needs to beware that this game release with two states and two trucks so it will be a strong DLC game which for some people is not viable option, This game has alot of good and potential and im afraid SCS have missed some possibility's to make this game truly special.Fulysic Recommended 7.5 out of 10			"

												Ok, I come from a background of playing Pedal to the Metal and Haulin, respectfully. I've never played ETS or ETS2, so I can't compare this game to those. The following review is on ATS:Fantastic game! I really enjoy it. It's really well done and is superb, even though it only has three states and two trucks. (more on that later).Graphics: 8/10. My computer is pretty good. It can handle FSX fine, but for some reason, it struggles with this game. I had to turn down my settings in game and I have to live with jaggies, or else it becomes an unplayble slideshow. I refuse to upgrade to Windows 10 (currently running W7) just to improve the performance, as the aforementioned FSX may then have issues. However, that being said, the graphics are absolutely beautiful! The landscapes at dawn or dusk are truly a sight to behold! The trucks are extremely well done, both inside and out. Shadows moving across the dash, the interior views of the sleepers, etc. You can tell alot of time and effort were put into designing the trucks! One small thing I really like that wasn't doable in the games I mentioned, is the ability to turn on parking lights only without turning the headlights on. This is a cool feature as just like in real life I can illuminate the dash without the headlights needing to be on as well. Also, the rain effects are impressive! (If you want realism, since it rarely rains in the states included, you can turn this effect off.)  Gameplay: 10/10. Yes, gameplay is nearly perfect! In Pedal to the Metal and Haulin, the trucks all drove like high performance autos, I.e. 0-60 MPH in two seconds, even while pulling a fully loaded trailer. Here, the trucks are slow to get up to speed, and definitley feel heavy going up hills. Gives that bit of realism as I struggle to get up to 55 MPH while AI cars pass me. Only small gripe is the cops are really picky. Go five miles over the limit and you will get ticketed. However, you can turn cops off in settings and fly if you prefer.Fun factor: 10/10. Whether you're a real life trucker, or one who never got the chance to be one but wonders what it'd be like to live life on the road with 18 wheels under you, this game is definitely for you. I find myself spending hours and hours driving around and delivering or dropping off loads. I usually bore of driving sim games after a few days; not so here. Every day after work I come home and start this game, and you can say farewell to me for hours, lol.In summary: As mentioned above, only three states are available thus far. But you know what? I don't care! Each state is extremely well done, and since I live in Vegas, it's where I started my career. I can say it's pretty darn accurate, right down to the sculptures alongside the 95 freeway! Only gripe would be, freeway offramps and onramps do NOT have stop signs; they have traffic signals. But ok..Driving from Vegas to Tucson, for example, feels like a long trip, just like in real life. No, it won't take 6 + hours real time, but it sure feels like it! So, three states are enough for me, so long as each additional state they create is just as well-detailed. The states included are more than enough to keep me busy. My first time driving over the Golden Gate Bridge was simply stunning! I almost wrecked trying to enjoy the scenery, lol.The available upgrades to the trucks (levels) are impressive. Almost like they borrowed features from previous modders. I recommend starting with the Kenworth W900. I was able to upgrade it to include the studio sleeper, an abundance of lights, and a beautiful dashboard after just reaching Level 12. I'm only using the included defaults, but for those interested in other trucks and aren't willing to wait for SCS, there are plenty of mods available on the internet. www.modsats.com has a nice selection. Also, for those who want a full USA map and again don't want to wait, the same site has one called the ""coast to coast v 1.8 map"" that's getting positive reviews. They also have one that includes Mexico and Canada, so if you wish to go across the borders, there you go.In summary: I really enjoy this game. Almost every day I see something new. As an example, the other day I took a wrong turn and went behind an apartment complex. I actually saw a guy dancing in the back of the building, with a girl sitting there watching him! Little things like this really make the game world feel alive. Even little things like an obvious UPS van (although it's called something different in game) being unloaded by a guy in his brown uniform, pedestrians milling about on street corners, the blowing tumbleweeds across the desert road, etc. All are a huge step up from the previous games I played.Pros: Great graphics, great gameplay, hours of fun, great rewards.Cons: Poor performance on my better than average machine. Hoping that as more states are released, it doesn't kill my machine. Limited trucks to drive and only 3 states, but that can be solved with mods as mentioned earlier.Recommend? Highly!			"

												So I grew up in Sacremento, and have traveled from Sacremento through Reno Into Winnemucca then up into Oregon maybe 5-10 times, It's my favorite road trip and I love taking it each time, I've been to Truckee, San Fransisco, San Diego, Fresno, Stockton, Oakland, Los Angeles, and even more I can't think of . I must say their representation of it is SPOT ♥♥♥♥ING ON, It feels exactly like the real places, most of the time when driving around these cities I can tell where I am just from the surronding area, I must say this game has done an outstanding job of replicating the states that are in the game, and I hope to see more states come along in the future!

												What more can I say, Driving Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks on some US highways and through US towns. What is not to like.After tweaking some GFX settings (HDR off and Heat Haze off - My preference) the game looks great, runs great and I lose so much time driving around delivering different types of freight my poor wife will be joining ATS Widows soon.On top of being a fun and very addictive Truck SImulator, I made a whoops and registered my account on World of Trucks on a seperate account to me ETS 2 game, with an email to SCS asking for assistance in combining the two accounts, they quick on verifying I owned the two games and merged my accounts into one withy very little fuss. This is the type of Dev Team I like, not only working on their game, but making sure the community members are supported as well.Enjoy Truck driving games, you can not go wrong with American Truck Simulator, though still small in map (only been released) Arizona is coming very soon as a free addition and many more states there after as DLC, ATS will become quite a large place to drive around in. I can not recommend it enough if the genre suits you.			"

												As I have said in my ETS2 review driving a virtual truck might not seem like the most exiting of things, but ATS just like ETS2 before it manages to achieve the improbable and actually makes it a very relaxing and fun experience to just start your favourite music on the radio and drive through the expansive roads, cities and small towns of California, Nevada, and Arizona delivering various goods and growing your trucking empire.Both ETS2 and ATS have something unique to offer. ATS captures the feel of US roads pretty well particularly after the rescale SCS has done to make the map a lot bigger and complete. The diversity of companies and cargo is pretty good in my opinion, and the three states provide plenty of roads to drive, even if not as much as full ETS2. The complexity of cities is also better in ATS than in most parts of ETS2.ATS definitely has a different feel to ETS2, the landscapes are new as well as road layouts and the overall feel is different to when I am driving in ETS2. You can definitely tell whether you are in Europe or the US and not just because of the truck you are driving. The only downside of ATS currently is that it has only 2 truck brands with 4 truck models together; and it seems SCS is having a rather hard time getting new truck licenses so the wait for new trucks, if you don’t like using mods, might be rather long.Overall ATS is a brilliant US truck simulator with a ton of potential when new states and new trucks are added in the future.

												Fantastic trucking game. To keep it short, it's like ETS2 but in America, and seeing the postitve responses to ETS2 just shows how good this game formula is. Even if you aren't too interested in simulators this can be fun, it's only $20 as well, basically a must have for everyone out there. Word of warning though, this is a lot younger than ETS2, so it has a lot less content than ETS2 (but still tons of mods) more will come with time.			"

												Bought this on impulse after watching a Youtube video of it.  8/10 easily.Pros:Works fine with a PS4 or XBox controller (I remapped a few things for simplicity's sake)Relaxing & FunDecent graphicsMassive & easy-to-install mod supportMost major cities in California & Nevada are representedBacking a truck into a dock...something insanely addicting about itThe detail of the trucks and various trailers/haulers is impressiveCons:Map is scaled down considerably more than necessary  - After 30 hours, I've driven every street, road, & highway  - Vegas is represented as about six city blocks...certainly not remotely realistic.Generic companies & signage (though mods fix this)Very easy to make money...pretty much no difficultyTraffic lights & speed zones are brutal (go from 80 mph to a 30mph zone instantly...boom speeding ticket)AI traffic is potato  - Vegas is a ghost town.  8 lanes of highway, maybe two cars on it ever  - AI gets out of your way...you can bully your way through on/off ramps with near-impunityOnly two states  - A third state, Arizona, is supposed to be coming out in the next few weeks or so  - Not sure if they're going to charge for DLC of other 45 CONUS states, Canada, or MexicoFor $20, this is a pretty fun game in a completely different way than I'm used to enjoying games.  Highly HIGHLY recommend you use the Steam Workshop to download a few cosmetic mods and radio station list.  Jamming to '80s music while delivering a backhoe to a job site is great.			"

												Being someone who thoroughly enjoyed ETS2, this game was equally if not more enjoyable.Pros: - Trucking now requires more skill (trucks harder to maneuver).- Good graphical detail (Requires decent GPU)Cons:- There are now active police cars on the road. No more 175km/h on the highway where there are no speed cameras ;(- If you enjoyed the scenery in ETS2 (particularly Scandinavia), then you may find the scenery in ATS underwhelming.- This is by no means a complete game with only 3 of the US states having been implemented. However this does not mean this is not an enjoyable game. - There were initially a few issues with this game but I have found that most of these have been ironed out through updates. - Not really a con but once again you will find yourself in situations with a truck (with a significantly longer wheelbase compared to ETS2) and an extremely long trailer, in which you will find it very difficult to clear traffic, obstacles etc.Overall a great game and definitely recommended to those who liked Eurotruck Simulator 1 & 2. And to those of you who prehaps didn't find ETS2 & ETS2 as fun as you would have liked, American Truck Simulator may very well change your opinion of SCS truck simulators. I am really looking forward to the release of more truck companies and of course wider map coverage to include more than the 3 US states that are currently in game. I know this game is still in the early stages of map development and I haven't looked into the developer's intentions but I would love to see this map to expand out to include not only all the states of the USA but surrounding countries such as Canada (maybe including Alaska), Mexico and so on (maybe as DLC as that would be quite an effort).

Product received for free
												American Truck Simulator is a continuation of SCS tradition of (almost only) Truck Simulators, still ATS have little in comon with previous titles like 18 Wheels of Steel. First of all: It is beautiful. It is a lovely experience to drive, even without a wheel since the new steering system was implemented in Euro Truck simulator.ATS features western USA, currently only California, Nevada and Arizona. More states will surely follow as DLCs. Some mods open up the entire continent, but they are unsupported and may cause problems with your savegame. Some of the community made stuff is really great, i remember the ETS2 PROMODS Scandinavian mod that added the nordic countries to the game, and it was very nicely done.The game is basically this: Move cargo from A to B.Doesnt sound like much fun, but considering that you are the one behind the wheel who gets to get the trailer from say, Reno to Phoenix, curse at slow drivers, drive slowly through the very lifelike rain, chose a speedy route around Sacramento to avoid the morning rush, avoid getting a speedingticket from hidden police cars and eventually detach the trailer at the destination, hopefully without having dented it, because damage cause a penalty and you wont get as much money and XP.As you drive, you level up and chose what type of cargo and bonuses you should get. So do any drivers you hire but you can control what types of cargo they haul and with that what sort of skill they should aim for when leveling up.You can customise your trucks, add better engines, paint, lights (etc) and as you level up, you unlock more things to add.Only bad thing about ATS i suspect: Like with ETS/ETS2, there is no endgame stuff to buy. Once you get a truckstop in all cities, fill em with trucks and drivers (if you do not run out of them, like i did in ETS2), there isnt a whole lot to do. I was sitting on €200 mil in ETS2 which was the equivalent of the GDP of a small nation and had nothing to buy. Right now i cannot see any endgame cash-sink features that would put a future fortune to good use. This is a small problem though since the game is more about driving around.Is it worth it? Well, as with all SCS truck games: Buy!Hint: Something that gives you a good atmosphere is to find a good internet radiostation and play that in the background and you drive endlessly into the night.

												While the game released in early February 2016, I decided to wait to write my review until the rescaled map and a 4th truck were added to the game. Here we are, 9 months later, and I've got some things to say...This game is not for everyone, but for people who enjoy relaxing trips through the open roads of the United States, while hauling cargo from point A to point B. The graphics aren't what you would find in most modern games, but that's not exactly the point. In American Truck Simulator, you are tasked with delivering cargo through California, Nevada, and Arizona (other states to come later), while following the laws of American roadways.It's a simulation game, so while some may find it completely boring and not at all entertaining, others find it calming yet fun. Trucks can be slow or quick, depending on the model, engine, parts, and trailer/cargo. American Truck Simulator (like Euro Truck Simulator 2) supports keyboard/mouse, various controllers (I've tested Xbox 360 and Xbox One, both of which worked), steering wheels (such as the popular Logitech G27), head-tracking devices (such as TrackIR), and even virtual reality headsets (such as the Oculus Rift).No, there's no official multiplayer, but the popular modification TruckersMP allows you to truck around with friends, showing off your different taste in trucks, paint jobs, liveries, and even wheels.PROS:- Great variety of cargo to haul- 3 states (California, Nevada, Arizona) with more to come in future DLC's- Map that has been scaled to ensure long hauls feel long- 4 awesome trucks (Kenworth T680 & W900, Peterbilt 579 & 389)- Great customization options for all trucks- Support for many input devices- Support for third-party modifications- Support for Steam Workshop contentCONS:- No official multiplayer (check out TruckersMP)- Slow productionOVERALL RATING: 8/10			"

												I'll be brief: compared to ETS2, this game has the following new features AT RELEASE:- New map of two US states: California and Nevada.- Police cars drive around and serve as mobile speed traps. No more careless speeding between speed traps.- Two new American trucks. Two is also the total number of trucks you can drive in the game at release. Read it: 2. TWO.- New traffic models, replacing European cars with American ones.- Some minor parking tweaks.- It has helicopters, blimps and crop dusters flying around. Crop dusters are cool.- It has weigh-in stations, which are basically the same annoying toll booths, but you don't pay.That's it. That's the exhaustive list of innovations. ATS has the same interface, the same progression, the same skill system, the same loan system, the same messages, the same tutorial, the same graphics (it doesn't look better than ETS2 at all), even THE SAME MENU MUSIC. Everything is the same. Except it's in America, and with fewer trucks.This is a very well done, very pretty, and very expensive (all things considered) OFFICIAL MOD for Euro Truck Simulator 2.Get it if you're okay with more of the same in new, less diverse environment. Otherwise, stay away. At least, for now. SCS will probably (read: definitely) add more trucks and areas eventually, but I seriously doubt the experience will be much different.			"

												In general - If you want to drive trucks build your very own company by hiring drivers. well this game is for you, i have been playing ETS2 for quite a bit of time which is based in europe so now this game is based in America currently it includes 3 states - California. Neveda, and Arizona and i have to say that they have really improved on the map, road textured, day cycle, etc. Is this game worth over ETS2? well it's really your choice depending on which continent you wanna drive in but if it was for me to make decision i would have gone for ATS over ETS2 due to few reasons i listed above. Is this game worth the money? Yes they actuallydid a very good job, you won't find any better trucking game then this, right now the game is lacking DLC's (obeviously it's new) but in time to come there will be better and cooler DLC's. :)			"

												I bought this game a week after it came out.i knew it would be fun, but not this much fun! I had 18wos Haulin along with 18wos Extreme Trucker,and American Truck Simulator is a HUGE improvement over them.ive played over 400 hours on this game and i love it! it feels like your really driving a truck! If they add Washington,i would go crazy,because i'm From Washington.Accually,i hope they add in the whole united states.Honestly i think this game is amazing! I dont think it could get any more realistic! I hope to drive a truck when i am older,but this game will deffinitly do for now! 10/10			"

												Hey, first review here. So don't expect an expert in video games. But in real american trucks. I am. I drive trucks since 1993. I like racing sims like Asseto Corsa and the likes. When I saw European Truck Simulator on sale, I gave it a try not expecting much. I do this for a living remember? I got hooked! This is almost like the real thing. Don't skip parking your trailers. It's the best part. Use your mirrors, not your views. I had to try American Truck Simulator. They have a Peterbuilt just like the one I drive at work. The American version is much harder because the trucks and trailers are so much bigger. This is great! I like the fact that you can build up your garage and your fleet using loans or just plain waiting and working for it. Hiring A.I. drivers to drive your other trucks. You can have multiple garages! Internet radio and the music player that plays your own music. Genius. Well, that was my bit. If you want the almost true feeling of driving a big rig on the road. Look no further.			"

 Far more than re-skin of ETS2 When you buy American Truck Simulator, you are buying two things - an excellent base game, and the promise of significant expansions/DLC/improvements over the next years. The game as it is now is already excellent - the world, although maybe a little small compared to Euro Truck Simulator 2, seems far more detailed and far more alive than some of the parts in the base ETS2 map. Of course, the game engine is pretty much the same and it will feel very familiar to ETS2 users. There are, however, plenty of things to enjoy in ATS - from challenging deliveries to long open roads, not to mention those great American trucks.With California and Nevada in the game at the time of writing this review, the world can feel a little small. In my current 33 hours of gameplay I have visited all major towns and have explored over 75% of the map, something which would have taken far, far longer in Euro Truck Simulator 2. On the other hand, with a free Arizona update coming soon and the promise of significant map expansions through DLC, American Truck Simulator is only going to get bigger and better over time.This is a great single player experience, that can also be enhanced through multiplayer play with the Truckersmp mod which is easy to install and free. If you are tired of driving around California and Nevada on your own, join up with some friends and join a convoy! TL;DR A great single player and multiplayer experience that promises to get even better as more content is added to the game by developers. Well worth it for people who enjoyed ETS2 - it is more than re-skin and it is also a great introduction to those who sneer at or have not had the pleasure of enjoying truck simulation.			"

												It's hard not to compare this to ETS2 but that is the standard SCS have set for themselves. So what have they done well and what's new to like? They've done a remarkable job capturing the American feel of small towns, large cities, surrounding countryside and the AI vehicles. The detail that has gone into the local businesses is terrific. Graphics are excellent and on par with ETS2 with a slight improvement in texture quality. The game runs stable with not so much as a single crash or hiccup in 14 hours.It's also nice being able to drive American trucks and trailers, and is a welcome change of pace from the Euro HGV trucks. There is a new parking option I like when delivering loads that you can gain extra XP if you put the trailer exactly where the customer wants it or in certain places. It sort of harkens back to the challenge of the dangerous drives of Scania Truck Sim or Truck & Trailers though on a much smaller scale. The world feels alot more alive with NPCs that actually are busy doing stuff instead of just standing around and many other little details too numerous to mention. That said is there anything else not to like? Nothing really bad but it falls short in a few areas that I had higher hopes for:1. Sound - While the truck sound effects are adequate, some are recycled from ETS2. The engines sounds are just okay but inaccurate, engine brake is far too muffled and the air brakes don't sound anything like the Kenworths and Peterbilts I see everyday with their brash loud blasts of air, rattling diesel engines and jake brakes so loud you nearly soil yourself if you're next to one.2. Weigh stations - This is another new game mechanic which sounds good on paper but adds little if anything to the game. I'm not really sure what they're trying to do here but after nearly 14 hours of playtime I've been required to stop at two weigh stations and nothing happened either time so it doesn't add anything significant that I can see.3. Game size - The game world is small compared to the initial release of ETS2 and of course with all of the ETS2 map add ons, SCS has a very long way to go to catch up. It took a long time for them to just create two states and months for Arizona which still isn't available. It makes one wonder if they'll ever get the entire continental USA.4. Only two truck brands to choose from which is a real bummer. While I'm sure the licensing will be worked out eventually for other brands, they could have at least released them under ficticious names, assuming they're finished with the modeling. We really need to see Freightliner, Mack, International and Western Star to name a few.In summary I give it a recommendation to hard core sim fans, SCS fans or trucking fans but more casual sim fans might want to wait until the game matures more and more content is added.On to the big three things most people look for in a game I'll give the following ratings:Graphics - 9/10Sound - 6/10Gameplay -8/10Overall - 7.5/10			"

												As much as I anticipated this games release once it was announced, it has turned into a huge disappointment. I was hoping this would be a new game, but let’s be honest, it’s just a reskinned ETS2. If you were to take an alpha state ETS2 full conversion mod of the US(California), add a few new features, take away all the trucks but 2, forget to rescale the game for the sheer size of the US, and add overly aggressive police, then you have American Truck Simulator.All BS aside, it’s not ALL bad;Pros+ Feels more like being in civilization+ More realistic than ETS2+ More options to park trailers+ New places to deliver to aside from just industrial like ETS2+ Well optimized for Ultra settings @ 4K resolutonCons- Horrible scaling (most of western Europe can fit in 1/3 of the US, yet takes only 5 mins to drive from Barstow to Sacramento vs that same mileage in ETS2 taking 30-45 mins)- Same 4-year-old ETS2 engine - Same ETS2 UI, Sounds, Physics, Graphics- Overly aggressive police which account for every 3rd vehicle, not to mention all the ones hiding on side of roadways(can be turned off). - No real changes or innovations over ETS2, despite game being 4 years newer. - Weak day 1 release content (to be expected).Granted I understand this is a brand new game, so content will be lacking vs a game that has been built and refined for 4 years, but come on, seriously? A few cities? 2 trucks? Same exact engine that ETS2 was on? Couldn’t even at least change the UI to somewhat make it feel like a new game? I cannot recommend this game in its current state. ATS is a perfect example on how “DLC” has ruined the industry, allowing developers to give you only 30% of a game, then make up for it later with “DLC” instead of just spending the time to make the full game first. Save your money and get ETS2 instead. ATS might be worth a revisit 1-2 years down the line after 5-6 more DLC are released to finish the game, plus tons of content patches (which I do give props to SCS on actually), but not right now. ETS2 offers far more game for your money. This is a joke.			"

												I badly wanted to like this game, and I really like SCS and understand they are a small company with lmited resoucers. But I just can't ignore the problems this game has:- Nothing really new compared to ETS2. The exaclty same UI is hard to ignore. The performance seems optimized but that's it, nothing new was introduced. Still terrible A.I / shimmering effect on fences / poles / anything vertical.- The A.I is still the same terrible one from ETS2- No ""open window"" feature despite many requests over the years- No ""smoke"" on trucks, something umbelivable since 18WS had smokes 10 years ago.- I get it that the scale had to be smaller than ETS2 as U.S is really big, but as pointed out for many US players, they went too far on a 1:34 scale. A lot of stuff feels off and everything is rushed- Jesus Christ what is going on with the fine costs? Was forced to disable it- Was really not a good idea to launch a game with such a small scale with only 2 states.In the end, the feeling that ATS should be at maximum an ETS2 Expansion is really strong.And despite it costing a lower price on US, they didn't customized the cost for other countries so it's costing close to full / AAA games in many stores. It just doesn't worth it. "

												Feels very limited; should have been Early Access. Having actually driven these routes in real life here in California I was disappointed I couldn't hit some of the major towns and cities as well as other major highways. With the state of DLC realeases in computer gaming I'm concerned I would have to pay for more states. Its work to make all that which I understand but I dont want to have to make more purchases to make it feel complete.The game looks good and plays well. I think a lot of people will really like it. For a casual truck sim user like myself I will save the 20 bucks and just play ETS2			"

												Okay, I'm sure, in the near future, this review will turn from negative to postitive, so keep that in mind when reading.As of right now, there just isn't enough content. Two trucks and a surprisingly small replication of California and Nevada is all you get. This will obviously increase, but I atleast expected a decent proportion of the US and a range of trucks on release.So, once things have been ironed out in terms of content, I will right a full comprehensive review of this game.For the meantime, it plays like ETS 2, looks like ETS 2, feels like ETS 2, basically it is ETS 2, just in America. This isn't a negative point, I love ETS 2. It runs well, looks good, cities included are detailed. Scale wise I have read it's pretty small but I don't live or have ever been to California or Nevada, and I don't live in the US.Basically, it's a functional game, and a good game, just wait for the content before you buy, I can't see my playing this a whole lot until an update is released.

												Really fun game.  I have played over 300 hours and enjoyed it quite a bit.  I've even dozed off while driving...not recommended. hahaGraphics are great.  Living in San Diego, CA, the landscape and buildings feel familiar enough that you could almost place yourself, at times.I come back to this game almost monthly for a few days.  I've yet to place the Arizona DLC, but I am excited!It's impossible to regret purchasing this game, unless you're looking for some form of demolition derby.  This game rewards you if you apply even a modicum of patience and safe driving.My favorite feature of this game is the ability to hire staff and purchase extra trucks.  It's a minigame that increases your profitability. --a real treat. :)Do it nao!			"

Drive to my trailer, get the goods, turn up the in-game radio (~free as a bird~), check my GPS and plan my trip, cross the states through day and night cycle and finally making a delivery at the destination only to find myself wanting to pick up another external contract again. On top of that, I get to manage my own trucking company. Get a new paintjob for my favorite truck every now and then. This game is amazing. Highly recommended.			"

												I was originally really hype for this game. I played so much of Euro Truck Sim 2, so an American version was really exciting. Everything that was in the European version is here, so if you've played ETS before, you'll have no problem skipping all of the tutorials and jumping straight into the game. They added a couple of new features, like choosing your parking difficulty and weigh stations and the lanscapes look exactly like their real life counterparts. They really did their homework in that regard. However, the game was still extremely disappointing. For one, there were only 2 playable states on launch: California and Nevada. This means completing the game is a lot easier and routes tend to be much shorter. I wouldn't mind too much, if it didn't mean traveling on the same highways over and over again because the longest routs usually take you to the same places. The game also only launched with only two trucks too, which is weird because I thought this was called American TRUCK Simulator. I know the lack of trucks was because of licensing issues and they'll be adding more trucks and states later (I believe they already added another truck in an update), but it was still disappointing to see this go a similar route of Sims 4 (a new installation in a franchise with less content than its predecessors). Don't get me wrong though, I still really enjoy what the game had going for it so far, and I've logged quite a few hours into the game already, however, I can't recommend buying it right now since there's not much in it yet. Wait until they add more content, then I really recommend buying it.			"

												As of Feburary 3rd, 2016. I would recommend this game to nobody, instead, I would recommend them to ETS2, or a game with more content for that matter, here is my reasoning.Oh, and for the record, I would've easily waited 3-6 more months if we had make a couple more states and some actual polishing. I plan on playing ETS2 now for 3-6 to help compensate for this.-The content is so small. I've gotten to all the towns within 4 hours of play. -There is only 2 trucks, I saw the blog post about this, but honestly, just make the fake names like how it was done in ETS2.-This feels like a DLC rather than an actual game. It's a re-skined version of ETS2.-The highways are 2 lanes or 3 (both ways). Last time I went to America, it's a 5-10 lane highway (both ways). I really hope they can some implement this in the next couple states, or at least fix the highways already.-The cop presence is high, it was a little annoying at the start because of how I could go 1mph over the limit and it would still go, just a little more sensitive than ETS2.-The AI is horribly wrong, honestly SCS, what's up with the right left turns on red and merging? Left-turns are okay, but can be improved upon.-The map is unrealistic, it's like this, get a job, go on interstate for literally 5 mintues, exit, drop off load, repeat. This whole process could take 10 minutes.-Truck customization is extremely limited.-As an AMD user with an MSI R9 290, I am getting some performance messes, even outside the cities. I've only noticed 2 of these, so it's minor, but noticeable.I will update this later on, but in the mean time, SCS, please polish your game and add more content.			"

												Oversimplified, it is ETS2 moved to the US.  Different models and terrain, smaller scale distances and time goes quicker, but the same game, basically.  SCI is moving to a DLC sales model where this will undoubtedly result in incremental charges over the next several years, just like the ETS2 model (if not more ambitious).  Modders have already had their way and sometimes made some nice things, but nothing close to ETS2 yet (which is logical).This will be a great game, it just might be expensive to see it.bought on sale with a coupon, paid $16 and it was worth it.  7/10.

												ATS very much looks, feels and plays like ETS2. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is very subjective. It's perfectly understandable that some people call it a glorified DLC and that there isn't much content at the moment. But let's be honest, the game is also priced as a glorified DLC :)    The base game consists of the standard assets and the state of California. All other content is added in the form of DLC's This can be both free or payed DLC. Like in ETS2, new trucks will be added to the game for free. Currently, due to licensing issues, there are only the Peterbilt 579 and the Kenworth T680. SCS already has a few more trucks ready to roll out as soon as they have the approval. The first two new states are also added as free DLC. Nevada was released together with the base game and Arizona will be added soon, altough soon can easily take a few months in SCS terms ;)Graphics and performance have improved over ETS2 but not by a huge margin. I think ATS looks a bit better with improved textures, especially the roads. It's also more detailed and has way more variety in the scenery, while in the stock ETS2 map it was just more of the same. The engine also seems to be better optimized, wich results in a bit smoother fps. Only 64-bit is officially supported this time. SCS is offering an unsupported 32-bit version for a limited time, wich can be obtained via de Betas tab within the game's properties. The game can perfectly be played and enjoyed with a controller. Settings like sensitivity and deadzone can be adjusted for the analog controls. Off course, a keyboard also works but... don't, just don't. For the full experience, a steering wheel is highly recommended, just as much as with a (semi) realistic racing game. It's a complete gamechanger. If you also own a TrackIR, great, another gamechanger! All SCS' trucksims have native support for this device. A neat new feature are multiple ways to park your trailer. Not in the mood for difficult parking but just pressing Enter is to fake? Just do it the easy but 'legal' way and just drive your rig forward in the designated spot. However, this will off course result in less XP than you would have gotten when parking like a boss.  I do have some minor complaints. ATS still has the same simplistic road network that ETS2 has. Second, the scaling of the map; it's smaller than ETS2's scale. I can understand that they had to do this since the US is such a ridiculously large country. I just would have wanted it to be a bit larger. Travelling from city to city is over just to quickly. Than there's the AI -_- It has improved over ETS2 but it's far from perfect. There are still many AI drivers who never passed their driving test and somehow managed to get a car. Remember those creatures in ETS2 who stopped on the highway to let you merge? They're not only living in Europe. The game also doesn't have much variety in AI vehicles. Well, noting that the modding community can't fix. ATS has the same extensive modding support that made ETS2 a huge success. That also puts the lack off standard content a bit in perspective, unless you don't want to use any mods. At the time of writing, there are already lots of mods available, including drivable trucks, cargo's, AI vehicles, skins etc. Map expansion are just a matter of time. SCS took their sweet time to release this game and many expected a bit more content at release. I'm sure they will take care of this, like they did with ETS2. That game is well over three years old now and is still being worked on. In the end SCS delivered the quality that we come to expect from them. If you played and like ETS2, you will feel right at home in ATS. Even with it's flaws and weaknesses, it's still that ultra relaxing driving experience that so many people love.			"

												I do not drive trucks for a living, nor have I ever.In fact, I don't even drive a car - I live in a major US city, and some medical issues prevent me from driving safely. When I could drive a car, I didn't enjoy it.So why am I in love with this game?I bought this on a whim. Hey, it's $20. If I hated it, I could always get a refund. I played for about half an hour the first time, barely making it out of the tutorial. I had chosen the third ""level"" of controls (shifting and mouse steering) out of four, which made the game unintelligible to me. I considered, and discarded, the idea of getting a refund. It was a neat game, but definitely not for me since I never knew how to drive a standard anyway.Then I started it up again later that evening... and I've been playing for hours ever since.Something about this game is so soothing, so freeing - it's unbelievable. The graphical fidelity reminds me of GTAV, although (obviously) less detailed and not bothering with animating humans. Neon blinks uselessly in open starry nights, proclaiming doughnuts here / left turn only / ACME goods. A year ago, I took a ride with a friend out into the wild empty desert around Barstow (and yes we did have Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas audiobook playing while we did so). This game does a wonderful job at capturing the grit and loneliness of that open, alien world.I finally figured out how to not roll backwards when I get to the top of an onramp. That was a good thing. I feel clever when I do things like this - I understand now why people drive, I think. Downshifting to slow down when I see brakelights flash briefly in the distance... and then, sure enough, there's a traffic light I didn't anticipate but I'm already slowed down!... these things make me feel that private sort of joy you get in any video game when you make a particularly difficult play.I don't know why I like this game. I'll never be great at it, and that's okay. I have no interest in trucking, or driving, in the real world. But I wanted to write this review to let people know that this game might grab them in the way it did me.Give this game a try.One quick edit while I'm thinking about it: Most of the negative reviews here are due to two main factors:1. Actual, real, live, human truckers disappointed that the game does not perfectly capture the depth or distance of driving for 40+ hours at a stretch (I am okay with this; I have no desire to sit for that long). I understand, but I disagree with, that as a criticism. Games must remove some of the tedium from real life.2. People giving temporary thumbs-down because the existing world is rather small. True. There are only two states out of the forty-eight that comprise the continental US. The company has stated they will add more.			"

												In its current state I cannot even suggest buying it for half the price. I'm overlooking the Map and Truck section as those will increase in a month or 2 in the future.Pros:-Annoying Cops (one was behind me when I was ""speeding"" and gave me 2 tickets before I got enough speed to pull away)-Cops actually turn their lights on like 18WoS-AI seem to give similar concept to truckers-Texture Detail (those who own Scandinavia will see a clone)-Rights on reds works flawlessly (not a good thing when you don't need to stop...)-weight scales-obscure parking jobsCons:-All trucks sound the same, or at least the ones I've driven (only 2), Engines the same, horns the same... Modder's have real truck horns and they are not licensed in ETS2, Why do we not at least have this?-AI is far more buggy than its Europe counterpart! I've witnessed so far 2 cars in front of me ""sliding"" sideways going straight as well. Very hard to see if you're not paying attention-AI just vanish right in front of you, and I'm going to assume can do the same (explains me sideswiping a red truck, that should of been visible in the mirror)-AI have a wide yield to you space, you even start turning out of your left turn lane you will stop traffic-If you can't stop and go thru a yellow-to-red light you have a 90% chance of getting a ""just cause we can"" red light ticket-Cops wont chase you, you just get a auto ticket.-Scandinavia Clone0 effort seems to of gone into it, but as a ""map mod"" with 2 trucks (for now), with working cop cars and right turning abilities w/o fines.Should you buy it? Only if you like Steampunk. After that offer is up wait 6 months for 50% off... You waited this long you can wait longer, to pay what it is actually worth!Do i regret buying it? No, but I don't agree with the price. For $30 CAD it's possibly the most expensive least content game I own, and I own tons of useless games.			"

												UPDATED REVIEW  MARCH 11, 2017Here's my review of American Truck Simulator. After 200 hours of game time play in the last 6 weeks since the first time I purchased it I am more excited than I was on day one. Why because of all the modifications out there especially when it comes to different trucks to drive. Check ou my profile I customized a new Peterbilt 389 rig, added Chrome LED Lights, Peterbilt illuminated LOGO, Bullhorns, Grill Bar, and a two spoke steering wheel and it only costed me about $65K (one of the cheaper modded trucks). Drives more smoothly, and the sound is AAHHHmazing!!!Do I recommend the game?  Yes I do recommend buying this game at the price point of $20. Its no longer on sale for $10 but the sale comes and goes with the times. You will be buying it just in time for the update to ATS version 1.6 (currently in Public Alpha Beta testing.)Thats where a couple of concerns come into play at. One being that when you first start playing you have plenty to do to occupy your time. However if you are a hardcore player such as myself that easily plays 4-6 hours a day driving up to 1,500 miles a day (78,000 XP, 48,000 miles approx. total) then you'll run out of things to do and will find yourself driving the same route over and over. At this point I have 75% of the roads covered in the game.My second concern, and you should take notice to this as well is the modifications. Modifications are good, especially if you are trying to add an element or realism and spontaneous situations to the game. You can do almost every thing under the sun with the right mod. HOWEVER, with most mods being compatible to the current version of ATS 1.5.3 , once ATS 1.6 rolls out almost ALL OF YOUR MODS will cancel out and youll have to refresh and download NEW. That kind of bums me because I have the right mods for my game including my new Peterbilt 389 which im certain to lose (BUMMER)However, if you want variety of places to go to and want to stay occupied look into Euro Truck Simulator for 19.99. You'll have plenty to do. If you still want to drive in America then get this game and go to the various different mod websites such as atsmods, modland (my favorite), sharemods etc where you can find different variety of maps, trucks, sound mods, whatever you can think of. Also same mods can be found directly in the Steam Workshop.(HOWEVER THIS GAME IS VERY CLOSE TO BEING UPDATED SO MOD CAREFULLY)The upsides to this game is just that. There are so many options out there to customize the gameplay to the way you see fit. Remember it's only 3 states you have to drive in so customize it based on that if you want to continue to play this game days and weeks and even months down the line just be prepared to wipe your mod list clean if you choose to mod before the update.

												I have to say that I am quite impressed with this game, having played almost every truck sim in the 18 WoS days as well as ETS2. I remember many years ago, stumbling acorss americantrucksimulator.com to find that the domain was being held for future use, I had high hopes for the game when it was finally released, and SCS didn't disappoint.Initially, my biggest concern was that the environment and feel was going to be too much like what Europe thinks of North America rather than what it's really like over here, and while it's difficult to explain, those elements do exist, but fortunately not to the degree I had initially thought. Screenshots of the game in the past year kind of made me worry about this, but the initial release isn't so bad.My favourite thing is that they've solved pretty much every issue I had in terms of driving physics - problems that were present in past games and even ETS2. With the transmission setting set to advanced, the game allows for clutchless shifting (with proper timing, naturally) with controllers like the G27, and the engine doesn't have the torque converter feel where applying throttle doesn't instantly raise the rpm by a couple hundred. If you're not sure what I mean, play ETS2 with a high horsepower truck like an FH with 750hp and while coasting, hit the gas and watch the tach.One of the things I wasn't fond of in ETS2 is the fact that many cities and roads are so hard to differentiate. I could never find my way around if not for the GPS. The Scandinavia DLC is an exception to this IMO, but it seems like every city and highway is mostly the same. ATS on the other hand, has very original and unique areas, as well as cities of varying sizes. I hope that this, plus the fact that they'll be releasing the map in bits at a time, will mean that we can sort of learn our way around through experience, and certain areas and roads will become more familiar overtime. I'm really glad to see SCS try to make each area of the map unique, original, and realistic.A number of people have complained about the current lack of trucks, many saying that they should have done like they did with ETS2 and release them unlicensed first. I think that there is a lot of legal mumbo jumbo involved. It's hard to criticize SCS for this when you don't know what their legal obligations are, and where they are currently at with truck manufacturers.There's still things I'd like to see improved, like the audio, but I can't even imagine how hard it is to make a realistic sounding truck without hearing audio loops and allowing it to fluently change as engine rpm increases and decreases, or even as more or less throttle is applied. With each truck so far, as engine rpm increases it seems to go through 'waves' for lack of a better word, where once you hit 12 or 1300 rpm, the tone resets down to sound lower again. Again, difficult to explain.Kudos to SCS Software. They're definitely on the right track. My favourite thing about them as a developer is that they listen to their community very actively and are quick to make changes if needed. This game was released at a lower than expected price point and I am very, very eager to see where ATS goes in the future.I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxing but enjoyable simulator, not only for the game but for the amazing developer that stands behind it.

												Looking at the timer, I see that I've currently been waiting some 9 minutes for a traffic jam to clear up, or rather nine minutes since I've started the timer after I got sick waiting and started writing this.When it behaves, this game is quite serene and relaxing, not to mention addictive. The mechanics of the trucks is quite impressive. If only they would fix all the annoyances. 12 minutes. I mean, as a DLC to Euro truck simulator this would be ok, but as a separate game with a few years extra dev time I would expect a better experience.The addition of police cars seemed like a good idea at first, but the zero tolerance for speeding combined with there sixth sense for detecting speeding makes for an unpleasant experience. I'd like to see the real world cop that would accurately detect a 5 mph speeding in the rear view mirror. 15 minutes.And who the hell is fining me for hitting a red light when there is no one around? Once I actually got fined for backing out of an intersection when the light turned red, and it turns red freakishly fast. And how difficult would it be to add some logic to the traffic lights so I don't have to stop at every single intersection in a town?Less intelligent then the traffic light are the AI-drivers. So I've waited for 17 minutes before pausing the game (or else I would get fined for delayed delivery). There is a great tendency for deadlocks, sometimes cars are literally standing in a circle waiting for each other. When trying to get out of deadlocks it's not uncommon for other cars to crash into you. They could avoid it, they just don't try to. Seeing a car decisively running into your side at a steady 10 mph is somewhat fascinating at first, but it quickly gets old, especially if you get fined for it. Sometimes you don't get fined for crashes caused by others, but you never get compensation for any damage.And for some reason (or lack of it), all time estimates in the game seems to assume an average speed of ~38 mph, no matter what. Why? And what sort of bank only allows 4 fixed loan amounts?And for some reason (or lack of it), all time estimates in the game seems to assume an average speed of ~38 mph, no matter what. Why?

												I’m editing my initial review.  After much thought I’ve decided to give the game a thumbs down, it saddens me to do so.  I play ETS2 all the time and absolutely love the game.  American Truck Simulator doesn’t even come close in comparison, it’s child’s play in comparison.  I live in Reno and I can say without any doubt that Reno is wrong in almost every way.  About the only thing you got right was some of the buildings, short of that, it’s completely wrong.  Most of Nevada is wrong if you want to know the truth.I-80 westbound out of Reno is like driving a road course.  Full of hairpins, twists and turns, did you guys even come to Reno?  I-80 eastbound out of Reno…don’t get me started!  Donner Pass is over 7,000 feet and in the game it’s nothing more than a slight incline and you’re done.  From Reno to Sacramento is over 2 hours, in the game it’s 2 minutes, what’s that about?  Reno to Vegas is over 8 hours, in the game it’s maybe 6 minutes, what’s that about?  It’s 4 hours from Reno to Elko, in the game it’s 4 minutes, what’s that about?  Have you guys seen the Sierra Nevada Mountains?  Have you guys seen Tahoe?  In the game the Sierra’s simply do not exists in any way, shape, form, or fashion.   What’s up with the AI traffic, it’s relentless, and you have traffic jams everywhere.  If you’re not at a light you’re screwed trying to get out.  What’s up with the ramps onto and off the freeways, why are they so short, have you drove in the US, we don’t have short ramps.  Many of the exits and ramps look like what you find on ETS 2.  I really wonder if your team even came to the states and looked around, really I do.I’m not going to stop playing either game but after all the hype about ATS, I found it to be such a letdown.  ETS2 is an awesome game so it gave me hope for ATS, it is clear something went very wrong.  I have faith it will get better.			"

												American Truck Simulator is a trucking simulator (bet you wouldn't have guessed) by SCS Software, who are best known for  Euro Truck Simulator 2. This game takes the ETS2 formula and puts it in Southwest America. Disclamer: I'm not a hardcore simulator fan, I just like driving in trucks.ProsDetailed Map - It's fun driving around and seeing advertisements, ""UDS"" (UPS) trucks going to make deliveries and more.Fair Pricing -  $20 for the amount of content is just right, and there will be some extra free stuff coming soon.Relaxing - Awesome to put on an album and make some deliveries.ConsFew States currently - I still think that the price is fair and it balances out properly.Three Trucks currently - ^No Cabin Acessories like in ETS2 - Wish that this was in, possible to come in the future.

												After playing a lot of European Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2), I was looking forward to American Truck Simulator (ATS), however (at the current stage) is not up to the same standard as ETS2.Things such as, the change in city design (making larger cities, with more stop lights), the reduction in size of a majority of the non-highway roads, and the dramatic change in the economy (increase in fine size and decrease in income) has resulted in the game being a LOT less ""fun"" than ETS2.My recommendation, is to buy ETS 2 (and the two DLC's) for the same price as ATS, as you will be getting better value for money and a more enjoyable game.Later, Matt			"

												$20 is a good deal if you've got spare money and are desperate to dive into ATS. However, if you're a big ETS2 fan and have it modded to the teeth this is going to be a gigantic downgrade.ATS brings better graphics and what felt like a more lively journey as I trucked around seeing new sites and experiencing cities that felt alive. Within an hour of playing I already felt that I wanted to return to ETS2 because the sheer amount of content I had in ETS2 makes it feel like there are some cities I may never visit and add the additional mods I have with it and it becomes the superior game -for now-.I imagine in the future once the community catches up and hopefully truckloads more content gets added this will be the superior version...but for right now we just have a base foundation that will need to be built upon.

												Update: SCS has come out with the map re-scale. However, it is in BETA, and as such there are some bugs and design inconsistencies. Therefore, I will not do a review on this nor change my rating until the map is fully supported. I believe that is only fair to the game designers. Positives: - Trucking in America- If you're looking for relatively fast deliveries, this is the game for you- Picking up and dropping off trailers is much harder than in ETS2. The trailers and trucks are larger, and the maneuvering space much tighter- Modding communityNegatives:- Much smaller map scale in comparison to ETS2- Limited number of models of trucks to purchase- Very limited stock choices for truck customization- No significant updates to graphics- Very slow release of significant updates to the game by SCS- Many of the routes become repetitive due to the small scale of the mapUpdated 11/2/1016 - SCS has finally added a new truck design, the Peterbuilt 389. Now this is the beast I've always thought about when it comes to American trucking. Huge, powerful, noisey - hey, it can't be beat! Thank you SCS for adding it. Now I'm just waiting on the long promised map rescale.------SCS's American Truck Simulator (now on referred to as ATS) is a fun little game for the first few hours. After that, it becomes rather monotonous. Billed as the sibling to European Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2), on the surface it seems to be the case. However, scratch said surface and you will find stark differences. The first thing one notices is how small the maps actually are. In ETS2, the distances feel real, and a 19 hour delivery really feels like one. However in ATS, the distances are extremely scaled down. The same 19 hour distance feels like a short jaunt. A side effect of this is that the main routes become common place and thus quickly end up being rather boring.The next issue is the lack of truck designs to purchase. Compared to it's older sibling, the choices the player has in trucks are very limited. (Update: as of 11/2/2016, SCS added the Peterbuilt 389 free to owners of ATS) To make matters worse, stock truck customization is extremely bare bones. I remember when I first played the game, I eagerly anticipated leveling up so that I could unlock more customizations. I was sadly disappointed to find out that there were hardly any at all. Now to be fair, SCS has added a few (namely tire customization), yet that was also applied to ETS2, so there really wasn't anything extra special for ATS. They have also added steering wheel customization (very basic), but again that was shard cross platform.Another issue is the graphic quality of the game. It seems that they used the same engine on ATS as that which was already present on the years old ETS2. So in essence, one could almost consider ATS as a stand alone ETS2 DLC. As an example of how outdated the graphics are, a friend of mine recently saw me playing and commented on the ""legacy graphics"" he witnessed. I also find SCS's speed of delivery on important updates equivalent to molasses running downhill on a cold day in winter. They promised a few months ago that they were working on a re-scale of the playable map to make it more like ETS2. This was due to the playing community's justifiable outcry. However, other than a few screen shots, they have produced nothing. Indeed, at the time of this review, the last status update (a few screenshots) they had given was on September 5th, almost a month and a half ago. They also claimed that due to successful sales of their products, they were able to hire a larger team of developers. However, one would not be faulted to wonder if they simply hired playful primates. Is it one developer and a monkey working on these updates? SCS is extremely quiet concerning this.The player community has also been constantly begging SCS for new truck models, and at first, SCS seemed to indicate that they were pursuing licenses for them. However, it has been an extremely long time since they have mentioned anything in regards to it, causing one to wonder if they have silently abandoned all effort in the matter. (Update: as of 11/2/2016, SCS added the Peterbuilt 389 free to owners of ATS)The one huge offering that ATS has is its modding support. What makes the game enjoyable for many players is the numerous mods that game enthusiasts have created (lighting, weather, mechanics, new truck models, map revamps, etc.). If it weren't for these, I honestly wonder if ATS would be as popular as it is today (other than fanboys who'll support the game no matter what). As someone who has played well over 200 hours in ATS, and who has at times really enjoyed it, I am forced to decide whether of not I would recommend this to a friend for purchase. When it comes down to it, I cannot recommend it at it's full price. Perhaps when it goes on sale for around $5, then I'd say to grab it up. However, as the product is today, the slow speed of development and updates by SCS, the sub par graphic quality, lack of truck choices, and a few other issues, I really don't think it's worth the full asking price.In the end, I give it 3.5/5 stars. It has it's fun moments, and has potential. You really do feel like you're driving a truck (as long as you have the correct mods installed), and at first the routes are fun to drive. Unfortunately, it turns repetitive awfully fast.(note: I have changed my review score from a 3/5 to a 3.5/5. The reason being is the release of the Peterbuilt 389 on 11/3/2016. Why not any higher? While I am thankful that there is one more truck model to drive, it still does not address the fact that the maps scale is quite small, nor the lack ot stock truck customization. It also does not address graphic quality nor speed of significant updates. I still cannot recommend this game at its non-sale price as no new truck model will salvage the game from the primary issues I have already documented. Map rescale will greately change my recommendation, and one can only hope that it happens soon.)* - If/when SCS updates the game, I will also update my review			"

												This is not one of those boring simulators, you have a feeling of being a real truck driver behind a real truck.Details on the models are great, driving physics are awesome.Time scaling is wonderful, it feels like you're spending less time on the highways and more time in the cities.Devs are great, they keep adding more stuff, fixing the bugs, polishing the game, tweaking the gameplay experience.10/10

												A lovely addition to the truck sim family to follow up Euro Truck Sim 2, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. It's great seeing the new game assets that are entirely different to those in ETS2 - new trucks obviously, but also a large range of new vehicles, new scenery props, new architecture, new road designs - and some fun things that enhance the ambience like helicopters, jets, shooting stars and flocking birds. There are some new mechanics too, including police cars that tag you with flashing lights and sirens when you get a fine for speeding/crossing red lights. The company extensively researches truck sounds and handling to give you a more genuine experience when driving the trucks, and they spend an inordinate amount of time getting the locations looking like their real-world counterparts (within the limits of the game), which is all very nice (and you can see side-by-side comparisons with Google Street View shots) - but the main reason I enjoy it is that it's just so damned relaxing. If you're looking for a serious, hard core driving sim with realistc crash physics, go play something else - this isn't that game. This is a casual game about driving a big truck around, taking in the scenery, listening to some music, and gradually building your trucking empire.			"

This is a new game in 2016? 2 trucks, essentially the same state and 2, you serious?  for 2 years of developing I expected more than just 2 states and 2 trucks, shame on you SCS.Unfortunately this game has a rushed feeling. Its like that half of cheese burger your room-mate left in the back of the fridge. you know you wanna eat it, but a fresh warm cheese burger is so much better.There are 50 States in USA, great truck history. In American Truck simulator we have just two states ( 4% of USA map ) and TWO trucks . Omg. when I started game first time I felt like I playing demo version. But dont worry , DLC map coming soon! just 10€ each. Game is not wroth money at the moment. You should wait for dlc maps and buy complete version later. 3/10			"

												After playing for 3.4 Hrs I find that Euro Truck Sim 2 kind of blows this game out of the water. The drive time is all messed up. Takes no time at all to go from point A - point B, The Traffic is even more stupid as I was 1/2 way through a yellow light, Going slow as I was pulling out from a stop a few car back at a red light and a car drove right in the side of my truck. The Rest stop's are dirt fields by the side of the road. Got to love 5000 cop cars on the road also. I drive the speed limit but come on at one point it seemed like more cop cars then normal traffic was on the road along with 1 parked off to the side as a speed trap.I am all for supporting a game but this is not even close to finished. Save your money people and buy ETS-2 its a way better game overall. The Trucks even feel like they are on ice in ATS vs ETS-2At first I gave this a thumbs up but after playing it for a bit I would say save the money and wait for a steam sale in a few months or buy ETS-2 as its much better overall. They failed bringing this out too soon, should have waited and got it right the first time. Not fix it as we go along.Man it killed me to say dont buy this game as I was so looking forward to it. I dont hate Trucks sims. Look at my ETS-2 hrs played as proof. Just dont touch this yet it need a bunch of work before its ready.			"

												I played ETS 2 for hours and hours... and now... I can cross through a small part of America, but America nonetheless. It has the same gameplay as ETS 2, with some tweaks here and there, but nothing completely different. Get in your truck and start doing jobs for cash ;) and go for your own company. Then do more jobs, pass through all the available cities and see the sights while delivering some explosives or something. So if you like to relax with some music and sit back while America passes you by outside the window, this is the game for you! Keep on truckin' !			"

												First off, I like the game concept and I like SCS Software so I bought the game cause I trusted them since I enjoyed ETS2.This feels like an early access game or an official modpack/dlc pack for ETS2. There's way too many inconsistencies in this game California Scenic Simulator to recommend others to purchase it. As others have said-- Game strongly resembles ETS2- Graphics to me feel worse than ETS2 but could just be me- Gameplay feels sluggish- It's like an Apple product that got a re-skin- Trucks feel slow, sluggish, inconsistent to actual American trucks, speed limits are weird, speed is mostly capped at 55 and sometimes drops from 55 to 30 and then back to 70 and then within .01 seconds it drops back to 55 and if you're speeding during those times (like less than 5mph over) prepare yourself for tickets- Stop signs at street lights- Sometimes traffic at intersections is neverending and the only way to proceed is to save the game and reload so you have a chance of finishing a load- Anti-aliasing? I'm pretty sure the developer has no idea what this does and why it's important- Same music as ETS2Simply put: It doesn't feel like an American Truck Simulator game. It's at best a California Scenic Simulator.At this time I'd give the game a solid 50% rating - I'm still going to play it but I wish it would have been better, and or gets better soon.			"

												Absolutely minimal innovation. This is a $20.00 Expansion Pack for Euro Truck Simulator 2 that parades itself as a different game. The developers didn't put any creativity into this game. Absolutely terrible purchase. Do not buy this unless you either want to support the developers or would really buy $20.00 expansion pack for Euro Truck 2.I was told that they would innovate on this soon and that it was released before they could do everything they wanted to with it. Hopefully they do. If so, I'll update this review.			"

												It pains me to write down that I don't reccommend purchasing American Truck Simulator.American Truck Simulator (ATS), created by SCS responsible for legendary titles like Truck&Trailer, Extreme Trucking, German and UK Truck Simulator, Euro Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2, should've been a slamdunk shoe-in in all and every aspect and it just isn't.The AI is a definate step back from the AI in ETS2 and it will slow down and/or brake violently where it isn't needed. Traffic-rules AI is over-zealous and will issue fines upwards of $700 ingame currency for the minorest of mistakes.The map is tiny and the two states provided (Cali and Nevada) are so condensed that a trip from LA to Oxnard is in length comparable to Rotterdam-Amsterdam in ETS2. Time flies so fast that your fuel-tank is always empty and your trucker is always yawning.The two brands of trucks the game starts with are legendary and speak to the imagination, Peterbild and Kenworth, the Adidas and Puma of the truckingworld. But they're weaksauce dinkytoys that can't even pull a load up a hill without losing steam and are hardly the monsters they ought to be.The highway-system portrayed in the game, which is a simulator, does in no way reflect the actual highway system in use in America today and is in that aspect worse than the  German Autobahn portrayal in ETS2.The handling of the trucks feel floaty or loose which gives the whole experience a very arcady feel.ATS is however a beautiful game, much of which a follower of SCS has come to expect. But beautiful graphics do not make a simulator. Realism (as much as possible anyway) and depth of simulation is. ATS is an arcade trucking game, much like Big Motha Truckers, but without the fun.I would suggest that you buy Euro Truck Simulator 2. It has more depth of simulation, more destinations, less absurd time-compression, more trucks, more jobs, more different trailers and a more diverse landscape.It's also cheaper, both in the meaning of the word and in what you get for your money.

												I was hyped about this game, I had to stay all night to wait for its release.Everything in this game is the same as Euro Truck Simulator 2 (the leveling, skill tree, and jobs).The difference is:-You'll get a speeding ticket if you're speeding more than the limit and there's a police car on the road.-The map is smaller I think because it feels small or because there's only 2 states on the release.-Parking a trailer gets a bit harder the first time you try or if you've gotten used to ETS2 due to the long tractor-trailer.Since I've gotten used to ETS2, I would be turning a bit further than usual due to the long bonnet American trucks have, so I find it quite annoying adjusting to the gameplay. It doesn't really feel like another game SCS has made, it feels like more of a dlc for ETS2.Why do I think it is like a dlc?Reasons:-There are only 2 states, 1 more for free is being developed by SCS.-Only 2 trucks (Kenworth and Peterbilt).-It was a bit expensive for my region (well it's not really SCS's problem, it's my country's economic problem. I'll be paying the same in Dollars or Euros).-It feels imcomplete (I do not really know how to explain this but....... I had feelings like this while playing).-It's not polished (there were some bugs, but it doesn't occur that much.If only Steam gives an option of ""meh"" or a middle type of option rather than positive or negative. If you're an SCS fan like me, go ahead buy it or not it's your money and your choice to do so. If you're not a fan of SCS, I'd say you better wait for the sale of this game or not I don't really care about your decision, all I can do is give you that option of buy it on sale or not.I bought it early because I can't control the hype I had.(sorry for bad grammar, I has bad english and a proud asian).

												The much anticipated sequel to Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator allows players to simulate trucking around the United States while building their trucking enterprise. Included in the game is California, Nevada, and Arizona with more DLC promised to come. As a devout fan to ETS2, I was elated to finally begin hauling freight around my home country. With stunning graphics and comprehensive road networks throughout CA, NV and AZ, the content currently in the game is amazing. However, the scale is greatly reduced from ETS2, and I found myself running out of new destinations to visit quite soon after my trucking company's grand opening. However, this is no reason to avoid this game; the developers at SCS have promised to continue creating DLC (some free) for ATS. All in all, American Truck Simulator is a must have for any simulator enthusiast.			"

												Very Decent Game, I opted for the beta (best way to go if you want more places to deliver to)coming from ETS and ETS2 this game felt right at home, however I feel this is more a cut and paste job from ets2, but I still highly enjoy it. By adding the classic american long stretches and highways made it feel awesome and the trucks are quite refreshing and fun to drive.Mods:I personally added a few mods into my game to give it more of a realistic feel such as: Real Life Companys, American Gas Stations, Longer Yellow Lights And Real Engine Sounds. These are awesome mods and made the game give more immersion. One thing I don't know if this was because of a mod clash or something I did but I now cannot hear my truck at all. I will edit this once I've fixed the issue (this doesnt alter my final score)All around this is a great game, I play this when I'm bored or relaxing wanting to play something but don't know what to play. I'm not quite sure its worth the $23.99 I paid for it (New Zealand Dollar) but It does pay itself off with the free updates and expansions added to the game on the regular. Maybe look on♥♥♥♥♥or something for a slightly lower price :)Final Rating 8/10Explanation: there is some fine-tuning and AI code need to be adjusted but overall a solid game.			"

												The game only has two states and two trucks. I know some trucks and states (like Arizona) will be added for free, but most states will be paid for. I'd be okay with this, if the game was not already too small. It takes four real life hours to drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Yes, I know the game is compressed because nobody wants to drive somewhere for four hours when they could do the same thing in real life, but it shouldn't take less than 20 minutes. If I can drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in 20 minutes, how long will it take to explore the entire game? The game claims it takes five in-game hours from LA to LV, but a five hour trip in Euro Truck Simulator 2 took an more than an hour in real-life. This game is obviously incomplete and released too early. The lack of content is to tempt you into buying more DLC once it comes out, which is just dispicable. The game is fun, but it's not worth $20 when for just a few more dollars, you can get more content with Euro Truck Simulator 2. I was hugely disappointed in American Truck Simulator.Also, not only is the game's UI and menu identical to ETS2, the geography is wrong. San Francisco, Oakland, and Oxnard are in the wrong place. If the game want to be taken seriously as a realistic simulator, it needs to have correct geography and not take 20 minutes to make a four hour journey.			"

Pros: Basically the same as other people have stated. Good graphics, nice sound etc.Cons: Only 2 (TWO) 3 trucks available (with modifications to them)... and 20 cities. (I think there was a free expansion coming soon, and some more trucks.) Speed limits are all over the place. It can change a dozen times over a 2 mile strech of road, and it just doesn't make sense. Speeding tickets are guaranteed. It can change from 80mph (Truck limit!) to 35mph and then up to 55mph in less than a mile.Not worth $20 atm, wait until more content has been added.			"

Sim looks and runs so much better plus the addition of the Peterbilt 389 to the game really sets it off. Still taking a long time for updates, more trucks, and more states, but I willling to wait ah longer to see where SCS is going with this sim, other than the wait I like what SCS got so far.

												After waiting a long time, SCS brings their truck simulator franchise back to the United States and I'm really enjoying the time spent in it.  While it may be only a couple of states covered, there is a lot of potential of having the entire country mapped out, even if that means multiple DLC map expansions.If you're a recent truck sim player, you may or may not be aware that the developers of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and ATS have developed the 18 Wheels of Steel series during the 2000s decade and it has been a while since the late time they focused on American trucking in 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul.  Since then, the map scale has increased a great deal, focusing on more American cities than ever before.  While some have noticed that the scale is a bit more compressed in comparison to ETS2, it doesn't seem to bother me as I understand that there is already a daunting task from the small development team as it is.  The same goes for the number of trucks because of their focus on wanting only licensed trucks in the game.  You can count on the modding community to address these shortcomings quickly and new official trucks get added in for all players at no charge, as was the case in ETS2.It is generally the same basic gameplay as ETS2 and there is nothing wrong with that.  A couple of new features have been added to set it apart: weigh stations and multiple parking spots.  The latter adds some of the more challenging parking trials to the player and tests your skills. Or you can skip those challenges if you want to keep things simple.In spite of the smallish map, there is some nice attention to detail from the silly billboards in Vegas to the amusing amount of burger and donut places,  A few faults with how some of the intersections are laid out, particularly with the less than ideal traffic light situation for cars wanting to turn left. Having a left turn only light would be helpful.  Police presence are rather plentiful and some have complained about frequent tickets, but it really helps to pay attention in advance to when the speed limits change. Just expect some inconsistency with speed limits.For the price, it's really worth it regardless of if you're an old veteran or a newbie wanting to know what trucking sims are all about.			"

												American Truck Simulator - This Game Comes With Amazing Graphics and Brilliant scenery While Driving To Your destination. This game also has more better and harder realisic trailer parking spots, It does also have easy parking or skiped parkingfor the drivers who are in a rush. My personal Opinion it is a really good game and I love the work that S.C.S hasput into it, I cant wait to see the game extented even further. I Recommend this game if you have played Euro Truck Simulator 2 or if you like trucking.			"

												Overall, i would give this game a 7/10. It's a fun game but it lacks, in my opinion, the real feel of trucking out in the rural areas of America. You don't get the feeling of being sat in a powerful, 8-wheeler listening to some of the latest and greatest Drake tunes on the radio. Obviously, the game is not near finished, i mean, there is about 10 trucks in total and abround 3 states. I suspect the game will add more states and trucks and like they did in the Arizona DLC.  "

												The game is more of what ETS 2 was, but now set in the US.  Unfortunately, it is only set in California and Nevada, which means you have a very limited map to work with.  I miss the ETS variety of cities and countries, and I don't think that the size of the US is an excuse.  More states should have been included, and having them as DLC later on is pretty lame.In addition, police fines are brutal, so if you go a bit over the speed limit then you may be losing half of the income from that haul.Ultimately, the game feels bland to me so far, but I will need to see more to decide more completely.  Hopefully I can get more into it, but I am not liking it the way I enjoyed ETS 2.  I would not spend the money again, at least until more content is added.			"

												Actually, I have been waiting for this game since the devs announced that they were going to create the game.However, I'm now a bit disappointed with what I see.Don't expect too many differences from ETS 2, this game contains only some new maps and cities, and also new trucks(only 2 different trucks), that's all. The only thing that I can praise is that roads are more realistic and better than ETS 2.Rest is the exact same of ETS 2, believe me.Moreover, it's a little bit unrealistic when it comes to driving. You'll see what I mean after getting in front of the wheel. You shouldn't be able to move those giant trucks without spending too much effort.Am I expecting too much? I don't think so.If this game was released before ETS 2, I would agree that the game is wonderful; but in this case, it's not, I'm sorry. "

												I like it but I don't, sounds weird I know.ETS2 (Euro Truck Simulator 2) is an amazing game I have spent lots of monney on it, over £400 probably, with a G27, G29 (Stearing wheels) and then lot's of the DLC'S. ATS is a let down, the graphics are stunning but I just think it was released too soon, there being not alot of trucks, the map is tiny and it is just no where near as fun as ETS2 I don' know why it just is not.I guess because this is sort of a bad review I will put it as not recommened but I just think the game does not suit me, maybe it will suit you, but please look up videos of the game before purchasing or try the demo, do not buy it then not like it.They have said they would be re-scaling the map and making it bigger (TheEngiGuy) said. So once this happens I will re-play the game and update this review.			"

												I have quite a bit of history with truck driving simulators since the days of SCS Software's 18 Wheels of Steel franchise. When I first heard of American Truck Simulator, I just about flipped my lid. I've been lookin forward to a revival of 18 Wheels of Steel for quite some time, and this game is more than likely what SCS wanted their original franchise to be. The game uses the same engine as Euro Truck Simulator 2, but there are minor gameplay differences from this and Euro Truck Simulator 2. Two of the most obvious things this game does differently from ETS2 is it's of course, set in the United States.Just a side note, I really hope SCS brings back some of the features from 18 Wheels of Steel like being able to drive through Canada and Mexico.Anyways, the gameplay is different from ETS2. Namely, you see police cars patrolling the highways and city streets, which, I should add as a warning for those who are NOT from the US that play this game: Police cars in the United States have radar built into the vehicles, so just like in real life, they CAN detect if you're speeding even when driving through the oncoming lane. While this is annoying, it does simulate police car radar, and they WILL fine you if you are speeding. Another thing that's different is all 50 US states have laws permitting drivers to make a right turn at a red light, while in Europe, this is either NOT permitted at all, or permitted only in certain areas. However, unlike this game, there are many real life locations in many US cities that have those hated signs that say ""NO TURN ON RED"" at intersection. Those do not exist in this game, so you will never have to worry about being fined for an illegal turn on red. However, for a right turn on red to be ""legal"" in the game, you have to have came to a complete stop at the itersection with your turn signal on, be in the rightmost lane on the road you're on, while yielding to traffic before executing the turn, just like in real life.Another thing that is different in this game than ETS2 is there are weight stations throughout the map. Just like in real world American trucking, the United States Department of Transportation mandates that all freight trucks must be weighed to make sure they are within both federal and state weight regulations, or be faced a fine. If you are overweight, you will be fined (Although I have yet, as of the writing of this review been fined for driving overweight. SCS might not have this as an actual mechanic in the game, but if it is, consider this a friendly heads-up). If you do not stop at the weigh station when it is open you will be fined. That being said, just like in real life, the weigh stations are open from a certain time, and close at a certain time. However, if the stations is not closed, you WILL weight that truck or be fined.Another side note: If you are driving a truck without a trailer, which is often called ""bobtailing"" in American truck slang (Not sure if it's also used in Europe), you are NOT required to use a weight station.Another thing that is taken from real life and put into this game is driver fatigue, just like in ETS2. Just like in ETS2, there is a setting where you can turn it off.The game's current state only has California, Nevada and Arizona as US states that you can go to, but SCS plan on adding the entire continental US, with my hopes being they will add Canada, Mexico, and some of the US's territories like Puerto Rico. That being said, I highly recommend buying this game, but at the same time, there is a very limited amount of map even with Arizona. I bought this game knowing how much map there is to start, but I honestly recommend buying this after some more US states are released. I really recommend buying this after a minimum of five US states (including California, Arizona and Nevada) are featured within the game.			"

												I would say that American Truck is almost the same as Euro Truck. What's different is the sceneries, trucks, trailers and of course the road. I personally like the game, but at the moment the game itself is getting boring due to its relatively small map and scale. But the dev are working on it so I guess it will be much more better soon. I would recommend buying this if you have already own Euro Truck. But if you are planning or deciding which to buy between american or euro, I would totally recomment Euro Truck first before American.			"

												American Truck Simulator;As you can tell from the name, it's a simulator. It's based off the Euro Truck Simulator series and made by the same company so if you enjoyed ETS you'll want to pick this game up as well. Let's just start this review off by saying, simulators are not for everyone. In American Truck Simulator you take the wheel of an 18 wheeler across California, Nevada and Arizona. (More states will be added at a later time) You start your own trucking company and make deliveries. As you progress the distance gets longer and the money you make increases. Honestly, this is one of the best simulator games around. It's a great way to just sit back, relax and pass the time peacefully. Nobody is yelling at eachother like in multiplayer games. The only thing you have to worry about is keeping your truck in its lane, not hitting other cars/trucks and stopping for red lights. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves driving games and who maybe looking to get into simulators.Pros:-Great Time Passer-Good Graphics-Very Realistic-You Drive All Across the United States-Learn How to Manage Your Own CompanyCons:-There is none, buy this game.Final Verdict:10/10			"

												All in all a very nicely done US followup to Euro Truck Simulator 2.  Probably could have been a little better researched, though, AFAICT, there's no 80 MPH limits outside Texas and some of the signage is a little funky, with freeway construction zones having noticably last-minute signage compared to the real world.  A few of the Interstate freeways have intersections (this is basically not something that exists in real life save for a few farm access points, and these have been mostly been changed to ramps even if they only serve one farm at this point).  But, it wouldn't surprise me if this gets worked out in a later update.			"

Think again with Promods 2.x, Piva weather & Fael Realistic Environment, I bet ATS looks like crap comparing to that. Plus: they are FREE though.At this stage of ATS I couldn't recommend it. Try it if you're still tempting, but grab ETS2 with Promods, Piva weather & Fael Env, and never look back at this ♥♥♥♥. You can as well get the American trucks mods to ETS. Seriously, what's the point of ATS? Seems like a TSM Africa map lol, what a joke. And btw, stupid fines and sudden speed tickets will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off lol.			"

It's mostly Euro Truck Simulator 2I have to say as someone who loves Euro Truck simulator I have to say I am going to be refuning this and going to buy it when all the states are released, as it stands, there is just too little in the game for my limited amount of money I can spend on a game, it feels allot like a skin for Ets2 which isn't bad, it's what I thought it would feel like, but launching with only 2 states ready that seems a little small to me, and then states are going to be DLC, it all comes down to how much the states are going to cost, but unless they change to a region system for states that is at least 48 peices of DLC for this game... that is allot and could be incredibly expencive to buy the complete game. So I would issue an air of cauction with this game and if you can be a bit patient, wait and see what happens. so basically   doesn't feel like enough game  could be very expencive to actually get all of it   doen't change much  "

ATS packs the same punch but instead of driving in Europe you are driving in America. I can't wait for the SCS team to add more states (if they have plans for that at all). But for now great job!

Just play it for 3-5 hours. You can also get mods like TruckerFM which makes it have a multiplayer. This is how people rack up  200 hours on this game lol. I am still playing and I just now finished exploring the cities. This game is still  expanding . The next state is New Mexico . Hopefully they go faster! I would give this game a 8 or 8.5 and this rating could change in the future. This is a indie company so don't make fun of them for going slow lol. KK have fun on this game. Once again dont kill me for my spelling. PEACE!			"

												So I have been playing Euro Truck for a long time now. Thought I would give this a try... Well its basically Euro Truck just set with different scenery and so forth. Which I am ok with for the record. My biggest issue is that its so super un realistic and inconsistant. For One there are cops EVERYwhere. And the same cop can peg you multiple times at $1000 a pop. First off no traffic ticket in the US is $1000 unless its a DUI and so forth. Two there are stationary cops on the side or the road... They dont peg you. And lastly even if you are driving behind a police cruiser they hit you with a ticket also. At $1000 for a load that nets $2100 this is rediculous. These issues are NOT present in the Euro Truck game, at least from what I have seen and have played a good amount of time on that. This just seems like a rushed game profit vs the fans. I will continue to play this game because I am a fan of the franchise, but I would NOT recommend anyone to buy this as their first purchase in the franchise. Save the money and Get Euro Truck.			"

												I've been hyped for this game ever since ATS was revealed. It shows great potential, and I'm looking forward for the rest of the game to come out.American Truck Simulator has two trucks. Two. It's got two states, 4% of all of the USA. When Euro Truck Simulator 2 came out, it had WAY more cities and trucks from the get-go, It felt like a finished game that didn't need any improvement. I paid $30 for ATS and I'm very underwhelmed with what I got.American Truck Simulator feels like a demo. It  upsets me when I go to the map and see that I can only drive through Nevada and California. I've heard that SCS will be adding the remainder of the cities and trucks into the game, but if they decide to charge money for those other states and vehicles, I'm done.The other fourty-eight states should have been released with the rest of the game to begin with. They have plenty of time to do it right and I would've patiently waited another 2-3 months for a full game to come out rather than a small portion of it.Don't get me wrong though, I like how the game handles, it runs smoothly and the scenery looks great. There's more action in the backgrounds, tumbleweeds cross the road, jet fighters fly past you at breakneck speeds and helicopters patrol the area.The game is fun......but not  that  fun. It's mediocre, I got a taste of ATS, and now I want the rest. I can't recomend it to anyone until the devs put the rest of America into ""American Truck Simulator"". "

												Having over 15 years as a company driver and owner operaitor before retiring I have to say this game brings back a lot of memories. Though I found a lot of things that are not close to being realistic, this game offers a variety of things I have seen that are. For one I found the graphics in this game better then what is in the real million dollar (plus) simulaitor I've had the privilage to use on more then one occasion and I like the way this game gives a very small taste of some of the realisticly hard places to get in and out of and a little of what real truckers may encounter during a trip. I'd also like to mention the fact that for what you get in this game I feel is very reasonably priced do to the fact that everything that is left out such as pre-trip inspection, log books, dealing wit dispatchers and brokers and even the creativity involved in finding a place to park in a truckstop after dark would all cost the developers more time and lead to a much higher initial cost to the gamming community. With all that being said, The biggest draw back to this game is that even though it can be played with a keyboard and mouse it is very difficult and somewhat tireing as both hands a kept busy all the time as you are constantly pressing keys to correct steering with one hand and with your other you are ajusting camera angles, operaitng turn indicators, and a ton of other tasks. Breaking is another difficult thing to master with a keyboard as if you leave your finger on the break button a millisecound to long, You will stop dead in the road or sidewalk, whichever you may be driving on at the time. One really needs a gaming steering wheel and pedel set up. This would defenitly improve a players gamming experiance and I think should be listed as a recommendation under the system requirments. I am currently using a mouse ,Keyboard and Logitech flight stick (to help with smoother steering but even that gets old fast and I am only commpleteing 3-4 trips a day before movig on to a more casual game. So in closing I just want to say if your thinking about purchesing this game, you may wish to consider the computer hardwear I mentiond first, that is if you can afford the expence, otherwise you may feel a tiny bit disapointed as I do.

The map isn't too terribly big but they are working on it and there aren't too many trucks but again they are working on it. If you like ETS2 but want less forest and more desert then this is the perfect game for you. The price is great as well.			"

												First impression is if you have played ETS2, then you'll absolutely be at home with ATS. The streamed US radio really does add to the atmosphere (ha, I heard what sounded like Johnny Cash singing Personal Jesus in the first 5 mins of playing).Pros:  It's a whole new environment for ETS2 fans.Cons: Whilst the scenery is nice, the graphics are looking very dated. Even knowing beforehand about the police being everywhere, I still managed to be $2k down on my first run trying to be as careful as possible. Ugh! I know it's early days but the map is pretty sparse - like driving in the UK only on ETS2. The miles seem smaller which makes the maps feel quite small. Some game breaking bugs like the retarder suddenly being stuck on for no earthly reason and unfixable or the ""turn right"" feature not working.I recommended this game at the start, but experience now says that the Devs need to fix quite a bit before you'll get your moneys worth even at the low price on release.

												Pros:-Great landscapes and detailed city's-Weigh stations implented-Aircraft (helicopters, jets)-Dead bushes-Detailed AI Traffic-Police Sirens when you get a fine-Improved Graphics-Realistic Roads-Compatibility with H-Shifter steering wheels (G27 i.g.)Cons:-Same Interface as ETS2-Only 2 trucks to choose from (I know that there are coming more, but they could've used fake brands like they did in ETS2)-Lack of truck customization options compared to ETS2-Lack of pedestrians at certain points (Some points do have a lot of pedestrians, but some not, which are perfectly made for pedestrians)-Fines are overpriced-I miss a CB Radio from what they did in 18WoSOverall, I really enjoy playing this game but like every game there are some points that can be improved, and if you look to the greater things of the game, you forget some of the cons.8/10			"

												Could be fun, but it is ruined by stupidity.It's like there is a policeman sitting behind you, hidden with a notepad, passing tickets the second you do anything wrong. Doesnt matter if you are in the middle of no where - didnt stop at a stop sign? ticket. Going 60 mph on a 55 zone, while in the middle of nowhere at night with no one to be seen? ticket. Going in the middle of no where in the desert and pass an imaginary red light? ticket. Going about your business and hit an imaginary car where no one is there? ticket.Every npc civilian is blasting through a green light and you go right along with them , the same rules dont apply, if you go through a green light with everyone else, you get a ticket. Basically, you end up every mission with less money then you started with. I did 5 or 6 missions and I have a dozen emails from the bank because I have negative funds.This game should be about learning to control the truck, or in my case that I was in auto mode, trying to make the best time I could while managing gas, rest and all that to deliver the cargo as fast as possible. Instead it's about tickets , imaginary invisible cars that you seem to hit although there's nothing there, along with red lights and stop signs.What a shame, it could be a wonderful relaxing experience instead it was just annoying me.

												Burgerland Truck Simulator.Needs content that SCS is working on.I have no idea why they released it when it wasnt done.The trucks are even slower than the ones in ETS2.They are also about 100 times bigger to hold your fat american rear and your mom at the same time.The police car scared me when it went off the first time i got a speeding ticket.THE BOTTOM LINEI dont recommend it as it is right now, but the game will hopefully be more complete in the future.

This is the game I've been waiting for my all life, a game that makes you feel like you're really driving on the US roads. There isn't anything else that gives you this kind of feeling. If you love this game like I do, of course you'll put it aside now and then to play other things, but you will always come back, start your truck engine, and drive along those amazing roads.

												OK, so I've played Eurotruck sim 2 for several hundred hours and have been looking forward to this game coming out, and for a number of reasons I highly recommend this game, however for fewer but far more important reason I dont recommend this. so here goes. Pro'sIt's good looking, It's good valueIt's slightly a different experience from Euro TrucksThe Badsome of the roads are to tight to drive around properlyThe scale of the map has basically ruined the game, for example you can get from LA to Las Vagas in around 5 minutes, I know they cant do it to true scale, but some resemelance of how big the USA actually is would of gone down well, I know they are releasing other states in time, but I cant see them rectifying such a massive issue with the game. And for tha reason I wouldnt recommend it. If you like truck sims, I can guess you have already purchased most of the DLC's from the previous game, and if its really American rigs you like, I would save your money and just use MOD's for Euro Trucks, theres a far greater choice of American rigs for free and the MODS are easy to install, plus many other maps etc to keep the game fresh.

												Right, so I have been playing American Truck Simulator. The idea itself is great, a change of pace from the European region to the U.S. However, we waited a long time only to find the sequel is pretty similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2 to the point I am beginning to think it is a re-skin with American made trucks and the map of the USA!My biggest concern for this game is that it sticks to the time consuming tedious skill point system as it takes HOURS upon HOURS to unlock stuff like longer distance driving, a larger variety of cargo and this is naming but a few. The gameplay and  seem exactly the same as ETS2.I am going to refund this game. Euro Truck received thumbs up from me because it was the first time I had played something like that and I loved it regardless of the long time grinding to make progress. But if the dev is adapting to ""If it ain't broken why fix it"" motto then count me out.			"

												This is a great game Id say. Definetely worth buying.  You get to drive trucks for jobs, make $$$, handle your own truck business and hire drivers that make more $$ for you. Its pretty neat. Very realistic game.  Gotta follow the traffic laws including speeding, lights, and going to weigh stations and toll booths, or you will be fined. However, there is an option where you can unclick traffic offenses and do whatever the heck you want without the police doing anything.  Free roam the roads of California( truck speed limits suck..), Nevada and Arizona. There are mods you can add inside the game such as making traffic lights longer, adding more reallistic traffic than what they normally have and some other cool stuff. I love the game so far as been playing it over 80 hours now.  Overall, great game!			"

I play it because I am devoted to the game and the time I spent on the game.  However, I would love to see more states come out and we can start expanding our empire. Having everyone cramped in 2 states is making people bored of the game.  PLEASE Bring us some more content and states! I do honestly love this game and want to see more of it without modding it.			"

												In it's current state, I simply can't recommend American Truck Simulator. The distinct lack of content (two trucks?) and the core similarity to ETS2 makes it seem like an officially made mod that costs money. The new environments are very nice, but that's almost the only notable change. Even features that were added in ETS2 (or in for the start) are not in American Truck Simulator.If you want a Truck Simulator game, get ETS2 and the DLC on sale. I'm sure that there will be more added in the future, but until then, I'll be refunding my copy.			"

												No where near ready for release.The size of the map is plain lazy. I don't wan't to hear excuses from the developers because even Euro Truck Simulator 1  shipped with a larger world map. ATS has a very limited world map, and the distance inbetween locations is way too short.For the price, it's not too bad, but honestly it just doesn't have the same feeling that ETS, and for the meantime I think I'll be sticking to that.TrackIR didn't seem to work either, which seems a little strange as it should be the same engine.

												I wanted to get into the game, I really did (I loved ETS2 and have ploughed a lot of hours into it), but at the end of the day, the lack of content (two trucks and two states) really made me too disappointed to go on.The map is far too city-focused for my tastes, I'd like to just cruise along the beautiful freeways rather than mess around in a thousand intersections in downtown LA. Sound and graphics design haven't really changed in any noticable way from ETS2, but they're at least decent. I find the UI to be OK enough, same thing there - very similar to ETS2.The content now is about as small (if not smaller) than a DLC for ETS2, which, again, really let me down - will sadly use the Steam refund system for this one (first time I try it out), and may give this one a go in the future, if they add *a lot* of content to it.

												To be clear this isn't a bad game however when compared with Euro Truck sim 2 it’s hard to recommend this game over it. If you’re an American this may be different but the appeal to me is to drive around with my truck following the laws of the road and enjoying myself. I know that many people won’t enjoy this style of game, but then again I don’t enjoy Fifa (other football and sport games are available). The game looks much better than European truck simulator the cities and even down to small details such as cracks in the road. At the end of a job the parking process is much better as you get to choose how you want to park selecting from what is effectively; hard, medium and don’t park. The increase in fuel stations is good as in euro truck you could only buy fuel in a city if you had a garage upgraded. The coast roads look absolutely incredible (but with faster trucks in euro truck would be more fun there). I know more trucks and roads are coming but I find myself thinking why don’t I just play euro truck instead? The current engines available are low on power and the GPS likes taking you down extremely small roads. Also The game makes the ‘highways’ have more bends in them than the motorways in Britain and Europe. The police surprise attack you every moment you are speeding and they are very sneaky arriving just after a 30 sign that I happen to miss seeing. When you finally crawl up to speed on a ‘highway’ you are forced to slow down as the road just arrives in a city or town that you have no idea about until you either get fined for speeding or crash into cars waiting for traffic lights!!! In conclusion although American truck Simulator is a good simulator I still feel like Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a better game. On euro truck I have put in 110+ hours (had none steam version for a while) and I have experienced that game to about the full whereas American truck simulator I only have about 3 hours of which I know isn’t a lot but still it is difficult for me to recommend. So in it's current state I cannot recommend this game, with more trucks and roads in future this may alter my view.*Disclaimer*I know more trucks and roads are coming and I know that you can get mods for removing the police and increasing engine sizes but I wanted to play this game properly but despite this I wasn’t levelling up very quickly and I wanted to see what truck options were available so I had to use an XP cheat mod so I could see the options.Edit:The traffic light situation was improved but the game still isn't as good as ETS2			"

												This game is great I dont have many bad things to say about the game. My review is more toward the SCS development team. They are releasing some unneeded feature and DLC but only have released 3 states of the 50 United states they keep telling us we are going to have. In my opinion we dont need anymore DLC painjobs or tuning packs until we can get a reasonable amout of states released. I understamd the SCS team may be small but that is all the more reason to work more on area then uneeded objects. As seeing this game was released over a year ago, I expect more states to be added into the game given out. If you were to ask me I would hault any additions to the game that are not major bug fixes or map additions. Until I see any improvement with states being released and without being overpriced DLC then I wouldnt recomend anyone buy this game.			"

												A fantastic trucking simulator...A very detailed casual experience, the devs always seem to be adding more content, fixing bugs, adding more states for you to work in and not to mention the latest rescale they just did making the game world bigger.  Being able to build your trucking company from the ground up is fun, I never would have thought a truck driving simulator would be so fun?  Loads of customization options for your trucks..""you get the pun?""..lol   Anyways as I stated before there are a lot of customization options for upgrading and detailing out your truck from changing out the lug nuts to swapping out the entire engine.  You can manage your company and hire drivers and buy or lease trucks to get your company started.  You can also customize your employees trucks as well, although I don't think you will ever see them out and about working but they are self contained once you assign them to a truck and garage and decide what type of loads you want them to specialize in.  They will start taking jobs and working depending on how you set them up.  This game is only going to get better with later updates expanding states and more types of loads, I am patiently waiting for Oregon to pop up but it looks like they are focusing on the southwest first versus the northwest.  I want to haul loads through my home state and see what they did with it and see what towns they plan to implement.  Another feature is you can program internet radio stations to listen to while driving which is a nice touch.  A very solid game, not demanding on your hardware and a very casual fun experience. The only cons I have found and these are personal but I would like the option to upload custom pics for yourself or your company, and maybe have the option of creating your own company logo and the ability to add them to your trucks.  Also the idea of being able to see your other hired drivers that work for you from time to time travelling down the road passing by etc.  It's a fun game searching the market for the best paying load and also playing the logistics game making sure you are not dead heading without a load anywhere so you don't lose money.  If you love sims this by far is the best trucking simulator around.			"

												Been playing 18 wheels of steel since hard truck was released. So I am a huge fan of these, and I hope SCS continues to deliver more after ATS, maybe they might include Canada regardless since I am Canadian myself as alot of others might be as well.			"

												The game is pretty self-explainatory, so I'll keep it brief.Pros: Large number of options plus customisable controls - drive with keyboard, keyboard+mouse, steering wheel plus various nuances. You can set up the gameplay the way you see fit Devs keep updating and patching the game, the community is active and the amount of mods is insane Map scaling of games made by these devs is seamless, you shouldnt have any problems with it Good for listening to audiobooks or podcastsCons: This is a game for people with certain mindset. Reconsider before buying. Distant objects and some locations look a little too fake number of trucks in unmodded game  SummaryReplayability, community, frequent patches, modability - the game is worth the price. "

												I just recieved this game from a friend and here are the pros and cons from what ive seen in my play timepros-works with racing wheel and pedals-ability to choose how to park your trailer-measurements are translated-very pretty-runs at a good framerate-sounds like a truckcons-map needs development (I want my route 66 to Joplin!)-AI need a bit of work when merging into the freeways-not many truck companies to choose from-Overall pretty good but it should be labled as still in development because I only get to see 3 states inThe United States of America 7/10			"

												A fantastic trucking simulator...A very detailed casual experience, the devs always seem to be adding more content, fixing bugs, adding more states for you to work in and not to mention the latest rescale they just did making the game world bigger.  Being able to build your trucking company from the ground up is fun, I never would have thought a truck driving simulator would be so fun?  Loads of customization options for your trucks..""you get the pun?""..lol   Anyways as I stated before there are a lot of customization options for upgrading and detailing out your truck from changing out the lug nuts to swapping out the entire engine.  You can manage your company and hire drivers and buy or lease trucks to get your company started.  You can also customize your employees trucks as well, although I don't think you will ever see them out and about working but they are self contained once you assign them to a truck and garage and decide what type of loads you want them to specialize in.  They will start taking jobs and working depending on how you set them up.  This game is only going to get better with later updates expanding states and more types of loads, I am patiently waiting for Oregon to pop up but it looks like they are focusing on the southwest first versus the northwest.  I want to haul loads through my home state and see what they did with it and see what towns they plan to implement.  Another feature is you can program internet radio stations to listen to while driving which is a nice touch.  A very solid game, not demanding on your hardware and a very casual fun experience. The only cons I have found and these are personal but I would like the option to upload custom pics for yourself or your company, and maybe have the option of creating your own company logo and the ability to add them to your trucks.  Also the idea of being able to see your other hired drivers that work for you from time to time travelling down the road passing by etc.  It's a fun game searching the market for the best paying load and also playing the logistics game making sure you are not dead heading without a load anywhere so you don't lose money.  If you love sims this by far is the best trucking simulator around.			"

												The change of scenery is welcome, as are the bigger cities. If you haven't played your fill of Euro Truck Simulator 2, however, you're better off trying that one first.It's because the amount of content currently on offer in ATS might not be enough for you. Even with the newly released Arizona, the game only offers three trucks and map the size of an expansion for ETS2. If you're expecting a product comparable in scope with ETS2 with its DLC, you'll have to wait a couple of years. Actually, more like five.			"

												 Good Game fun to play great with mods for the off line and some even work for the on line game add on (it is a free add on too).    System does not tax low end system by using too much resources like other driving games do.  This game barely even makes most systems sweat even on the highest settings.

Its been quite some time since this game map has been updated, but the game community is up for rescue with lots of Mods published alomost every day. Worth playing if You prefer American trucks over European ones..			"

The quality and detail of the cities are extraordinary. Definitely recommended to you, the value and cost of the game Is reasonable and the content you’re given is reasonable and will be expanded and more will come. The rescale of the game making it similar to ETS2 has made the game even better.			"

												This game has a few good points and bad points, and although I was using a MacBook Air (base model I believe) the game ran quite decently, getting abt 30 fps with decent graphics.Pro's-Realistic gameplay (like ETS2)-More livid and bustling map compared to ETS 2-Some crazy powerful trucks-Rain looks great-With a gaming PC you could get stunning graphics and 60fps 100% CONFIRMEDCon's-Only 3 trucks (Im sure there will be more in the future)-Rather small bit of America to roam on (but there will probably be many expansions)-Not fun using keyboard steering-You need a decent computer to run this at around 30fps-Too many police cruisers!!!Overall this game was a more refined version of ETS 2 and has a high chance of beeing rather enjoyable after the expansions and new trucks. If you have weak PC, you will probably not enjoy it very much, a PC with core i7 and 6GB of ram should cope just fine.			"

												Coming from a family of truckers (3rd gen), this game rocks! A perfect simulator, just wish they would include breakdowns. I feel like if they included a faulty equipment function, the game would be more realistic. Plus everyone would be finding a Detroit 60, 70, 80 series mod to run. The new EPA engines are terrible, which is all this game has to offer. The DEF filters are always clogged and need to be replaced, for a price $$$. I cannot wait for day that this game is complete with all trucks and states. Drive safe!			"

												This game is amazing. I love all the Truck simulators by SCS Software. American Truck Simulator is already shaping up to be the best one yet. The stunning visuals of this game are breath taking, especially if you use SweetFX which brings the game to life.The scope of the world is huge and really feels like your on the road.\I have one suggestion and something that I have wanted to see in this series for a while now, is to have the service lines and glad hands connect to the trailer from the truck to give it that extra beauty (is there somewhere that I can suggest this feature?) With the recent (advance coupling) that came with Arizona I know its possible.I love the advance coupling system, as well as the scales it really gives it that uniqe American feel.			"

												American Truck Simulator is one of the best and only trucking simulators that actually seperates the men from the boys. If you love long drives and love spending time enjoying the wonderful views, this game is exactly what you need. I myself have spent over 890+ hours enjoying myself on singleplayer and with friends on multiplayer. (Multiplayer is a seperate mod for American Truck Simulator)I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is really into trucking simulators and loves some kenworth and peterbilt trucks.This is truly one of the best trucking simulators out on the market right now. :)My game hours show how much fun I've had in this game and while playing with friends on mp.. this game has a lot of room for potential in today's gaming industry.Thanks for reading.- Chev.

The #1 feature about the AI that is purely genius, is that they can reverse away from your truck. I don't mind the low amount of trucks because SCS constantly release new DLC that includes new maps and trucks. Overall 10/10. If you don't have this game, BUY IT!			"

												This is the best trucking simulator to date. If you are looking for a way to just relax and take it easy, this is the game for you. The game can be hard, but only if you want it to be hard. You have almost complete control over the game which means you can make it easy if you are looking to just take it easy, or you can make it hard if youd like a bit of a challenge. With the easy to install mods as well as an already very nice game, you really can make this game whatever you would like it to be. If you are at all interested in this game, I highly suggest you go ahead and buy it. It is more than worth the price you pay with already free DLC that has either been released, or is in the works. In conclusion, I definitely recommend this game if you think that this is something you would enjoy. It is well worth the price and can be edited to your liking. I hope this helps if you are on the fence on buying it, and I hope you have a wonderful time trucking!			"

												Only played this game for seven hours so far, but so far I'm not dissapointed. I did worry about the amount of content in the game compared to ETS2 at first. I have thousands of hours in ETS2 so ATS felt right at home. All the menus are the same, but slightly redesigned. The map might seem small, but it's still 1300km to cross the map which takes a good half hour.There are only three trucks at the moment and customisation is limited, but I'm sure that more will be added and the Volvo has already been confirmed by SCS.

And although it is based on ETS2 (which is very obvious from time to time e.g. the UI) it feels like a succesor, like progress and it feels like America should. The scale was changed, so that we have  more compressed map and time which does not break the feeling unless you played ETS2 right before playing ATS.It features California and Nevada and someday we'll have the whole US in the game. The 3 featured trucks were made with the standards of ETS2 trucks. You'll feel how different they are (from each other and from the ETS2 trucks).The map quality is at least as good as ETS2's Scandinavia map expansion and features a lot of little details making it feel more alive.  After playing over a 100 hours I can recommend this to people that are interested in driving trucks through America the beautiful...			"

												SCS Software has done it again.After the surprise massive hit that was Euro Truck Simulator 2, the developers decided to try their hand at expanding the trucking simulation game over to the good ol' US of A. I bought Euro Truck Simulator 2 on sale for $4.99 quite some time ago and have spent over 100 hours in it, as many have--it is one of those games I feel immensely guilty for buying on sale because of the quality of content and the massive enjoyment I get out of it. It is one of my top played games on Steam, and I currently own over 1,000 of them. It is also the only game I've ever bought DLC for (that wasn't part of the original package). In saying that, I own thousands of digital games (not just through Steam or even PC) and American Truck Simulator is the first digital game I've ever bought at full price (or at launch, for that matter).American Truck Simulator is one of the few games that lives up to the ""simulator"" title. It is a top notch simulation game where you must work your way up from an employee that drives trucks for other companies to a trucking business owner with dozens or more of drivers that report directly to you and make you income. It is a game that will scratch your simulation/business management/love of driving/relaxation itch all at once. This is not a stressful game. Quite the opposite, in fact. This is one of those games that you can zone out while playing and relax your mind after a stressful day. Everything about it has been meant to be relaxing, and it succeeds tremendously (even missing a loan payment earns you a politely worded letter from the bank telling you they'll extend the extra credit toward you free for a few days until you can pay them back).The game works with various controllers, from a 360 gamepad (which I use) to wheels and such if you're interested. It also looks beautiful on higher end PCs, though I prefer running it on my old non-gaming laptop for a small sacrifice in graphics quality, and it runs just fine. It launched at a $19.99 full price, which shocked me. I would have gladly paid $59.99 for this. I go by the $1.00 per hour of gameplay rule, and as you can see, I've already gotten more than my money's worth within the first week of launch. The game at launch includes two trucks (more to be added for free later on as they sort out licensing for those truck brands who doubted the game's viability) and two states, California and Nevada. In over 20 hours of gameplay, I have not discovered all cities yet and have covered about 50% of the map.There are some concerns over the amount of content the game was launched with, or the idea that American Truck Simulator should have been launched as DLC for ETS2. I disagree with this idea. ETS2 was released in 2012 and is still being actively updated with DLC and free updates (including new trucks, paint jobs, etc.). I personally like having the two separate, and the fact that ATS was released for so cheap makes it almost comparable to the price of DLC to begin with. I have followed the game's development since it was announced a long while ago--I know the work SCS Software has put in to put loving detail into this game. I've read the updates where they've written how they've travelled out to record the audio of engines and carefully map the dimensions of the interiors and exteriors of various trucks, for one example. This is one developer that has built up trust with me, and this comes in a time of corruption from AAA publishers and the media that covers them alike.Finally, what are some of my complaints? I only have two, and one isn't really a complaint. For one thing, while the environments are already vast and varied compared to ETS2 (you now have deserts, farmland, oceanside, big cities like Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and even what I assume is a redwood forest), I do wish there was a way to have a taste of everything America has to offer in this. We have so many various landscapes here (mountains, forests, deserts, grasslands, swamps, beaches) that it's a little sad that we'll have to wait as the game is expanded over the years to reach them. My last complaint (and only real one) is that the speeding system in this is overbearing compared to ETS2. I see more cop cars in an hour of playing this game than I usually see in weeks of real life driving, and they can insta-ticket you for going 31 in a 30 speed zone, for example. It happens so frequently (particularly starting out when you're getting used to the roads and the system) that the resulting fees can cripple a newfound business owner. The only fix for this that I've found is driving at night versus the day-time, when traffic overall is lower and thus fewer cop cars are roaming about.Overall, I highly recommend that everyone try this game out (they released a demo today). It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but for people who like simulation games, driving games, or even just let-loose-and-relax games, American Truck Simulator can't really be beat. This was my most looked forward to game of 2016, and I'm not disappointed. I look forward to playing the game as it grows and expands for years to come.Edit 4/29/2016: I've noticed that an abnormal percentage of people have marked this review as unhelpful. As I always try my best to cover all aspects of a game in a review to be helpful to potential consumers, I would appreciate any comments on my review letting me know the information I've left out, or any questions you have about the game which my review left unanswered. I will update the review as applicable. Thank you!			"

												For this game to be truly good and up to its full potential, these devs would actually have to come over to the United States and drive on the mentioned roads to get a feel for what things are actually like, something they clearly did not do.  They would have to then go home with the notes they took and redisgn literally the entire map. Either SCS was too busy with the physics simulation to bother with the map, or (more likely) they just didn't take the time to do their research. Interstates do not have traffic lights on the intertate itself So why do you have several instances on this map where interstates are something other than interstates? And the speeds? This is not Europe. Please put warning signs in this game. There are too many areas where you slow down the speed without any warning, and when I regularly have to venture through these intersections, it's not something I can do to relax once I'm used to it, it will always be a chore. Also please make it to where your AI actually cooperates with said speeds? Trying to deal with a busy freeway going 80 in a 55 zone isn't enjoyable nor realistic.If you can deal with the bad map design (which will take a good bit of time to wrap your mind around), this game has a decent amount of simulation, but poor placement on all fronts (there are almost no rest spots decently placed, things you will absolutely need when doing long hauls, and the ones that exist are extremely poor in placement). The time restriction is ridiculous.If you've played a another truck simulator before, give this one about six months and they'll likely have most of this sorted out. We also don't quite know what their plan is for DLC and for a $20 game this is rather threadbare. It's still quite a hot mess right now, don't buy.			"

												Well Its been a long time since I have writen a review for any but I decided to do it for this game. Lets start with the cons1) Freight train are to short2) No directx11/12 support yet3) To scaled down you can drive 1000 miles in one hour.4) Not enouth varation in the at traffic5) AI traffic are still dumasses 6) The fines in the early game are to muchNow the pro's of there are alot of them.1) Very good map detail2) Very realxing to play just like ETS23) Easy to setup4) UI i very easy to understand5) The sounds on the standard trucks are awesome6) Good challenging parking spots7) Mod support many mods avalibe already8) The police sound are very cool9) Weightstations 10) Good intersrting trailers in the early game.11) You can turn right on a red lightSo as you can see the pro's way out do the cons. I would recomeded this game as I think it will get better with time. "

												Ok so after playing for a couple of hours i will give you my honest oppinion about this game.Pro: Pretty nice graphics(i think it looks better than ets2)                   the map is very detailed and the cities are bigger than in ets 2                   now you have police cars on the road that can fine you if you do something wrong                   a lot of nice AI cars                    a lot of mods on the internet that can make this game 2 times better                    tumbleweeds on the desert roads Cons: only 2 trucks at the launch (More will come but you have to wait a little)           only 2 states: Nevada and California( Arizona is on its way and more states will come but for now you have to deal with those 2 states)            it need some optimization in cities cause it eats some fps( but on highways and desert roads runs more better than ets2)            the police fines are quite big especially at the beginning of the game so be careful!Personally i will recommand this game because its a new experience and when you will have more states and trucks this will be way better than ets2.The price i think its quite reasonable considering that a lot of features,trucks and some map expansions will be free.

												Well, this is the new installment of SCS Software trucking simulators. I have been following this developer since I started PC gaming in 2007-2008. The 18 wheels of steel franchise will nostalgically always be with me.Is this game worth the buy?Yes, well it sort of depends on you.Pros if you haven't played ETS 2:-A more lively,creative,well done map.-Has a ton of content.-Is a great simulator-The community and developers are great-The map is large for only comprising of 2 states (the only ones out as I did this review)-Does not get boring until hours into the game.-Has a in-game streamable radio-Is compatiable with every steering wheel,controller,and you can play using mouse,keyboard,and onion (not really.)Pros if you have played ETS 2:-No cities are the sameAs you can see, this is a lot like ETS 2, but it has a lot of new content.Cons:-Is a lot like ETS 2.-Has a smaller map at the moment-Radio still hates Fall Out Boy (it skips them and some other artists songs for some reason)-Only has 2 trucksMy score out of 100:If you take in account ETS 2: 78/100If you dont care about ETS 2 and is judging this game only: 90-91/100Great game would run red lights again.

												I just got this game yesterday and already have just below 15 hours of gameplay logged, so you could say I'm enjoying it.I'm not going to say too much about the game in it's current state, it's pretty good so far. Lots of customizations for your trucks, large maps and nice details and landmarks. Here are some things I would add or change about this game:* The cops seem way too Barney Fife about giving you tickets. They give you speeding tickets for going just a few mph's over the limit. They show no tolerance for the ""9 over rule."" They also gave me a ""red light violation"" for stopping at a red light. Wat? Maybe I was too far out in the intersection? I really don't think so. It would also be cool if instead of magically handing you your ticket while your driving if they actually pulled you over and you had to stop; costing you time and delaying your shipment as well as a fine.* The game needs destructable vehicles. The game looks pretty good, but when you crash your 18 wheeler into a wall at high speed, it should show the results.* More driver focused interactions and let the driver get out of the truck and free roam. This is a simulator, so what about all the unthought of things that a truck driver has to deal with? Like eating and going to the bathroom? Where are the waffle houses? It would be so cool to be able to jump out of the truck and stretch your legs, walk into a gas station and buy some coffee or energy drinks to keep awake for the final stretch of highway. And things like flat tires, you would have to get out and change your tire.* I want to see more states! I want to drive from coast to coast! If not, at least Colorado, I love driving through mountains!* User-made routes players can share in the workshop. * Small truck deliveries, like ""PostEd.""* Bus driving. It's more or less a truck.... You can transport people from city to city. Just something extra to do to earn some cash and keep the game a little fresh.* Wildlife and livestock. Deer and such running across the road you need to avoid hitting.* The trains need to be longer than just a locomotive.That's it for now. I'll edit as things change.			"

After it was released there were a few things I liked/ loved about it, and things I don't like about it. But to keep this Simple in this I will still include what has been released so far. I like that it started on the west coast since i live on that side, Sacramento. I like at the very beginning i was able to set my primary garage there. But that you don't care you all want details right! So here we go!Nicely detailed trucks, but after 4 months still only 3, still missing that promised oneSo far only Peterbuilt and Kenworth, would like to see Western Star, Freightliner, Mack...and volvo if you must...ah swift...Customizable trucks, but limited, cant even put all the real engines in the truckslook in the controls, there is a beacon light, but you need a community content to have it, and its only for the W900Alot of cities to drive to, but way to close, BUT THEY DID SAY THEY ARE WORKING ON IT! 1/35 scale to 1/20Added not to the one above, hopefully they use that space to maybe add a city or 5Nicely colored overall, but a bit over saturated, HDR on or off, did i see a diffence?Different trailers to use, small up to 53 footers, would like Heavy/oversize DLC and possible able to haul doublesFix the train tracks, if your going 55-60 and the lights come on, if you dont use everything possible, YOU WILL CRASH!!!I think that was everything, overall AWESOME GAME! fun playing multi-player, TruckersmpI like the world of trucks external contracts. more helpfully then regular sometimes. 11/10 will play this for a LONG TIME!! get it!!!

Although I just started it, I can tell a lot of things have been repackaged from ETS2, although there are also many differences.When I started up, I immediately noticed the exact same intro screen as ETS2 except for the name.The main menu looks identical to ETS2, even the character portraits are the same.The tutorial is literally the exact same, word for word, as in ETS2, signifying that there havent been any major improvements in the gameplay itself. However, there is a lot to look forward to:The cities are a lot more realistic and bigger than in ETS2 and have many famous landmarks. I opted to start in San Francisco, and it the area looked a lot like SF. (More than it would in ETS2).There is a lot more to explore, as there is 50 states with diversified terrain and a lot of free DLC coming out that grants access to these states.There will probably be less of endless highway driving and more of exploring the cities. (As I mentioned, SF seemed a lot bigger than the cities in ETS2). Overall, I have been looking forward to this game for years and it has finally come. Despite some of the similarities to Euro Truck Simulator 2, there will be many positive differences and changes that outweigh the cons. If I am wrong on any of this, please tell me. This is my first review.			"

												I have no idea how realistic this is compared to a real truck and I do not care. This is fun. A LOT of fun. With so many reviews before this one, there might not be anything to say that has not been said. They did a great job condensing the areas of the cities that I am familiar with. I'll bet the rest of them are just as good. If for some reason this is the only review you have read of this and are still wondering if you should buy it...stop wondering and add it to the cart. You will not be dissapointed. I recommend this to anyone who already enjoys driving simulators and games. I also recommend this to anyone who is wondering what it is like to drive across america. It will take a while but eventually they will have all the states that are able to be reached via truck. Be careful, the scenery might distract you with it's detail.			"

												ATS AI is one of the wrost I have ever seen. First of all Cops dont pull up over for driving 5 miles of the speed limit. Second a Truck's horn means get out the way . And a speeding ticket for driving 5 miles over isn't $400 . And the Map trucks can't make small turns they make WIDE turns. so if a car pulls out and hits you . its their fault in this game its your fault and you pay $600 very unrealistic. Well hopefully more states will be unlocked soon because California and Nevada are getting boring, driving from San Diego to Los Angelas.			"

												First of all, this game is so beautiful. The first thing I noticed, once I configured my settings correctly, is how smooth everything looks. Driving during a sunset in California is absolutely gorgeous.This game has much more than one might think. 90% is driving trucks and parking trucks, but you're also trying to develop your own truck-delivery company. That's a good chunk of the fun for me; saving up money to buy a truck and hire drivers and make a name for myself. But the other part is letting the whirr of the engines and the pitter-patter of the rian consume me for hours.I do have one major problem, and given that I make music and listen to it nearly every hour, it's a big deal to me. Whenever I try to load my own music (the proper way, mind you) and play it in the game, the game crashes. On top of that, the radio stations seemed to work the first time I tried them, but they haven't been playing anything since. Everything else in the game makes noise except for the radio.I love this game, but I really hope whatever bug is causing the game to crash when I try to play my own music is fixed soon. Keep up the good work, fellas!			"

												Great game I love it! Just like the real world! The only bad thing about ATS is that some drop off areas are a bit too small to drop a trailer in and sometimes depending where the drop off point is it can be really tight. SCS needs to work on expanding some of the drop off areas. Also please add more trucks into the game!			"

												Good game for every truck fan, worth the money.It is successor to Euro Truck Simulator 2 with better ambient graphic, american trucks, cities, traffic signs and rules.Featuring some innovations - you may choose difficulty for parking every single delivery, new police system etc.Internal view seems to me graphicaly worse in terms of reading tachometer, speedometer and others compared to ETS2.

												When I first bought this game I was expecting to be introduced to the game with the American national anthem playing in the background, with a morbidly-obese guy eating a double-cheese burger with a bald eagle screeching in the background. This didn't happen.I also expected an excellent game with fantastic mechanics and controls, amazing gameplay and beautiful graphics and scenery. That did happen. American Truck Simulator is THE game you want to get if you enjoy simulator games, or trucking games. It is very similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2, just more American-ised. But that's a good thing.So far it only has 3 states (if you include the free DLC):Arizona, Nevada and California, but they're planning to add more as time goes by. Even with only 3 states you are able to get tens of hours, if not hundreds of hours of gameplay easily, as it's still quite a large area and there's a lot to do in the game.If you've read all this and still haven't decided to buy the game, what's wrong with you?!-----tl;dr - buy this game.

												I bought this game a couple of months after it was released. I had NOT played Euro Truck Simulator 2 prior to this, as I had no interest in driving in Europe.The game was admittedly a little lacking in the early days. But in the nearly one year it's been out, the game has received two free trucks, a free state and a free rescaling of the entire map to increase immersion. Playing this game also inspired me to purchase ETS2, and I have been enjoying both games ever since.As a real-life trucker, ATS appeals to me. Anyone who enjoys ETS2 will probably enjoy ATS. The American trucks are bigger, but so are the roads. And much like ETS2 will give you the sense of what it's like to try and drive through the Cotswolds, ATS will give you the sense of what the American open road is like.			"

												I have no idea how realistic this is compared to a real truck and I do not care. This is fun. A LOT of fun. With so many reviews before this one, there might not be anything to say that has not been said. They did a great job condensing the areas of the cities that I am familiar with. I'll bet the rest of them are just as good. If for some reason this is the only review you have read of this and are still wondering if you should buy it...stop wondering and add it to the cart. You will not be dissapointed. I recommend this to anyone who already enjoys driving simulators and games. I also recommend this to anyone who is wondering what it is like to drive across america. It will take a while but eventually they will have all the states that are able to be reached via truck. Be careful, the scenery might distract you with it's detail.			"

Even with only three states right now a one way trip through all of them takes several real life hours. The map really feels huge now and the landscape looks even bigger and wider. So I can't wait to take two weeks holidays in some years from now to cross the US from West to East. ;-)Thanks SCS and keep up the good work!			"

												Of all my games on Steam I've logged the most hours in ATS.  It's definitely my favorite and I enjoy most everything about it.  The only dislikes I have about the game are the strict way speed is enforced and how any accident is your fault.  AI traffic does cause some accidents but you will always pay the fine.  You do have the options to turn off traffic infractions so that makes up for the dislikes.  The game is very immersive and very pleasing to the eye.  The scenery is great and the map has been expanded in size.  While it may take a painstakingly long time to get more states it's worth the wait in my opinion.  SCS is doing an excellent job getting this simulator right and it shows.  The mods in Steam workshop are easy to apply directly into the game thanks to the built-in mod manager.  I will continue to play this sim for a long time thanks to the quality of the stock sim and the mods available!			"

I bought the ""Kinetic 9W9"" and painted it the same shade of purple as the very truck I was sitting in and was Immediately hooked with the rest, history. 13 years later I'm running a beautiful black fully licensed W900L shined to the nines with the needle buried in the left lane and passing other players like they're standing still(online multiplayer mod that is insanely awesome) which truly is a dream come true.

												Growing up riding around with my father in his Big Rig always caught my interest in big trucks. I loved seeing more of the state I lived in. This scaled down sim is pretty close to the real thing. There are a few small things missing, but overall its quite detailed, scenic, and ""pretty"". Even driving down my home highway and through my home area, I recognize many key features of it that I love to drive on IRL. Definitely fun to play, smooth, and addicting! And of course, having a long convoy of your buddies is pretty sweet when you look and the mirror and see the line of trucks behind you. Cant wait to see what they bring to this game as more of the USA is opened up. Do wish theyd get on that though, even though the game is about a month old at the time of this review, Im sure many of us ATSers are ready to see and explore some new stuff. Also, I hope they ad some of the famous grades over the country. Not too many big hills where you actually have to DRIVE your truck up or down properly or risk wrecking.			"

												Well after the rescaling patch (i refuse to use the word DLC) has been released. The game feels Considerably larger now. Which is good news since before it felt too small. i would say now it feels right! Trips from northern california to the arizona south take easily over an hour. The controles are Perfect, i play with keyboard and still, it is very playable. If you have more precise input, thats easily more fun. Sound is great, Graphics are VERY nice except the trees and bushes look a bit ""bitmappy"" I have pranked several of my friends uploading a nightly video of a short ride and some still think that my parttime job is a trucker.The negatives are that there is not much happening. I hoped for some Smokey and the Bandit type of missions, Traffic Jams, Police actually stopping you...inspecting cargo etc... eating would also be fine. Maybe have a nice truckerbar where truckers could gamble and play cards. CB Radio warning for Radartraps and such. It feels a little sterile. But if you just want trucking and have nice scenes during your trucking...well you should really buy it. Its worth it. If you like podcasts...HELL its even better.			"

												If you did'nt already know, American Truck Simulator is a trucking Simulator were you are sent out to deliver cargo to multiple different organizations and then to make your own company and hire drivers to take on the trucking buisness around the world.Pros-Controller Support-Various Cargos-Steam Workshop-Amazing Scenery-Great Looking Game-Beginner and Expert Options-Adding Content (Like Arizona and Trucks)-Achievments-Customization -Leveling SystemCons-Only 3 Trucks at the moment-In Large areas FPS can be spotty-Not a huge variety of AI vehicles-Identical Layout to Euro Truck Simulator 2As you can see the Pros out number the Cons by a lot. American Truck Simulator is an amazing experience with the true American feel.American Truck Simulator hit spot on with making you feel like your actually driving on an American Road, Visiting and American gas station, and getting cargo from an American store. If you have'nt already, go to TruckerMP and sign up for an account there to get access to the multiplayer side of American Truck Simulator. TruckMP is not associated with American Truck Simulator. It allows you to connect to a server with friends and have a blast. Do I recommend this game? I do recommend this game by a lot. This game just like Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a huge successor on SCS Sofware's part. Its a huge open world trucking simulator, what else could you want. With Multiplayer it can really be a lot of fun. If you would like, Feel free to add me on Steam			"

												WHAT ARE YOU DOING LOOKING AT THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!!!Seriously though this is a great game and i love it           Pros & cons :3Pros:-You get to drive in america-Awesome trucks-Pretty good graphics for a simulator-You get to be a truck driver :3-Tumbleweeds 4 days in nevada!!!!!!!Cons: -It can take a lot of time so if you dont have lots of free time i wouldnt recommend you buy this game-The Justice and law system is a little unfair but you can turn it off so if you dont like it you can always solve that problem-Doesnt have that much content at the moment but they are adding more like arizona which is coming soon-Some of the turn offs are kind of narrow and you will get you truck stuck-Coastline Mining is difficult to deliver to every time i deliver there i end up getting my truck stuck on the Weight platforms?I highly recommend this game if you enjoy trucking and delivering cargos Euro Truck Simulator 2 is also a great trucking game set in Europe made by the same develpers so check that out tooGreat game i give it a 8.5/10			"

												Trucking in America really giving fun but there is some points missing in this game.-Map is so small at this point. They added 2 free dlc to grow it up for base game.-They want to make other states as DLC. There will be so much DLC as we can see from this.-There is only 3 or 4 trucks available at this point.-Game only support 64-bit and they said they don't think to make a support for 32-bit systemsBut the game will be good and huge with DLC packs and free contents in the future.If you are a fan of ETS 2 buy this game but if you are new at this games, don't buy ATS go for ETS2.

												Fantastic game, especially after the free Arizona DLC. Not as mature as Euro Truck Simulator 2, but the developer is clearly in it for the long-haul and each update makes the game better and better.Its biggest flaw is having a smaller map scale than ETS2 - but the Arizona DLC does a decent job compensating for that, and SCS has announced that they will be rescaling the map to match the scale of ETS2 in a future update.

												Do I recommend this at $20? No. At $10 or 15$? Yes, I would. I did buy it at $20 out of boredom, due to it seeming like a nice complement to my new real life job which gives me a different persective on trucking, but I am a bit disappointed with the game.This is a much smaller product compared to Euro's counterpart. I knew this going in, but realizing that there is literally only 3 trucks to pick from is still a shock. That's hardly enough to be called a ""simulation"" of this career. You'll find yourself covering what little landmass they offer very quickly, as well. And if your goal is to play online, you'll find no more than 230 players on the USA server on average, which is hardly a replacement for the AI traffic that will be removed when you play with the multiplayer mod. There will be times when you pass through a city on routes, and see not one single vehicle on the road. That's a very lonely experience, despite playing online.With that in mind, I suggest playing the American edition offline, with the REAL logo mods for the various signs, trucks, icons, etc to make the game seem like the real world. There's also a nice economy boost to speed things up (by slightly cheating), so you wont get bored before getting your fill of the game's world. You should definitely download the user-made Volvo truck model too. It's very impressive. I hope we see more trucks added by users, as it seems the developer is more focused on Euro's edition.The experience otherwise is fine. It's no racing game. Play it casually, relax, take in the sights, listen to the internet radio stations, try to abide by laws for some challenge. The experience is fine that way. The graphics engine sucks though. Despite my GPU and no CPU cores getting taxed to any real degree, the game often chugs at 30fps in cities for no reason.			"

												I totally recommend this game, because the game is so well-polished and the gameplay is even more impressive than Euro Truck Simulator 2. I had never tried the Truck Simulator series, and I found that once I got it, I couldn't stop playing. Even though the map is currently small, the graphics have been improved from ETS2, and is currently at a rock-bottom price. I cannot wait for more DLC to come out, and eventually I hope that the game can expand to the whole of the USA. This game is great for anyone, as it is super easy to learn, but is also challenging in it's own right to grow your company to a bigger level. Get it now while it is at a cheap price.10/10			"

												I sure hope the Developers of ATS plan also to add Multiple Combination Trailers too! E.G. ""A"" Train, C""Train Combinations? .........These type of combination trailers are still quite popular in North American, Especially for L.T.L. Loads........... To make them drivable within ATS...a, ""Converter Type Coupler""... that ""Free-Stands"" when disconnected is needed. A ""Converter"" also would require a, ""Pintle Type Hookup"", for the ""A-or, Lead Trailer"" along with a ""Fifth Wheel Type Hookup"", for the ""B-or Following Trailer"".Theres one more type of Combination too...without the Pintle Hookup! The ""B"" Train. This type relies on a Sliding Trailer Axle for the ""A"" or ""Lead"" Trailer. Whe the ""Axle-Slider"" is extended their is a Visible a ""Fifth Wheel"" on top of the ""Trailer Axles"". the ""B"" or ""Following"" Trailer attaches to this ""Fifth Wheel"" to make-up a ""Set of B-Train Wagons"" or ""B-Train""Real Popular in Canada too, as its simple to ""Hook and Unhook"" and is Extremely more Stable than an ""A-Train"" or the almost obsolete/replaced ""C-Train"". The ""B-Train"" has over time replaced the ""C-Train"", as its less complex and requires less maintenance and training too.ThanksNeilr			"

												Initially I was apprehensive about buying the game due to the small size of it compared to ETS and ETS2, and over scaling making the roads far too short. However, I bought it after playing around with the demo and realising that it is all relative. Don't get me wrong, the map is small, and the longest drive I've done so far lasted no more than 40 minutes (I've spent a couple hours on a single job in ETS2). I have no doubt this will change over time, but I feel SCS has cheated the game by only releasing two initial states.Pros:- Challenging driving with longer trailers- Selectable trailer drop off locations- Detailed scenery and roadsCons:- The map is far too small in its current- Lack of trucks- Idiotic AI and overly harsh traffic penalty enforcementThis game is good for people who want a step up from the driving in ETS and ETS2, but I wouldn't strongly suggest people who own those games to get this as it feels more like a DLC or gimick having played the previous two games. For those who've never played a truck sim, this offers a unique and in-depth entry into the game type.TL:DRGood game that challenges your driving skills, but map is too small.			"

												American Truck Simulator is a strong evolution of SCS's trucking sim formula. The core loop of pickup, drive, and deliver (with a dash of business management) is still there from ETS2. Cruising from the bustling cities in California, trough the barren night desert, and into a small town in Nevada is as satisfying as ever.The map's scale may be smaller than ETS2, but ATS's world is much more dense and interesting. The use of vanilla ETS2's assets was very similar in every city. That is no longer the case with ATS. From the base level, there are straight up more things to see as you cruise from destination to destination. When assets ARE reused, they are done so in such a creative manner that you probably won't notice on first glance.Most notable of the new assets are the new locations where jobs are taken and delivered. Not only are they much more varied than ETS2, but there's an increased level of challenge when parking. Larger trucks and longer trailers combined with tight quarters and required blind-side backing make some of the drop-offs downright difficult. In fact, the difficulty as a whole has increased with ATS. The mobile police cars make avoiding speeding fines more complex than just cheesing speed cameras. Also, the rebalanced economy seems to have made it a little less easy to earn loads of money.However, there are still flaws. Unprotected, at-grade left turns onto freeways are a nightmare. The freeway traffic will never let up, so any AI in front of you will never be able to pull out. Even if you're lucky enough to be first in line at the turn, you'll end up slowly nudging your way into traffic to try and block them long enough to make it through. Then there are the small pockets of the road system where the speed limit rapidly changes from 70 to 30 to 55. God help you if a cop spots you going 31 in the midst of braking. Lastly, some truck customization parts are not present, such as air horns and extra lights.(UPDATE 2016/05/02 - SCS has since added protected left turns to some areas and made the speed limit changes more gradual. There are still a few rough spots, but way less than on release.)Overall, I am really pleased with ATS at the $20 price point, which is the same as the Scandinavian DLC for ETS2 when it came out. There may only be two trucks and two states, but SCS has been good about supporting ETS2 and they are showing no signs of changing. They've already confirmed at LEAST two more trucks, and the state of Arizona as free DLC. It will be interesting to see their plan for paid DLC to cover the rest of the country.			"

												Pretty much ETS2 with American trucks and a smaller, but highly detailed map. You play as a truck driver who has no cash, no truck, nothing. You do quick jobs by driving for other companies till you can afford your own truck. Once you own a truck, you are free to explore and discover cities where you can find pickup and drop off points for trailers, truck dealers, recruitment agencies, and more. Once you've earned a considerable amount of cash, you can upgrade our garage and buy additional trucks and hire drivers for added income. You can buy more garages in different cities to further expand your business.Pros: - Very vibrant and beautiful graphics- Easy to use interface (Carried over from ETS2)- Highly detailed map with excellent attention to detail- Highly detailed trucks with interior- Realistic Driving physics- Realistic Driving laws- Simple to use Sat Nav- Controller, wheel, joystick support- Mods support- Photomode and World of Trucks- Multiplayer mod (Truckers MP)Cons:- Very poor optimization; you may need a good GPU to run smoothly- Small map (Free & Paid Expansions soon to come)- Limited truck selection (More to come within the next few months)- Daft AI (Similar to ETS2)- Police cars spawn too often and are not forgiving when speeding- Spawn rate of certain AI cars are unrealistic- Lack of slip roads on freeway intersections- Horn sounds like a computer making error noises			"

												I bought this as a fan of ETS2, however, I found myself dissapointed to the point of refunding the game. Why? The main thing that brought me to that conclusion was the scale in the game. A mile in game is equivalent to about 100 feet on the road,which makes a 100+ mile drive take about 10 minutes. Why does that drive of 100 miles (about 2 miles in real scale) take that long? Because the trucks are the most sluggish and poor handling things I've ever seen in a game like this. Having the petal matted to the floor and flat-foot shifting takes about 1 whole minute to get to 50mph. I can't recommend this game in this state.			"

												I could play this game for hours. Though it is a reskin of ETS2.. It's just so amazing! There are freaking hills! It changes your experience with driving completely per area you are in. California is more green, hilly, and lower speed limits. Nevada is more flat desert with higher speed limits. It just changes so much. In ETS2 everything seemed the same, in American Truck Simulator it is all different! I couldn't ask for more, well more states... But this game is just amazing, I highly suggest you buy it or atleast try out the Demo.10/10 I would definately buy again.			"

												Congratulations, you have successfully simulated the tedium of motorway driving. This 'game' is suitable only it seems, for budding Eddie Stobart drivers preparing for their first week on the job. Beyond the -repeat- tedium of overzealous police, speed limits that make me want to increase the rate time passes to actually get anywhere, and the god damn lack of any ounce of imagination when it comes to road design (seriously the most inspiring road design appears to be a series of miniature hills near Bakersfield), we see a return of invisible walls to the world of gaming, I thought had been left behind in 2006. I bought this for two reasons, I wanted to use an controller with my computer, and I wanted a nice relaxing game. Well the controller was anything but obvious to configure, and the gameplay was less relaxing, more naeuseatingly dull.Seriously hope this was not the efforts of more than a first year games programming student's pet project. Dont bother with the rest of the states, you appear to have run out of ideas anyway.			"

												Before you look at all the bad reviews look at how many positive reviews it has, because those people who rated it very low are just whiners while the rest of us who actually played the game for more than an hour genuinely love the game as is. yes it only has two trucks, but those trucks are fully customizable, and yes it only comes with two states but the attention to detail SCS has given to those states is just incredible. last thing to note is yes they are going to be adding more states as dlc and if you are still wondering if they are a money grabbing company take a look at the prices of the dlc for euro truck simulator 2, the prices are very low and will continue to be for the forseeable future. overall i love this game and so will you if you just give it a chance and how could you not for only 20 dollars.

												Played the game for 7 Hours so far, It's fu*king amazing SCS did a good job. There is defiantly some issues and it looks like the game was rushed but over all it's a good game.Pros: Overall good looking world Has some new feature that are not in ETS2 (Weight Stations, E-Cards At Tolls, ETC) Has actual Police that patrol and ticket you Trucks feel and handle like they should. Feature to choice difficulty of parking for extra XP.Cons: AI is still completely sh*t, they will cut you off, run into you, stop randomly just to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Speed limit signs are incorrect, In quite a few areas the signs will say 65 and the real limit is 55. Speed limit is unrealistic in many areas, I have found the speed limit to be 70 in some areas that you should be going over 30. Same with some areas are 30 but it should be 55.  Stop signs in random places for no reason:


Stop signs at stop lights...

Again why put stop signs here?

 Police AI had potential but is now just a moving speed camera. You tend to get ticketed by police for going 3 MPH over the limit, Kinda Aids.  I feel like I'm forgetting a few things...Final Opinion This game has plenty of potential if they spend the time working on it.I would give it a solid 8.7 out of 10The game needs some work but is defiantly worth the $20, I would recommend that you get it on♥♥♥♥♥right now for $15.

												Really fun game. Though something that annoyes the hell out of me is the fact that there is no hose connection still, that one little thing has been bugging me so much. Other than that, it's what you can expect from any game, it has it's up and down. The port is okay, I get major drops in my fps, when I hit cities, and when it rains, etc even though I shouldn't. Graphics could honestly have been better, but there alright. There is a difference from ETS2, but I can't really say much about that game, cause I hate driving flat nose trucks, so I stopped playing that game a long time ago. It will probaly never happen but, I would love to have a seperate mode to this game or something in the future, that actually provides realism. Like getting out of the truck to connect the trailer, maybe a simplified version of logs, acually wieghing the truck at a truck stop, also, adding stuff like real life DOT regulations. Like only being able to work 14hrs and driving 11hrs. Maybe actually hit the dock to the location that your delivering to, actually opening the doors to the trailer. And when you sleep at a truck stop, ya actually have to get out of the seat and move to the bed. adding an actual shifter. Anyway, those are just a few things. This of course would be like a whole seperate mode. Like and advanced game mode for like hard core people, and then what it is now is a Simplified mode. But, yea 10/10.			"

												If you like driving to unwind, this is a great game for you.  Some of the sights might distract you from staying on the road, and sometimes you might find yourself behind a typical slow driven hybrid car.  While this game isn't 100% perfect or accurate with the real world roadscape, there are few iconic junctions or landmarks which are close enough to the real thing.  SCS has also done a great job with the map rescale, even though game updates may feel few and far between.  Regardless, with the current price of $20 and the quality of the updates make this game worth the price.  There are also a ton of mods available in the Steam Workshop.  I just hope that SCS can eventually map out most of the United States, but that could take decades at their current pace.***TLDR:  It's worth the $20 if you love to drive around to unwind.			"

												Long time player of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and finding this experience to be just as good if not better!At first you load it up and you think that only three states is nothing... especially compared to ETS2... but then you play and thanks to the recent rescale trust me... you can't quickly run out of places to explore!I would highly recommend this game to any fan of ETS2 and even if this is your first ever stab at a truck simulator... if you're interested enough to look then you will enjoy this game for many hours! Well worth the asking price but seeing as I got it with 30% off... easily the best £10 I've spent this year!What are ou waiting for? Jump in the driver's seat!			"

												An addictive game which is a must for any driving enthusiast.I received this game as a gift from a friend just over two weeks ago and in that time, I've put 100 hours and 30000 miles on my truck. It has a healthy modding community, which has made many trucks not available in the base game (4 currently), realism mods with real companies, and more. It is currently in open beta for the 1.5 release which increases the scale of the game.It's hard to put into words what makes this fairly monotonous game so enjoyable as all you do is take a job, hook up a trailer, and then navigate traffic along miles of road to your destination while avoiding fines, damage and being late.So far, all the core DLC has been free, including new trucks, new states and the rescale project to bring the game to 1:20 scale from 1:35 scale. The only paid DLC is cosmetic. Some paint jobs, a steering wheel pack and a rim/hubcap pack.			"

You can mod the SP, you can play online with the Multiplayer mod and drive around with other players. Now, with the rescale coming out, which was the most complained about part of this game it is even better. Do you want to drive a Truck, or even drive around with your friends (requires MP mod by TruckersMP) then buy American Truck Simulator now!			"

												I was *super* excited for this game to come out. I love Euro Truck Simulator, and I'm a Linux user, and I live in one of the major 'hub' cities where the game starts!However, having played it, I am very sad that they barely even re-skinned ETS for the US. There is, at most, a tiny nod in each of the locations - but it feels like they didn't even come here to see what they were designing.I know it's a *game* but it really feels like they phoned it in. Disappointed.I'd still recommend it, especially for Europeans - but I'll be going back to playing ETS. It's probably just as bad, but I don't *know it* having never been to most of those places.			"

												American Truck Simulator is a great game with some serious problems.  It's still a classic and loads of fun, but you may find more value in Euro Truck Sim 2.I have a big debate of whether I prefer ATS (American Truck Sim) or ETS2 (Euro Truck Sim 2).  The two games are very similar.  The UI, graphics, and game controls are improved in ATS, but overall the titles are very similar.  ETS2 has a vastly larger world.  As an American, learning and seeing the European countryside is interesting while driving on the California I-5 is objectively not.  ProGood Sim, the trucks feel real and the various options allow you to make the game more arcade or more simThe world is fun, I don't know if I would say accurate, but it feels genuine in many ways.  California looks like California, Nevada back country feels like Nevada back countryGraphics are improved, not great, but acceptableSteam workshop modsThe red light tickets are really bad....unfortunately it's very realistic just like the number of pot dispensaries in Bakersfield.ConsPerformance is really bad.  Even on a Haswell i5 and GTX 980 the game really struggles to push out 60fps - and the hardware isn't maxed.  This isn't helped much by reducing the settings.  The game just doesn't run well.  My understanding is that aside from being poorly optimized it's running an old DirectX version.Without Stam Cloud, all of you saves are stored locally.  It means you either need to risk all your progress or go through the trouble of backing you saves up through a 3rd party solution.  If you decide to come back to the game in the future you may not be able to locate your savesThere are not enough vehicles in the game as of June 2016.  This will likely change.  However, with ETS2 the developers just put in truck-look-a-likes until the licenses were secured.  Why wasn't this done in ATS? "

												After nearly 60 hours of playing this game I must admit I've thorougly enjoyed it. The game receives updates very frequently, the developers are always listening to feedback and new suggestions, plus who doesn't want a game where all you do is drive trucks? The game runs smoothly, I haven't ran into any problems, and it's a lot of fun!A lot of people are concerned about the map size, especially since there's only three states right now. In my opinion it doesn't matter! The map size is HUGE, way bigger than any ETS2 map, and SCS Software even announced they were making the map even bigger just recently.Just because there's three states doesn't mean it's no fun. I've been playing this game for so long and haven't discovered all the cities and roads.This game is a lot of fun, I recommend it to anyone interested. It's worth the money even if you only play it for 60 hours.			"

												I love driving and now that I'm living in China without a car it is very hard to not be able to drive the open roads of sweet home America.  I've always wanted to maybe be a truck driver.  Well, now I can...sort of.This game is pretty gorgeous.  If you want to drive a truck in a game, then this game is for you.  This isn't a racing game.Some drawbacks/gripes: Signage isn't always the clearest and advance warning is rarely given in terms of speed limit change.  You'll be cruising along at 55+ mph and suddenly the vehicles in front of you were slam on their brakes as the speed limit crashes to 25 to 40 mph for city speeds.  No warning signs like are ACTUALLY found on American roads.There are more little things like that for the trained American eye.  Most players outside of America won't notice.There are a ton of mods for this game which also help to bring it closer to real-life (change generic fake logos, billboards, etc. to real things that for licensing reasons couldn't be put in the game.  I wonder if there is a mod to change Ray's Burgers to McDonald's!)Probably the best experience of this game or any driving game in general would be with a good steering wheel and pedals...alas I don't have one, so I'm forced to play with either the keyboard or my gamepad (which always drifts with the steering).Take your time.  Enjoy it.  Try to avoid falling into the rut I recently fell in!  12 or so good deliveries in and then I just started slipping and crashing my truck all the time.Beautiful game.  If you enjoy simulators and driving (not racing) you will probably put in 10 hours the first day or two you have this game and you'll start to feel fatigued like a real driver!			"

												ATS may be much smaller in scale than ETS2 but its environments are better designed i.e., prettier and more believable. It is also a bit more challenging with harder drop-off points that you can select for bonus in XP. Smaller gas stations would give you problem to navigate your long trailer in requiring you to be mindful when entering them. There are now police and emergency vehicles that roam the streets which are nice additions for better immersion. The Police would sound their sirene should you violate traffic rules and get yourself fined as a result. Towns and cities are bigger, prettier, and believable in ATS. There are also fewer trucks in ATS but with time there may be more trucks coming as SCS resolves their truck license issues.To me since the game has  Kenworth W900 that alone is enough reason to buy it.The downside is that the fps in ATS varies quite a bit. It goes from 60 fps on highways to 40s at towns' intersections and some portions of cities. It's probably due to its reliance on DirectX9. There are some rumors that SCS intends to port both ETS2 and ATS to DirectX11 but until that happens there's little you can do to mitigate this wild variation in fps, unless perhaps you have an older computer. If you love American setting and enjoy ETS2 you should buy this game. If you love American trucks then this is the game for you.SCS is known to set its DLCs and expansions at fair prices. I'd definitely give my support to these people at SCS. I hope they will port the game to DirectX 11 engine. The sooner, the better.""There's nothing logical or economical about American trucks. They perhaps best showcase American excess with their oversized body, poor gas mileage, and tacky gangster-style lighting. Everything about them is romanticized. And that's why you probably love them as I love my Kenworth W900""			"

												I love driving and now that I'm living in China without a car it is very hard to not be able to drive the open roads of sweet home America.  I've always wanted to maybe be a truck driver.  Well, now I can...sort of.This game is pretty gorgeous.  If you want to drive a truck in a game, then this game is for you.  This isn't a racing game.Some drawbacks/gripes: Signage isn't always the clearest and advance warning is rarely given in terms of speed limit change.  You'll be cruising along at 55+ mph and suddenly the vehicles in front of you were slam on their brakes as the speed limit crashes to 25 to 40 mph for city speeds.  No warning signs like are ACTUALLY found on American roads.There are more little things like that for the trained American eye.  Most players outside of America won't notice.There are a ton of mods for this game which also help to bring it closer to real-life (change generic fake logos, billboards, etc. to real things that for licensing reasons couldn't be put in the game.  I wonder if there is a mod to change Ray's Burgers to McDonald's!)Probably the best experience of this game or any driving game in general would be with a good steering wheel and pedals...alas I don't have one, so I'm forced to play with either the keyboard or my gamepad (which always drifts with the steering).Take your time.  Enjoy it.  Try to avoid falling into the rut I recently fell in!  12 or so good deliveries in and then I just started slipping and crashing my truck all the time.Beautiful game.  If you enjoy simulators and driving (not racing) you will probably put in 10 hours the first day or two you have this game and you'll start to feel fatigued like a real driver!			"

												ATS may be much smaller in scale than ETS2 but its environments are better designed i.e., prettier and more believable. It is also a bit more challenging with harder drop-off points that you can select for bonus in XP. Smaller gas stations would give you problem to navigate your long trailer in requiring you to be mindful when entering them. There are now police and emergency vehicles that roam the streets which are nice additions for better immersion. The Police would sound their sirene should you violate traffic rules and get yourself fined as a result. Towns and cities are bigger, prettier, and believable in ATS. There are also fewer trucks in ATS but with time there may be more trucks coming as SCS resolves their truck license issues.To me since the game has  Kenworth W900 that alone is enough reason to buy it.The downside is that the fps in ATS varies quite a bit. It goes from 60 fps on highways to 40s at towns' intersections and some portions of cities. It's probably due to its reliance on DirectX9. There are some rumors that SCS intends to port both ETS2 and ATS to DirectX11 but until that happens there's little you can do to mitigate this wild variation in fps, unless perhaps you have an older computer. If you love American setting and enjoy ETS2 you should buy this game. If you love American trucks then this is the game for you.SCS is known to set its DLCs and expansions at fair prices. I'd definitely give my support to these people at SCS. I hope they will port the game to DirectX 11 engine. The sooner, the better.""There's nothing logical or economical about American trucks. They perhaps best showcase American excess with their oversized body, poor gas mileage, and tacky gangster-style lighting. Everything about them is romanticized. And that's why you probably love them as I love my Kenworth W900""			"

												Trivia about this game:1. Some locations in the game look like the same location in real life.2. At the release of this game, there were only 2 trucks in the game called the Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt 579, however in the ""American Truck Simulator - Alpha build 0.1.60 gameplay"" video, the Kenworth W900 was included in the game even though it wasn't included at release.3. After the game was released, a limited-time DLC called the ""Steampunk Paint Jobs Pack"" was available if you followed American Truck Simulator on Steam before it was released.4. Originally, the game was supposed to include only California at release but the release date kept delaying until the Nevada DLC was completed.6. In Los Angeles, the famous sign reads ""World of Trucks"" instead of ""Hollywood"" due to copyright issues.			"

												Well. I ended up returning ATS to be honest. I didn't have enough money to buy both ETS2 and ATS and ETS2 won me over. As an American myself the familiar signage, terrain, and trucks are not quite as interesting. Don't get me wrong. Also, in an ironic twist you spend more time on the highway in ETS2, while there is more focus on the sprawling cities in ATS. Ultimately I wanted to spend more time coasting through the alps and on the confusing reversed roads of the UK. ATS is GREAT, especially with the Arizona dlc and the better parking mechanism. In the end though it doesn't feel as much like an adventure since I know America and the map is scaled so small. I'll definitely come back to ATS in a year once more trucks are added and the map gets larger.			"

Yes, i get that I should really be going the speed limit, but accidentally going 5-10mph over the speed limit then getting an unrealistic fine of $1,000 when in reality it should be around $200-$400 at most?

												An addictive game which is a must for any driving enthusiast.I received this game as a gift from a friend just over two weeks ago and in that time, I've put 100 hours and 30000 miles on my truck. It has a healthy modding community, which has made many trucks not available in the base game (4 currently), realism mods with real companies, and more. It is currently in open beta for the 1.5 release which increases the scale of the game.It's hard to put into words what makes this fairly monotonous game so enjoyable as all you do is take a job, hook up a trailer, and then navigate traffic along miles of road to your destination while avoiding fines, damage and being late.So far, all the core DLC has been free, including new trucks, new states and the rescale project to bring the game to 1:20 scale from 1:35 scale. The only paid DLC is cosmetic. Some paint jobs, a steering wheel pack and a rim/hubcap pack.			"

												Nice long term Simulation of a Trucking Industry.  If you like dodging Moronic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ POV ( Privately Owned Vehicles) pulling every demonly stupid move in front of you or if you love looking at scenery while traveling at 70 to 85 MPH at night in a pouring rain and missing your route turn then traveling another 80 Miles for a turn-around. If this is your dream then ""Welcome to the Nightmare"". However, thru in dominatable perseverance, thousands of traffic tickets for running red lights, speeding 3 MPH above the posted limit then... by buying Garages, Buying Trucks and hiring Drivers ( some of whome are lazier than Hillarys supporters ) in time you may amass an empire of employees earning you two to four Million USD per week. OH did I mention wrecking your rig by falling asleep while looking for a rest stop. The Game is a challenging of your tenacity, perseverance and business acumen, it is not for those of you on the dole because it is work but building an Nation wide network of heavy haulers makes you Lord of the commodities and silent ruler of the nation.Great Simulation !

												I've been waiting for this game for a VERY, VERY LONG TIME!!! FInally it is out... It's probably one of my most anticipated games of 2016 and now that I have it I've drove around California its time I drove in Las Vegas, Nevada. I can't wait until the DLCs come out. Sooner or later more and more mods and stock trucks from the actual game itself will increase. Getting this game does require a 64-bit computer system. If you have a low performing processor you will need to ""play around"" with your settings. The Arizona DLC will be availible soon and hopefully the rest of North America as well. Hopefully this is somewhat helpful.UPDATE (6/22/16):So far there are two DLCs that came out, the free Arizona DLC and the wheel customization DLC. The Arizona DLC came out fairly recently and honestly speaking SCS actually stepped up their game just a bit but it need a bit more work since there are only 3 states, SCS said they will be covering the entire North American continent. The trucks I want in the game are the Volvo VNL (670-780), Peterbilt 389, Freightliner Cascadia, and the International Lonestar. These trucks are, in my opinion, great trucks. I feel that the Peterbilt 579 is a good truck but it needs more work, so does the Kenworth T680. The Kenworth W900 has great power and handling, it'll take some practice to master the truck itself. My friend and I (whom I'm not naming due to privacy) are currently slowly making a map of New York State, since we are from NYC. Aside from that the game does have a multiplayer version, HOWEVER you must have this game, it has to be on steam, and you must download it seperately on ""truckersmp''. If you would like to convoy there is actually a page where you can join a convoy and take jobs. So far so good, SCS keep up the good work. Happy trucking guys!!! UPDATE (11/28/16): The Peterbilt 389 is finally here!!! Also the 3 states, California, Nevada, and Arizona, along with furture states to be made will be in a differnt scale (1:20)!!!			"

												Definitely recommended if you like driving related games.  This is one of those simple games that has a very addictive playstyle.  So what do you do in ATS?  Do you race?  Drift through mud and smoke your tires?  Run over pedestrians?  No.  You transport cargo from point A to B and earn a profit.  Sounds boring, right?  Somehow, it's not.  If you want to get into more of the business side of trucking, then you can start your own company, hire drivers, buy more rigs, upgrade them, and earn a profit.The driving is more on the realistic side of playing, but not so much that casual players would be intimidated by it.  Don't want to shift gears?  Fine, go with an automatic transmission and worry only about accelerating and braking.  Want to spice it up?  Do a manual transmission, 18 speed gearbox and try to stop on a hill, then get it going again without stalling out.  Turn on speed limits so traffic tickets pile up on you, or, turn them off when they get annoying.Graphics....well, the foliage needs work - I think everyone agrees that is a little dated, but everything else looks good.  And the sky....oh wow, the sky - it's fantastic.  It actually feels refreshing to gaze at the sky when the sun is just peaking over the horizon from an all night drive.  The cities are well-built and feel alive.  I could go on and on, but you get my drift...buy it; buy it now.Rated 9.5/10.P.S. This game caused me to shell out $350+ for a steering wheel + shifter.  I had zero intentions of ever buying one before this game...especially one that expensive.  That has to mean something.			"

												I started playing SCS Softwares games almost 6 or 7 years ago. I started out playing 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul, then to Bus Driver, and then ETS2. SCS really out did themselves with what they have already in the game, and they are going to continue to out do themselves with each new state.			"

												I will try not to be too critical in this review. This game is great, but there are a lot of things that I absolutely cannot stand about it.1. AI Drivers/PoliceThis topic is widely discussed by many players. To me, it feels like SCS was very lazy in creating the AI drivers, which is, in my opinion, one of the most important aspects of the game. The AI drivers are all over the place, and they will take turns when they want to, not when it is safe. I have found this very frustrating when I have lost thousands of dollars because an AI driver took a left turn right into my trailer or when merging onto the highway and that mustang comes and smashes right into the back of you. The police are another big problem in this game. They totally do not care about how fast they are going, but will give you a ticket for going 3 over the limit. I've seen a police car go whizzing by me at 65-70mph in a 55mph speed zone.2. Barriers/Railroad CrossingsThis is another topic that I feel SCS has not taken into account correctly and were very lazy when creating. When coming up on a railroad crossing, if the lights are flashing (but the barriers have not yet dropped down) an invisible barrier is placed where the barriers of the crossing that drop down would go. This makes it very frustrating when I'm going the speed limit of 55-80 mph along the road and the lights start flashing. I know that I don't have enough time to break, so my truck, trailer, and I are all screwed. I usually just pause the game and cancel the delivery because there's nothing I can do about it. Super frustrating driving hundreds of miles just to have it ruined because the creators of the game were lazy.3. Speed Limits/SignsFor one, some of the speed limits are SUPER unrealistic, and wouldn't be considered safe in the real world. But the main thing is the speed limit signs. I try to play this game super realistically and not look at the GPS at all (even though I still have to every couple of minutes), but it just isn't possible. Some speed limit signs read ""70mph"" when the real speed limit is 55. I usually only go by these signs but I am starting to have to use the GPS more because I am getting unnecessary tickets for going ""over the limit"". Another problem I have is the change of speed limits. When pulling into a weight station, the speed limit is 15 mph, but you could be traveling on a 55mph highway. Going from 55 to 15 in the small amount of seconds it gives you to do so is nearly impossible, thus me receiving more unnecessary tickets. I find this ridiculous and really think that SCS was very lazy on, again, one of the most important aspects of the game.4. DamageThe damage of the trailers is VERY unrealistic. I made a turn once and the very back tire of the trailer that I was hauling touched the dirt on the side of the road while making the turn. I was INSTANTLY hit with 5% damage on the trailer, all because Wal-Mart had to keep their precious tire all clean. Hitting signs by accident is the same story, except you get about 15% damage instead of 5%, which is super ridiculous. Side swiping a barrier or car will give you a whopping 20-35% damage on your truck and trailer, and don't even get me started about hitting barriers by accident at high speeds...Like I said in the beginning, this is a great game. I just feel that SCS were very lazy with the development and did not take enough time (if any at all) to go over some of the key aspects of the game. I hope you found this review helpful.			"

												TLDR; I never thought I would buy this game but I am in love now that I have.A note before my review: I laughed out loud when I saw this game on Steam. I hadn't heard of ETS and haven't played simulator games in years. I saw a truck sim game and thought ""who the hell wants to drive around and make deliveries in a truck?"" Well, apparently I do!I've spent about 4 hours in this game (played the demo for some time before purchasing) and I am hooked. The scenery is gorgeous, controls are great (I recommend using a gamepad), and the game as a whole is so simple that it is amazing. It doesn't waste time overcomplicating things, the game is what it is, drive a truck around and listen to music, make more money and buy more trucks. The map is already large and they are expanding it right now and in a few months it will be much larger. With the potential to add new states down the road you are looking at a gorgeous new game that will continue to expand, grow and improve for years to come.This game is the perfect end to a long day at work. I can go home and just drive around viewing beautiful sunsets and sunrises across some of the best roads in America for cruising. The added ability to listen to internet radio makes it so much better. I personally like driving around jamming to some 80s rock, it's a perfect compliment to life on the road.If you aren't sure if this game will suit you try out the demo, you can get quite a bit of time in it and it's a great way to get used to the controls and decide if it's a game you will enjoy. I recognize that simulators like this might not be for everybody, but if you enjoy sims or driving you will probably love this game.I just can't wait for work to end so I can go home and play some more!

												I love driving and now that I'm living in China without a car it is very hard to not be able to drive the open roads of sweet home America.  I've always wanted to maybe be a truck driver.  Well, now I can...sort of.This game is pretty gorgeous.  If you want to drive a truck in a game, then this game is for you.  This isn't a racing game.Some drawbacks/gripes: Signage isn't always the clearest and advance warning is rarely given in terms of speed limit change.  You'll be cruising along at 55+ mph and suddenly the vehicles in front of you were slam on their brakes as the speed limit crashes to 25 to 40 mph for city speeds.  No warning signs like are ACTUALLY found on American roads.There are more little things like that for the trained American eye.  Most players outside of America won't notice.There are a ton of mods for this game which also help to bring it closer to real-life (change generic fake logos, billboards, etc. to real things that for licensing reasons couldn't be put in the game.  I wonder if there is a mod to change Ray's Burgers to McDonald's!)Probably the best experience of this game or any driving game in general would be with a good steering wheel and pedals...alas I don't have one, so I'm forced to play with either the keyboard or my gamepad (which always drifts with the steering).Take your time.  Enjoy it.  Try to avoid falling into the rut I recently fell in!  12 or so good deliveries in and then I just started slipping and crashing my truck all the time.Beautiful game.  If you enjoy simulators and driving (not racing) you will probably put in 10 hours the first day or two you have this game and you'll start to feel fatigued like a real driver!			"

												ATS may be much smaller in scale than ETS2 but its environments are better designed i.e., prettier and more believable. It is also a bit more challenging with harder drop-off points that you can select for bonus in XP. Smaller gas stations would give you problem to navigate your long trailer in requiring you to be mindful when entering them. There are now police and emergency vehicles that roam the streets which are nice additions for better immersion. The Police would sound their sirene should you violate traffic rules and get yourself fined as a result. Towns and cities are bigger, prettier, and believable in ATS. There are also fewer trucks in ATS but with time there may be more trucks coming as SCS resolves their truck license issues.To me since the game has  Kenworth W900 that alone is enough reason to buy it.The downside is that the fps in ATS varies quite a bit. It goes from 60 fps on highways to 40s at towns' intersections and some portions of cities. It's probably due to its reliance on DirectX9. There are some rumors that SCS intends to port both ETS2 and ATS to DirectX11 but until that happens there's little you can do to mitigate this wild variation in fps, unless perhaps you have an older computer. If you love American setting and enjoy ETS2 you should buy this game. If you love American trucks then this is the game for you.SCS is known to set its DLCs and expansions at fair prices. I'd definitely give my support to these people at SCS. I hope they will port the game to DirectX 11 engine. The sooner, the better.""There's nothing logical or economical about American trucks. They perhaps best showcase American excess with their oversized body, poor gas mileage, and tacky gangster-style lighting. Everything about them is romanticized. And that's why you probably love them as I love my Kenworth W900""			"

												Trivia about this game:1. Some locations in the game look like the same location in real life.2. At the release of this game, there were only 2 trucks in the game called the Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt 579, however in the ""American Truck Simulator - Alpha build 0.1.60 gameplay"" video, the Kenworth W900 was included in the game even though it wasn't included at release.3. After the game was released, a limited-time DLC called the ""Steampunk Paint Jobs Pack"" was available if you followed American Truck Simulator on Steam before it was released.4. Originally, the game was supposed to include only California at release but the release date kept delaying until the Nevada DLC was completed.6. In Los Angeles, the famous sign reads ""World of Trucks"" instead of ""Hollywood"" due to copyright issues.			"

												As a man who still is qualified to operate T/T and various lengths, capacities and the like; I must say, I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS GAME and I DON'T WANT TO!!!!I've been out of the truck driving world for over 8 years; but since purchasing this game and all the others in the bundle, my desire to return to the real world of trucking is ever increasing.  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!!!  Okay, now to the P&C of the game:PROS:- Physics are almost perfect.- Internet radio makes this even more amazing. Classic Country is my favorite to drive to.- The weather, scenic environment...just gorgous.  I have everything on ULTRA. CONS:- The railing on the weigh stations are difficult to drive over when I arrive to drop a cargo load off.- The traffic AI, could do with some improvement; but still not that bad. Sometimes, the drivers in California, are like those in the game: Lunatics.- Crossing the line as you stop on red, ever so slightly can cause you to get a ticket.  Sometimes.........the ""CONS"" actually aren't bad, but I just wanted to write minor things.  The game is great.Personal CONS (problems with the game, because of my driving; not the devs):- Writing about the scenic environment, it's easy to almost get into an accident.- The ticket fees are astronomical.  Then again, maybe I should be more careful.**UPDATE: 23 April, 2017**Still playing the game after the new update.  Still not as smooth, although my rig is top notch.  Will skip every now and then, but doesn't crash; then again, I do have a number of MODS.  Mostly real company names, trailers, paint jobs, etc.  Overall, I'm enjoying this game a lot.			"

												I am going to go ahead and give this my recommendation, however this is with a bit of an asterisk Platform of the game has every bit of potential as ETS2, however it almost feels as if the game has started more ""gimped"" than ETS2 did, in regards to interesting locations to discover and landscape variety. Another issue is that there is very few trucks to choose from. And finally, multiplayer needs a lot more love from the community as it is a relative ghost town, this has made me go back to ETS2 for the moment. Relatively small gripes, since the rest of the gameplay is every bit as enjoyable as ETS2. And once more of the states and a significant amount of trucks are added (hopefully for free, since the amount we have now is unsatisfactory, thus game is not ready for much justified DLC) things should get a lot better. There is one challenge with getting people in America to play.... they need to aggressively advertise this game to people who are in the field of trucking. It's not going to be like ETS2 where even just general gamers were interesting. American crowd is much more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥in regards to getting them to play simulations. You need to take advantage of the niche crowd more. So hopefully ATS adapts to the new territory with their marketing strategies.***THIS GAME HAS MANY MORE POSITIVES THAN NEGATIVES, IT IS JUST A BIT UNDERWELMING RIGHT NOW***Finally I will say that I would still be playing ATS if the multiplayer crowd was larger, since I like having interaction while I truck. If this is not the kind of thing that will turn you off, then you can subtract that from the negatives.You definitely want to add this, if you are a fan of the series, as soon as financially possible.... since there is a strong chance of great things to come, if ETS2 is any indication. I would not want to be caught out when the game is improved without being able to play it when that day comes. I'll probably come back to this review in 6 to 12 months and update it. If a lot of content is added I will talk about that. If no or little content is added I will change to thumbs down. But these devs have never really let me down yet, so.... there's that. :)  Have a great new year.			"

												I have played all of the other SCS American based Truck Simulators. And I've been dying for something updated like this for quite some time.Glad it finally made it to Steam too. The mods are easier to find and install than the previous games were. And you get updates automatically from the developer instead of having to go to the website to download a patch.It does need more trucks; like Freightliner, Western Star, Caterpillar, Mack, and others. And not the ones that are from the workshop either. I'd like to see actual classics from the 70's to the 90's too.Even if you do or don't like trucks. This is a simulator that really does well and isn't some cheap rip off. I have my CDL and this helps me when I am not driving because here I can make mistakes that you can't in real life.I think this would also make a great VR game too.			"

I can go home and just drive around viewing beautiful sunsets and sunrises across some of the best roads in America for cruising. The added ability to listen to internet radio makes it so much better. I personally like driving around jamming to some 80s rock, it's a perfect compliment to life on the road.If you aren't sure if this game will suit you try out the demo, you can get quite a bit of time in it and it's a great way to get used to the controls and decide if it's a game you will enjoy. I recognize that simulators like this might not be for everybody, but if you enjoy sims or driving you will probably love this game.I just can't wait for work to end so I can go home and play some more!

												Really fun game. Though something that annoyes the hell out of me is the fact that there is no hose connection still, that one little thing has been bugging me so much. Other than that, it's what you can expect from any game, it has it's up and down. The port is okay, I get major drops in my fps, when I hit cities, and when it rains, etc even though I shouldn't. Graphics could honestly have been better, but there alright. There is a difference from ETS2, but I can't really say much about that game, cause I hate driving flat nose trucks, so I stopped playing that game a long time ago. It will probaly never happen but, I would love to have a seperate mode to this game or something in the future, that actually provides realism. Like getting out of the truck to connect the trailer, maybe a simplified version of logs, acually wieghing the truck at a truck stop, also, adding stuff like real life DOT regulations. Like only being able to work 14hrs and driving 11hrs. Maybe actually hit the dock to the location that your delivering to, actually opening the doors to the trailer. And when you sleep at a truck stop, ya actually have to get out of the seat and move to the bed. adding an actual shifter. Anyway, those are just a few things. This of course would be like a whole seperate mode. Like and advanced game mode for like hard core people, and then what it is now is a Simplified mode. But, yea 10/10.			"

												Probably the best thing I can say about ATS is it's one of the most relaxing games I've played in a long time.  You can just work as a driver for hire, with no worries at all other than arriving on time (which isn't difficult) but even if you start your own company, the economy is such that you won't run into too many problems keeping it going.  Or you can just buy a truck for yourself, not hire anyone and cruise the USA (well...CA, NV and AZ) as an independent owner-operator.  Works best with a wheel of course, but perfectly manageable with a gamepad.  There's a ton of options to set so you can make the game as realistic as you wish.  Can't manage or don't want bothered backing a 53' trailer into a tight spot?  Turn it off.  Realistic air brakes to real?  Turn it off, you get the idea.If you enjoy driving games this is worth the $20 easily.  If you don't enjoy driving games this still might be worth the $20, could get you hooked.			"

												So you're wondering if you should buy this since you like ETS2 so much?+ prettier sceneries (grand ♥♥♥♥ing canyon, las vegas, SF)+ easier achievements?- uglier trucks (and only two brands)- more expensive fines (♥♥♥♥ da police)- smaller map (duh)ATS definitely doesn't feel as complete as ETS2, but it sure is worth it. The game is newer, more DLC were already announced, and the change of pace from Europe is a much needed breath of fresh air.			"

												UPDATED FOR RESCALE UPDATE I wanted to review this game and give it a good one because I like ETS2 and I wanted to support the devs. But, I thought it would not be right to do as (too) many people do and post a review (good or bad) without even taking time to try the game. So I played close to 5h and made at least 5 deliveries with and without owned truck before writing this./!\ I will compare alot with ETS2 so if you are not familiar with this game, probably this review wont be the best so feel free to ask anything in comments below /!\Let's start with short review for those who don't want to read a novel and then I'll give more in depth of my thoughts for those who want to know more (keep in mind those ""facts"" are my own appreciation of the game and could differ for others):PROS- Graphics are as good as ETS2 (Scandinavia)- Map- Muuuuurica!- Maneuverability different from ETS2 ---> parking trailer is so much more fun and challenging- Weight stations- Cops- Higher amount of car models- Stop signs (not only red lights anymore)- Can turn right on red light as long as you do a stop before (as in real life eh eh)CONS- Graphics are as good as ETS2 (Scandinavia)- Map- Cops- Lower amount of truck models- No World of trucks deliveries.. not yet... it's probably coming ;)- no multiplayer --> i hope they'll consider it as the map will grow..Graphics are as good as ETS2 (Scandinavia) : It is good and bad at same time. Good because this mean you dont need an asskicking new gen high end PC to run this game, which is awesome for those who were running ETS2 on a lower spec computer and wanted badly to put their hands on ATS. For some people, it is a bad thing because they'll say devs didnt made too much work keeping the same game engine. I could agree with this and at same time I would say it's not fair to think they were lazy on this one. Scandinavia is a recent release (may 2015) and they worked hard to improve the engine. In Scandinavia (compared to basic ETS2), the roads are more sophisticated (less boring same looking linear roads), graphics are better, landscapes have way more details and stuff to look at while driving.. Well, overall, Scandinavia was really superior to the basic ETS2 in term of looking and, at least for me, I had a better time driving this part of the Europe. ATS is as detailed and good looking than Scandinavia. In fact, I believe it's even more detailed than Scandinavia. So I dont feel like devs were lazy taking the same engine. In fact, I think they work hard to improve it countinuously. Every update of the engine brings better graphics and more detailed environment. It's just awesome considering that most part of time, you drive straight forward and that your main entertainment is all about admiring landscapes.Map: It is not big right now. Only 2 states. A third is coming for free really soon. And for the rest? who knows. A bad thing for some people because they think the map is too small for the price of the game (and they are afraid SCS asks lot money to unlock the future states and countries)... and at same time, it's a good thing because the scale will be more interesting than ETS2 if they manage to make the whole US + Canada (maybe more if people keep supporting them). It's a huge project. It's a choice to do: will you support them and give money sometime or not? No matter what your choice is, I believe people giving a bad review to this game for the reason it'll cost money in the future, it is just stupid. The base game is pretty cheap. And this project is a big one. People working at SCS need to pay bills, to eat, to pay rent too... you can't expect to get all for free and for a cheap price on top of that. You can decide it's too expensive for you and ok, just don't buy it. But if you buy this game just to complain that it will be probably too much money for you to afford the new DLCs in the future, then you lost me on this one. Think about it before buying because tons of review warns players about this fact. It's nothing new and if you dont like their business model, just don't buy the game. That's it! UPDATE: I was incredibly surprised by this announcement!  They decided, for free, to spend few weeks to rescale all 3 states to have the same scale as ETS2. Wow, just WOW. People have no reasons to complain anymore. They do ask us or money someone but they also know to work without asking more from us. They are damn fair. I cannot consider they are abusing and overpricing anything. Well done SCS. I'm more willing to pay team ever before. Muuuuurica! : A matter of taste.. I prefer american trucks.. and north american landscapes too.. maybe be cause I live here... it feels more like home to me.. maybe.. ;)Cops : It's good to have cops on the road... it gives a reason behind those tickets you were getting randomly. This is the good part of the story, it's more realisitc. Bad part now? The fine is abusively high and you get fined every time you do a mistake. Like I got a fine because I did a ""stop"" but the game didnt registered it or something so I got a fine. I got a fine for high speed because I was driving downhill at 25mph instead of 15mph (it's hard to break with a full loaded truck in San Fransisco hills lol) and I got fined by an invisible cop... it sucks.. seriously.. it's good to have it but crap.. 1000$ for every mistake and being fined every time you are not perfectly fiting in the square... they could be a bit more nice on this one. Some people said you can turn off fine. I don't agree. I'll try harder to watch speed and do stop as close as what I think the game expect from me... and hope I'll lose less cash in future. LOLHigher amount of car models: They really improved that. You'll see more different cars on the road, small trucks like UPS, Fedex, school bus... no really, way more enjoyable to drive with this higher variety of cars on the roads!Lower amount of truck models: Only 2 models for now... but... they are awaiting authorizations to unlock all models that are ready. They said we would not pay for this, we just need to wait. So for those who are not patient enough and think 2 truck models is not enough, don't purchase now. Just wait a bit longer they got all legal stuff ok so they can add more models (cuz they have already tons of models ready).UPDATE: another truck added. They have several models close to be finished by have to wait for truck companies to approve them. :)Wolrd of trucks UPDATE: Finally here and we had a Christmas event through it again. Thanks SCS :)ConclusionOverall, it's another upgrade of the SCS trucking simulator engine. Is it worth the price? Well if you are a fan of that kind of games, I think it worths it. I paid my 28$CA on release day and I dont regret it. I love ATS way more than ETS2. Sure, devs will have to work to improve and fix many things, but I have trust in them. I know I will get enough stuff for my money. And I know that in the future, they could release map expansions as paid DLC. It is something to consider when you buy it. You know it'll work like this so if you buy, keep it in mind and don't complain they are greedy dlcs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They aren't. This is a big project, you have the choice to be an ""investor"" or not. Personnally, I chose to be one because I like this game, I like the work they do and I want to give them the tools to lead this project to another success.If you decide to join SCS in this epic journey, then I wish you countless hours of happy trucking.

												Now that the American Truck Simulator has been expanded somewhat I feel I can give it a more comprehensive review. The game has stunning views and graphics especially during sunrise and sunset as the light plays across the American landscape. At the current price I recommend picking up the game even though it is incomplete there is more content coming from the developers and they are rescaling the game which should help in the areas where roads feel too tight and small scale for an 18 wheeler to properly drive down. I do wish there were more trucks to select from but the community is pretty great at filling any modders needs. The map also could be bigger but as said at the current price it's appropriate although unfinished. The other thing I wish there was an option for rest and trip planning, whats the purpose of having a cab with sleeper if you can only sleep in designated parking places?. These minor complaints and by far I have spent hours growing my company and managing finances, and most of all rollin' coal on the open roads.			"

												I really do like this game. It is quite a lot like ETS 2 but that doesn't mean its not worth it. The game has much more detail and driving in America is really nice. The trucks are obviously really good because it's SCS were talking about. There are no speed cameras so they added police. The police fine you alot, $900 dollars for speeding? But apart from that I still think this is a great game and I recommend it.			"

												I enjoyed the entire game. Very realistic. However, was greatly disappointed that there is only the 3 states to run in! After so long, one gets tired of the same old highways and towns and was hoping that the entire would be available. Also, it seems that most of the docks were rather let's say small for a large truck. I know it's for the challenge, but as a professional driver, not all places are that difficult to park :) Anyway, it's a great game, just give us more states to run!! PLEASE!!!			"

												Amazing game, Very impressed with the graphics happy to know that the whole U.S will be out at the end. Very fun game to play if you like trucks. Very fluent when using a steering wheel to drive it. Has some easter eggs (Truck Racing) that can be found!!! Love this game and deffinitly recommend it to those who like simulators like me. I have not seen a better simulator on trucks in America then this. Hope to see you excel developers!

												First things first, I personally enjoy this game and will continue to enjoy this game. Something about being alone with the open road, taking jobs across long distances and sightseeing really relaxes me.So let's get into the game!Profile Creation:It's simple, it's quick, there's not a lot of messing around with it. Give you driver a name, choose a picture from hundres both male & female, Pick a logo and name your company and that's pretty much it.Playing the game:So you've made your profile and are ready to get going. You're going to have to take jobs from the job list as you don't have your own truck yet, meaning you're driving somebody else's truck and taking cargo from point A to point B. Once you get your own truck, you'll be taking jobs from the freight market and picking them up yourself and you will earn a bit more for it. There's a bit of a grind and messing with skills but you'll get there eventually.Vehicles:At the time of this review, there are only 4 different types of trucks to purchase: The Kenworth T680, Kenworth W900, Peterbilt 579 and the Peterbilt 389. Though there are only 4 trucks, the customization on them is fairly good, but parts are locked and you have to unlock them with ranking up.Skills & Ranking:Every job you complete, you gain experience and money. The experience goes towards a level progress bar and new parts and paints will unlock as you level higher into the game. Every level you progress through will give you a point to use in skills, which can be used for Long Distance Cargo, Fragile Cargo, On Time Delivery, High Value Cargo, Dangerous Cargo(ie: flammable, corrosive or explosive) and Fuel Economy. Driving & Parking:Driving with a trailer can be difficult, parking one can be even harder. That's why SCS put in an option to choose between skilled and simple, or if you're truly lazy, skip it entirely(You will lose the added bonus for parking the trailer yourself though)! During your drives, you'll probably find yourself breaking a few laws like Speed Offenses, Traffic Light Offenses, Collision Offenses, Wrong Way Offenses and a few others.Overall Pros and ConsPros-Accurate vehicle recreation-Accurate Simulation-Good amount of customization-Lots of roads to travel and places to goCons-AI Traffic can bug out and create traffic jams(that's really all I can think of)First in depth review I've done of a game so hopefully it wasn't too bad. I hope it helped!			"

												American Truck Simulator (ATS)This game is a 'must have' for any simulator lover. Forget the 'boring driving sim' attitude of some reviewers as they simply don't get it and seem to compare these games with the action games that they’re used too.The game:Firstly, I must admit that I was very sceptical about this game when I first watched videos and read reviews because the scale was wrong and the game was released with only ONE truck manufacturer and TWO states of America. Simply put, it was not worth the money as a stand- alone game and instead should’ve been a Kickstarter campaign where we all acknowledge that ‘we’ are the backers and testers.But that has changed with the introduction of a third state, and another truck brand (still not enough but much better – and free). But the grand change of the entire game was a recent complete rescale and road fix update that has now opened the gates for constant updating of the game world, including the new states to be added. This was SCS’s plan all along as they could not add more states without this rescale. Also, I must add that this new scaling changed everything, with the time taken on a job tripled in some cases.Graphics:The graphics in general are stunning, with animations everywhere. I particularly like the crop dusters and Raptor jet flyovers, also there are some interesting places like a trailer park dispute with builders, complete with professional ‘hired’ protesters and that crazy dancing guy on a roof. The roads are beautifully textured as well as the fencing, barriers, signage and all bridge structures. The new scale brought with it, much richer textured terrain, and distant objects – the Grand Canyon is stunning.Physics: Are better than anything I have played before in a driving simulator (same as ETS2), although there are some ‘quirks’ here and there but not worth any complaints – watch out for traffic and I am damn sure that they are programmed to be bad divers (pulling out in front of your very heavy rig, or running stop signs ETC). The tyres need to wear out faster as they become ‘nasty’ after 50% and you will lose grip, unfortunately they get repaired with the rest of the truck in service, I think they should have different repairs and effect the game much more. Also the cabs need to move and bounce around, there are mods for this though but the dev’s should fix it.Content: As stated previously, the scale was a big issue and turned many players away, or just kept them glued to European Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) for their main driving game. I won’t go into details about the scale and what was involved (that’s been covered by others in much detail) but I can say that they matched ATS with ETS2 with the amount of actual driving you need to do to arrive at your destination and that was a game changer. Now you must ‘count your gallons’ and watch your driver for signs of fatigue and more than once per trip. Everything else seems to be perfect for my driving style and simulator gameplay. I now wait for the rest of the USA and more trucks. There are more than 1000 mods available and in only one year, plus double that in paint jobs. Many are top quality and worth a try but remember to back up your game save folder, and regularly! Some mods can corrupt your save when removed and that can be painful.Gripes:The damage model for the trailer is way too much of a penalty since rubbing on a curb can cause over $1000 penalty and that needs to change. ETS2 has a nice no-damage mod for your trailer – which works for me as I still pay big money for damage to the rig, so I’m hoping that gets ported over to ATS asap. I also think that people should cause massive damage to your rig when hit, maybe even a fine for endangering life ETC.The game has many mod trucks and many are free, as they should ALL be – I recommend the Volvo VNL670 by Arradeth and try out the triple rear axle option. My best advice for anyone that likes to use mods that are ‘pay-ware’ is to firstly check to see if they are legal and registered mods like all pay-ware must be – EG. With full permission from the manufacturer. If they are not, then just look for those mods for FREE on many sites that also agree with my views about content rules. Pay-ware mods ‘pee’ me off if they are not properly registered and approved. And for those raised eyebrows, I have hundreds of dollars’ worth of pay-ware content that is officially endorsed.Which leads me to my last ‘gripe’ The lack of trucks because of licensing agreements or the lack there of. See my statement above about why I am so angry with some people and the profits they’re making while the game dev’s struggle to get more ‘legal’ content! But I’m sure they will move the ball along faster now that the main reason for the stalling is now sorted (rescale).Conclusion:Go out and buy this game, just do it. For the price, it sits nicely with any other mid-range game and you get a game that can last for years. After buying it, you get free updates to the game world and can try all sorts of community mods to enhance the game play. Remember that there are many negative reviews because they have not been retracted since the rescale released just before Xmas 2016 and probably never will be deleted as many critics tend to like reading their own rants.Enjoy this game for what it is, a simulator. And don’t forget that you will enjoy it better with a steering wheel, I chose the Logitech G920 plus 6 gate shifter and it changed up the game playing style 10 fold.Cheers,Aussie Lee			"

												This is exactly what I always wanted to do in GTA.  Did you every get that feeling when playing GTA and you just want to obey the traffic laws?  Well that's what this game does.  It might become a little boring driving on the highway with just a controller but I'm sure if you have a steering wheel, the game will be that much better.  There are plenty of cool little features including streaming a real life radio station and adding your own music to the game.  It's the details that count! Oh and by the way, this game looks great too!  Highly recoommend to anyone who just wants to sit back and relax.			"

												ATS is very good truck simulator (the best one). Yeah need uptade in map because maybe in 30 hours I complete 100% mapa. California - Arizona - Nevada, no more? and New York - New Jersey - Texas - Florida - Alaska (snow) - Colorado (...) EDIT: Canada - Mexico - Hawaii. No big map unfortunately. ETS2 have complete best map.Hey put your favorite radio station and enjoy to drive.ATS é um bom simulador de caminhão (dos melhores). Sim precisa de uma atualização pois seu mapa não é muito grande. Só três estados para explorar tem o game no momento. Acredito que em 30 horas da para fazer os 100% do mapa. Só tem os estados da Califórnia - Arizona e Nevada (só tem deserto kkkk) Poderiam adicionar por exemplo os estados de: Nova Iorque - Nova Jersey - Texas - Flórida - Alaska (neve) - Colorado e muito mais.. EDITADO: poderiam acrescentar Canadá - México - Havaí. Por enquanto (acho) o mapa  não é tão completo como o ETS2 infelizmente.Ei o jogo é massa aproveita ele coloca sua estação de rádio preferida e tenha uma ótima viagem.			"

												I already liked this game a lot (slightly more than Euro Truck Simulator 2, though they're largely the same), but was giving it a bit of a break, waiting for more states to arrive. But then on Black Friday, I upgraded to a force-feedback wheel (the Thrustmaster T150, which I recommend highly), and it was a huge boost to this game. On top of that, now they've changed the scale of the game to make things much larger, and it's wonderful.If you're looking for a relaxing driving game, this is probably the best out there right now. I highly recommend not just a FF wheel, but also TrackIR, and Eyefinity if you can. TrackIR is more important in this game than most driving games, because you'll be checking your mirrors quite a bit.			"

												So, as a follower of pretty much all of SCS' games, I've pretty much owned all of their games. And I have to say, this game is awesome! So let's go over somethings. First, if you don't like Euro Truck Simulator 2, don't buy this. The GUI's are the exact same and ther only real difference is that this is American. Another thing, if you are impatient and cant do nothing for ten minutes while moving cargo, don't buy this. So, let's get into performance. I own top of the line gaming computers and they have no trouble playing this with every graphics option on high. I own multiple AMD AND NVIDIA gaming computers and they both work perfectly. So AMD Users, don't be afraid. If you have a computer that might not be a gaming computer, I personally don't think I would take the risk. However, you can always get a refund. The graphics (If turned up) are really amazing. And one thing that will make you really impressed is the hills. If you have a solid FPS and I do, going over hills at the same time while turning looks truly amazing. It demonstrates the physics of the game and how much their games have improved. -Pros --Great graphics--Great physics --Realistic--Does not get boring for me--Trucks are awesome--The ability to use pedals,steering wheel, clutch, etc.-Cons--I think that the whole ""Damage"" thing could be better. For example, I think that car accidents could be taken to another level. If a car pulls out in front of me and I hit it and it ruins my load and I don't get paid and then have to pay for my truck, I don't believe that is fair. --Speed limits should be a little less strictHOWEVER, this is beta and for what they have right now, the game is amazing and I definitely would recommend this.

												A great game. It takes all the pros of ETS 2, like the great physics and realism, and packs them into an American Environment. It even fixes one major con in ETS 2, the detail in the scenery. I own both games, and can definitely say that the detail is miles ahead (pun intended) of its European counterpart. If you like ETS 2, this is a definite buyand my comment to those who say that ATS is a copy of ETS 2, it isn't. Only the UI is the same, and I have a question for them. ""Why change something that's already good?"" In my opinion, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"", and that's definitely the approach that SCS Software took towards American Truck Simulator, and it seems to have worked. Being critical towards the game, I dislike the fact that till now, there are only three trucks, and the map is still quite relatively small. However, the developers have said that they will expand the map and add more trucks as time goes by. In fact, they have a free Arizona DLC on the way, which should expand the map quite a bit. Overall, I definitely recommend this game.			"

												This is one of best if not the best Trucking simulator game I've ever played. Although at the time of writing this review there are only 4 models of trucks, but they are very well reproduced. Moreover basic map available in the game is now rescaled which means that now travel from one end to the second takes more then 2 hours. Along the way you can visit cities with their known places, cross deserts and sunny coast of California. This game can be very easy modified through integration with the Steam workshop, what helps if you are a person who is easily bored.If you still don't know whether you want to buy it, just try the free demo.

A friend of mine in Australia got me started on this (and ETS2 by the same company), and I was so hooked that I bought a decent game wheel and pedal set.  This game (and ETS2) are the only driving games I would recommend to my friends that want to drive anything other than racing cars.			"

												Why did i get this game???Well.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!Honestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xDMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.Honest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!Recommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one. (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this one, Because Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than US, So you might get tickets for some things you don't know lol..

												I seriously and highly recommend this simulator to anyone who loves to drive. Graphics are awesome. Game play is quite customizable.  It's fully Modable. (There are already literaly thousands of mods available.) And, at the price they're asking, you really aren't going to find another trucking simulator, (with the exception of ETS2), that will even come close to this. I tend to avoid workshop mods due to the fact that they update while you're in game, and freeze the game. There are a few modding sites that are better, so far, and I hope that SCS corrects the problems with workshop mods, soon. They are more convenient, and, if the problem of them updating while you're in game is addressed, may even become a much better source of mods, eventually. Through mods, you have the ability to drive coast to coast, (with the exception of Hawaii, not, as yet, covered), through Canada, and even down into Baja California. (Mexico) True that the terrain graphics leave a lot to be desired, but, they are only mods, and modders seem to lack the resources to fully do the graphics up to the same quality as SCS does. I have about 6,400 hours on ETS2, and bought this game the day it was released. With nearly 1,400 hours on this ""game"", (since it's release), it should be obvious that it has overshadowed ETS2 as my favorite ""game"". (I think I've opened ETS2 twice since purchasing ATS). With future updates, and possible rescaling of the maps, this game will become a force to be reconned with, on the ""driving/trucking sim"" front. I hope I've been of some help here, in your decision as to whether or not to purchase this title. :) (Not to be rude, but, if you're going to write a review of a game, simulator, or program, you should at least have used it for a lengthy time. I see a lot of people that write reviews with 6 or 7 hours on a program. You've barely scratched the surface, and you seem to think that you know what the program is about. Personally, I wouldn't even think about writing a review before having a minimum of 500 hours on it. Just saying.)			"

It might become a little boring driving on the highway with just a controller but I'm sure if you have a steering wheel, the game will be that much better.

												American Truck Simulator (ATS)This game is a 'must have' for any simulator lover. Forget the 'boring driving sim' attitude of some reviewers as they simply don't get it and seem to compare these games with the action games that they’re used too.The game:Firstly, I must admit that I was very sceptical about this game when I first watched videos and read reviews because the scale was wrong and the game was released with only ONE truck manufacturer and TWO states of America. Simply put, it was not worth the money as a stand- alone game and instead should’ve been a Kickstarter campaign where we all acknowledge that ‘we’ are the backers and testers.But that has changed with the introduction of a third state, and another truck brand (still not enough but much better – and free). But the grand change of the entire game was a recent complete rescale and road fix update that has now opened the gates for constant updating of the game world, including the new states to be added. This was SCS’s plan all along as they could not add more states without this rescale. Also, I must add that this new scaling changed everything, with the time taken on a job tripled in some cases.Graphics:The graphics in general are stunning, with animations everywhere. I particularly like the crop dusters and Raptor jet flyovers, also there are some interesting places like a trailer park dispute with builders, complete with professional ‘hired’ protesters and that crazy dancing guy on a roof. The roads are beautifully textured as well as the fencing, barriers, signage and all bridge structures. The new scale brought with it, much richer textured terrain, and distant objects – the Grand Canyon is stunning.Physics: Are better than anything I have played before in a driving simulator (same as ETS2), although there are some ‘quirks’ here and there but not worth any complaints – watch out for traffic and I am damn sure that they are programmed to be bad divers (pulling out in front of your very heavy rig, or running stop signs ETC). The tyres need to wear out faster as they become ‘nasty’ after 50% and you will lose grip, unfortunately they get repaired with the rest of the truck in service, I think they should have different repairs and effect the game much more. Also the cabs need to move and bounce around, there are mods for this though but the dev’s should fix it.Content: As stated previously, the scale was a big issue and turned many players away, or just kept them glued to European Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) for their main driving game. I won’t go into details about the scale and what was involved (that’s been covered by others in much detail) but I can say that they matched ATS with ETS2 with the amount of actual driving you need to do to arrive at your destination and that was a game changer. Now you must ‘count your gallons’ and watch your driver for signs of fatigue and more than once per trip. Everything else seems to be perfect for my driving style and simulator gameplay. I now wait for the rest of the USA and more trucks. There are more than 1000 mods available and in only one year, plus double that in paint jobs. Many are top quality and worth a try but remember to back up your game save folder, and regularly! Some mods can corrupt your save when removed and that can be painful.Gripes:The damage model for the trailer is way too much of a penalty since rubbing on a curb can cause over $1000 penalty and that needs to change. ETS2 has a nice no-damage mod for your trailer – which works for me as I still pay big money for damage to the rig, so I’m hoping that gets ported over to ATS asap. I also think that people should cause massive damage to your rig when hit, maybe even a fine for endangering life ETC.The game has many mod trucks and many are free, as they should ALL be – I recommend the Volvo VNL670 by Arradeth and try out the triple rear axle option. My best advice for anyone that likes to use mods that are ‘pay-ware’ is to firstly check to see if they are legal and registered mods like all pay-ware must be – EG. With full permission from the manufacturer. If they are not, then just look for those mods for FREE on many sites that also agree with my views about content rules. Pay-ware mods ‘pee’ me off if they are not properly registered and approved. And for those raised eyebrows, I have hundreds of dollars’ worth of pay-ware content that is officially endorsed.Which leads me to my last ‘gripe’ The lack of trucks because of licensing agreements or the lack there of. See my statement above about why I am so angry with some people and the profits they’re making while the game dev’s struggle to get more ‘legal’ content! But I’m sure they will move the ball along faster now that the main reason for the stalling is now sorted (rescale).Conclusion:Go out and buy this game, just do it. For the price, it sits nicely with any other mid-range game and you get a game that can last for years. After buying it, you get free updates to the game world and can try all sorts of community mods to enhance the game play. Remember that there are many negative reviews because they have not been retracted since the rescale released just before Xmas 2016 and probably never will be deleted as many critics tend to like reading their own rants.Enjoy this game for what it is, a simulator. And don’t forget that you will enjoy it better with a steering wheel, I chose the Logitech G920 plus 6 gate shifter and it changed up the game playing style 10 fold.Cheers,Aussie Lee			"

												As a fan of simulation games, ATS really brought the fun of driving a truck into reality! I've spent countless hours getting all the achievements and discovering 100% of the map. In the end though, I did it! One thing though, the constant truck driving is REALLY boring after a while. You can fix that problem though by buying your own truck and go on sightseeing! Also, you can go to the Steam workshop for this and download a few mods, one such mod being no damage, and another being advanced transmissions! So I can drive around going 163mph and not get damaged! This game is truly worth your buck though, that is though if you make the best out of it! I can't wait until the next one! Maybe it will be Canadian Truck Simulator, or Asian Truck Simulator! We can only guess the possiblities!                          12 out of 10, one of the best games I've ever played!			"

												A nice relaxing game if you want to chill, and it is very easy to play even if you do not have a lot of ""sim game"" experience. Suggest using some sort of analog controls like an xbox controller, but have a mouse an kb close by as the interface is not 100% compatible with just a controller. For example, some menus require you moving a mouse cursor with the controller if you do not have a mouse handy.  Only real gripe is the AA; the only choice is ""MLAA"".  It's awful as far as smoothing goes. I'm running it at 4434 x 2494 DSR on a 2560x1440 panel (still 60fps on gtx 1080 at max settings) and I can still see modest jaggies. Not a deal breaker, but more advanced AA options would be nice.			"

												I enjoyed the entire game. Very realistic. However, was greatly disappointed that there is only the 3 states to run in! After so long, one gets tired of the same old highways and towns and was hoping that the entire would be available. Also, it seems that most of the docks were rather let's say small for a large truck. I know it's for the challenge, but as a professional driver, not all places are that difficult to park :) Anyway, it's a great game, just give us more states to run!! PLEASE!!!			"

												First things first, I personally enjoy this game and will continue to enjoy this game. Something about being alone with the open road, taking jobs across long distances and sightseeing really relaxes me.So let's get into the game!Profile Creation:It's simple, it's quick, there's not a lot of messing around with it. Give you driver a name, choose a picture from hundres both male & female, Pick a logo and name your company and that's pretty much it.Playing the game:So you've made your profile and are ready to get going. You're going to have to take jobs from the job list as you don't have your own truck yet, meaning you're driving somebody else's truck and taking cargo from point A to point B. Once you get your own truck, you'll be taking jobs from the freight market and picking them up yourself and you will earn a bit more for it. There's a bit of a grind and messing with skills but you'll get there eventually.Vehicles:At the time of this review, there are only 4 different types of trucks to purchase: The Kenworth T680, Kenworth W900, Peterbilt 579 and the Peterbilt 389. Though there are only 4 trucks, the customization on them is fairly good, but parts are locked and you have to unlock them with ranking up.Skills & Ranking:Every job you complete, you gain experience and money. The experience goes towards a level progress bar and new parts and paints will unlock as you level higher into the game. Every level you progress through will give you a point to use in skills, which can be used for Long Distance Cargo, Fragile Cargo, On Time Delivery, High Value Cargo, Dangerous Cargo(ie: flammable, corrosive or explosive) and Fuel Economy. Driving & Parking:Driving with a trailer can be difficult, parking one can be even harder. That's why SCS put in an option to choose between skilled and simple, or if you're truly lazy, skip it entirely(You will lose the added bonus for parking the trailer yourself though)! During your drives, you'll probably find yourself breaking a few laws like Speed Offenses, Traffic Light Offenses, Collision Offenses, Wrong Way Offenses and a few others.Overall Pros and ConsPros-Accurate vehicle recreation-Accurate Simulation-Good amount of customization-Lots of roads to travel and places to goCons-AI Traffic can bug out and create traffic jams(that's really all I can think of)First in depth review I've done of a game so hopefully it wasn't too bad. I hope it helped!			"

												First things first, I personally enjoy this game and will continue to enjoy this game. Something about being alone with the open road, taking jobs across long distances and sightseeing really relaxes me.So let's get into the game!Profile Creation:It's simple, it's quick, there's not a lot of messing around with it. Give you driver a name, choose a picture from hundres both male & female, Pick a logo and name your company and that's pretty much it.Playing the game:So you've made your profile and are ready to get going. You're going to have to take jobs from the job list as you don't have your own truck yet, meaning you're driving somebody else's truck and taking cargo from point A to point B. Once you get your own truck, you'll be taking jobs from the freight market and picking them up yourself and you will earn a bit more for it. There's a bit of a grind and messing with skills but you'll get there eventually.Vehicles:At the time of this review, there are only 4 different types of trucks to purchase: The Kenworth T680, Kenworth W900, Peterbilt 579 and the Peterbilt 389. Though there are only 4 trucks, the customization on them is fairly good, but parts are locked and you have to unlock them with ranking up.Skills & Ranking:Every job you complete, you gain experience and money. The experience goes towards a level progress bar and new parts and paints will unlock as you level higher into the game. Every level you progress through will give you a point to use in skills, which can be used for Long Distance Cargo, Fragile Cargo, On Time Delivery, High Value Cargo, Dangerous Cargo(ie: flammable, corrosive or explosive) and Fuel Economy. Driving & Parking:Driving with a trailer can be difficult, parking one can be even harder. That's why SCS put in an option to choose between skilled and simple, or if you're truly lazy, skip it entirely(You will lose the added bonus for parking the trailer yourself though)! During your drives, you'll probably find yourself breaking a few laws like Speed Offenses, Traffic Light Offenses, Collision Offenses, Wrong Way Offenses and a few others.Overall Pros and ConsPros-Accurate vehicle recreation-Accurate Simulation-Good amount of customization-Lots of roads to travel and places to goCons-AI Traffic can bug out and create traffic jams(that's really all I can think of)First in depth review I've done of a game so hopefully it wasn't too bad. I hope it helped!			"

												American Truck Simulator (ATS)This game is a 'must have' for any simulator lover. Forget the 'boring driving sim' attitude of some reviewers as they simply don't get it and seem to compare these games with the action games that they’re used too.The game:Firstly, I must admit that I was very sceptical about this game when I first watched videos and read reviews because the scale was wrong and the game was released with only ONE truck manufacturer and TWO states of America. Simply put, it was not worth the money as a stand- alone game and instead should’ve been a Kickstarter campaign where we all acknowledge that ‘we’ are the backers and testers.But that has changed with the introduction of a third state, and another truck brand (still not enough but much better – and free). But the grand change of the entire game was a recent complete rescale and road fix update that has now opened the gates for constant updating of the game world, including the new states to be added. This was SCS’s plan all along as they could not add more states without this rescale. Also, I must add that this new scaling changed everything, with the time taken on a job tripled in some cases.Graphics:The graphics in general are stunning, with animations everywhere. I particularly like the crop dusters and Raptor jet flyovers, also there are some interesting places like a trailer park dispute with builders, complete with professional ‘hired’ protesters and that crazy dancing guy on a roof. The roads are beautifully textured as well as the fencing, barriers, signage and all bridge structures. The new scale brought with it, much richer textured terrain, and distant objects – the Grand Canyon is stunning.Physics: Are better than anything I have played before in a driving simulator (same as ETS2), although there are some ‘quirks’ here and there but not worth any complaints – watch out for traffic and I am damn sure that they are programmed to be bad divers (pulling out in front of your very heavy rig, or running stop signs ETC). The tyres need to wear out faster as they become ‘nasty’ after 50% and you will lose grip, unfortunately they get repaired with the rest of the truck in service, I think they should have different repairs and effect the game much more. Also the cabs need to move and bounce around, there are mods for this though but the dev’s should fix it.Content: As stated previously, the scale was a big issue and turned many players away, or just kept them glued to European Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) for their main driving game. I won’t go into details about the scale and what was involved (that’s been covered by others in much detail) but I can say that they matched ATS with ETS2 with the amount of actual driving you need to do to arrive at your destination and that was a game changer. Now you must ‘count your gallons’ and watch your driver for signs of fatigue and more than once per trip. Everything else seems to be perfect for my driving style and simulator gameplay. I now wait for the rest of the USA and more trucks. There are more than 1000 mods available and in only one year, plus double that in paint jobs. Many are top quality and worth a try but remember to back up your game save folder, and regularly! Some mods can corrupt your save when removed and that can be painful.Gripes:The damage model for the trailer is way too much of a penalty since rubbing on a curb can cause over $1000 penalty and that needs to change. ETS2 has a nice no-damage mod for your trailer – which works for me as I still pay big money for damage to the rig, so I’m hoping that gets ported over to ATS asap. I also think that people should cause massive damage to your rig when hit, maybe even a fine for endangering life ETC.The game has many mod trucks and many are free, as they should ALL be – I recommend the Volvo VNL670 by Arradeth and try out the triple rear axle option. My best advice for anyone that likes to use mods that are ‘pay-ware’ is to firstly check to see if they are legal and registered mods like all pay-ware must be – EG. With full permission from the manufacturer. If they are not, then just look for those mods for FREE on many sites that also agree with my views about content rules. Pay-ware mods ‘pee’ me off if they are not properly registered and approved. And for those raised eyebrows, I have hundreds of dollars’ worth of pay-ware content that is officially endorsed.Which leads me to my last ‘gripe’ The lack of trucks because of licensing agreements or the lack there of. See my statement above about why I am so angry with some people and the profits they’re making while the game dev’s struggle to get more ‘legal’ content! But I’m sure they will move the ball along faster now that the main reason for the stalling is now sorted (rescale).Conclusion:Go out and buy this game, just do it. For the price, it sits nicely with any other mid-range game and you get a game that can last for years. After buying it, you get free updates to the game world and can try all sorts of community mods to enhance the game play. Remember that there are many negative reviews because they have not been retracted since the rescale released just before Xmas 2016 and probably never will be deleted as many critics tend to like reading their own rants.Enjoy this game for what it is, a simulator. And don’t forget that you will enjoy it better with a steering wheel, I chose the Logitech G920 plus 6 gate shifter and it changed up the game playing style 10 fold.Cheers,Aussie Lee			"

												If you liked Euro Truck Simulator 2, this is basically a better version only set in the USA. As of writing this review, there is only 3 sizable states, with one to be added relatively soon. The detail of the cities has been severely increased. Its still not life like but its better than a couple of streets like in ETS2.I am enjoying my time with this game even though I find there to be a lack in different types of trucks to pick from. I have over 300 hours in ETS2, compared to ATS's pitiful 23 hours, this is simply because I am not from the US and I guess I don't get the same enjoyment as driving around in my own countries and neibouring countires. But don't let me disuade you, this is a great game with a bunch of content for the price, like I said in my ETS2 review. Launch up a good podcast and enjoy the road ahead. 9/10			"

It can be played with keyboard/mouse, gamepad, or steering wheel setup. It also offers fully customizable key mapping also.Certainly a fun and relaxing game and easy to lose track of time while playing.			"

												Not just a great sim, but a great game too. The sounds are miles ahead of the old SCS games in America which is the biggest selling point for me besides the obvious graphics and interface. If it wasn't for a pretty severe lack of content, most notably trucks, i would recommend this game all day long. For the price its hard to find something better if you dont want Euro, im just assuming that though since I've never played a Euro truck sim. I'm genuinely excited to start playing it again and it sucks up hours upon hours seemingly without effort. There will be plenty more hours put into this game before I'm done with it. Overall, 4/5Could be 5/5 as long as the devs stick with itKind of seems like they relied on the community doing most of their work for them through the workshop, hoping that wasn't the case or they got the message that people aren't ok with that option.

												I guess it's time for my review!Stability / Polishing / Performance:The game is not crazily polished, but it works well and has no major bugs as far as I was able to tell.It's performance is compared to other games rather underwhelming, but it should work on most systems.Graphics:The graphics aren't all that great.The texture resolution is good, the overall quality of the textures is also fine.But when it comes to complex lighting effects the game doesn't necessarily match today's industry standards.However it doesn't look ""ugly"".Gameplay:The game is very detailed when it comes to the controls.The physics aren't so bad given it's not aiming for damage models or any fancy stuff.It shows it's muscles when it comes to simulating a lively AI driven traffic world.Eventhough the AI sometimes acts outrageously stupid, there are few games one could compare this game with, but I'd dare to say the AI here is still the smartest, given that (nearly) no other game tries to accurately simulate normal every-day traffic! (even GTA with a much higher budget has NPCs blowing each other up just by accident - this doen't happen here)The game also has a little background simulation going on for the player's company, which I'd like to recommend to focus on in later titles, since it shows some potential in my opinion.Models / Game World:The truck models are very detailed and look nicely, if you don't look too closely at the big headlights you can mount at the bumper and the roof of your truck (those have just a plain texture).The AI cars don't look too shabby either.The game world itself is a little lack-luster.Eventhough they made great improvements compared to the previous title, it's still partially in medieval-ages of game development with sprite-based distant flora and some simplistic general design.Cities don't consist of much more than a few steets.However I believe the game has something to it.You could consider it to be one of those ""zen"" games that you can just use to relax while playing.It has a progress system, a (downloadable) multiplayer and steam workshop support, which already addresses a whole bunch of the previous critique and if you feel adventurous, you should look around on the internet, there are plenty more other mods that address even more things of the game - I believe there's even one or two complete game world replacers   and add-ons out there.

												American Truck Simulator is a great game! But I think SCS should have sold ATS as a DLC extension for Euro Truck Simulator 2, instead of making this a standalone game. For those of us who enjoy driving simulators, this is an amazing game. But for casual gamers, you may be better off buying ETS2, since it offers more content at a cheaper price—especially on sale. The map mods are also higher quality on ETS2. However, both games are excellent.			"

												I seriously and highly recommend this simulator to anyone who loves to drive. Graphics are awesome. Game play is quite customizable.  It's fully Modable. (There are already literaly thousands of mods available.) And, at the price they're asking, you really aren't going to find another trucking simulator, (with the exception of ETS2), that will even come close to this. I tend to avoid workshop mods due to the fact that they update while you're in game, and freeze the game. There are a few modding sites that are better, so far, and I hope that SCS corrects the problems with workshop mods, soon. They are more convenient, and, if the problem of them updating while you're in game is addressed, may even become a much better source of mods, eventually. Through mods, you have the ability to drive coast to coast, (with the exception of Hawaii, not, as yet, covered), through Canada, and even down into Baja California. (Mexico) True that the terrain graphics leave a lot to be desired, but, they are only mods, and modders seem to lack the resources to fully do the graphics up to the same quality as SCS does. I have about 6,400 hours on ETS2, and bought this game the day it was released. With nearly 1,400 hours on this ""game"", (since it's release), it should be obvious that it has overshadowed ETS2 as my favorite ""game"". (I think I've opened ETS2 twice since purchasing ATS). With future updates, and possible rescaling of the maps, this game will become a force to be reconned with, on the ""driving/trucking sim"" front. I hope I've been of some help here, in your decision as to whether or not to purchase this title. :) (Not to be rude, but, if you're going to write a review of a game, simulator, or program, you should at least have used it for a lengthy time. I see a lot of people that write reviews with 6 or 7 hours on a program. You've barely scratched the surface, and you seem to think that you know what the program is about. Personally, I wouldn't even think about writing a review before having a minimum of 500 hours on it. Just saying.)			"

												For some odd reason this game is theraputic and enjoyable. As a longtime gamer I've played fps, open worlds, and rpg's. Never thought driving from point A to point B would be addicting and fun. Can't explain it, but can recommend it.			"

												One of the achievements is ""I think I like it""...well...yes...you could say I do. One of my duty stations was Base Consolidated Telecommunications (BCT) at Naval Air Station Fallon NV in the mid/late 80's. It is where 50 and 95 meet. In the game it's a gas station. Love driving in NV and seeing fighter jets going across the sky. I keep trucking there I'm gonna end up going back in Real Life. Thank you SCS for bringing back some great memories.			"

												ATS needs more states, Engines, Transmissions, In game Mods for the trucks, More Loads, and the weights need to be more realistIc, More trucks (MACK, Freightliner, Volvo,) The ability to have larger fuel tanks without having to extend the Frame, Offroad Driving where locking the Diff is actually useful, Heaving Hauling, Larger Hills and Mountains, You should be able to Own Trailers. More States, More Trucks, After that focus on the little things and you will have a Amazing game. Right now, it's Ehh.Scale 1/10- 6 Maybe 7.			"

												As a fan of simulation games, ATS really brought the fun of driving a truck into reality! I've spent countless hours getting all the achievements and discovering 100% of the map. In the end though, I did it! One thing though, the constant truck driving is REALLY boring after a while. You can fix that problem though by buying your own truck and go on sightseeing! Also, you can go to the Steam workshop for this and download a few mods, one such mod being no damage, and another being advanced transmissions! So I can drive around going 163mph and not get damaged! This game is truly worth your buck though, that is though if you make the best out of it! I can't wait until the next one! Maybe it will be Canadian Truck Simulator, or Asian Truck Simulator! We can only guess the possiblities!                          12 out of 10, one of the best games I've ever played!			"

												It's fun for a bit. I wish I had a steering wheel to enjoy it more but it's fun to play if you just want to relax. The Multiplayer is all I really ever play it for. I don't enjoy the single player all that much but you can pretty much do all that in the MP as well.Edit: It's more fun to sit in traffic in this game than in real life. So if you like traffic, you will love this game.I recommend it. 7/10.			"

												I am going to go ahead and give this my recommendation, however this is with a bit of an asterisk Platform of the game has every bit of potential as ETS2, however it almost feels as if the game has started more ""gimped"" than ETS2 did, in regards to interesting locations to discover and landscape variety. Another issue is that there is very few trucks to choose from. And finally, multiplayer needs a lot more love from the community as it is a relative ghost town, this has made me go back to ETS2 for the moment. Relatively small gripes, since the rest of the gameplay is every bit as enjoyable as ETS2. And once more of the states and a significant amount of trucks are added (hopefully for free, since the amount we have now is unsatisfactory, thus game is not ready for much justified DLC) things should get a lot better. There is one challenge with getting people in America to play.... they need to aggressively advertise this game to people who are in the field of trucking. It's not going to be like ETS2 where even just general gamers were interesting. American crowd is much more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥in regards to getting them to play simulations. You need to take advantage of the niche crowd more. So hopefully ATS adapts to the new territory with their marketing strategies.***THIS GAME HAS MANY MORE POSITIVES THAN NEGATIVES, IT IS JUST A BIT UNDERWELMING RIGHT NOW***Finally I will say that I would still be playing ATS if the multiplayer crowd was larger, since I like having interaction while I truck. If this is not the kind of thing that will turn you off, then you can subtract that from the negatives.You definitely want to add this, if you are a fan of the series, as soon as financially possible.... since there is a strong chance of great things to come, if ETS2 is any indication. I would not want to be caught out when the game is improved without being able to play it when that day comes. I'll probably come back to this review in 6 to 12 months and update it. If a lot of content is added I will talk about that. If no or little content is added I will change to thumbs down. But these devs have never really let me down yet, so.... there's that. :)  Have a great new year.			"

												Pros-Realistic Highway numbers-Realistic speed limits-Fun-Same graphics engine at ETS2, so it is an easy transition.-Mods are part of Steam Workshop, so they are guaranteed virus-free.Cons-Same graphics engine as ETS2, so a bit disappointing.-Scaled WAY the f**k down, so it is not really a big map. Much smaller than ETS2. -Only Peterbuilt and Kenworth, and only 1 Peterbuilt truck. Limited options of 3 total trucks to choose from. -The cops are total Nazis, and totally unrealistic. 1 over is a 500 fine. WTFYes, the game is still in early stages. Yes, I expected more of a map. It is called American Truck Simulator, yet it only has 3 of the 50 states. A bit of a drawback. There will be updates, so there is that to look forward to. All in all, I would say it is a solid game and I would recommend it to anybody who likes ETS2.			"

												I have played all of the other SCS American based Truck Simulators. And I've been dying for something updated like this for quite some time.Glad it finally made it to Steam too. The mods are easier to find and install than the previous games were. And you get updates automatically from the developer instead of having to go to the website to download a patch.It does need more trucks; like Freightliner, Western Star, Caterpillar, Mack, and others. And not the ones that are from the workshop either. I'd like to see actual classics from the 70's to the 90's too.Even if you do or don't like trucks. This is a simulator that really does well and isn't some cheap rip off. I have my CDL and this helps me when I am not driving because here I can make mistakes that you can't in real life.I think this would also make a great VR game too.			"

												What has the gaming world come to when a Truck Simulator becomes fun?It sounds negative doesn't it? But that was my first thought when I saw this game.I played it, then I asked myself the same question.Well, it seems the gaming world is exactly where it needs to be. On the cutting edge of brilliant minds and pushing the limits of incredible technology!This game hooked me from the start. It's not just a bunch of poorly rendered boxes on wheels floating through an open-world, demolition derby scenario.I come at this game from two different points-of-view. I am a life-long artist and graphic designer, so visuals are very important to me in a game, but I also have my CDL and spent many years over-the-road in these trucks. After getting in a truck and driving a few blocks, the first thing I noticed was an incredibly detailed world around me! Turns out, this is what is actually keeping me coming back for more. All of the vehicles in-game look incredible, which is what I expected, it's a Truck Driving Simulation game after all! However, the world generated around me, positively blew me away!  I found myself going off the road a few times because I was trying to look over at some of the scenes happening out my window as I'm driving by!I won't go into any depth about the looks of the game, you just need to see it for yourself. Simply put, visually it's an incredible game and you'll have plenty to look at as the world goes by.The handling of the trucks seems to be truly accurate, with truck-specific mechanics, right down to the horrible turning radius of the W900! This is truly a simulator, I find myself driving the trucks in-game, the same way I would in real life!The AI drivers in-game are a little crazy, they randomly ruin your day in a hurry. Stopping on a 80 MPH freeway for no reason or turning right  smack into you at an intersection. I think this is just an AI system in need of  a few minor tweaks, but I found it actually adds to the realism of driving giant trucks around total idiots all day!Really the only con I have found in the game are the speeding penalties. There's not much room for error, if you are near a police officer when the speed limits lowers, you need to be at the correct speed before you pass that sign! I have paid about $20,000 in fines so far just from not seeing the speed limit change soon enough.The devs seem to be VERY involved in rolling out updates and fixes, and also appear regularly in the forums answering peoples questions and concerns. This is one of the most important details of a game for me, if the devs don't care, then why should I? They sure seem to care in this case.I would most certainly recommend this game to others. I can't get enough of it! My 12 year-old son was even quickly addicted to this game, after making fun of me for playing a ""Truck Simulator"" of course!  "

												My initial impression with the game so far is very positive. It might be *too* close to ETS2, but I see that in a good way. They kept all the good stuff from ETS2 and improved a bit on top of it and then fed back that to ETS2. I would totally recommend the purchase if you like ETS2, but I would tell you to lower the expectations of a ""new game"" altogether.The game has a lot of potential. The US of A is a great place to truck (as proven from 18WOS-Haulin' and the original 18WOS-PTTM) and you can start thinking on expanding to Canada and Mexico (Haulin' had both IIRC). California and Nevada are good places to start, but it feels like the game needs more and soon. And when the DLCs come forth, I hope they are like ETS2: a decent chunk of map and places for ~$5 USD. For me, Cali and Nevada are $5USD.In terms of mechanics, the game is basically the same as ETS2. I did not notice any differences in how the truck feels using the same settings (disabling helps, basically). I do appreciate the new ""select your parking"" and some are pretty darn hard, but they become repetitive. If they could implement something more ""random"" to each location, would be amazing. Also, I am expecting them to put the Online Job Offerings component in ATS soon as well. I found it really interesting in ETS2 and I have come to like it a lot.The only disappointment I have with the game, is graphics/art wise. I expected an improved map render, but it looks and feels the same as ETS2; they both feel dated as you see the images in front of you, but still keep being surpised with stunning landscapes and detailed locations with what the engine lets them do. Now that they have the game out and put a DLC or two, I hope their new north is improving the Simulation part first and Graphics component second. Bonus points to SCS for making it a native 64bit client as well!8.5/10!Update: 5th of April 2016After playing it for a long long time now (less than ETS2 though), and adding a few mods, the game improved quite a bit. The cops are still ruthless, ticketing left and right. The AI is still a bit dorky at times and there are a few things to still be improved, but I back up my original statement that this is a worthy buy. Just like wine, with time this game will just get better and better.Plus, I have been playing it with my G27 using the range H shifter and clutch. Just amazing.			"

												A game that I put in high regard with a experenced developer in the cab with many years of sucessful games of this genre. All I can say is buy this and you won't be dispointed and they constantly impoving this game all the time with new features, trucks, and maps. I know they are rescaling the map atm but I wish they added more trucks at least.			"

												Ok, the game is not bad, it's pretty good. I enjoy the ATS trucks a lot comparing to ETS but this game just like ETS2 has some very common issues.  Hopefully SCS can address these and hire some people who can write/script better.  I say the game is not bad but that's because I've invested a lot of hours into ETS2. I also have a review up for that game.Please fix the following.1) Resting for 10 hours? really? Who sleeps for 10 hours? Allow us to rest as many hours as we want please and wherever we want. What's the truck cabin for if not to rest?2) Allow purchasing trucks online right from the start3) Need better traffic AI in intersections especially. Many times I need to restart the game so the intersection is empty otherwise I'd be standing there for hours or I simply have to stick myself out into traffic like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and make them stop so I can enter.4) Better support for graphics. I run a brand new skylake build with a 980ti (2k res, 1 screen, 60fps) and I often get massive drops in FPS during weather or while in a city.I do recommend this game and I also love and recommend ETS2 but this game can be so much better if some minor tweaks were implemented to offer more realism for the player.

												For $20 bucks this game far exceeds any expectations. ATS provides a uniqe view into the world of a truck driver from just getting your CDL and driving loaner or company trucks to buying your first truck and becoming an Owner/ Operator. This game doesnt exactly scream excitement and if your coming from a FPS you may be initialy disapointed, but the steady hum of the diesel engine and the whine of the tires on the highway will suck you in, and if that doesnt do it for ya, take a cruise up high way 1 and take a look at the STUNNING scenery they've put into this game. The only addition I would like to see to this game would be to add buyable trailers so you can haul loads with your own truck and trailer and make more mola!!  18 WOS had this and Id really like to see it in this evolution.All that said if your into driving sims, or want to try it out and see if its in your interest I absolutly recommend this game as it is a fine example of quality content and involved developers.I strongly recomend using a decent quality racing wheel or at a minimum a game pad (I currently use an xbox one controller) to get the most out of this game.

												I had anticipated this title for some time .... just like many others in the community.I bought the game at the first opportunity to do so and was nicely surprised to see the game load into my steam account a day earlier than I expected.Now there is a case of the older sibling casting a shadow on the new family member and I feel ATS still has to come out from under the shadow ETS2 casts and stand on it's own two feet.That said, I won't sugar-coat my first impressions .... I was a bit deflated personally. I'd run 450 hrs+ in ETS2 and created over 260 YouTube videos .... I really enjoyed ETS2 and expected to take up from a similar position with ATS from the start. I found that ATS ticked the boxes well initially but seems to lack something that made it a 'standing on it's own feet' title. It really felt very much like an add-on to ETS2 to be honest. The thing is, it's not an addon ... and with a little more time and support from SCS which is already coming ... it'll surely mature into another AAA title for SCS. But it's not quite there yet for two main reasons ...1) The map currently is 3 states (actually 2 but Arizona is but a week or two away from release). I don't clearly understand what to expect for the remainder of USA and then what the plans may be for Canada and Mexico. 2) Truck makes and models. We've got Peterbilt and Kenworth today and no clear indications on the roadmap for all the other brands.On a positive note, SCS have upped the communication with the community. It was always best in class and in recent weeks, they seem to upped their standards again. Maybe I had too much in terms of expectation but I feel that community has generally communicated a similar message back to SCS based on the size of the map and range of trucks available.It's mid May 2016 as I write this review and I'm ~60 hrs into ATS.  All signs are pointing firmly towards 100's of hrs in this title.  I've enjoyed the Kenworth W900 truck I'm driving and I've explored a lot of the California and Nevada map that SCS opened with. Arizona will help immensely and I'm looking forward impatiently to being able to drive to the East coast.Now SCS have always been modder friendly and it's this community that enhances a players experience so often in games today. ATS is no exception and kudos to SCS again for their support.If I recall the release days of ETS2, way back when ..... and look today at what ETS2 developed into today, I would say that ATS is on a similar track ... so the future looks pretty good. The community wants faster updates and is impatient as ever which in my opinion highlight two things .... a. a call to action for SCS on ATSb. confirmation to SCS of the passion and energy the community has for ATSSo if you're looking at ATS reviews and trying to decide if it makes sense for you to buy it, my recommendation is Yes, buy it ... it's another great title in the SCS stable and it really does give the player a sense of driving an 'American' truck in an American landscape. ATS is the only place that offers this truly American trucking experience and the future is full of potential.			"

												I was a bit hesitant to buy this game after reading the reviews about the map scaling being wonky compared to ETS2. I actually waited a week or so after release, then decided to go ahead and buy it. I have zero regrets. This game is absolutely enjoyable, as it is an entirely different experience driving in ATS than it is ETS2. I still play ETS2, and will always have a fond love for that game. The graphics are gorgeous, the trucks are even more so, and if you're new to ETS/ETS2/ATS, then I highly recommend you buy this (even ETS2, while you're at it). I have few gripes about the game, including the map scaling which really doesn't bother me all that much; the on-ramps on freeways are extremely short and not at all realistic, but again it doesn't detract from the game as a whole. Perhaps my biggest gripe would be the lack of states out of the gate. I understand there is a lot behind this game already, however, Arizona is the last free DLC that will be added to the game, which is still a few months away from release. It would have been nice if SCS would have done the entire Western United States as free DLC, maybe Arizona, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Then had gone from there, just so there is quite a lot of distance to cover while they work on cranking out the paid DLC. Regardless, I love this game. While I have low hours played on it, don't let that deter you any. I play a variety of other games and love to give them equal attention. If you're able to, I suggest getting a steering wheel with pedals to add to that realistic touch. I play on a gaming laptop, so I have to use the keyboard which if you don't have the option of getting a steering wheel, still get this. Keyboard is still fun and the only thing you may have trouble with is backing the trailer up into position. I know this review is a bit scatter brained, and I apologize if it is a hard read. I hope with the paid DLC that they do it in regions, such as Mid-West, Eastern, etc., and not state-by-state. The game itself is $20, so I am hoping that the paid DLC stays under that price range. Get this game. You'll enjoy it, and have a blast.			"

												This game is just amazing! I play this game just to relax and take my mind off of stuff.If you enjoy simulators then this game is a great game to add to your list. It is pretty realistic and very detailed graphics wise. It has mod support (one of which is a multiplayer mod that I'll decribe as well). Regarding mods: Say you don't like the slim choices of trucks (which keep in mind they are adding more trucks and even more states soon), but you can just download a different truck design or even a car if you don't want to drive a truck. In regards to the Mp mod: I will say that it doesnt have ai which is good and bad because no ai driving around means less lag with other players and not having to deal with stupid ai (which you still have to deal with some stupid player not understanding the physics or how its a simulator or whatever the reason is). What's bad about not having ai is that in this game the only way of getting fined for speeding is by cops (there are very little speed cameras), so people just decide to break all the laws because they can't get punished (or they don't care). And it's not like admin aren't there moderating it because they are. All in all I would say to get this game but if simulators aren't your thing then just go play your shooters or whatever you find joy out of because this game needs more serious people especially in Mp. 9/10			"

												I have been a lifelong fan of SCS' 18 Wheels of Steel series and their subsequent ""simulators"" franchise. Overall, I think this game is pretty solid. The graphics are fantastic if you can handle them, and include a great deal of realistic aspects carried over from ETS2 which I appreciate as well as the eventual reference or item from the 18 WoS series. While the game itself runs pretty smoothly with a decent gaming computer and the gameplay aspects are the quality we expect from SCS, the expansion (in other words, the map) and the amount of time the game is taking to expand north and west is well, unexcusable. While the game's graphics are indubitably fantastic, I cannot help but feel short changed by the time its taking to expand the map and the fact expansion DLC costs. I can only help but hearken back to the days of old SCS, when despite their team's only slight exposure and small size milked out flawed, but memorable, and well formatted games from my childhood like Convoy and PTTM etc that came out with a host of (despite not having licenses) realistic trucks and a fantastic fully completed map. Now, with the immense success both monetarily from ETS2 and the huge team they have gotten in the process ATS not only took longer than first imagined to release... but it was released with 2 states... Despite the fact they are both immensely detailed and their are few to no kinks in the gameplay, they have since released ONE new state, Arizona, that was thankfully free that was promised to be out ""soon"" at original release which ended up taking months. Not to mention, they are currently still months into the process of expanding into New Mexico... In my opinion, with a team as great as theirs they need to be less focused on lackluster ""paint job"" DLCs (maybe not the free ones...) and start going all systems go into expansion that should be free in compensation or do something like the ""Going East!"" DLC from ETS2 in which they just release a whole region at one low cost. But other that, I recommend for being good quality SCS gaming and pretty relaxing.			"

												So after 35 hours in the game, I think I can finally review it properly. At first you might see this and think it's just a mod for Euro Truck Simulator 2, it has the same UI, the same idea, and the same feel as ETS2. However, it is so much more. There is not a ton of content at the moment (three states, and a few trucks with several different layout to choose from), but like ETS2 there are tons of mods. Even though there's not much content right now what is there is solid, the map design has improved massively since ETS2 due to the fact that the devs have gotten better at making them. It is a ton of fun to drive around the US and if you don't think it's worth the money now, just wait a while until they have completed more states. Something also to note is they just announced a map rescale, so all of you people who think the map is to small right now, you will soon be satisfied. I hope this review helped!			"

												I would recomend this game to anyone who likes driving or sim games and wants to try to drive a truck. Former drivers and non-drivers alike can enjoy this game. It is pretty relaxing to play with very user friendly controls. This game is easily enhanced by MODs and the SCS development team has taken modding to a new ease of use. Simple menus and the ability to upload content, screenshots and link to your Steam account make this game even more fun!			"

If you're into Euro Truck Simulator 2 then I'd recommend American Truck Simulator too!Pros  Low price  More trucks, more roads to explore  Mac is a first-class platform  Active Community Hub. Cons  Not true to US Interstate System's form & function  Limited content available so far  Poor detection of Steam Controller  CopsI've had hours and hours of fun playing this game. I've found the Community Hub to be helpful whenever I do encounter something to complain about. The developers are hard at work to deliver new content soon, which is what I'm looking forward to the most. The bug fixes can wait, I want more states!			"

												THIS GAME IS AMAZING. If you know scs sofware you should know that they do great work. But in my opinion they have really out done them selves in this game. I live in the USA and for an american truck sim to come out is very cool. If you love truck simulators you will probably love this one. I love what they have done with the game and I will probably love what else they do with the game.  Right know the game is a bit limmited but from what scs has said they are going to realease a whole lot more. I Love this game and for the $20 it is so worth it. SO GET TRUCKING becasue......:its not driving its trucking. :)			"

(not only people with 18-wheeler-interests; EVERYONE!) :D Also, Euro-Truck Simulator is amazing as well. More ""flat-nose-type"" rigs, but a perfect game to start learning all the same! >=)			"

												So after 35 hours in the game, I think I can finally review it properly. At first you might see this and think it's just a mod for Euro Truck Simulator 2, it has the same UI, the same idea, and the same feel as ETS2. However, it is so much more. There is not a ton of content at the moment (three states, and a few trucks with several different layout to choose from), but like ETS2 there are tons of mods. Even though there's not much content right now what is there is solid, the map design has improved massively since ETS2 due to the fact that the devs have gotten better at making them. It is a ton of fun to drive around the US and if you don't think it's worth the money now, just wait a while until they have completed more states. Something also to note is they just announced a map rescale, so all of you people who think the map is to small right now, you will soon be satisfied. I hope this review helped!			"

												American truck sim, Blows all the 18 wheels of steel games right out the window!. The gameplay is fun but can get boring(thats what mods are for). You get to drive your own truck(once you get enough money or cheat). This could go on for hours im just gonna list pros and cons ok?Pros: Endless gameplay, No limits And plenty of detail and customization.Cons: Game is only in Calafornia,Nevada and Arizona. No nice Peterbilt trucks, Weird physics and dumb A.IThere ya go the rest is your choice.Personal Request: Add more variaty of trucks.			"

												This is one of the best truck simulators I have played. I use a logitech steering wheel, I can use the H-shifter and clutch as if it was real life. After going through the gears you bind a key to switch your gear box to continue going through the gears. The graphics are good, the cops are a pain, the other drivers seem to break check you from time to time .... its alot of fun.			"

												I like the game more than euro truck sim. I love the selection of the Eaton-fuller trans on this game makes it feel like I am right in the cab of my own truck. I was not really happy with the short trailers and not much variety in truck I was hopping for t800 and maybe even a K123. I was hoping by now someone would have figured out how to make double trailers work on trucking games as 18 wheels of steel long haul did a good attempt but missed the fifth wheel pivot on the second trailer. I hope scs comes out with 53' trailers- flats, tripple detach, bullracks, grain and milk tankers. Then this game would be one of the best.			"

It has Amazing Graphics, Superb Sound effects & the views are absolutely  stunning,If you want to wind down at the end of the day & play something that is relaxing & doesnt need to much thought or attention then this is the perfect game for you. If you're new to the series then give the demo a try.If you're coming from Euro Truck Simulator 2, youll love this one too!The game is still a work-in-progress though so expect more cities, states & other content to be coming out in the near furture.TL:DRAbsolutely Fantastic, worth every penny, buy it NOW!

												2nd day playing this game. I played the heck out of ETS2 and was looking forward to this for a very long time. I actually took a day off work on the release date. Yes, this is the same game as ETS2. But it is a different world to explore and build a company in and very well done from what i have seen so far. I have explored probably about 30% of the map i'd guess, and continue to smile checking out this new world! There is tons to see. The cities are bigger and more interesting. there are more small details like tumbleweed and events in the sky (no spoilers). The built in radio stations are fantastic and only add to the immersion and adventure. I suspect many of those complaining about size of the map went straight for the ""Level 100 unlimited cash"" mod, because playing the game as intended i'm having a blast and still have tons on my ""to-do"" list. Even then, the replay factor is huge, especially with mods.There are, in-fact,  improvements over ETS2 as well. The new parking system is a nice addition. Optimization is better - I can run triples on higher settings with much less slow down. Quick saves no longer pause the action briefly. Police now roam the streets. I see more animations about the world.It would be nice to see a shiny new graphics engine for this game, but given the end goal of SCS to create a massive online virtual world representing real geography the likes of which gamers have never seen at this level of detail, I support the decision to continue to use this engine. If you have the PC to run shiny new games, chances are you can run this on high settings where it looks great anyway. Triples + TrackIR + cup of coffee = casual driving heaven.At $20, it's also a great value i'd say. I highly recommend this if you enjoy open world driving. Also, with a manual clutch FFB wheel and trackIR the game really gets immersive.			"

												American truck sim is addicting. Most of my free time goes to this game. Playing it with a G27 steering wheel is a huge plus. I would say the only bummer is that there is only 3 trucks available right now, but with mods being released everyday it's not much of a problem. I look forward to seeing what other DLC will be released and the future mods for this game. It's a definite A++ in my book. And with a price tag of $19.99 it just keeps getting better and better. So if I was you and you like Driving simulators and big rigs then this is the game for you.			"

												Great truck simulation game, SCS did us proud! It gives you a challenge but of course it is still fun at the same time. Very realistic, lots of details and even more than ETS2 I would say. The choice of trucks to start off isn't too bad, but of course it could be better but that will all be done when SCS get the required licenses to include more brands. The two starting states - California and Nevada were a great choice to start off with, as I'm quite familiar with the state of California and know my way around a fair bit.

												It's entertaining but not a very deep simulation.  I'm not sure it will hold my attention after I fully explore the map.  Using an  Xbox-type controller is doable, but, as with most driving simulations, it works best with a steering wheel/pedals/shifter system (at least for those of us who actually drive).			"

												Well ATS I only play online so can n ot comment on the single player.I really like this game and its a good replacement for ETS2, I have had some fun driving the big rigs with the amazingly long tarialers. I like the feel of the GFX engine for the most its smooth and runs nicely but in heavily populated areas the frames can drop to jerky sub 25fps and sometimes it may drop just below 50fps its really random im using a GTX970.I haven't played now for a week and a half as I have discovered everything have 30+ trucks and a very steady income.The good.beautiful landscapes Good GFX engine 99% of the timeTumble weed :PMuch more challenging  trailer parking than ETS2Long Long Roads.CB radio 10-4The BadMaps are to small and easily completedRandom Frame drops :(No Air Horn (really!!!!!) Not enough trucksless customization than ETS2Long Long roadsSome glitches when trucks drive over the humpy roadsWeigh Bridges pointlessTraffic lights red turn right get fined sometimes !Thats about it I do like the game just need much more content.

												This is an all-around amazing and incredibly fun to play game. I'm someone that started playing on Euro Truck Simulator 2 and I loved that game as well. As updates continue to be released it only gets better. Whether you play with a steering wheel or just a keyboard, its still great fun. The best update is most definitely the steam workshop support. Mods are amazing in this game and workshop support makes it so much easier to obtain them. This game has a great future, and an even greater value. $20 for the entire game, with all free DLC. It doesn't get much better than that. I'd recommend this game to anyone as it is just absolutely amazing.			"

												Driving the roads, blasting the radio, hauling A$$! Well thats the point of this game, Its a driving sim at its finest. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a semi (get it? lol) relaxing driving game. I said semi though because if you do not follow the traffic laws (which can be turned off) and avoid the other drivers (that are seemingly soccer moms) the game can be a real challenge. The scenery going down the road is nice as well. Would love to see a few more in depth things added such as current market trends (Right now it seems you haul the same thing over and over if you just want to make the big bucks). Also, other than being able to customize your truck its actually better to just drive for a company. Much easier to make the cash. Adding in Multiplayer (which is currently only available in MOD form) would have made this game even better. So what are you waiting for? Get out on that Road now!7 out of 10 Overall a solid game but could be fleshed out a bit more as well as some multiplayer support, Also future maps will be DLC so the game has potential to become a moneygrab.

												What made me buy this game in the first place is that I was playing GTA 5 and really enjoyed playing taxi, but really wanted a game that was more realistic in terms of actually driving around. Having never played a simulator ever before (as I usually stick with games that are not so realistic) I decided to try this one, because I'm always up for new things. First thing I am going to say is that if you're a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ who only wants the best graphics, this is not the game for you. Also the traffic AI and citations are not the best either. However, if you can look past those flaws, the game is really great. Having experienced a little bit of the real thing, I can say it is fairly accurate to what being a truck driver is actually like. It's especially impressive considering that this is an indie game. My only real big complaint is the size. I would have actually liked all of America to be in it, instead of just Nevada and California. Also changing seasons and in game events based on in game dates would be a great way to expand the game. As it is, it's still worth the time and money and I think this was a great introductory into the simulation genre for me and for anyone else looking to get into simulation games.			"

Drive across the states with different types of cargo wether it be a long trip or a short trip it doesn't really matter, It's so god damn relaxing! I'm getting older so fast paced fps and other games is time consuming and you need alot of focus which i dont have after a long day taking care of my child and what not so thats where ""ATS"" comes to play!Before you take care of your own company you gotta do frilance jobs, as you do that you'll save up money for your first truck, Then you take care of your own company; hire drivers & assign routes for them (dont forget to buy trucks for them)Upgrade your trucks; engines, tires, mirrors and a whole lot more can be upgraded.Oh, and drive safe! Don't forget to follow the traffic rules or you'll be fined! Last but not least, dont forget to rest or you'll be dozing on the road and keep your truck with sufficient gas!			"

												I have held of saying something but it IS necessary! You will see only two hours here but I have 126hrs on ETS2! The games are the same in mechanics! Should I buy ATS? Of course you should, its a must have! BUT, at this stage its a HUGE dissapointment. If the devs had all the ground work in game production already done for them, why have we waited so long for a game so thin in content. The trucks are beefy and American which is awesome and the landscape is real, but really, you want me to drive in such a short hop all the way to Redding??? NO NO NO, people - ATS makes Cally look the size of Luxemborg!!! All said and done, I love the titles and I love the concept and ethos start of ATS but if you are going to make ATS work as well as ETS2 you better get some real content fast and you better get some mileage scaling sorted out. Lastly and Im not just harping at you guys but devs are supposed to be wizz kids and for all the simplicity behind the actual coding of a project like this, it is REALLY DISSAPOINTING that the two games dont talk to each other! It isnt rocket science to do that! To sum up, I undertsand that thousands of hours and more go into the graphics of designing maps, but hey, you have a following here so lets get busy, we dont mind paying for good dlc's for more content but we cannot have ATS representing USA as smaller than Europe????Please take this as a positive gripe, we love the series, we want more?Again, should you buy it, how could you live without it? But if you have clocked the miles on ETS2 - AT THIS STAGE, you WILL be left a little dissapointed with ATS!			"

												For those that have already played ETS2, this is just a better version of it in almost every aspect. Graphics are better, trucks are nicer and the map is way more detailed. The only drawback that this game has compared to ETS2 is its lack of content. 2 states and 3 trucks at the time this review was posted. But arizona free DLC and more trucks are on their way.To conclude its worth buying if you like this kind of games. For ETS2 owners its a fine addittion to their library as well.Set your favourite tunes and happy trucking!9/10 would reccommend to anyone.			"

												Clearly the negitive review people did not read anything about this game before purchasing it. Those complaining about lack of map: They stated that the states will be released as future DLC. Seeing as how California alone is twice the size of the U.K I can see how it would take a bit of time to develop. As for the lack of trucks they ran into licensing issues with the truck companies BUT they did say after a few weeks they should have the go ahead to put more trucks into the game, which will be free updates. The only issue I really have with the game is the ridiculous amount of police around so just starting out you loose money quick from speeding tickets. Also to those complaining about the 55 mph limit on some highways: In California the law is trucks with trailers statewide cannot go over 55 mph. When you get into Nevada and eventually elsewhere the speed limit goes up to a decent speed. Overall I rate this high as the future of this game will be rather well once they get more states and trucks up.			"

Updated 2/26/016If you are a hardcore fan of ETS2, then I highly recommend getting this game. It's the same engine, concept, layout, and core mechanics so you'll feel right at home. Despite the game not being listed as Early Access, you might as well consider it as being so. The amount of content is a little on the light side as of now, but more content (both free and paid) is definitely on the way. The content that is in the game is much higher quality than that in ETS2. The world is very detailed and feels rather lived in.Compared to ETS2, the difficulty and amount of grinding has been bumped up a tad. Speeding fines have since been toned down and the Police are a bit less insane in the recent update thanks to SCS. I definitely find this game requires a lot more of my attention while playing. I personally play with a Logitech G27 and a TrackIR; I wouldn't recommend trying to play with a keyboard and mouse, but if you're determined, feel free to give it a go.The game now has three trucks, with a fourth potentially coming soon, and two states with a third in development. Modders have already rolled out a decent amount of content already, including a multiplayer mod. I find the combination of official and unofficial content to definitely be worth the $20, but that's just me.			"

												As far as the actual game is concerned, it is a good game.  I played Euro Truck for a few years and this ""American"" version is the same great quality of its ""Euro"" version.  I give it a negative review because it's been a year without any added content.  They released the game with California and Nevada and quickly released Arizona.  Since Arizona there has been nothing other than some ""addons"" like paint jobs and parts.  Euro Truck is a fully developed game where they added new content (new countries) on a regular basis.  It seems like American Truck is just an after thought with no real desire to develop it into a full blown game.  3 states in a year isn't development.  I was bored of the game in 20 hrs.  There is a ton of content they could add (not to mention 47 more states) but doesn't seem like it's going to happen.  If this the extent of American truck, then I give it a zero until they become serious with the game and start adding real content.			"

												Awesome, just awesome game.  SCS outdid themselves so far.EDIT: I posted the review above with around 1 hour of gameplay.  After 24 hours, here is what I have come up with:Pros: -Inexpensive -Very well modeled trucks, including the AI traffic. -SCS nailed North American scenery. -Realistic Traffic Lights-Hotels, Gas Stations, and Miscellaneous Buildings are awesome, I just want to keep looking around to admire the level of detail. -Same menu layout and settings as ETS2, that makes everything so much simpler. -Ocean Spray/Dust Storms-Highways/Freeways are fairly straight.  That is one thing I hated about ETS2, you felt like a NASCAR driver pulling 1G lateral acceleration around a highway corner at 62MPH/100KPH.  -Realistic Sounds -AI traffic acts just like the idiots I see every day on the way to work. -Weigh Stations, that makes the game right there. -Realistic Gas prices -Options to park your delivery. -Insurance for repairs on your truck. -Transmission options. Now you can miss gears and it will keep grinding too! Amazing. -Tolls, even with the ""I-Pass"", that is just too cool. Cons (I know, it was just released....but hopefully they fix these things)-FPS fluctuation.  I play on Ultra settings and get 60 FPS on the highway, but as soon as I get in the city, it drops to an average of 35 FPS.-Exit/Entrance ramps are not realistic.  Needs to be longer.-Too many Cops.			"

												Frankly I do not understand why it costs ₹1249 It's just an add on  to the ETS2. Comparing side by side nothing improved. Sounds the same from ETS2. I expect a new game, and not just another add on. You're getting only 3 states and 2 Trucks for  ₹1249 :(Buy the game only  if SCS honors regional price in India. This game not worth ₹1249. I can't refund becoz I played more than 2 hours.

												First off let me start by saying that I love the concept and I really liked Euro Trucker 2.. I've been waiting a long time for the American version because.. well I live in America.  The game its self is basically the same thing as Euro Trucker 2 which is perfectly fine (read reviews about the Euro version for in-depth info) but there are 2 things that cause me to down vote the American version of the game:1.  Why start on the west coast for the first release?  That's about as far as you can get from what real trucking is like in the US.  California is a bunch of tree hugging hippies, massive conjestion, liberal regulations that making trucking there a joke.  You can't even drive classic trucks in that state because of their insane laws so why choose that to start off in?  I would have much rather have seen the midwest, south, even the east coast for the first version.  I've driven all over the US and California is about the last state I would have stated with.2.  The 1st one was more of me ♥♥♥♥♥ing, this one though is really why I downvote the game.  The developer made the decision to change the scale of the game in the American version which blows my mind.  I can't understand why they would do this as logically it makes no sense.  In the Euro version when you drive from country to country it feels like you are long hauling.. I'm not saying that I spend hours in front of the computer for 1 route but you do get the experience that you really are trucking.  In the American version when you drive from LA to San Deigo you can barley get the truck up to speed before you arrive at your destination.. to be honest it's really bizzare.It seems to me that the developers think that the 'fun' in this game is backing up the truck to unload and going from stop light to stop light when you arrive at a town.. and that's not the case at all.  The real fun in this game is being on the open road, having your radio tuned to some red neck station and chilling out drinking a beer trucking down the high way... that's what it's all about.  The Euro version had this, the American version doesn't come close.The scale change for America was a big let down, yes I know that if they kept the same scale that they had in the Euro version that it may have taken a few hours to drive from the west coast to the coast.. but honestly that's not a bad thing.    People who are crazy enough to do that, more power to them... that's long hauling in America and trust me there is plenty to see that would have justified the content being created (DLC, more money for them).  As it stands now I think the developer missed a huge oppurtunity to take advantage of the US market but not understanding it's love for driving and the potential revenue that could have been captialized on.

												I get the criticism this game receives, e.g. that it looks like a mod / DLC for ETS2 and that it's way too expensive. However, I find this game still very fun and challenging AND worth the money. The scenery is completely different and the challenge is there. You get to choose while delivering if you want to take the easy way out: automatic parking, the easy challenge: parking in an easy spot or to pick the advanced spot. You get more XP for taking a tougher challenge.  I think that this game is no where near done. It lacks diversity  after a while and new things to unlock, but you can't flat out compare Euro truck simulator 2 with American truck simulator. ATS will be greater or equal to ETS2 in the future as SCS has shown in the past with ETS2.7/7			"

												Here's an old reference. 18 Wheels of Steel. I'm not talking about the Extreme Trucker versions, I'm talking about the originals. Hard Truck, Haulin, Convoy etc. Now this. This game seems to me like an extreme overhaul of the 18WoS games. There's HD graphics, supreme truck customization (except for custom liveries), a wide range of companies and loads, and, a feature used in 18WoS Haulin, hired drivers. Not only that, the immersion factor within the terrain and the trucks is through the roof. It's not just haulin loads any more. It now lets you enjoy the view. One recommendation, better rendered drivers.			"

												Amerecan truck simulator is better than euro truck simulator 2, mainly because of that it has cop cars, why cop cars you ask? well, at random parts of the map of euro truck simulator 2 the speed limit would say 80 so I'm going 80, speed limit changes to about 50 or something lower than 80, I see it change so I slow it down to the new speed limit but soon as it changes I get a speeding ticket. this doesn't happen everytime but when it does it tends to be at a internsection or when I'm about to go in to a tunnel. this doesn't happen on american truck simulator because if you speed near a cop car than you'll get a speeding ticket, otherwise you're fine. so this gives you more time to slow it down so you don't get a random speeding ticket. I read about speed cams in euro truck simulator 2 but haven't seen em, unless I'm just not seeing em but I'm driving a freaking 18 wheeler, I cant slow down from 80 to 30-50 speed limits in 3 seconds lol. that was so annoying in euro truck simulator 2. and yes I had the truck speed limit shown and not the car speed limit. I also noticed that the throttle control is way more sensitive, this makes it easier to mantain your speed. I cant find anything I dislike about this game.			"

												I play on a laptop so your experience may be different. Pro's, Con's(or maybe bugs) and opions of ATS IMHO.Pro's:1. Graphics runs smoothly on 'High' Settings. (ETS2 I loose lots of FPS)2. Having the option to choose a backing skill level is great for all players new and old. This allows newer player the ability to start with none or easy backing and learn how to maneuver in reverse. Learning advanced backing maneuver like reverse S and sliping the trailer for more advanced backing.3. Scenery has a great feel for it. Reminds me of what it was like when I drove those highways. However some great locations are missing. I was lookingforward to the challenges like Donner's Pass. They are just missing(this might just be due to the scale of the map). 4. Lots of Rest Areas(but no truck stops).5. Lots of locations to get fuel.6. Trucks look and feel, handle good(however all should come equipt with the hood mirrors, at lease on the drivers side).7. Great looking AI traffic. Athough too many classic cars. Would like to see some emergency traffic going to calls. Car accidents, fires, cars pulled over(just might be to hard to program, not sure).Con's:1. Unrealistic speeds on small roads and in and around some city areas like Tonopha, NV need to slow down. 80 MPH is way to fast. You have to wait hours to make a turn FROM US-95 to US-395/US-6. Slower speeds and some traffic lights is needed in this area. Have seen some roads that are 1.5 lanes with 70 MPH speeds should be set to 35 MPH. Speeds in most US Cities (98%) are 25 not 30, and city bigger road are 35 MPH. 2. Pre-Pass should be Green when Weigh Stations are closed not just not come on. AI trucks should also enter Weigh Stations when Open. Also with Pre-Pass You should not have to enter as many Weigh Stations (reality would be like 1 in 10). A 1 in 5 would also work well for gaming purpose. However California does pull more trucks in than any other state.3. Reduce Speed Ahead signs need to be placed. Giving drivers a chance to slow down before entering a slower speed area. I hit a construction zone with no signage and got 2 tickets from 2 cops that was back to back. 4. No exit ramp speeds. ETS2 has ramp speeds but ATS doesn't. Taking a ramp at 70MPH is sure death.5. Smaller towns missing. No need to place every one of them in but driving down a US Routh or State Route we should seen some kind of small towns along the way with a speed reduction zone. Not really needed for Interstate as they don't drive through the towns.6. Interstates don't drive through cities. Ex: I-80 doesn't drop in Reno and pick up on the other side. A interstate almost always have on and off ramps.7. Ticket costs are way to high. Also fines double for construction zones.Would be great to be able to leave the truck and walk around and maybe interact with things. Like go order lunch, or buy a coffee use the rest room. I know it's a Truck Simulator, but we are the drivers and need these things for or lives as driivers. Another improvement would be live loading and unloading. You would buy a trailer(s), and drive to a location for loading and unloading. It opens up lots of new jobs and I don't think it would be to hard to program. However i'm not a programer ;))I love ETS2 and ATS has shown some improvements but yet also has shown some backward progress. I'm sure they where just oversights. And most of these kind of things can be fixed with a patch or two. Finding things like these depend on when someone testing enters a area. Like if you goto Tonopha at 3am it's much different than going there at 3pm. Overall it's a very intertaining game. With some small problems. None that mess with gameplay, but might make you whine a little. Once you pass the effeted complaint you will be happily rolling down the road and forgetting that last mile from h***. At least until you enter it again(but these thing happens in real life to). So if you get to areas you don't like reroute your route. You don't get paid for going around but you're free to do so.

												I'll try to keep this short and somewhat readable :If you were an Euro Truck Simulator 2 fan and are intimidated by the seemingly small size of the current content - don't be. SCS has shown more than high aptitude to deliver high quality content with time. It may be less content than you are used to, but it's fresh, and my god is it polished. It's beautiful, the controls are tight and intuitive, as well as incredibly configurable - and it seemingly runs smoother the prettier it looks - don't know what kind of nail polish SCS works with, but it works perfectly on my 2012 war victim. As a final note : remember the devs took several steps to have the world size of Euro Truck Simulator 2 as it is. There was its prequel, and the prequel to that (Scania Truck Simulator). And on top of that, the game got massive expansions, and multiple patches that added cities in Italy, Austria and Hungary. You honestly think SCS didn't or won't deliver? Well if you do, I can't do much to convince you otherwise. But they can. For 20 (local currency) it's worth it. tl;dr : BELIEVE in the developer. Particularly this one.			"

												Surprisingly full of frustrating screw-ups.  Wasn't expecting to be this irritated playing the game.1)  Cops appear out of nowhere and give you $1000 tickets for going five over the limit.2)  Hardly any posted speed limits anywhere.  Have to drive with one eye on your GPS to tell whether you're speeding or not.3)  Speed limits on major roadways are wrong, sometimes fluctuate in a given stretch of road for no reason.  Never any warning.4)  Lots of traffic signs missing for that matter.5)  Even with an automatic transmission truck rolls backwards on hills and stalls.Graphically enhanced version of ETS2 but nowhere near as comfy to drive.  Lack of variety in trucks is balanced by increased diversity of locales to drive in.  Would wait for a sale or for more content/fixes to annoying gameplay elements.			"

												First off let me start by saying that I love the concept and I really liked Euro Trucker 2.. I've been waiting a long time for the American version because.. well I live in America.  The game its self is basically the same thing as Euro Trucker 2 which is perfectly fine (read reviews about the Euro version for in-depth info) but there are 2 things that cause me to down vote the American version of the game:1.  Why start on the west coast for the first release?  That's about as far as you can get from what real trucking is like in the US.  California is a bunch of tree hugging hippies, massive conjestion, liberal regulations that making trucking there a joke.  You can't even drive classic trucks in that state because of their insane laws so why choose that to start off in?  I would have much rather have seen the midwest, south, even the east coast for the first version.  I've driven all over the US and California is about the last state I would have stated with.2.  The 1st one was more of me ♥♥♥♥♥ing, this one though is really why I downvote the game.  The developer made the decision to change the scale of the game in the American version which blows my mind.  I can't understand why they would do this as logically it makes no sense.  In the Euro version when you drive from country to country it feels like you are long hauling.. I'm not saying that I spend hours in front of the computer for 1 route but you do get the experience that you really are trucking.  In the American version when you drive from LA to San Deigo you can barley get the truck up to speed before you arrive at your destination.. to be honest it's really bizzare.It seems to me that the developers think that the 'fun' in this game is backing up the truck to unload and going from stop light to stop light when you arrive at a town.. and that's not the case at all.  The real fun in this game is being on the open road, having your radio tuned to some red neck station and chilling out drinking a beer trucking down the high way... that's what it's all about.  The Euro version had this, the American version doesn't come close.The scale change for America was a big let down, yes I know that if they kept the same scale that they had in the Euro version that it may have taken a few hours to drive from the west coast to the coast.. but honestly that's not a bad thing.    People who are crazy enough to do that, more power to them... that's long hauling in America and trust me there is plenty to see that would have justified the content being created (DLC, more money for them).  As it stands now I think the developer missed a huge oppurtunity to take advantage of the US market but not understanding it's love for driving and the potential revenue that could have been captialized on.

												Right, I'll try and be short and sweet. Whilst everyone complains about the slow development from SCS, I give them credit for having this game out so soon. I am shocked at the fanbase's reaction purely because they went betching off about how the Pete 389 or the Mack Superliner or some shet like that wasn't included in the base release. Upon first playing it I admit I was thoroughly impressed just by the way the game felt to me, It hasn't grown old to me yet actually. So let's start simple enough for the children to read shall we? The map: Wow, a whole other continent. What an effing shock, everyone!! It is, to my knowledge of 3d modeling, pretty damn good. The scenery & props (buildings): Okay, this is where I personally believe SCS absolutely outdid themselves, I mean look at it, weigh scales, actual truckstops, random rest areas, all characteristics of... *drumroll* THE USA!!!!! Little motels out there occasionally in the countryside..The graphics: Wow, these are just perfection over my old ETS2 graphics, not to mention it runs better hahahaHonestly, 20/10, I'd drive a Peterbilt 579 for 200000 miles again any day.

												So here's a review. I've played a bit of it since it came out, and I'm liking what I see. The cities all have a unique feel to them, and I actually smiled a bit when i recognized places shown in game. From a gameplay standpoint, it's pretty great, like a somehow improved version of ETS2. You don't have to go through tollbooths (which I hated), and instead the weigh stations, which seemingly replace them, are a lot less common. Overall, it's a great game, and I can't wait for the Arizona dlc, and everything after it.			"

												I'll try to keep this short and somewhat readable :If you were an Euro Truck Simulator 2 fan and are intimidated by the seemingly small size of the current content - don't be. SCS has shown more than high aptitude to deliver high quality content with time. It may be less content than you are used to, but it's fresh, and my god is it polished. It's beautiful, the controls are tight and intuitive, as well as incredibly configurable - and it seemingly runs smoother the prettier it looks - don't know what kind of nail polish SCS works with, but it works perfectly on my 2012 war victim. As a final note : remember the devs took several steps to have the world size of Euro Truck Simulator 2 as it is. There was its prequel, and the prequel to that (Scania Truck Simulator). And on top of that, the game got massive expansions, and multiple patches that added cities in Italy, Austria and Hungary. You honestly think SCS didn't or won't deliver? Well if you do, I can't do much to convince you otherwise. But they can. For 20 (local currency) it's worth it. tl;dr : BELIEVE in the developer. Particularly this one.			"

												Yea people argue that it's the same game just different map.. BUT NO it's not, sort of. The map of this game is so much better and more detailed than ETS 2 which is one the main reasons this game is amazing. The AI can actually drive now, which is a good thing. The graphics in this game is amazing. ITS IN ♥♥♥♥ING MERICA... and those are the good things. Now the bad... Police cars great feature... but gets you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, theres just to many of them. Only 2 trucks but more to come. Only 2 states but more to come. And the last this is SPEEDING TICKETS and the SPEED LIMIT of this game like holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ they give you tickets for days and $1000 for each... for only going like 6 more than the speed limit, that is annoying. Also the off and on ramps need to be adjusted they are too short and also when you enter a city that goes from 70mph to 30mph real quick and guess what THERES A ♥♥♥♥ING COP READY FOR YO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥TO GIVE YOU A TICKET.10/10 WOULD GET A TICKET AGAIN, GREAT ♥♥♥♥ING GAMEIF YOU LOOK AT IT THERES ONLY LIKE 1 PROBLEM WHICH IS THE SPEED TICKETS AND SPEED LIMIT.

												I get the criticism this game receives, e.g. that it looks like a mod / DLC for ETS2 and that it's way too expensive. However, I find this game still very fun and challenging AND worth the money. The scenery is completely different and the challenge is there. You get to choose while delivering if you want to take the easy way out: automatic parking, the easy challenge: parking in an easy spot or to pick the advanced spot. You get more XP for taking a tougher challenge.  I think that this game is no where near done. It lacks diversity  after a while and new things to unlock, but you can't flat out compare Euro truck simulator 2 with American truck simulator. ATS will be greater or equal to ETS2 in the future as SCS has shown in the past with ETS2.7/7			"

												I would like to start with that this game is definitely not a re-skinned version of ETS 2. It shares the same engine (slightly updated). I  found many new things which currently are not implemented but later will be implemented and will make this game more interesting then ETS 2 but I don't want ETS 2 to die, I hope developers will take good care of ETS 2 and ATS too. I just want developers will work on the Multiplayer which can become a huge feature for both the games, I already the Multiplayer community growing each day and is insanely addictive. I know the game content delivered is very less but I believe in SCS and I know they dont keep the community ignored :)			"

Now you can actually drive without being hit by AI all the time. That's well done.Only thing I might miss, is slightly longer empty straight roads in the desert that just goes on and on and on and on for miles and miles :)(There are some good long roads already though, but I just love desert-roads on autopilot with a hot sun baking the cockpit :) )Very good game :)			"

												I started with euro truck sim 2 and its great loads of trucks content and places to go, so thought id try the american one again good game great views and towns its just the amount of content in it lets it down 2 different trucks so not much choice and the amp isnt very big compared to ets 2. 3/10 from me im afriad for the lack of content. if your thinking of getting this i would recommend not to and get ets 2			"

												Enjoying driving around without spent real money on gasoline :D, yes i love driving but in my real world traffic is mess and make my life worse because too much stupid and ignorance people on the road, so i decide buy this game to enjoy peaceful driving and i got it the scenery is beautiful and i got the sense of driving real truck so i recommended this game for people who love driving.Cons --  - No truck damage animation :(  - The bank interest is too high (you must work everyday just to pay the interest)  - Why there is no Ford truck F650/F750 in america, I want buy and drive that truck?  - Can I have Volvo, Scania, and Mercedez trucks ? please import it from Europe !  - Speeding ticket drain my money :(			"

												What can I say about the game, I totally love it!! I loved playing ETS2 because I'm from Europe, but it is fun discovering new parts of the world. To bad that there are only 3 stats so far :( Things I like the most about ATS: - The community is great, you can download trucks, skins and other mods from the workshop. So moding your game is very easy, but I can recommend you to not use to many mods if your computer is not a beast, and the second thing is that if the mod is taken away from the workshop it will no longer exist in the game, which can be problematic if it was your main truck. - The developers do a good job (fix bugs, new updates, map improvments)- Learn some basic stuff about America. - Nice graphics! Things I would like to change in ATS: - The weight stations, I don't really see the point of their existing in the game because as a player you'r not able to change the affect of the weight of the cargo. Maybe add a option so it makes sence to have them. - The bills. As a beginner the bills are a huge gap in your economy, but as a level 30 player with a small company and over 100k dollars in your pocket a 600 dollar bill is not going to make much diffrence. - The trucks don't have much options when it comes to tuning (less than in ETS2).I would suggest this game if you like slow games and listening to music or a podcast perhaps. I often play this game when I am not in the mood for playing a shooter game. (English is not my first language, so if you have some tips about how I can forrmulate myself PLS contact me :))  "

												I love this game, even with all it's flaws.  I fear that the slow pace of pudate, adding states and trucks, will cause the audience to dwindle and lose interest and that is saddening.  In single player mode I suppoe this is a good game to play for a bit, then put aside and play something else while you wait for more content.  The multiplayer version (nmot acutally officially SCS Software) gets dreadfully boring very quickly.  Arizona made alot of difference, but still the same trucks.  Hope they pick up the pace.			"

												I love the game. Yes as stated by the devolpers, there are some licening issues so the game is not fully released quite yet. Which is why the price is 20USD and not a full priced game. Another thing peaple are lacking to see is that The game is still in its birthing stage and you cant expect it to be a huge map. The devs have done a wonderful job recreating California but it seems as if the community isnt appreciating the fact that they did this at all. Most gamers these days expect a game to be perfect, but as a game developer in San Diego I can tell you that game design is not majgic and just to make a simple good menu like ATS has takes weeks, possibly even months! So yes, the game is worth it. Its not that big of a game yet and the developers have responded to that and agree and have lowered the price. Just guys, I leave on this one not, games are not magic and take years to make.			"

												Though I don't reccomend this game, that doesn't mean you won't enjoy this game. Lemme explain my experience:The good:-Yeah, it's a truck game-It's a cool 18-wheels of steel updateThe bad:-The graphics are bad-No scenery-Towns are usually only a few roads long (cities like New Vegas)Overall, it's very plain. Nothing to look at. Even on the highest settings, everything looks pretty bad. Trees will disinigrate in your mirrors. Shadows won't load until you're close. Some grass even won't load til you're closer. I will probably play this game a bit more, just to see what the end-game stuff is like. I know you can hire workers and buy/upgrade your own truck store. But it's taking quite a while and you're on the road with nothing to see. Cars are always getting into stupid wrecks with eachother, making it pretty hard. Usually the crash is a car turning from a stop sign straight into another, sometimes backing straight into me. There is a lot I can say about this game, but overall a 6/10 from me.			"

												I would like to start with that this game is definitely not a re-skinned version of ETS 2. It shares the same engine (slightly updated). I  found many new things which currently are not implemented but later will be implemented and will make this game more interesting then ETS 2 but I don't want ETS 2 to die, I hope developers will take good care of ETS 2 and ATS too. I just want developers will work on the Multiplayer which can become a huge feature for both the games, I already the Multiplayer community growing each day and is insanely addictive. I know the game content delivered is very less but I believe in SCS and I know they dont keep the community ignored :)			"

												Coming from the 'old' ""18 wheels of steel"", which was great, it is a very welcome (and much improved) title :)It feels very much like 18WOS, just re-vamped to current tech-specs, so that's great.The AI traffic is very much improved over 18WOS. Now you can actually drive without being hit by AI all the time. That's well done.Only thing I might miss, is slightly longer empty straight roads in the desert that just goes on and on and on and on for miles and miles :)(There are some good long roads already though, but I just love desert-roads on autopilot with a hot sun baking the cockpit :) )Very good game :)			"

												After 10 hours of gameplay, I have enjoyed playing the game. I understand that the game had been in development for roughly 2 years. The main downside of the game is the complete lack of content. For a game which is running off the same engine as ETS2 and also uses nearly identical mechanics and UI's, it is very concerning that their are only 2 states and a very limited amount of vehicles. I do not think the game is worth the price that it is now with the current amount of content. If their was a complete engine overhaul/graphics changes and more vehicles and states then I would agree with the current price. As I said, I have enjoy playing the game but I can see it getting boring very quickly. If you are willing to buy now and wait for more content to come out, then I would say go ahead. However, if you are looking for a game with large amounts of content then you should probably wait a lot longer until more content is released.			"

												Just purchased this game and played a couple hrs... i cant put my finger on it but i LOVE this game soo much more than ETS 2, maybe its the long nose trucks, maybe it feels a little more home with the american touch (i'm from australia) and maybe the realistic of gettin fines with cops on the roads instead of seeing a speed sign and only slowing down for 2 mins, the non restriction on the speed... i could go on for ever... the only comment i have is i REALLY HOPE they bring out the older Kenworth styles SOON!!! but the way the traffic acts and the not so sudden STOP in the middle of the road really sets this game off... i WILL be buying DLC and expansions for this game and support you guys anyway i can cause this game has soooo much potential if you guys just stick to it all the way to the end i will play and pay for this game for many years to come...

												Although I have played enough of this game to offer a fair review, I will choose not to and instead offer one of my favorite recipies for my favorite dish, Boeuf Bourguignon Knopf.First prepare the bacon: cut off the rind and reserve.Cut the bacon into lardons about 1/4"" thick and 1 1/2"" long.Simmer the rind and the lardons for ten minutes in 1 1/2 quarts of water.Drain and dry the lardons and rind and reserve.Pre-heat the oven to 450°F.Put the tablespoon of olive oil in a large (9"" - 10"" wide, 3"" deep) fireproof casserole and warm over moderate heat.Saute the lardons for 2 to 3 minutes to brown lightly.Remove to a side dish with a slotted spoon.Dry off the pieces of beef and saute them, a few at a time in the hot oil/bacon fat until nicely browned on all sides.Once browned, remove to the side plate with the bacon.In the same oil/fat, saute the onion and the carrot until softened.Pour off the fat and return the lardons and the beef to the casserole with the carrots and onion.Toss the contents of the casserole with the salt and pepper and sprinkle with the flour.Set the uncovered casserole in the oven for four minutes.Toss the contents of the casserole again and return to the hot oven for 4 more minutes.Now, lower the heat to 325°F and remove the casserole from the oven.Add the wine and enough stock so that the meat is barely covered.Add the tomato paste, garlic and herbs and the bacon rind.Bring to a simmer on the top of the stove.Cover and place in the oven, adjusting the heat so that the liquid simmers very slowly for three to four hours.The meat is done when a fork pierces it easily.While the meat is cooking, prepare the onions and mushrooms and set them aside till needed.For the onion, if using frozen, make sure they are defrosted and drained.Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet and add the onions to the skillet.Saute over medium heat for about ten minutes, rolling the onions about so they brown as evenly as possible, without breaking apart.Pour in the stock, season to taste, add the herbs, and cover.Simmer over low heat for about 40 to 50 minutes until the onions are perfectly tender but retain their shape and the liquid has mostly evaporated.Remove the herbs and set the onions aside.For the mushrooms, heat the butter and oil over high heat in a large skillet.As soon as the foam begins to subside add the mushrooms and toss and shake the pan for about five minutes.As soon as they have browned lightly, remove from heat.To Finish the Stew:.When the meat is tender, remover the casserole from the oven and empty its contents into a sieve set over a saucepan.Wash out the casserole and return the beef and bacon to it (discarding the bits of carrot and onion and herbs which remain in the sieve).Distribute the mushrooms and onions over the meat.Skim the fat off the sauce and simmer it for a minute or two, skimming off any additional fat which rises to the surface.You should be left with about 2 1/2 cups of sauce thick enough to coat a spoon lightly.If the sauce is too thick, add a few tablespoons of stock.If the sauce is too thin, boil it down to reduce to the right consistency.Taste for seasoning.Pour the sauce over the meat and vegetables.If you are serving immediately, place the covered casserole over medium low heat and simmer 2 to 3 minutes.Serve in the casserole or on a warm platter surrounded by noodles, potatoes or rice and garnished with fresh parsley.If serving later or the next day, allow the casserole to cool and place cold, covered casserole in the refrigerator.20 minutes prior to serving, place over medium low heat and simmer very slowly for ten minutes, occasionally basting the meat and vegetables with the sauce.

												After 10 hours of gameplay, I have enjoyed playing the game. I understand that the game had been in development for roughly 2 years. The main downside of the game is the complete lack of content. For a game which is running off the same engine as ETS2 and also uses nearly identical mechanics and UI's, it is very concerning that their are only 2 states and a very limited amount of vehicles. I do not think the game is worth the price that it is now with the current amount of content. If their was a complete engine overhaul/graphics changes and more vehicles and states then I would agree with the current price. As I said, I have enjoy playing the game but I can see it getting boring very quickly. If you are willing to buy now and wait for more content to come out, then I would say go ahead. However, if you are looking for a game with large amounts of content then you should probably wait a lot longer until more content is released.			"

												I absolutely love this game. The only thing I don't like is the graphics level. I could run euro truck simulator 2 really well with only a few framerate drops but in places on ats, even with the graphics all the way down or disabled, i still get 7fps. I highly recommend this game but you should probably only buy it if you have a good computer. 9.9/10			"

												This game, is really awesome. It's kinda nice to not have to be in a city in real life, but within a game. For example: Why travel to Las Vegas when you can drop a load within a trailer there? I really hope that they make a Utah level. It would be a great pleasure to add that in. That way, people can see some beautiful landscapes of Utah, Arizona (Coming soon), Oregon, etc.I strongly recommend this if you wanna just explore the world.			"

												Just purchased this game and played a couple hrs... i cant put my finger on it but i LOVE this game soo much more than ETS 2, maybe its the long nose trucks, maybe it feels a little more home with the american touch (i'm from australia) and maybe the realistic of gettin fines with cops on the roads instead of seeing a speed sign and only slowing down for 2 mins, the non restriction on the speed... i could go on for ever... the only comment i have is i REALLY HOPE they bring out the older Kenworth styles SOON!!! but the way the traffic acts and the not so sudden STOP in the middle of the road really sets this game off... i WILL be buying DLC and expansions for this game and support you guys anyway i can cause this game has soooo much potential if you guys just stick to it all the way to the end i will play and pay for this game for many years to come...

												This is a great game for Euro Truck Simulator lovers.I have played now for a good while and i can sum alot of good things about the game :So first :Detail - I enjoy the detail in this game, it feels there is alot more detail and different areas to see compare to ETS, there are alot of signs with random things not just town signs it feels authentic ( there are shops, diners, donut places and much more with different lights and showcase...) some lights are pretty drops down on buildings in a special way and the scenary is beautiful, from forests and watery places into barren lands and high speed roads, truck gauges are amazing, there is surely alot to see here.Gameplay - Long straight roads and fun. there are many interesting roads and intersections to drive at specialy hilly areas with a special truck lane or long straight roads with hills that the road goes up and downs i really liked them.Difficulty - From ETS2 to ATS there is a lot of difference, the truck really feels long and sometimes it's challenging to leave a parking area or park your trailer, there is alot more driving to do, high speed roads and dangerous roads.I hope we keep seeing new upcoming content to ATS and ETS, they are both excellent and i think it's important they keep the community and game alive by doing so.I recommend getting ATS, it's a small payment for alot of pleasure,The game is awesome and beautiful for all those who love driving games this is a must and i'll be looking forward for any upcoming expansions for both ATS and ETS2.

												Don't want to read the entire review?  Just read this: Yes.American Truck Simulator is an amazing, challenging game designed for a relaxing experience.Now, I know what you're thinking.  ""Nate, why the heck would a game about work be fun?  I work enough already!""  It's great.  There's just something about commanding a huge tractor pulling 50k pounds of freight at 90mph that's exciting.Don't want the grind?  I didn't either.  I downloaded a free profile with about 60 million dollars.  ""Nate, that defeats the purpose!"" No, I paid for a fun, relaxing driving sim.  I didn't want to worry about money issues, I just wanted to make deliveries and run my company.  I have now brought that profile from 60mil to 138mil as of this moment from my work and having my company at the largest possible at this point in the game.  I can afford repairs if I have an accidental crash or if the AI (Artificial UNintelligence) cars ram me.  I can afford any truck with any upgrades I want.  It's great.Pros:-Semi-Realistic driving sim (as long as you don't ram the invisible walls)-Easy-to-use, straight forward interface-Extremely ‘replayable’ (I mean, just look at my hours)-Great customization of truck exteriors with many options (and, according to SCS, many more to come)Cons:-The AI cars need a bit more common sense.  It gets annoying when you lose $3,000 on a job just because a car rammed your trailer when you pull out of a gas station or something.-The game needs more development.  I will give credit to SCS.  They have a small team working on a BIG game.  But, compared to ETS2 (Euro Truck Sim 2), ATS is under-developed.-Interior customization could be expanded.  As a professional truck driver, you are going to be spending lots of time in the cab.  After about 50 hours straight in the exact same cabin, it's going to get a bit boring.  Conclusion:ATS is a great, laid-back pass-time game.  With a large map in a great setting with thick forests, large deserts, and a beautiful coastline, the game has many different environments that make it hard to get tired of.  While the game is somewhat under-developed, SCS Software is quite obviously working hard to update it frequently.  I find this game worth every penny and more. "

												One of my fav games was / still is ETS2, so it is a natural progression, to play ATS. Only thing I was surprised at was the lack of available trucks. I know it is a licence thing, but more variation of trucks should have been available from the outset, even if they were just imported from ETS2. We could then at least drive our fav trucks on the American roads.I do understand about the map size also, but again I thought that there should be a more expansive map, this being America. All in all, I am pleased that they didn't wait till they had all these things and gave us a chance to get stuck into this game as they did. Well done, recommended.If you don't have this game, you are not a gamer.. "

												It's a clear morning in California. I'm driving my truck down a lonely road, through the empty desert. In the rear view mirror, I see a car approaching. I keep driving, expecting them to pass me, but they don't. I check back in my mirror, and- it's a police car. Okay, this is no situation to panic. I kept driving, slowly and steadily. But I felt myself growing tired. The road stretched on, seemingly endlessly. I finally could take no more and dozed off for anly a few seconds. When I woke up, I was going slightly above the speed limit, and I slammed my brakes. But it was too late. The police car had already called reinforcements. A line of six or seven cop cars was following me down the highway, sirens blaring. I suddenly get a storm of notifications from my GPS- my bank account is being drained, ticket by ticket. Then the shooting started, and they drove the truck off the road. That was the last thing I remembered, until I woke up. The starving, broke, pitiful CEO of a failed trucking company.10/10, quite realistic.			"

												This is one of those games that similar to ETS2 will having me doing a few jobs a day for months on end.It does not revolutionize the sim genre as its very similar to ETS2. However its improves on most all of it. Scenery is more detailed in cities. Outside of cities its about as detailed as it can be for mostly desert areas. It does feel quite a bit smaller than ETS2 mainly because its 2 states at the moment. Which is disappointing but from what I hear Nevada is in the works and will be free so cannot complain to much about that. The modding scene is in the works as well so I have no doubt in a few months we will have some amazing mods to go along with it. There are already some great mods for the game. I am excited for the maps mods.What impressed me the most was the sounds. I love ETS2 but when you get in one of these Peterbuilt or Kenworth trucks and get your truck moving it gives you chills. I have got 2 other drivers working for me and am well into making my trucking empire. For me this was a no brainer. I loved ETS2 however I prefer the North American setting so I grabbed this.I know this review is kind of all over the place. Moral of the story. If you have and enjoy ETS2 and are looking for something different this is not the game for you there is not enough to recommend switching. However if you prefer the setting by all means grab this game you will not be disappointed.If you have never owned one of the trucking sim games but are interested. Choose which setting you prefer most and pick it up.			"

Physics is great, I'm not expert in gaming reviews but It really feels like driving a truck, I think in the Euro Truck Simulator 2 the map is bigger and more truck companies but this one is great since there are other truck types and different landscapes. Nothing like driving a truck in the desert roads, listening to classic rock radio and watching the sunset. I like it and Recommend it :)			"

												IGNORE MY LOW AMOUNT OF HOURS, I HAVE PLAYED MORE ON DIFFERENT ACOUNT___________________________________________________________________________I would have to say, this and it's sister, Euro Truck Simulator, are probably the best driving simulators out there. Moddable and avalible to causal to hardcore truck drivers, it has a wide range of content.                                                                                                        Pros:- Moddable- Large map, with expantions coming- Decent amount of trucks to choose from- Many different types of cargo to choose from- Fantastic graphics- Easy to learn - Can use VR- Can use gaming wheels- Can Play for hours on end- Constantly Updated- Customizable TrucksCons:- We all know it's coming, the amount of DLCs the devs will put out- Uhhh, umm... OH, the amount of time it takes to find more cons   - I've been sitting here for 7 minutes thinking of any. Ok... i'll move on.""Mehs"" (Opinions, Most of these can be solved with mods):- Honestly, there is a lot of customization features but i feel like it needs more- Little more traffic variaty- The time it takes to get moving at the start (Just get a money/xp cheat on the workshop)- Size of the cities, they are kind of big, but i felt like they should have been made biggerThings they should add to the game (Most of this would be DLCs):- More intierior customization, same as wheel tuning DLC, but with the inside of the trucksI had more but they were stupid.All in All, if you like driving simulators get this, if you don't, why are you here?

												After 10 hours of gameplay, I have enjoyed playing the game. I understand that the game had been in development for roughly 2 years. The main downside of the game is the complete lack of content. For a game which is running off the same engine as ETS2 and also uses nearly identical mechanics and UI's, it is very concerning that their are only 2 states and a very limited amount of vehicles. I do not think the game is worth the price that it is now with the current amount of content. If their was a complete engine overhaul/graphics changes and more vehicles and states then I would agree with the current price. As I said, I have enjoy playing the game but I can see it getting boring very quickly. If you are willing to buy now and wait for more content to come out, then I would say go ahead. However, if you are looking for a game with large amounts of content then you should probably wait a lot longer until more content is released.			"

												As SCS Software mentioned in the description of the game, it currently only has two states, California and Nevada, with a third - Arizona - currently in development. And as of right now, only has two trucks to choose from. So the game is currently lacking content wise, only because this was built from the ground up, and there will be more content released for it in the future, some probably through free updates and others through purchases, it's up to the company for what they do. Even though it's a decent game right now, it cannot be recommened in its current state due to being incomplete content wise (trucks to choose from, states to go to, etc).I may come back to this in the future to change my review, so stay tuned for the *update.*I'd like to point out now that this will be way later on in the future, when there are more states and more vehicles to choose from. My best guess is that it would be at least by late 2017 at best, and early 2019 at the latest, when I believe that a sizeable amount of the game might be completed, meaning more content added to the game. I'd also like to say that I am not trying to make a major 100% guess on a timeframe for a more complete game, but for just a guess, a shot in the dark.			"

												Dismally disappointing. Literally ETS2 with a theme. Only two states, only two trucks, and incredibly short driving times, posing no actual challenge. They've spent a lot of time bigging up this game and how big and open it's going to be, and it's ended up with less content than UK Truck Sim. They've rushed it and not even used the pretense of early access.I've also noticed that it manages to look worse than ETS2 and yet suffer from more performance problems.Sorry SCS, refunding this one.

												Waited a long time for this one, years and was told  by the developer time after time please be patient. We don't want to release the game before it is ready. A huge hypefest about all the new features and blah blah this and it will be so worth the wait we promise. So it was FINALLY released and what did we get for our money? Two count them on two fingers yes 2 trucks and 2 trucks that have minimum modifications compared to the OLDER  game ETS2.  Now  I'm trying to notice what is really NEW and find mostly really irritating things like a cop on every corner giving me $1000.00 dollar tickets every 10 seconds.. Being ticketed for right turns on red which last time I checked was legal in America. Then started looking closer at the ""new details"" and find some more really irritating things like concrete barriers that look like some child playing with their toys placed them willy nilly so as to create a potential hazard every 100 yrds.  Light standards with huge concrete bases so close to the lane that you would not dare travel in that lane! Hello SCS people are using keyboards to steer their trucks and you put all this crap right where someone is most likely to run into it and cause huge amounts of damage. Now lets talk about some really dumb stuff that makes me just shake my head in disbelief.  The developer paid someone to put stop signs at the intersections that already have traffic lights. No wonder it took so long to get this thing to market.  Most of the ""cities"" if you want to call them that are so small that they don't even have a garage or gas station. Talk about sparse. Heck most of its desert country whats so dam hard about putting up a few cactus and some brown vegetation? Now lets talk about sound quality. Let me put it this way, the first time I heard the ""horn"" on either of the 2 trucks it reminded me of the clowns car at the circus. Thats the best you can do in the three years I waited ? Can I recommend this piece of unfinished stuff?  A BIG thumbs down. I could give a rats patooty about all the new flare and other superfluous nonsense. I want my tuned trucks back, I want the dual trailers that were supposedly going to be part of ATS and some form of LAN connectivity. SCS you have lost sight of what your customers want and have chosen instead to offer a dumbed down unfinished product and sell ridiculous DLC addons such as your accessories DLC and paint job DLC's and heavy loads bs. At this rate it will take another three years just to fix what you just released instead of making any real progress.			"

												Real-life U.S. truck driver here.Having put a ton of hours into ETS2, I was very excited when I learned SCS would be making another game based on trucking in my own country; not so much today. Yes, I do realize the game is very new and WIP.Stuff I do likeControls and plays much the same as ETS2 - hooray for XB360 gamepads!Game is graphically beautiful!The delivery parking options are a very much welcome addition. I've even found myself having to stop, think, and plan how I'm going to get a trailer into a tight spot.Fines for violations are actually a real concern; even crippling!But there's this one thing that's been wrecking it for me...Ask just about anyone from anywhere else in the world what one of his or her major first impressions will be when visiting the United States, and I can all but guarantee one of them will be a sense of awe at how vast and wide open this land feels. That sense of openness is lost in this game.Cities such as Los Angeles and Carlsbad, CA feel practically next door to each other, when it reality, they are over 80 miles apart through an almost entirely urbanized landscape. In game, the trips takes less time than a quick run to the corner store when the real run in a 74' truck lasts the better part of 2 hours. This feels even more pronounced when making the longest in-game trips; the sense of distance simply isn't there.Rather surprisingly, I've recently learned the map scaling is significantly smaller than it was in ETS2. As a result, the game world feels disappointingly truncated. As others have noted, essential elements such as highway on-ramps are very short - gaining enough speed to safely merge with traffic is nigh impossible. What would normally be a challenging decent down Donner Pass, requiring careful planning and concentration, feels like it's over and gone in just a few seconds. As others have said, I feel this effectively breaks the immersion aspect of the game.Other minor quibblesNo, you cannot drive for 14 hours. You get 11 hours in a 14 hour windowWe generally don't fuel our trucks with 53' trailers at a typical gas station. There are truck stops for that.....and speaking of truck stops, we usually don't go about ""nosing in"" to parking spots!I understand my critique is very harsh, but that's because I've done and do this for a livingIn summary, I feel as though I'm ""playing at"" trucking with toys as a kid, rather than engaging in any sort of simulation. At this stage, the game feels like a $20.00 demo - speaking of demos; I hear they've released one, so go get it!If you're looking to jump in the cab a well-modeled American truck and go about having some easy fun gallivanting about California and Nevada, then you'll likely enjoy this one. The game has a long way to go, but that also means it's got lots of new content ahead! Also - MODS!!! :DI would not recommend this game to anyone seeking a more immersive simulation-type experience, it simply isn't there.Be safe out there!-Red "

												I really liked Euro Truck Simulator but being American I wished there was an American version where I could drive the types of trucks I am used to seeing every day and on the right side of the road. Well, that's just what this is, and the graphics are a little better too. Usually I don't care for simulation games at all but this one is easy to get into, has great controls that you can set up multiple ways (I use an Xbox controller with button inputs custom set up), you can easily load up your own music for your road hauls, and there are lots of neat mods to tweak the experience even more to your liking. Its an oddly relaxing and enjoyable game with goals that keep me coming back. It takes up surprizingly little space on my HDD, and the price is quite fair for what you get unlike so many games that are early access with barely anything to even do for more money. Plus they are working on Arazona, which will be a free update. Good stuff! Over n out.			"

												American Truck Simulator, yes it is lacking the Countries and Cities that Euro Truck Simulator 2 offers. However let us not forget how Euro Truck Simulator 2 began, it started as German Truck Simulator. And UK Truck Simulator. Locking you to only Germany and UK (In 2 different releases.)So is the lack of States a problem for American Truck Simulator? I think not. Right now it causes some issues of repetativeness as you will very quickly span the map, however it is just the beginning. The lack of truck veriety however is disapointing, license limitations or not I would rather they took the Euro Truck Simulator approach and released fictional brands for the trucks until they we're able to secure a licenses.At the moment as American Truck Simulator is today I feel Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a better buy, however I see lots of potential for American Truck Simulator to get to the same level in time, and I just hope it doesn't take too much time to get there.

												Though I don't reccomend this game, that doesn't mean you won't enjoy this game. Lemme explain my experience:The good:-Yeah, it's a truck game-It's a cool 18-wheels of steel updateThe bad:-The graphics are bad-No scenery-Towns are usually only a few roads long (cities like New Vegas)Overall, it's very plain. Nothing to look at. Even on the highest settings, everything looks pretty bad. Trees will disinigrate in your mirrors. Shadows won't load until you're close. Some grass even won't load til you're closer. I will probably play this game a bit more, just to see what the end-game stuff is like. I know you can hire workers and buy/upgrade your own truck store. But it's taking quite a while and you're on the road with nothing to see. Cars are always getting into stupid wrecks with eachother, making it pretty hard. Usually the crash is a car turning from a stop sign straight into another, sometimes backing straight into me. There is a lot I can say about this game, but overall a 6/10 from me.			"

												If you like/ love Euro Truck Simulator, then I am sure you are going to enjoy this too!Right now, at the time of writing this review there is not that much content in the game, but there is a fair amount to keep you entertained for the time being, more content will be added but most likely at a cost.Graphics: The graphics too me seem a little upgraded compared to the original Euro Truck Sim 2, which is nice and the detailing is kinda a little better, it's the only way to explain it.  I had scaling on 400% and max graphics and was super smooth!Audio: The audio is the same as Euro Truck sim, with some added effects coming from the world.  It is truck noises... I turned off the radio and music because I found it annoying!Controls: This is where I got annoyed! I am using an Xbox One controller (X360 works too) but I had some problems setting it up and it took me a while because of the weird issue with the acceleration with the game!Gameplay: The gameplay is the same as Euro Truck Simulator 2, which I did not play much off as I only played the multiplayer mod, which I am thankful to say, this version now has!(I am unsure if ETS2 has these features but I am detailing them from ATS) - The nice fact you can hire drivers, buy trucks for them and a little more, buy a garage, upgrade it and semi customise the trucks and get your drivers to go on missions to earn you some more money is pretty awesome.  The detail in this version I find is a lot more extreme, to the point when driving around the scenery actually has things going on, there are no pedestrians on the streets, but they are in cars and wandering around a complex and outside buidings IN a small area, but there are planes flying over dusting their fields, police following people, helicopters and actual things to look at. There is a multiplayer mod for this game already and it is pure amazing, I love everything about it.  The only problem is, there is there NO traffic at all, not even police cars on the road... The only people on the road are other players, that is it! Kinda sad! Also is the idiots who think this game is GTA and race around, cutting on the pavement, ramming and so much more, but thankfully the Admins are very fast to actually ban them which is awesome, and there is very little of these people and players actually play the game properly mostly.  Again making this enjoyable!The game plays more or less the same as ETS2 and is enjoyable and will be a better version when more content has arrived, so on that basis... Yes, I would recommend this game a a step up from ETS2			"

												Lazy.Same game as ETS2. Same dumb driver faces, same lame truck sounds that make you want to put on euro skinny jeans and become a pillow biter, same dumb ai that crashes into you, rides up your a$$ when you're trying to turn around or need to pull that oversize gas tank into a gas station that is right of the road, so now you have to stop your parking attempt to clear ai cars that bunched up on both sides of the road, and be careful so you don't dink them cuz that's a $1000 fine. I set police to off right away after that. No more dumb fines.Few years after ETS2 and you're telling me they couldn't make multiplayer? Two trucks only? Oh is it cuz of licensing or they spent their time on hookers n blow? They had trucks w/no license in ETS2, they just changed their names. I wouldn't care if I was driving Macs or Panchobilt if the dealer had bunch of trucks to choose from.And every time I drive on the 5 up n down from LA I want to fly to whatever commie country devs are located n kick em in the balls since the real thing has like 12 lanes.. Not in game tho. Same lame 2 lanes with few stretches of short 3 lanes..ATS map is way scaled down because it's a ETS2 with a new map.. In the time of huge open world games this is what ATS brings to the table? roads that end with xxxxx marks you can't drive thru. So devs couldn't lay down roads every where in the game that you can just drive thru instead of being forced to this linear A to B path? Oh cuz the game is such a cpu hog? lol  With this old engine you could drive from mexico to Alaska and across the states.I stayed away from this reskin of ETS2 and only got the game thru twitch giveaway since I rather spend 20$ on a bottle of fireball I'm gonna♥♥♥♥♥♥away the next day.Only reason I still play this now n then is the Peterbilt 351 mod. Great truck great sound.Which brings me to mods. I'd happily pay 40$ to the mod team that made the multiplayer mod, not for this abortion of a game that's gonna have paid dlc's for upcoming states expansion.Get this game thru ATS twitch channels since I always see bunch of em having giveaways. Or if you're a fanboi. I don't ever underestimate fanaticism in people. Just read about someone getting stabbed waiting in line for a $1500 pair of ugly Kanye sneakers..			"

												The game itself is fine and playable as long as you're not familier with the routes...It's plays very much like its Euro Truck counterparts. I myself however couldn't get past the routes.I did a trip from San Diego (where I live) to Bakersfield, CA (Where I was born and rasied and lived until I was 21)and it was just horrible how much was left out and how wrong the freeways were... bottom line if you're not familier with the areas it's just as good as Euro Truck, if you are then it could be a deal breaker(it was for me).

Idling in the MorningIdle questions drift through my mind sometimes (normally when I’m at work and supposed to be having more productive, less idle thoughts).There are a few questions that always plague me when I settle at my desk in the morningsQuestions like:“What am I doing here?”“Why isn’t it lunchtime yet?”and the classic“Is there a microscopic black hole under my desk because I think time has slowed down?”(There isn’t by the way, I’ve checked, although if it really is microscopic I might have missed it).I recite these musings to myself like a kind of depressing mantra every morning, but it’s the afternoons when my thoughts really go off on a tangent.Idling in the AfternoonFor example, have you ever wondered why we have two letters in the English alphabet that make the same noise, C and K?I have....And whilst we’re talking about C, why do we use it to make an S sound in some words?(Circle, I’m thinking of you here)We’ve already got a letter that can make ""Sssss"" Sounds, it’s the letter S, why is C stepping on S’s toes?If C did step on S’s toes, and it turned into a fight, which one would win?Which one would I want to win?Don’t get me wrong, it’s not always that insightful in my mind, that was a good afternoon.Idling my way to RelevanceThankfully a slightly more relevant question occurred to me today, relevant because I was sitting at my desk subtly checking for black holes(I have to be subtle or my colleagues might think I’m weird).Anyway, as I was eyeballing a shady corner of one of my draws for suspicious gravitational anomalies my mind wandered towards thoughts of home (as it often does) and my plans for the evening, plans which included playing American Truck Simulator.Relevant RevelationNow, it’s no secret that I like to zone out with a good long session of European Truck Simulator 2 when time allows so I was looking forward to getting behind the wheel of a “Good Ol’ Big Rig” and trucking in a Zen-like trance across the US of A.It was then that it occurred to me that I didn’t know which was bigger, geographically speaking, Europe or America.As this question was obviously much more important than any actually work I was supposed to be doing, I immediately turned to my friend Google to investigate.Factual FrictionThe problem was Google didn’t seem to know the answer.Keep in mind that whilst at work I have to be just as subtle in my clandestine internet activities as I am in my black hole survey, so I could only really scan the results (whilst the boss wasn’t looking) without opening up any actual web pages.This led to a list of links with snippets of information like “Europe has a slightly larger landmass” and “America is much larger than Europe, France is smaller than Texas”.I decided that as I couldn’t investigate this properly whilst being watched by “the man” (and I was aware that whilst it seemed like a burningly important question when compared the dullness of actual “work” it wouldn’t matter to me in the slightest once I was at home and had more interesting things to do).Fictional FactsAnyway, due to the lack of an immediately accessible answer I decided that they were probably about the same sort of size, a decision which has now become fact in my mind, a fact I’ve made up myself, but a fact none the less.It made sense to me, If SCS had made a trucking game which spanned most of Europe then American Truck Simulator would probably be on the same sort of scale, therefore America must be the same sort of size as Europe, you can’t argue with science like that.These thoughts were still with me when I finally escaped the shackles of work and settled down in front of my PC.Steering wheel and pedals at the ready, I fired up ATS ready for some “Stateside Trucking”Road to RichesFor the uninitiated, American Truck Simulator places you in charge of your own haulage company (as does its sister game Euro-Truck Simulator 2). You start out by choosing where you want to set up your first little base of operations and then you’re master of your own haulage destiny.Unfortunately you don’t start with any money, driving skills or even a truck of your own, you’re going to need to earn, learn and buy these things as you play.Earn and LearnThe “earning and learning” elements initially come from the successful completion of “quick jobs” which you’ll find available to you from the various locales scattered across the map.These jobs vary in length and payment; you’ll find yourself hauling all sorts of cargo across the states.You’re working for the metaphorical “Man” with these jobs though so you won’t earn as much as you would if you were your own boss, but as you haven’t got your own truck when you first start out, running these contracts in the loaner rigs provided is the only way you’re going to earn a buck. When you’ve finished browsing the list of jobs currently available to you, you’ll pick a contract you like the sound of (whether that’s because it pays well, you like the idea of hauling a particular cargo type, or you think it might push some interesting scenery past  your windows).A click of a button later and you’ll find yourself sitting in your borrowed rig; trailer hooked up and destination already set in the sat nav.It’s time to get trucking!Grand Truck AutoNow you’re sitting behind the wheel of a big rig, trundling along the byways and cruising down the highways it’s important to keep in mind that this is a simulation title, not a joy ride in Grand Theft Auto.You’re being paid to complete a delivery job.Running red lights, racing past speed cameras and smashing other vehicles off the asphalt (as tempting as it might be) could result in some hefty fines, if you’re saving up to buy your own rig, this is not a good thing.Does it come with Fluffy Dice?Traffic transgressions aside, you’ll eventually reach a point where you’ve got a tidy sum of money burning a hole in your pocket. Whether this is through the diligent completion of delivery jobs or the quick fix solution of a crippling bank loan is up to you, but sooner or later you’ll find yourself touring the dealerships to pick out a truck of your very own.When you’ve got your heart set on a rig, the dealer is going to tempt you with a wealth of optional extras from the cosmetic to the mechanical and like a kid in a sweetshop; you’re going to want them all.Rig Responsibilities With your chest full of pride and your wallet empty of money, you’ll now be the proud owner of your own truck. It’s time to stop making money for “The Man” and start making it for yourself.You’re no longer tied to the “quick job” market, you can take contracts directly now and cut out the middle man.The downside of this is that now you’re using your own vehicle; you’re going to need to look after it, give it petrol to drink and pay to have it fixed up if it gets “poorly”.You need to look after yourself too, drive for too long without rest and you’re going to get drowsy. Falling asleep at the wheel can really ruin your day (and your truck) so rest stops in lay-bys are a must on long drives.Bigger, Better, Faster, Stronger As well as getting rich from completing all these contracts, there’s also the added bonus of increasing your own driving skills, this is done with an almost RPG like experience levelling system.Complete a contract quickly without smashing up your truck and you’ll gain experience; gain enough and you’ll ...

												I will not lie, I do like this game, but as of yet it just doesn't compare with Euro Truck Simulator 2. Ok, I am aware it is in very early stages and was relelased only 3 days ago, but...there is not loads in it. I have played less than an hour and already come across loads of map edges. In fact, possibly just as many as I have in ETS2 and i have played that for over 200 hours (I just didn't activate the CD Key on steam because I didn't know it was a steam game) So, back to American Truck Simulator. It used the same graphics engine as ETS2 which i think held it back. I have it runing on Ultra / high and it could, for it's era, look a bit better. There is a very limited truck selection at the moment which i am hoping will be rectified in time. Hopefully not too long. I look forward to the map expansion DLC's and i must say, they are needed. Though it takes a while to cover, the map is small, and it feels more like a £14.99 demo, than a game. Originally the game didn't run on my screen resolution so i spent a while trying to fix the home streaming thing so i could fix that on my laptop. It was a pain and initially it crashed a few times, but now i have it working, it seems to be alright. I like the diversity of the cars on the roads, it feels authentic and it's a nice touch to the realism. The terrain does look good, as do the roads, but the lorries don't so much. I actually don't like the look of the trucks in the game at the moment, with the massive bonnets (or for the Americans, probably hoods). I do prefer the ones with a flat front, but hey, maybe they will get added in later, or someone will mod one. All in all the game is very much the same as ETS2 with just the truck types, and the map changed. It is satisfying enough to pass for a new game, but i hope they relese these updates soon. I reccomended this game because i saw potential in it, and i only hope that the game designers won't let us down there. As it is currently, i woud not reccoment it, but i know they will update it, and i have hopes for the future of this game.			"

10/10 Mustang will get on ya on the next intersection (it was actually leaving Cars & Coffe, already rekting pedestrians)AI of cars on intersections is, well... Bad. At least i got the ""Simple No damage"" mod to cover me from it. I can hardly repay my fines (100mph driving :V). In Euro Truck we had radars, here we have a donut eating fat 'murican cop each mile. Oh and, the jobs arent as payable as in ETS 2 Phys and GFX Physics are completely ok, though for me, the steering weel turns a bit slow (im on keyboard). Its basically Euro Truck Sim 2, but with different trucks and map (oh, and less FPS :P) Overall summary its a good game, worth playing the demo and of course, buyign the full version. God graphics that dotn burn your pc (or at least shouldn't, cmon, change that ikea wooden kitchen box pc to a manly thing). I like the concept, thoguh it lacks the ETS 2 radio stations (i know you can change that by modding, but I would like it to be there primarly). Workshop mods made this great even betterGFX - 7/10PHYS - 9/10PLAYABLITIY - 8/10RECOMMEND? YES			"

												Awesome Game! My father is a Truck Driver and my Grandfather retired from Truck Driving a few years ago after 40 years. This Game is fun and addicting and I find myself spending way too much time already making deliveries trying to expand my company. Note: if you don't have a controller or the steering wheel controller. it may take a little time to adjust your steering settings to get the right feel for the handling of the truck with the keyboard. took me a little bit before i got the sweet spot on my settings so i can somewhat control my rig. I'd like to see this in a mutiplayer platform where you can compete against other trucking compaines and stuff. talk on CB radios while traveling together on the roads. "

												First I want to say that American Truck Simulator should have been a thing before Euro Truck. I think everybody agrees that American trucks overall are better than euro trash trucks. Like come on, the flat nose garbage is a stupid design and bothered me the entire time I played euro truck sim. Second, I agree the map is way to small for what the game should have been. The amount of time they had to work on the game they for sure must've had time to increase map development. I'm not trying to pick sides with the haters but I have to agree that SCS is going to release a lot of map DLC because they know people will buy it which I think is pretty a S*H*I*tty thing to do as a company. But overall the game is a blast to play and I would highly recommend this over Euro Trash Simulator. 10/10 for trucks, 6/10 for the map size, 7.5/10 for the detail on the map its self.			"

												After only spending a few hours in ATS, I feel like I've found a game I can just play forever and ever and never get tired of.  I was hesitant about buying it, as I know nothing of trucking, nor did I get into ETS 2 or other similar games, making this my introduction to trucking games.  I took the risk and bought it thanksto a friend, and I can't stop playing.  It is extremely fun and relaxing to just drive and/or listen to the in-game radio.  The game is beautiful!  SCS did an amazing job  with graphic details.I do, however, have a few issues with the game.  These are mostly minor things that don't  take away from the gameplay overall.  I'm thoroughly loving this game.1)  Speeding tickets are 1k each, even if you'ree only going 5 miles over.  That's pretty extreme and not realistic.2) Cops are EVERYWHERE.  I love seeing the cops around, but it gets to be a little too much when every fourth or fifth car you see is a police car.3) I've encountered certain spots in gas stations that the truck simply cannot go over.  I found this out initially when delivering fuel.  My cab could go over the spot, but my trailer wheels would get stuck and force me to skip parking.4) Traffic speeds!  Cars will go much faster than you all the time, even if you're going 55mph, they will fly by you.  If we have a set speed limit, the AI needs one, too.			"

												One of the best simulators out there, hours of fun. With the Rescale project and a few more states and Euro Truck Simulator 2 will be no more.+ Driving feels updated toward ETS2.+ American huge trucks!+ The rescaled game feels more compareable to ETS2, even though some more states could do. But as we all know it take time.- The Anti Aliasing is in need of a huge update. Blurry textures and flashing lines are a way too common problem.- Too much desert, would love to see some non desert states added soon.Wishlist:Customisable Cabin, we still miss accessories as an example.- More to be added			"

												I will not lie, I do like this game, but as of yet it just doesn't compare with Euro Truck Simulator 2. Ok, I am aware it is in very early stages and was relelased only 3 days ago, but...there is not loads in it. I have played less than an hour and already come across loads of map edges. In fact, possibly just as many as I have in ETS2 and i have played that for over 200 hours (I just didn't activate the CD Key on steam because I didn't know it was a steam game) So, back to American Truck Simulator. It used the same graphics engine as ETS2 which i think held it back. I have it runing on Ultra / high and it could, for it's era, look a bit better. There is a very limited truck selection at the moment which i am hoping will be rectified in time. Hopefully not too long. I look forward to the map expansion DLC's and i must say, they are needed. Though it takes a while to cover, the map is small, and it feels more like a £14.99 demo, than a game. Originally the game didn't run on my screen resolution so i spent a while trying to fix the home streaming thing so i could fix that on my laptop. It was a pain and initially it crashed a few times, but now i have it working, it seems to be alright. I like the diversity of the cars on the roads, it feels authentic and it's a nice touch to the realism. The terrain does look good, as do the roads, but the lorries don't so much. I actually don't like the look of the trucks in the game at the moment, with the massive bonnets (or for the Americans, probably hoods). I do prefer the ones with a flat front, but hey, maybe they will get added in later, or someone will mod one. All in all the game is very much the same as ETS2 with just the truck types, and the map changed. It is satisfying enough to pass for a new game, but i hope they relese these updates soon. I reccomended this game because i saw potential in it, and i only hope that the game designers won't let us down there. As it is currently, i woud not reccoment it, but i know they will update it, and i have hopes for the future of this game.			"

												Awesome Game! My father is a Truck Driver and my Grandfather retired from Truck Driving a few years ago after 40 years. This Game is fun and addicting and I find myself spending way too much time already making deliveries trying to expand my company. Note: if you don't have a controller or the steering wheel controller. it may take a little time to adjust your steering settings to get the right feel for the handling of the truck with the keyboard. took me a little bit before i got the sweet spot on my settings so i can somewhat control my rig. I'd like to see this in a mutiplayer platform where you can compete against other trucking compaines and stuff. talk on CB radios while traveling together on the roads. "

												I can't recommend it yet. Not really because the lack of content, graphics, AI of other vehicles or because it's just standalone DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2.The problem is: There are three states for free, others are highly propably sold in packs via DLC. Even some new trucks might be paid in the future. I knew it when I bought it, but I can't recommend it until I see SCS won't charge ridiculous amount of money for DLCs. If they will, there are other ways how to play the DLCs without paying... Who said it? Kickass torrent? The♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ No, I was talking about playing it via my friend's account of course!I will change/update this review after first paid DLC is out.NOTE: Looks like Steam now censors♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥NOTE2: Screw you Steam!Sitrep 01: First paid DLC is out - wheel customization. Really great DLC for game which lack content like trucks and maps. I also downloaded mod from recently added workshop which adds more traffic - this can bring FPS from 60+FPS to 15FPS and it also means often crashes on freeways and intersection, it basically show you how stupid the AI is.Sitrep 02: Arizona is in open beta, looks nice, average scale. Still no word about new trucks. It's almost four months after the release, we only got one new truck and one new state in open beta. Before launch they said - it would be nice to have USA covered in 5 years. With this pace it'll be in 20 years.			"

												I would love to recommend this game, but I just can't. I loved playing Hard Truck 2: Kind of the Road as a kid, I love playing ETS2 now. New game by SCS set in USA, what could go wrong? Well, it did.I mean, map and surrounding is nicely detailed, good job, but this is the only plus for the game. Roads blocked for player for no reason - those could get easily connected with different routes, but no, SCS just HAD TO make this annoying virtual barriers. Half of the cities roads are blocked, despite they are there. Map feels cramped, traveling to destination is too quick.The game itself feels like DLC for ETS 2. Whole user interface is literally copied from ETS 2. Like seriously, is it this difficult to change layout and background of main menu along with texture of Route Advisor? It would help a lot.And I thought this game is made by SCS, not EA. If so, why is it shipped unfinished? Only two trucks to choose from? It is riddiculous, they are not even American Classics, but some streamline modernish crap.We were hyped for new game, yet we got just limited standalone DLC for Euro Truck. Not cool. I probably could've been happy with ATS if it was sold as DLC, but well, it didn't.At this moment I would not buy again. And so, when my buddy asked me if should he get ATS my answer was NO. ""What about ETS2 then?"" he asked. ""Well, go for it"" I replied. Yet, I hope SCS will finish game as they should before release, so they prove me wrong and ensure my money were well spent.			"

												I just made an urgent delivery of a bulldozer to a road that is under construction. There was another one there, ready to be taken away. This leads me to believe that the one being taken away broke down and they urgently needed a replacement to continue the construction.It's the little things that make this game so great, and make it so much different than ETS 2. Yes, there are only 2 states. Yes, there are only 2 trucks (that can be customized to make it more like 4 or more trucks in my opinion). More of both of those are to come in future updates. What is in the game right now is definitely worth $20. In fact, I think it's underpriced, especially considering that the price includes years of updates (ETS 2 released in 2012 and is still being updated - even after ATS is released!). There will be paid DLC for some of the states, simply because of the amount of work that has to be put into each one. SCS Software has to make money somehow, and they definitely deserve it.Also, if there really is not enough content for you, then there are always mods. The game just released days ago and there are already quite a few free mods to enhance your game.Edit: Let me add something else - The game is supposed to look and play like ETS 2. It is not a successor or sequel. It is the same game in America. Both games will still be updated, and each will benefit from the other. If you bought the game expecting any different, then perhaps you should have done your research first, since this has always been the case since they first announced ATS. What is different, like I said, is the little things. The world feels much more alive, and you do actually feel like you have a purpose other than 'drive from this warehouse to that one.'			"

												When viewed as a stand alone game the US$19.99 for a game containing two US states (California and Nevada) and two trucks might seem steep, but there are a few factors to consider. First, SCS has already committed to Arizona and future trucks as free DLC, which is a great long term value. Second, when viewed as a function of the land area open to explore, CA and NV have about 273,000 sq mi of land area, which is about the same as Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Switzerland, and the UK (and we didn't get all of the UK in ETS2). So while 2 states sounds small, it isn't nearly as small as is seems. Finally, because American Truck Simulator uses the same engine as ETS2 we are getting a game that has many of the bugs already ironed out.Overall, ATS is a great value. Especially when viewed as an expansion of the ETS2 world.			"

												Hello well, I got a few hours into this game and i""m already rank 5, I gotta say it's a interesting sensation finally being able to read and understand ""AMERICAN"" Roadways.  City's, Hazard signs, and so on.   I mean in the EU you can understand it once you get a handle on things with your own handbook.  But with stuff that we Americans can read, who's never stepped foot outside of their own state.  It's a good feeling to not be confused.Pro's and Cons to this game.ProsEasy to get into for us Americans who knows not the rules of the road in Europe.Great Graphics Highly customizable.Has a radio setup where you can listen to web radios while you're driving, though it kinda makes me feel like i'm playing ""GTA"" on safemode ya know? No crime lol.Licensed vehicals mostly.  Other than npc vehicals i'm sure they are gathering all proper licenses for each and every individual Trucks available on the US Market.Decent sound quality, Nothing noticable in this than it was in E.T.2.19.99 well, can't really beat that on 1.00 release day.  Especailly when you get two trucks and free skins with it and free Navada map.ConsWell, I have to say, my biggest gripe is MAP SIZE!  I mean come on, they should atleast make it for every 5 hours it takes 30 minutes rl time to drive it.  But KRIPES! I was able to finish a 5 hour drive in less than 10 minutes following speed limet, They aut to extend the map size a litlte further.  or something. I'll probrably find a mod that does that anyway.  I dont' know what else to put down.  It's pretty much the same as in E.T.2. with a twist, That's about it.   My rating for this game is this a solid 7/10 total, B+ for effort, B- for map sizeing.   A+ for USA Settings!			"

												Ok overall a nice game since I am American of course it's nice to finally see the real trucks in a game an not the wanna-be's in ETS... Kidding of course.Anyways definately worth the price of $20 and can't wait for the Arizona DLC to come out..Well aside fromt he game itself and location, the price it right and the expected DLC also.. Could use more types of trucks though, l mean like different year models as well as manufacturers that are related to actual US trucking.Ok cool they ripped trains from train simulator it looks like.. but the names are interesting BFLM instead of BNSF... Bureau of Federal Land Management???? I see what you did there..OK so no right on red? This IS NOT EUROPE for christ sake!Poor horns. Come on American big rigs have multi chime air horns not whats currently in the game... sad.EVERY American Truck has a CB radio, its a staple product for EVERY US Trucker that calles themself a trucker.. We dont expect a usable inteface , just a skin change in the cab and maybe an option to change it at truck dealers or shops..Railroad crossings in the US are not set up like they are in the game to protect all lanes on all sides. if they were then there would not be car - train accidents... Again this is NOT EUROPE! We live in constant adventure over here in the States where it's tempting to tempt fate at the RR crossing..			"

												I found the lack of highway merge area frustrating and with the lack of a responsive braking system you end up hitting cars as you get on the highway.Making turns is a challange as the truck does not feel like it wants to turn until you get below 20 mph.Trucks also don't feel that powerful, you gan get to 60 but the slightest hill and you drop to 50.  ETS2 was much better overall on truck handling. Only two states for doing jobs?  ETS2 had most of Europe in the original download, they could have given us the whole coast line at least.At this time I would not recommend this game to anyone.			"

TL;DRSCS Software is just milking the cow one more time: ATS is just a copy of the old 18 Wheels of Steel series/European Truck Sim with improved graphics and nothing new or exciting... You just throw money at them playing the same thing until you get bored grinding for in-game money to upgrade yo shi t.The GoodWell, if you're a new guy/lass in the truck simulator world, ATS is a good way to spend your hard earned cash and get bored in about 5 hours. You get nice graphics, a decently sized map, somewhat realistic truck handling and ""tons"" of work to do.The BadIf you're like me and have gone through all the truck simulator games from the first 18WoS to this crap, I'll let you know this has nothing over previous titles but improved graphics and smarter traffic. The developer is clearly trying to get some cash one more time from enthusiasts pulling the same maneuver all over again.  I mean, after 3 years since European Truck Simulator was released, they come with a copy of that taking place on the East Side of the USA this time, saying it's their biggest s h i t so far and even more good things are about to happen. Well, the cake is a lie...I know there is copyright work to be done before using real trucks in game, but all they managed to get so far are three fkin truck models... THREE ! And two of them sound and feel exactly the same. There's also no visual damage and everything stays nice and shiny forever, you know, like a truck in the real world. And what do you think they did next? They came up with a 3EUR DLC that allows you to chage rims and tires... fkin rims and tires, mate... just like it's the 2000's again and we all want to play NFS Underground but with trucks this time. I hope the next one adds neons and wings...Seriously, how about adding some realistic damage instead of some percentages shown in tiny boxes next to the truck in diagnose mode? Or, how about the trucks getting dirty, oily or dusty depending where you drive them? Or even better, make the game really put you in the driver's skin; get out of the truck to couple/uncouple the tailer, refuel, repair a flat tire to make the game a bit more tricky to play. It just gets so damn boring after about 5 hours of playtime. And also make sure you use the ingame currency a bit more accurate.... who the hell spends 180K to upgrade to a medium garage but only 100k to upgrade to a really big garage?I can only hope that at least the workshop enthusiasts will put out more trucks and dirty/oily/rusty skins. I lost my faith in SCS. Don't buy this recycled garbage if it's not on sale for about 2 bucks....			"

A do tego czasu musisz sobie z radzić. Poważnie? Dwa ciągniki? OK, rozumiem, licencje, i inne takie. Ale bez przesady, Peterbilt oferuje 3 modele ciągników, Kenworth - 4. A my co dostaliśmy? Jeden Peterbilt i Kenworth i kolejne modele Kena i Peterbilta w DLC. Kiedyś. To jakaś kpina. A gdzie Mack, Volvo, Freightliner, Western Star, etc, etc? To jakiś żart? Sprawdziłem, dziś jest 3 lutego, a nie 1 kwietnia. I to nie jest śmieszne. Oczywiście, gra posiada sporo zalet, klimat np jest świetny. Tyle że w tej chwili to nie ma żadnego znaczenia. CoD bez broni też pewnie miałby swoje zalety, tylko co z tego? Ktoś z Was chciałby grać w CoD-a z nożem? Nie sądzę, choćby nie wiem ile zalet by miał. Smutna prawda jest taka, że SCS kroi 20 euro za niedokończoną grę. Jak dla mnie to najzwyklejsze złodziejstwo i rozbój w biały dzień. Wstyd! Jeśli chcesz kupić ATS to jak najbardziej zrób to, ale nie teraz. Nie bądź głupi jak ja, kup go kiedy SCS go łaskawie skończy robić. Kiedyś. 1/10Call of Duty made by SCS: lot of nazis with MG42 and MP40 against you, and you have a ... knife. Pistol, rifle and grenades you will get in DLC. Someday. Until then you must to deal with it. Really? Two trucks? OK, I understand, licenses, etc. But Peterbilt offers 3 models of tractors, Kenworth - 4. And we what got? One Peterbilt and Kenworth and other one models of Ken & Pete in the DLC. Someday. And where's Mack, Volvo, Freightliner, Western Star, etc, etc? It's some kind of joke? Today is February 3rd, not April 1st, and no, it's not funny. Of course, the game also has lot of advantages, but at this moment it doesn't matter. CoD without weapons also probably would have advantages, but so what? It's would unplayable, like ATS in this moment. The sad truth is that the SCS takes 20EUR for unfinished game, and it's daylight robbery! Shame! If you want to buy ATS - do it, but not now. Don't be a fool like me, buy ATS when they will be finished. Someday. 1/10			"

												You are a truck driver. Your goal is to build your trucking empire, one job at a time. Beginning the game, you'll be introduced to a simple delivery job that explains the controls and acts as a tutorial. Afterwards, you'll be dumped at your garage, tasking with saving up enough money to buy your own truck by doing work for other companies. Eventually, you'll be able to buy your own truck, and gain access to the Freight Market, which pays more than the Quick Jobs from contractors. However, you'll have to pay for your own expenses: damages, fuel, fines, and more. The graphical design of American Truck Simulator echoes the games of its past. While it does attempt to stay current with visual effects like lens flares, godrays and more, ultimately the game's graphics won't impress anybody. The truck models are highly-detailed, and leave little to be desired, but the textures throughout the world are often muddy, low resolution, and can be a bit of an eyesore up close. However, once you're out on the open highway, it's easy to find yourself getting lost in the long winding road ahead of you, with only subtle mountains in the background as a backdrop. The sun beats down on the hot tar below your tires, and it shines up in your face, effectively blinding you if you look just the wrong way.  These graphics, however, are a double-edged sword. While the game does by no means look great, this also allows for lower-end hardware to play the game, and play it well to boot. The game is not very demanding, and even lower-end configurations will not struggle to drive the game. On an NVIDIA GTX 970, paired with an Intel i7-5820k, I averaged 110fps throughout my gameplay. This is with everything maxed, and 400% scaling.  The trucks look good, the backdrops hold up well, but the ground textures, building textures, and AI vehicles look lackluster for a game released in 2016. When put alongside another brand new release, like Rise of the Tomb Raider, you can clearly see that SCS Software was not out to achieve the best in graphical capabilities.American Truck Simulator is, at its heart, a simulation game. As such, it does this very, very well. Bar-none, it is the most realistic driving game available on PC, and likely available, period. That being said, the engine used in this game is the exact same engine in SCS Software's previous installment, Euro Truck Simulator 2.This means that while the simulation in this game is excellent, it's no better than the game before it. Granted, there's little room for improvement in the game, so I see no reason to fix what isn't broken here.  Immediately starting the game, you'll find yourself dropped into a truck. On-screen prompts will walk you through the basics of the interface, and then you'll be on your way. This game has excellent gamepad and wheel support, and they should be a breeze to set up if you prefer it over kb+m. Once you're all set up, it's time to hit the road. You'll immediately notice how much weight you feel in your truck. The steering is heavy, the acceleration is a game of patience, and the laws of the road are ever-present, adding another layer of pressure while you're getting accustomed to your new big rig.  Jobs will require you to take a trailer of contents from one location to the next, and your SatNav will indicate your route. This will be your guardian angel as you trek across the land. Below your SatNav, your miles-to-go is displayed, letting you know how much longer you have left in your drive. You'll need to be particularly mindful of your fuel, and your consciousness. As you drive, these two will drain. If you become too tired, you'll drift in and out of consciousness, and eventually pass out at the wheel, racking up fines as you drive while exhausted. If you run out of fuel, you'll find yourself dead in the water in the middle of the road, with your only option being to pay for a tow truck to the nearest rest stop. The world of American Truck Simulator boasts a plethora of winding roads, hills and dusty back roads to drive across. Each offers a distinct style of gameplay while you head towards your destination. American Truck Simulator™  is a fun game, hindered by a lack of content. While SCS Software plans to release additional trucks and states, in its current state, the game offers little more than a re-skin of its predecessor set in a not-so-interesting location. Fans of the previous game will definitely find many hours of enjoyment, but newcomers are definitely encouraged to look toward the previous title for their first foray into the truck simulation world. Small UI and gameplay improvements are a welcome addition, but it doesn't change enough to make it feel like a new game. With that said, however, it is priced competitively and fairly, and finds itself costing little more than the Scandinavia DLC for the previous game in the series.			"

												The detail is pretty good,and thats it..The scale of the map is small,in a days time you can cove both states and then you bored.The 2 trucks look ok,if you want a new truck,but a used truck dealer would have been the way to mix in some older coe`s and others rigs...The fines are huge,i got a 1800.00 fine for a wreck!!!!! Ai`s are still a pain,to many of them,needed a setting for less ai`s...Speed limit signs are hard to see,and sometimes the speed limits change from 55 mph to 30mph to 55 mph,,,so fast you dont have a chance to slow down or speed up ticket,ticket?????There need to fix alot of things if people are going pay for any more states i think?I am one of them..Nice try SCS..Oh,,now my ETS2MP is really messed up with SCS adding ATS to it somehow,,Oh by the way,i have drivin over 1 million miles in the usa,,with a truck,,you cant bs me..

												The graphics of this game is very good but very limited to the amount of two trucks due to the licensing and you'll get two states (California and Nevada) and soon to be three which is Arizona in the free update. This game uses a engine which is simular to Euro Truck Simulator 2. The fines are more expensive than it was in ETS2 and bascially this is about trucking under the law (like most SCS trucking games were about) because if you think you want to break the law then you'll go bankrupt in minutes. This game also adds police cars but you won't be forced to be pulled over if they see you break any traffic laws.			"

												Ok... ATS is a great game, don't get me wrong here but there is still a lot of work to be done to get this game up to standards. The number of police I see on the road is crazy, the fines they give out too are quite harsh but I do like how they put their sirens on when you go over the speed limit. There are lots of great features in this game such as the tumbleweed, which is a great touch.The bugs... wow, don't get me started... The game often crashes on load despite all my drivers being up to date and my PC is perfectly adequate with a GTX 970 and an intel i7 4790kAnother stupidly annoying thing is how all my save games seem to dissappear... They are all clearly in my savegames folder yet don't appear on my game.The scaling of the game is horrible. Why it takes such a short time to get places, I don't even know. ETS2 is much better scaled compared to this.The fact that there are only two states in the game is quite frustrating but I feel that SCS may be planning to add more states as DLC content like ETS2 Going East and Scandinavia.If you are thinking of getting this game, I recommend waiting a month or two for SCS to sort out the many bugs in the game and to add some more content to the game before buying it.Overall I will rate this game 4/10 Mainly because of it's many bugs and issues.

												Pros:   - Awesome Scenery   - Same great handling physics from ETS   - Plays nice with Keyboard, Xbox Controller or Wheel   - AI seems to be a bit better   - Playing the Classic Rock Radio while driving down a lone empty highway in Nevada? Amazing!Cons:   - Lack of content.             - Only (2) Trucks on release as well as (2) states; even for 20 bucks that's pushing it.   - Speed limits seem odd, they change to rapidly in / out of cities. Cops are unforgiving and you'll get a fine for going   3MPH over. AI is also unrealistic in this respect, instantly changing speed from 55MPH down to 35.   - Lack of On Ramps. Has anyone from SCS every been on an American Highway? There's a leadup to gain speed! ATS just dumps you directly onto the highway with no merge zone.  Overall, a fun game. If you enjoyed Euro Truck, but wanted the American Trucks and maps, this game is for you! I've had a great time so far besides the above mentioned cons, and looking forward to what SCS and mods will bring! "

This is my opinion of the game as it stands.After spending just a few hours in game this is what I think.If you liked ETS2 you will like this, it is exactly the same with a few added updates (apart from truck models).Whats the same?Driving is the same.Business management is the same (none existant).Graphics are the same, (LOD levels need tweeking for longer view distance in LOD 0 (closest on ultra settings)).Menus are the same.EverythingWhats new?New parking selection (skip, easy and slightly harder than easy).Weigh bridge (annoying pull in at weigh bridge, stop and press enter to pass).New locations to drop off at (not many new places to drop off at mind you).Police (basically speed cameras have been taken out and put in mobile cars).What could make the game better for me?More business managementOwn trailers (maybe drop off a trailer in your yard and get AI to complete job, just a suggestion).Change the map scale (takes no time at all to drive 1000 miles).Fix the AI from pulling out of junctions infront of me.Use a better materials for assets (mode detailed and more up to date).Police cars can detect you speeding on the other side of teh carrage way!!.is it worth £15?In my humble opinion YES BUT BUT more work needs doing on the engine itself to make the game more enjoyable to me I would like to see these two things.Owning trailers.More business management (thi is no 1).

American Truck Simulator... Is it worth it?Review written on 04/02/16American Truck Simulator is basically Euro Truck Simulator 2, set in the West coast of the USA. So if you didn't like Euro Truck Simulator 2, you're probably not going to enjoy this Sim.General jist of the game (For New Players)So just like ETS2, you start off by creating your new, exciting delivery company and character. You then take on a few quick delivery jobs around California and Nevada (More states coming soon). Eventually, you can get loans which then allow you to purchase your own truck so you can do freight jobs where you use your own equipment. (You get more money for this)You can then upgrade your garage to allow more spaces for employees, buy more trucks and hire employees to make more money. There is a skill tree and as you level and progress through the game, you can unlock delivery jobs such as hauling Dynamite, gassess and whatnot.The ProsThe game is highly addictive if you're the type of person that gets satisfaction from a mundane task; it's the thought of developing your own company and working really hard to get by which is really fun. After quite a few hours on this game already, I can tell I'm quite hooked and I find that driving around isn't as boring as it looks.The driving is just as good as ETS2, the physics are really decent and it's pretty damn realistic. But then again, I'm not a truck driver, so how would I know?More content coming soon! This game only has 2 states so far and only two truck brands, but more is on the way, such as the Arizona state and a few more truck brands.The ConsThis game like every other Simulator, is a massive grind and I can see myself eventually getting bored or tired of repeating myself. But you've got to remember, it is a Simulator and you're supposed to work hard for little reward.The lack of states in this game is slightly dissapointing as you feel like there should be more places to go, however I found that after my current play time, I have seen a lot and there's still a lot to see. There are also only two car brands which is a shame as there's not much choice in what truck to buy at the start. It's 50/50 chance you'll get the same truck as me.Speed Limits! Every country has them, but God damn! I want to scream when I'm in a 55 Mph zone when you could clearly do 70! And don't get me started on the 30 Mph limit, it's so painful!ConclusionIf you fancy giving the game a go, why not? It's really good for the price of £14.99 and I'd reccommend at least trying it. Please remember, it is a Simulator and can be boring; if you're the type of person that just wants to get going immediately and shoot people, this isn't for you.I am enjoying the game a lot and had to force myself to come off so I could make the badge. I'm going to go to bed, wake up, go to college, go home, and play this all evening... Again. "

												Fun?  Sure.  Simulator?  Not really. While it's a fun game, I have this and Euro Truck 2, there's a lot that needs to be improved to the ""American"" roads in this game.  To me, it appears that they just re-used assets from Euro.  Which is fine unless you're actually familiar with American roadways...  I always assumed that these strange road designs were how Euro roads are, I've never been there so I don't know.  The fact that the same strange designs are in the American version just IRKS me.  I'm torn because I like the game but the fact that these exist just exudes a level of laziness by the devs.  Google street view exists!Short SHORT interstate on-ramps, at a 10% or better grade and end right at the top?!  Not realistic!  I'm doing (max) 20 mph at the top of the ramp trying to merge into 80mph traffic?  Holy hell batman.There are some ramps I have to cross into oncoming traffic to turn right onto because there's a guard rail right on the white line?  What the actual ♥♥♥♥?!  Who puts a guard rail on the inside of a flat corner people are going 5-10mph around???  Not realistic.Guard rails and Concrete medians/barriers that simply just start without the crumple pads?  Not realistic.Guard rails and Concrete medians/barriers that are literally RIGHT on the yellow line?  Not realistic.The stop lines in some intersections are out WAYYY too far.There are a ton of 80mph roads in American truck simulator and that's not realistic.  The highest limit in Cali is 70, Nevada and Arizona are 75.If you miss your exit, instead of the GPS actuallly re-routing you, it does nothing.  Basically tells you ""Hey, go back the other way"".  Like you're going to make a U-Turn on an interstate.Why are my brakes not set when I hop into a hired truck?I waffle on my recommendation for this game, I wish there was a sideways thumb for a ""maybe"".  I'd recommend if you don't care about it's complete disregard of American roadway accuracy...  This is a trucking game.  You'd think accurate roadways would have been top priority.			"

												Step up in detail from ETS2 especially in the impressive towns/cities that are infinitely more impressive than in ETS2. Las Vegas looks like Vegas, LA like LA and so on. I noticed that they have even paid attention to certain minor details like making sure the police in certain cities have the correct liveries on their vehicles. I hate the idea that we've only got two states to drive in as I'd love to explore the varied geography that the USA has to offer but I'm sure this will be improved with DLC within the next few months. If you liked ETS2 then I'd suggest this title, I understand the criticism that this is more or less a re-skin of the previous title but to me it feels very different and I prefer this game.			"

												I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an immersive experience.While I am not a car junky, I do enjoy driving across the country with only the sound of police sirens wailing as I breeze past them at a completely reasonable 90 miles per hour.When a fellow American decides to stop moving because there is a red light, I sometimes exercise my rights by pushing said bystander and their vehicle onto the side walk with my 10 tons of freedom.Sometimes people decide to slow down with a semi-truck behind them and you as the driver have to decide whether or not you will teach them a lesson or deal with a concussion as your truck flips 90 degrees and slides a quarter mile down the highway.You'll also experience crippling debt as you work literally 24 hours a day 7 days a week just to pay off the truck you purchased on money lended to you. Expect a greedy police officer around every corner to steal yet another $1,400 just for going a measly 40 mp/h above the speed limit.I love this game. It taught me to never become a truck driver or I would end up overdrafting my bank account 3 times a day 7 days a week, as well as suffer daily concussions due to my truck flipping at least twice a day.

												I took a whole new aproach to playing ATS than I did in ETS2.  In ETS 2 I went for world domination so to speak.  I have all the drivers with upgraded trucks working for me with over 100 of them at level 10.  All the garages maxed out.  All acheivements done and all the money in the world with nothing really to spend it on.  The game became a bit boring because I had nothing to achieve.  I still had fun delivering loads but not like before.In ATS I decided to not hire any drivers and instead work hard to save enough to buy my truck and etc.  Its amazing how much harder the game is when you have to worry about not getting tickets or in accidents.  I am enjoying the new approach to the game.Now the game is in good playable condition but not in perfect shape yet and content is on the low side but I have no dought SCS is going to continue improving the game, adding content wheither free or dlc and etc.  They know they have a winner with lots of room to grow as long as they play their cards right with what they plan to charge for as dlc and what will be free.

												I love European Truck Simulator 2, no doubt - smooth playing, no major glitches, wonderful way to spend time. Still, ATS didn't feel the same as ETS2, just located in USA, which I was expecting at first. Tried the demo earlier, which didn't feel that much different, but the actual game was a refund case on my account - even when bought from sale. There are probably some issues with the Xbox360 controller drivers as I coudln't get it work right out of the box the same as ETS2 and there could be some other details of programming of the game play that differ, something that tells ATS that little different from ETS2 to spoil the first impression. And I'm very sorry to have to say this..About the looks of the game, the American style trucks are rather heavy on  visual details, thus the graphics might need more oomph on the GPU to look real good. More minimalistic European trucks are easier to render and look more ""natural"" and eye pleasing with less GPU power - which is an important point to consider. Also the cabins of the US trucks are a bit problematic because of their design, don't quite fit on a single HD monitor, thus side mirrors stay out of picture unless you zoom the cabin view to near max, causing the front window to narrow down quite a bit.I will wait if there will  be a major update with some of these issues smoothed out, especially the gamepad compatibility to have another look at ATS, until then will stick with ETS2 and its DLCs, and maybe some independent mods too on top of that.I can still recommend ATS with the above reservations taken into account and if you're not already familiar with ETS2 - or if you for some reason just don't like Europe particularly, or just prefer ""America first"" in general (joke) - otherwise, think of ETS2 as the game to go to first.

												It is not dramatically different (or really any different at all) from European Truck Simulator 2, but that is a good thing. There are some changes - cops are aggressive and will ticket you more often, for example - but otherwise it plays the same way. It was a little disappointing to only have CA and NV to start with, but AZ is coming soon for free and they will keep expanding it. It is just as additive as ETS2, and just as oddly calming. It makes me realize that I would be an absolutely terrible truck driver. Great price, great game, and a great company behind it. Definitely buy it.			"

												This game is really good. It runs really well on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop with an Intel Family Graphics Card. My only problem with it is that the engine is the same, and the render distance isn't great on medium. Would reccomend to anybody who liked Euro Truck.			"

												Long time fan of ETS2, and I have to say I've really enjoyed what I've played of ATS.  Sure it's not as large as ETS2, but that's an unfair comparison when I consider how far ETS2 has come (as a result of developers and fans).  Considering the fact that  ETS2 is still growing, I can only imagine what ATS will look like in time.That said, there is more than enough content and polish already present in ATS for me to recoomend it.  If you've played ETS2 or are a fan our simulation games, then you have to take a look at ATS.  It's a great game that will give you a solid return of entertainment for your money.Do yourself a favor and take the plunge!			"

												I think it needs more trucks, otherwise it runs very good on a good pc. I enjoy playing with my steering wheel it makes it much easier to drive. The graphic are amazing, from the fog on the golden gate bridge to every crack in the road this game just looks truly great. So overall besides for the low amount of trucks at launch this game is 8/9.			"

												The game is amazing! If you have the PC power you will appreciate the graphics in game, gameplay is smooth with little to no freezing, even after trying on a lower end PC. The only thing I wish is that SCS worked a bit harder on getting more trucks into the game before release. Other than that great game and I would recomned 10/10!			"

												OK where to begin, This game is awesome. I have come over from ETS 2 so i knew what to expect and what not to expect. There is not alot of difference in the games, but then again is there truely alot of difference in driving big rigs in Europe and North America? You move cargo from this city to that city for a transportation fee. On the flip side youve promised to transport it and delieve it as youve picked it up or you face penalties. Now as ive seen people complain a little bit about lack of content. You are very much right, there isn't alot here.. YET.. i think if we can expect half of the love the SCS has put into ETS 2 we will be more than pleased. And for those that say they dont want the DLC's and for content to be thrown in for free, Realize that SCS has released this in knowing there wasnt alot and have adjusted the price accordingly. $20 is not a bad price and i was more than happy to pay. i believe as the game is, it is worth $20.  I personally will be willing to pay for Reigons (the mountain states, the midwestern states, the east coast) and different trucks (although i believe they will be added in free of charge) So as a final verdict, I give this game a solid 7/10 The game is what they say it is, and this score will rise once the rest of the game has fleshed out more in reigons and trucks.

												I'm going to say this outright, for those giving it a bad review and otherwise putting the game down, we all need to realize the reason the game is here in this condition is because we where pushing for it, we kept asking for it and nudging SCS for it and really put on the preasure to get this game out. I'm not going to claim its bad, its very good - But i am going to say at this point it should be labeled or treated as a early access game.The game plays and feels very much like ETS2 - which is good, its better to have a familiar feeling game then a game that has entirely new everything and makes it so returning players have to learn everything all over again, its on a very simular engine, i believe slightly updated, so we can expect the same modding community that made ETS2 massive and awesome to do the same for ATS. And for those saying its a EA games style thing, make a complete game, then rip everything out and sell it all back as DLC to milk more money out of it - i feel SCS isnt going to do this, they may charge for future dlc or may not, that is something only time can tell, however the prices are most likely going to be low (as they where for ETS2) and most if not all players can afford 90% of the DLC without issue. Considering the Quality of the game and the quality of the community behind it, i think we should be proud and consider ourself lucky that we get this the way we do. Remember: We asked for this, they had gotten the game to a position they where comfortable in giving us access to it - and now all i can see if people complaining that they didnt get enough or exactly what they expected. I feel we need to cut SCS a break, and we shouldn't make them feel that they've got their foot in a pile either way they go.			"

												""The Freerider""~ By Robertson Crusoe""Whenever I take a job, may it be heavy load or a simple drive, I feel strange. I would always turn my head and see my bed behind the drivers seat and I know I am already home. Because my home is where I am. I would turn the radio on and listen to classic rock. Than I would turn on the engine and drive my truck through valleys and fields and towns and unknown places. Cars will pass me. Some will vanish in the rearview as the cities fade out when I leave them. And I drive and I am free.But than I wake up. I see the clock and know the alarm clock will go off soon. And I realize that I am caged and that I am just sitting in front of a screen showing me a life that I don't have but that I always desired. And my 9 to 5 job calls me and I work papers I don't understand and I don't connect. And I am a servant to my income. To pay for my home. But when I am back home, I will turn the engine on again and ride freely through a place that only exists in my dream.I am the freerider. And I am already home. Home.""			"

												So I do like this game quite a bit. It's rather a good time killer but to be honest I don't think that in good conscience recommend this game at this time.Pros:- Real big rigs, not those sorry excuses for rigs in ETS.- A lot of cool things to make your truck your own- Most of the content is free at some point- Good Dev team.Cons:- Drive over train tracks any faster than 20mph and your truck flips and causes 100% damage to tractor and trailer- 4 Tractors- Small map over all even with one of the biggest states in the USA included- Cops give you tickets for anything other than perfection, even if you wipe your♥♥♥♥♥the wrong way- Weigh stations with no other purpose than to annoy you and give you more tickets- Bad sounds that are not close to being real- No shifter when using manual trans- Never dark enough to really make your lights useful at all- Can only sleep in designated areas and not on the side of the road as you would be able to in real life if you had to- AI drivers crash into you constantly even if you are sitting still at a red light- Many things are extremely over priced or under pricedWhile I do rather enjoy this game it is hard to get past some of the stupidness of the way it currently is. Over all it plays more like an Early Access or Alpha/Beta stage game. Buy at your own risk and desire.			"

Great game, amazing attention to detail given the fact its considered an Indie Game. Lots of potential; this said because it is ""American Truck Simulator"" and we only have 2 states (as of 2/10/16). Does not even make up the south-west of america. Regardless for the price it is still an exlent game you should absolutely have in your library.			"

												Short version - Like Eurotruck Simulator 2, except in America. If you liked ETS2, you'll like ATS.As is, at release, the ATS map is pretty darn small, averaging 600 to 700 miles end-to-end. Yeah if I manually configure the SatNav to go into smaller, undiscovered roads, I might get 900 miles... maybe.Personally, I somehow find that American important locations in towns and cities, as depicted in the game, are spread too far apart. You can drive a couple of minutes to get to the company you want to take a job for, or to get to a service centre to get your truck repaired/upgraded. This eats into you ""awake time"" in the game, and you start yawning very quickly (to me) while on the road.Plus, rest stops seem to be rather scarce in America when compared to Europe. Good thing is, you don't get fined for not sleeping. Speed limit signs are almost non-existent. Woe be to you if you were in the process of slowing down from 70 to 30 when approaching a city, and a cop car happens to pass you - you get fined.....EVEN WHEN YOU'RE SLOWING DOWN.On the up-side - No speed cameras :) "

Posted: February 15, 2016
												I just barely recommended this game, and my opinion is subject to change as the game progresses; but as of now, my review is as follows.I am an American trucker. I have been for a while now. I own my own rig. I run all 48 states, plus Canada and Alaska. I played ETS2 more than any other game in the past 30 years. (even more than super mario) I loved that game. It was the first simulation game for trucking that came anywhere near the real thing. Now, I do not live in Europe. I cannot say how similar it actually is to true Euro Trucking. Well, this is American Truck Simulator and I am an American trucker, so certain things do stick out to me. For one, no where in the USA, will you have an interstate with a state road just turning into it. You'll never find that. You will have a long on ramp and off ramp for these. Every single time. There are no splits in the interstate. Also, the layout of the truck stops is way too similar to ETS2, and nowhere near similar to true American truck stops. Yeah, I see that there are some legal issues dealing with naming the big truck stops (Loves, Petro, Pilot, Flying J, TA), but don't take something that is never a truck stop (Chevron) and turn it into one. Also, you'll never find a truck stop that just turns off of the interstate. You'll always take an exit, go a few blocks down and then it will be all by itself or surrounded by other buildings. I was really hoping that this would be more accurate. Some truckstops are challenging, while others are a cake walk. However, you will never find a truck stop that pulls off of the interstate like a rest area, and you will never find a truck stop with parallel parking. It will always be back in parking.Now onto the trucks. I get it, the game is new. But why only 2 trucks to start out with? Maybe I'm playing it wrong, but maybe not. I'm not going to touch too much on this; but I will say I hope to see more trucks appear very soon. (Not just models, but other makes also)My biggest beef, besides the interstate shortcomings, is the fact that the game devs decided to put this in California. (Or as some truckers call it, Commiefornia) This is the single worst state to drive a truck in. It is far from the ""American spirit"" in regards to trucking. It has the slowest speed limit, the highest emissions laws, and the most corrupt state Department of Transportation in the country. If this game were to really see the heart of American trucking, they should have started it off in the Midwest or the South. Anywhere from Kansas to Texas would have been best. Something with a high agriculture outport, high manufacturing, and even high livestock. But no, we had to go with California, who imports most of what they ship from China. Oh well, I can only hope that more states will be added, and soon. I see that Arizona is next on the list to be released, and I am just curious as to what cities they are planning on introducing, and what they believe actually ships out of Arizona. Should be interesting to see. I really also wish that the backing in the game was harder. I see that it has gotten more difficult from ETS2, but it is FAR from being accurate with some of the shippers and receivers around this country. How about some 90 degree blind side alley backs? Or how about some blindside parallel parks for flatbeds? These are what truckers have to deal with daily here; so why not throw a few, or a ton, of them into the game? It would add more of a challenge while, at the same time, becoming a bit more realistic.Now, I did give this a ""yes I would recommend"" vote. It is a fun simulation, and for what it's worth, the simulation is fairly accurate. You won't find a better trucking simulator out there. Hell, even trucking schools have worse software to teach people how to drive a truck. This is a cheap game, at only $20, but it has amazing potential. I hope to see this game live up to my expectations, especially after having waited so long to get it. If you are not a trucker, this game will be great for you. If you are a trucker, you'll find the same gripes about it as I did; but you'll still play it.			"

												This game, what can I say? I was expecting to pay £30 but same price as ETS2 :o Graphics are soo beauiful and comparably improved than ETS2! Thanks to ATS being 64-bit supported it is far quicker at loading saving and overall responsiveness has improved far better than ETS2, even in ATS MP it is far better! Also, the locations to deliver your load are varied and can be challenging (dependant on what you pick) than one drop-off place in ETS2. So why wait? Buy this awesome game and support the awesome company that is SCS! GG to SCS :D			"

												I have played many of the trucking sims out on the market for many years.  Then about a year ago I bought Euro Truck Sim 2.  Very quickly found that I enjoyed the realism in the driving experience and really appreciated the Dev Group's work on improving and adding more maps and trucks to the game.  So when American Truck Simulator was announced I didn't hesitate.  SCS has not let me down at all with this newest version of their work.  Many people will complain about lack of truck choices and map size at the moment.  Please put it into perspective,  It takes time to get licenses to show the actual different makes of trucks in this game.  Most companies want their equipment painted in the best possible light so SCS has to make sure to do their best work on every truck, not just looks but function and capabilities.  As for the map some are saying that the highway driving doesn't seem long enough but please realize when the full USA is complete it will take an estimated 1 hr or more of real time to go coast to coast.  This is because of the sheer size of our country.  At this point I have zero complaints with the game and am just patiently waiting for the new updates that will come.  I do have some things I would like to see in the American version of this game but will post it to Dev's.P.S.  I am a real life OTR Trucker so if I can enjoy it then you can too.			"

												ATS  may only have two maps & two trucks , looking at the overal map that is currently blank more is in the pipe line.SCS have already stated that new maps will follow & for now they are free.There  are a few on going licencing issue's both with city names & Truck makes.SCS have a well proven record of bringing knew trucks to their games free as they gain the rights to use the name's.Though I am not sure about just how much of the map content will be free , & in that respect it could be like its older brother ETS2 where some of the maps were pay for DLC at a good price.SCS support is one of the best out there & as been since day one.I am sure this game will grow in very much the same way ETS 2 as over its life time.I most respects ATS as improved over ETS 2 both looks wise & playing wise .I agree that the time scaling needs tweaking to give a better feeling for the scale of driving in the USA.The weather looks better than ETS 2 the  detail looks better even if its based in a very dry part of the USA .The two truck look good drive ok after spend year playing ETS 2 driving these bigger long trucks & trailers takes some getting use to .That also reflects in the new parking system that gives you three options & an scaled amount of XP for the choice of trailer parking you decide to make.Though you are limited for load types & trailer types  as well as truck types , this balance can be adressed by the Large modding community that as grown along side SCS & it Truck game's Here you will find maps  given time , but for now even after only a few days since launch there are already  several truck types that can be added along with knew trailers  . cars . sounds & game tweaksThis as always been the strongest part for the game type & SCS have always supported modding & I hope its stays that way.For the low price you are paying here you get a good trucking based sim built on the same  quality that SCS have showns us in the past with all there Trucking game'sIts may be small but they have started out with Licenced content pritty much a first as far as know for one of their  game'sAs I seem to remember their first few  Euro based truck games shiped with unreal truck names & it took several versions of those games to get the licences for the rights to use those brands.So ATS will grow over the year now just like ETS 2 as into the game it is now.SCS will listen to players feed back & improve the game play and features , & I am sure the modders with do the same.Buy it .It a lot of fun & It will only get better.Pro Fair price for the size & content.SCS are one of the best devlopers around when it come's to support & developing their games.ATS should be no different when it comes to modding and already as several mods to download or in development.The game runs well out of the box even on older hardware like I am using.ConsLimited trucks types.Only two maps.Time scaling feels unbalanced.But nothing that I could makes the game not worth buying .If you like trucks or just want some relaxing driving then this is as good as it gets.

												 I have over 100 hrs on ETS2, so I thought I'd write about my experiences with ATS.I live in Canada, so playing ETS2 was fun, but I had no clue whether or not what I was seeing was realistic or authentic. Now, since Canada and the US have very similar city layouts and stores, I was able to judge more ffectively whether or not what I was seeing was convincing. I was delivering a load and saw I was taking it to a grocery store. A big name grocery store, exactly like the ones I've seen accross the US and Canada. Something about this rather mundane experience seemed so immersive and realistic.The building of the store, the parking lot out front, and the loading dock in the back. Now to address the criticism of the lack of content. I do not fault them one bit. I don't want to steal the words of Daniel Hardcastle (Nerd3) so I'll summarize his explanation in this review, as he framed it in the most convincing manner I have heard yet. ETS2 has 2 previous games worth of content behind it, ETS and German Truck Simulator. This is a completely new venture, and the cities are much more fleshed out than in ETS2. So whereas only a few cities actually had many roads, now even smaller cities have a ton of roads and actual area you can drive around in, as opposed to seeing the rest in the distance.At the end of the day, it is NOT a revolutionary change from ETS2. But to anyone who complains of that, I have no idea what you were expecting. Overall, it's a good looking, reasonably priced and actively developing game and I can't be more excited for the future!

If they ever fix this I will absolutely change my review to recommend this game, as when it works it is loads of fun.  I had never played ETS2 so I couldn't compare this to that, my gripes about in-game playing would be fines way too high and double if a cop sees you run a red light or hit someone (like it's more illegal if a cop sees you do it) but enforcement can now be turned off.  I do hate the stop lights in the middle of the interstate...and why they put spawn points for AI vehicles at a T junction to an interstate I'll never know.  The only way to actually get on the interstate from here is to pull out, slowly, in front of traffic and force them to stop.Also the wheels of the truck while turning only turn the full degrees while stopped, not sure what that's about.  When you hire drivers and they 'couldn't find a job, $950 in fuel costs', seems odd that they don't know how to use a phone or the internet.  If SCS wants to limit funds I think it would be more realistic to have a message say, 'XXX called in sick today and could not work'.For some reason, regardless if you are in NV or CA, you seem to be driving uphill both ways.

												As a fan of Euro Truck Simulator 2, I really like American Truck Simulator after 20 hours of playing.Compared to ETS2, there are some new game elements such as roaming police cars (giving speeding tickets if they're near you) and different parking possibilities (harder spots for more XP or easier spots for less XP).However, by far the biggest difference is the world map. Although it isn't very large yet (only California and Nevada for now), it is beautifully designed. Both cities and remote areas (e.g. in Nevada) feel much more authentic compared to ETS2.Mostly the same gameplay, yet in a beautiful new world with the promise of many (paid) map expansions to come... Highly recommended for fellow ETS2 fans.			"

												I played the crap out of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and have been waiting for this game like crazy.  ATS is even more beautiful than ETS2 and it's really nice to see familiar territory!  I have a few minor quibbles here and there (severely condensed land scale, weird things like yield signs on freeway onramps (???), freeways (like the 15 and the 5) that normally have 3+ lanes in the real world only having two in-game, missing favorite freeways (was hoping that the 210 for the IE and the 78 for North County would make it in), the game shipping with only two states and only two truck brands), but I still feel that ATS is a solid enough offering for the price point they chose.  Thanks SCS!			"

												Very great improvement from ETS2!SCS Software really upped their game with this one. The buildings, scenery, vehicles, and roadside objects look even better. They went so far that they even implemented the box vans that UPS and FedEx use ito the game! The gameplay is hands down amazing. The trucks look EXTREMELY realistic and they drive like the real thing (if you're using a steering wheel). The sounds are also spot on.One thing I really like is the implementation of police cruisers that will surprise you and sound their siren when you try the old speed-on-the-highway move from ETS2.Long story short: ATS = ETS2 x 9000 + MERICA!

												So I decided that my Haulage company, Freddytrux, should start trading in the US of A. Well I must say that this English upstart, Freddytrux USA, has been finding trading conditions slightly difficult. Oh to be able to import a good old Swedish Volvo instead of the insipid Kenworth or Peterbilt trucks. Hopefully as Freddytrux USA grows then the options on the available trucks will become better.The rozzers, or as the locals call them, the cops, seem to be incredibly mean handing out all sorts of traffic offence fines or insistant demands to be weighed. (sorry officer, I need to cut down on the pork pies.) And then there's the rather strange affair of vehicles turning right on a red light, pray tell, what is that all about? I guess it's legal though, because no rozzers have issued a demand on Freddytrux USA's limited funds for it.The user interface will be familiar to ETS2 players, but I did get caught out on the delivery procedure a couple of times, as that is new to ATS, but that's my own fault for skipping the tutorial bit about it. I wanted to crack on and get my Kenworth rolling. The scenery looks kind of nice despite running the game on a toaster spec laptop, and surprisingly the game tends to run smoothly with only minimal lagging. I'm guessing that some creative licence has been used in much the same way as ETS2. So far only California and Nevada are covered with Arizona coming soon, LA to The Big Apple hauls could be a while yet.There are some improvements that could be made, more trucks to choose from and more states to drive through although my understanding is that these issues a currently being looked at. And how I would love to be able to import my cabover Volvo FH16 GlobetrotterXL from ETS2.ATS is still recommended by me though. It's as immersive as ETS2 with new trucks to drive and new roads to explore. Must run, I have a cargo of frozen fruit needed in LA. Never fear, Freddytrux USA is here.(30th Dec '16) Arizona is now included and has been for some time, now you can visit the Grand Canyon by truck, take a detour for some sightseeing. The Vovo FH16 Globetrotter XL is in too, that one is on the workshop as are a couple of other US and European types. Since I wrote my original review there have been several updates and the aforementioned Workshop support for a range of easy to add Mods of all manners.I still recommend ATS, Freddytrux USA is expanding, slowly for sure but expansion is coming along. Well I really should get on. ""Gasolene"" to the Americans, Petrol to me, is needed Tucson way. Once more unto the breach go Freddytrux USA. Why U-Haul when Freddytrucks can take the load.			"

												This game is really fun! A bit dissapointing that there's only two trucks and two states at the moment, but hopefully that'll get updated soon! A problem I did have to begin with is the fact that there's no speed signs. Is that how it is in America IRL? (I'm Australian, there's speed signs everywhere here) But once I got used to where the speed changed, it wasn't too bad.Aside from some minor glitches I've found (Like headlights shining through bridges) the game is brilliant. Feels odd, since it looks visually similar to ETS2, but I like the change of scenery. Now we need a Truck Simulator by SCS based in Australia/New Zealand. Road Trains, B-Doubles, European and American trucks, city, desert, country, etc. That would be cool! (Oceanic Truck Simulator since calling it ATS would get confusing with this game XD)			"

												ATS  may only have two maps & two trucks , looking at the overal map that is currently blank more is in the pipe line.SCS have already stated that new maps will follow & for now they are free.There  are a few on going licencing issue's both with city names & Truck makes.SCS have a well proven record of bringing knew trucks to their games free as they gain the rights to use the name's.Though I am not sure about just how much of the map content will be free , & in that respect it could be like its older brother ETS2 where some of the maps were pay for DLC at a good price.SCS support is one of the best out there & as been since day one.I am sure this game will grow in very much the same way ETS 2 as over its life time.I most respects ATS as improved over ETS 2 both looks wise & playing wise .I agree that the time scaling needs tweaking to give a better feeling for the scale of driving in the USA.The weather looks better than ETS 2 the  detail looks better even if its based in a very dry part of the USA .The two truck look good drive ok after spend year playing ETS 2 driving these bigger long trucks & trailers takes some getting use to .That also reflects in the new parking system that gives you three options & an scaled amount of XP for the choice of trailer parking you decide to make.Though you are limited for load types & trailer types  as well as truck types , this balance can be adressed by the Large modding community that as grown along side SCS & it Truck game's Here you will find maps  given time , but for now even after only a few days since launch there are already  several truck types that can be added along with knew trailers  . cars . sounds & game tweaksThis as always been the strongest part for the game type & SCS have always supported modding & I hope its stays that way.For the low price you are paying here you get a good trucking based sim built on the same  quality that SCS have showns us in the past with all there Trucking game'sIts may be small but they have started out with Licenced content pritty much a first as far as know for one of their  game'sAs I seem to remember their first few  Euro based truck games shiped with unreal truck names & it took several versions of those games to get the licences for the rights to use those brands.So ATS will grow over the year now just like ETS 2 as into the game it is now.SCS will listen to players feed back & improve the game play and features , & I am sure the modders with do the same.Buy it .It a lot of fun & It will only get better.Pro Fair price for the size & content.SCS are one of the best devlopers around when it come's to support & developing their games.ATS should be no different when it comes to modding and already as several mods to download or in development.The game runs well out of the box even on older hardware like I am using.ConsLimited trucks types.Only two maps.Time scaling feels unbalanced.But nothing that I could makes the game not worth buying .If you like trucks or just want some relaxing driving then this is as good as it gets.

												 I have over 100 hrs on ETS2, so I thought I'd write about my experiences with ATS.I live in Canada, so playing ETS2 was fun, but I had no clue whether or not what I was seeing was realistic or authentic. Now, since Canada and the US have very similar city layouts and stores, I was able to judge more ffectively whether or not what I was seeing was convincing. I was delivering a load and saw I was taking it to a grocery store. A big name grocery store, exactly like the ones I've seen accross the US and Canada. Something about this rather mundane experience seemed so immersive and realistic.The building of the store, the parking lot out front, and the loading dock in the back. Now to address the criticism of the lack of content. I do not fault them one bit. I don't want to steal the words of Daniel Hardcastle (Nerd3) so I'll summarize his explanation in this review, as he framed it in the most convincing manner I have heard yet. ETS2 has 2 previous games worth of content behind it, ETS and German Truck Simulator. This is a completely new venture, and the cities are much more fleshed out than in ETS2. So whereas only a few cities actually had many roads, now even smaller cities have a ton of roads and actual area you can drive around in, as opposed to seeing the rest in the distance.At the end of the day, it is NOT a revolutionary change from ETS2. But to anyone who complains of that, I have no idea what you were expecting. Overall, it's a good looking, reasonably priced and actively developing game and I can't be more excited for the future!

												So after a few hours of playing this game i can say that I am a tad bit disappointed for a few reasons. The first of which being my initial expectations, I was expecting this game to be a throwback almost to the 18WOS: American long haul game which I killed so many hours on trucking across the US and canada, but when I log in all I see is 2 states, about 48 short of what I was expecting. On top of that the game feels like a reskinned ETS with different music, I get that its easier to make the new game like that, but I feel this game came out with about 4% of what it should have and that im going to have to pay more on DLC's to get the rest of the 96, and if thats the case, then shame on the developers. The only way I could reasonably recommend this game to anyone is if they havent played ETS yet, that way they aren't as let down as I was			"

												This game is really fun! A bit dissapointing that there's only two trucks and two states at the moment, but hopefully that'll get updated soon! A problem I did have to begin with is the fact that there's no speed signs. Is that how it is in America IRL? (I'm Australian, there's speed signs everywhere here) But once I got used to where the speed changed, it wasn't too bad.Aside from some minor glitches I've found (Like headlights shining through bridges) the game is brilliant. Feels odd, since it looks visually similar to ETS2, but I like the change of scenery. Now we need a Truck Simulator by SCS based in Australia/New Zealand. Road Trains, B-Doubles, European and American trucks, city, desert, country, etc. That would be cool! (Oceanic Truck Simulator since calling it ATS would get confusing with this game XD)			"

												I really want to leave a positive review for this game and recommend it to others.  I really do.  But after force re-starting my computer for the umpteenth time after trying to launch, I just can't.  This is my biggest gripe about the whole game.  Here are my specs:Intel i7 - 2600K 3.4 GHzRAM 16.0 GB64 bit x64 windows 10 (boy do I miss windows 7 tho)AMD Radeon HD 6900All drivers are up do date.The problem is this - roughly every third or fourth time I try to load a saved game, the game freezes.  I can still hear music, but I can't even ctrl-alt-del out of the game to force close it, it completely freezes my computer and forces me to do a hard reboot, which I hate.  Sometimes when I go back in the game after a re-boot it says there was an error and says reasons have to do with mods.  I have absolutely no mods on this game.  I have only the game I purchased and the updates SCS software did with the new truck.  If they ever fix this I will absolutely change my review to recommend this game, as when it works it is loads of fun.  I had never played ETS2 so I couldn't compare this to that, my gripes about in-game playing would be fines way too high and double if a cop sees you run a red light or hit someone (like it's more illegal if a cop sees you do it) but enforcement can now be turned off.  I do hate the stop lights in the middle of the interstate...and why they put spawn points for AI vehicles at a T junction to an interstate I'll never know.  The only way to actually get on the interstate from here is to pull out, slowly, in front of traffic and force them to stop.Also the wheels of the truck while turning only turn the full degrees while stopped, not sure what that's about.  When you hire drivers and they 'couldn't find a job, $950 in fuel costs', seems odd that they don't know how to use a phone or the internet.  If SCS wants to limit funds I think it would be more realistic to have a message say, 'XXX called in sick today and could not work'.For some reason, regardless if you are in NV or CA, you seem to be driving uphill both ways.  This could be just me.  For the pros:Graphics are amazing.  I like the progression to higher levels, more money per level, unlocks to truck upgrades and paint jobs.  Having driven thru CA and NV, the realism for the terrain and landmarks are great, I can't wait for other states to be added. TLDR:  I would recommend if I didn't have to force re-boot my computer every day. "

												Now, I came into this game with the same mindset as most others. I figured it would be a reskin of ETS2. Boy was I wrong, however. American Truck Simulator has a completely different feel than ETS2. The menus may be the same, but the trucks are big, brash, and tower over all of the other cars unlike in ETS2. The trailers are much longer, giving it a new challenge that I didn't face in ETS2. The map may be small, but there are many intricate details that make it fun to drive on with every delivery. I highly reccommend this game to anybody new to the driving simulator scene, or a veteran looking for a new way to experience driving.			"

												So many people have written bad reviews for American Truck Simulator, and it's based around the price (which is a bargain) the content, and only having 2 trucks in the game.I find all of the above points for not buying the game, really quite silly. 1) The game is EXACTLY like Euro Truck Simulator 2 - its very similar in many ways.2) The game details is absolutely incredible. There are so many new things to see and do in the game, and the new parking choices are really nice to have.3) I'm absolutely delighted with the game as it is, and i cannot wait until I see more from SCS for American Truck Simulator.Seriously recommend it if you loved ETS2 - it's the same game, in America, with better detail and better options.11/10 - can't wait for more to come!

												Coming from someone who played 400+ hours of Euro Truck Simulator 2, I personally feel this game is amazing. Sure, the scale is sort of small, and yes there isn't nearly as many roads as ETS2, but the cities and enviroment, and just level of detail make up for it. Don't get me wrong, American Truck Simulator is the same game as Euro Truck Simulator 2. It's a different map, different trucks, but the game is the same. However, in saying that, I feel American Truck Simulator is funner to play personally, and I haven't touched ETS2 since.You actually feel as if you ware driving through actual cities. The enviroments, I've driven down the same road 10 times, and still notice something new. American Trucks, in my opinion, are much funner to drive. While the map does skip some accuracy, it still feel similar. Driving through California feels like driving through California. I am a really happy camper, and plan on purchasing upcoming Map DLC to support these devs.FOR YOU LINUX USERS:I fully converted to Linux full time (no dual boot) in September 2015, and I must say, the Linux Version is remarkable. I have a GTX 980 and use Nvidia Proprietary Drivers (keep that in mind) and the performance is on par with the Windows Version. I even use a Logitech G27. No issues whatsoever. I'd give the SCS team a high five for this. Remarkable.My ONLY Complaint about this game, is still the lack of Force Feedback on Logitech G27 (and other wheels) under Linux. It's purely a Game Issue, as the Linux Beta for ETS2 had Force Feeback, then it was removed and never fixed. Force Feedback works flawlessly on every other game. If they would fix this, I would be so so grateful.			"

												You have to like the game for the mere fact that it is SCS Software and the game is still being developed which is why I can't really give a good or a bad review.Right now, the game has some bug issues that do need worked outPolice ticketing you: Ok the traffic is going much faster than I am. Say the speed limit is 55, and other traffic is going 70 including the cop, you'll get a ticket which makes no sense. They need to fix that.The GPS: It seems to be weirding out all of the sudden making it mark roads on the other side of the road. For instance, if you go on an off ramp, it will show it on the other side of the road as well to go on the other side of the road to get onto this ramp. Need to fix your GPS.Cars running into you: I've had this happen MANY times now when I am at a red light and a car will hit my truck causing me to have to pay for it. I've had cars come off of an on ramp and run right into my truck causing me to, again, pay for the fine. I've had cars in the passing lane run right into my truck for no apparent reason causing me to pay the fine. This starts♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off when you're trying to earn money and you're now racking up a repair bill.Customization of your truck: This game needs a bit more when it comes to customizing your ride. All though, this isn't a major issue or anything, this is something that would be just nice to have.Graphics: I run this game on full settings but the graphics seem a bit grainy for me. All though it isn't bad at all, it's just something they need to work on.Controls: I run this game with a keyboard, always have. The turning is great in this game. The braking is a bit weird from Euro Truck. But, all in all, it's great.Job: Considering this game is still in development I have not much to say other than it needs more to do in the game. So, still waiting for major updates as the map is extremely small compared to Euro Truck.The game engine: It seems they haven't done much improvements as far as the games engine goes for graphical settings. It seems to use the Euro Truck engine.I'll rewrite this review when they start adding more to the game so I can give a proper review. All in all, it is worth the money to me. Great game.My system specs: Processor: AMD 6300 FX (3.5 GHz 6 core) RAM: 8 GB DDR3 Corsair Vengeance Video: eVGA 750 Ti 2 GB FTW Game runs at a crisp 60 FPS with a few minor drops to 58 here and there.

The map is only 25% the size I was expecting. The Free DLC map extension is a sign to me that they panicked at the last moment, and it is much too small as well.They have had years to sort out the deals with the manufactures but still only 2 Trucks and a rehash of another.The scale is wrong.Even the Driver pics are the same.I will be more carefull with my money in future SCS !!!!!!!

												I love the game.  Much like ETS and ETS2 they got the feel of the roads and cities right.  Driving around in L.A. feels like its L.A. Vegas feels like Vegas.  When the DLC’s with additional trucks and the eastward expansion come out this game will be amazing. The one thing that really is irking me is the overabundance of 1950's cars.  I get it; in RL there are some you'll see on the roads from time to time but nowhere near as many as I've come across in the game.  If this were Havana truck sim I'd get it, you’d expect to see 1950’s cars.  But man, one of every 10 seems to be a 50’s throwback.  Aside from that little annoyance (to me) this is a great game. "

												I have only played this game for less than an hour, but I can tell you that this game is a fun game. Comparing this to ETS2, I would say that this game has several improvements in terms of gameplay. One of which is the new trailer parking options. I find it very pleasing to be able to choose how you would like to park the trailer.The trucks themselves are quite different from the trucks in ETS. The trucks in this game have long bonnets, and I find it rather difficult to turn since I am used to the bonnet-less European trucks from ETS.Moving on to the map. The map in this game is still small compared to the map in ETS2. Currently, the game only has 2 states in its map.Overall, however, I think that this game is very enjoyable to play, and I find it relaxing to play this game, especially while listening to music.

												This game isn't perfect, but it's damn near close.The immersion of this game is quite awesome. The level of control over the settings and key bindings make it even more awesome. If you're like me and have a wheel ( I have a DFGT) it adds a different level of the game that you truly have to experience. A few gripes I have, as everyone has already been addressing: Right turn on red. Being able to make a right turn on red is a staple of driving culture here in the United States. Everyone does it. It's safe to do, provided you actually look to see if anyone is coming, and shaves precious seconds or even minutes off of your driving time... I'd like to see that implemented a little better in the game. Also...... Speed fines. Yes, it is well known that speeding tickets are a prime source of revenue generation for law enforcement here in the US, however speeding tickets for going less than 5 over are almost non-existant, at least in my neck of the woods anyway.To sum it all up, this game is worth every penny. It's fun. It's interesting. It's a good way to spend time. I can't wait to see more states implemented, especially the east coast. I want to see how West Virginia looks in the game.			"

												I am having so much fun driving in this game. I wonder if it would be possible to play as the police and be able to pull others over such as AI cars for bad driving and also other truckers.Seeing how I keep getting speeding tickets for quick speed changes and a cop car being right behind me. I f this game is going to be multiplayer I think being able to use the squad car and do some Highway Patrol would be a hoot! Awesome game( DRIVING JOB) I LOVE IT!  The detail is just so AWESOME!			"

												I'm not really sure what there is to say about American Truck Simulator. It's a game that shouldn't be enjoyable to anyone except a 'niche' of simulator fans, but somehow it's just...captivating. Maybe I get too into it, but there isn't anything quite as relaxing as just driving down the highway listening to internet radio (via a feature in the game that allows you to) and just watching America roll by. Right now, it's just California and Nevada, which makes the game world feel a bit smaller and less varied than it's predecessor, Euro Truck Simulator 2. Arizona is being built, however, and planned as free DLC when it is finished.			"

												Really? This game is such a disapointment i was hoping to have a realistic game to play, not only are the hit boxes to big but the speed limits arent even right (at least in vegas) nor are the laws and you get speeding tickets far far far to fast even if you're doing what the A.I is doing Euro Truck is far better then this game i could play that all day but this game? it pisses me off with all the wrongs done not only that its only Cali and Nevada i was expectiong to have at least half the US to go between that last 5 jobs i've done have been the same job with different cargo sorry but until you guys fix things i dont recommend this game, oh and the trucks really? only two companies!?!?! with very few differences between them even if this game is ""cheap"" only like $20 but i dont even think its worth that much. If i had bought this at a physical store and not online i would return it as fast and as soon as possible			"

												Playing with a G27 this game is actually very fun once you understand how to setup the h-shifter and transmission properly. Theres a guy on YouTube called ""Mistermoose"", he does a great video explaining all about the different transmissions and setups. ATS also has pretty damn good graphics, even though I can't understand why I'm only getting about 30-40 fps with everything maxed (my specs are below). I'm writing this review right after the recent update that brings lowered fines and a new truck with a few other things. I like how they actually saw the feedback from the community and fixed these issues quickly. I also read a lot of complaints about the lack of map size and truck availability but I havn't felt that made any differenece for me, the actual driving makes up for it imo.i5 4670asus gtx 980ti8gb ramz87 mbwindows 10			"

												I want to preface this by saying it's not just a game, it's an investment. Yes, there's only 3 trucks (with another on the way) and 2 states (with Arizona on the way), but I knew this well in advance. In fact, the game was originally just going to be California.Like Euro Truck Simulator 2, this game is relaxing way to pass the time, see the country, and learn about it, albeit on a scaled down version. This game does a bit more than ETS 2 by recreating some locations and buildings. The cities are bigger, and some towns are so small they barely exist outside a gas station/rest area and a job site. Not every city has a garage and employment agency, so it won't be as easy to make money. Still plenty of truck customization options. Each truck has its own set of unique paintjobs too. Trailers can get longer, and on top of the longer cabs, you will have to figure out manuvering around corners. There's also multiple options for parking (and you can set it to always easy or hard in the Options). Police cars now roam the streets, so speed limits will be more enforced, and they're not as bad as they were in the beginning. Mod support has been immediate (and signs of going to Steam Workshop too).I'm going to keep on trucking, building up my company, leveling up to upgrade my truck, and waiting for new states to unlock and trucks to buy so I can go from sea to shining sea.

												Haven't had too much time to properly test it out yet, but so far it feels just like ETS2 (which is a good thing, mind you). The interior details look much better compared to ETS2, and the game is very easy to get into for new comers, and old timers as well. Curretly there are only two different trucks, and two different states, which sounds boring at first, but knowing how well the devs were committed to ETS2, I'm sure there will be so much more stuff coming very soon!

When I bought it I was planning on driving across the USA, and come to find out the game had barely 5% of the country completed... All that's added in the full game rather than the demo is one new state, a few trucks, unlimited play time, and mod support... If you want the game, my advice to you is just get the demo for now, the game is not finished.			"

And if you've played ETS, this will be a mere shadow of what you have in that one. Wait for it to go on sale. And for friggin sake, if Arizona wasn't coming for free, I think I would change this to a ""NOT RECOMMENDED"". Can't wait to see the DLC price tags on more additional states...(sarcasm)			"

Yet The franchise got better with American Truck Simulator with tweaks and new feature this game is definatly an improvement the only negative is the lack of locations compared to eurotruck however this is shown in the price and with future patches and updates to come hopefully this game will do as well as its predecisor			"

												If you like Euro Truck Sim 2 then you will like this one.  My complaint is that the starting map is small (cali and nevada) and they didnt add anything new to the game.  I really wanted them to expand on the RPG elements in ETS2 or add some garage management options that were new but... still fun, for the price of $20 get it, its a good value.

												American truck simulator, this game has had almost a year to improve. Sadly the game has improved very little only adding 2 trucks, 2 map expasions (Re-scale included) and many paint skins for trucks which only a small amount of the community are intrested in.. I'm hoping in 2017 SCS put the foot into this game or they won't complete the map till 2018-19..			"

												I am going to be honest with a few stuff here:Negative Stuff:-The engine between ETS 2 and ATS is the same; the graphics, roads, trees, cars all look quiet the same.-Even the main menu/GPS is not changed.-The BOTS (cars other trucks) need to get a little bit smarter, when you pass to another direction, they get to crash on you; and you are to be blamed for that.-The only reason the game got published this quick is that it got leaked in the websites, forcing developers to publish it and not to lose money!I won't mention anything about the upcoming DLCs for NOW. Because SCS still can fix the prices on DLCs if they have read other people's reviews too.Positive Stuff:-The map is detailed.-The humans are doing action now. (Sweeping the floor etc.)-The roads are more detailed now.-Trucks still have a good simple understandable design.-There are now more frequent police cars, you get to have a higher fee if there is a police near by.-There are police waiting in a few rounds trying to catch people the that break the rules.-The lightning of trucks from ATS are much better than ETS 2.Overall the game still has a lot to improve, the game developers themselves made a huge mistake by leaking the game on the websites forcing them to publish the game and not to lose money. This also caused a lot of negative reviews and how the game was not even ready to be realesed. The SCS is currently working on making Arizona which will hopefully be published over in the next 2-3 months. The devs should also listen to comments of other people, they simply just listen to famous people that do not even understand what the game needs; this is a really big mistake done by them.Id give this game a rating 8/10 for now.Have a nice day!

												TLDR: If you think you might like it, you probably will. If you don't see the point, don't expect it to surprise you. There are problems, but I expect them to improve with DLC and patching.I'm not much into hard-sim games, but for some reason this one appealed. I couldn't even explain why.This game doubles up as a hardcore truck-driving simulator, and a casual time-sink. If you want to get a steering-wheel controller, manual shifter input and analogue pedals, play the whole game from the driver's camera perspective and grind out your hours as a big-rig stalwart, it's well set up for that. Slowly build your business, earn the right to take high-value cargo for long distance hauls, plan your fuel & rest stops, watch your speed and park your trailer perfectly every time for bonus XP.But if you just want to use your WASD & mouse, pick up a Quick Job and drive from point-to-point for ten minutes, bashing through the occasional stop-start idiot who clogs up the junction, ditching the trailer at the gate and logging off again... well, that's totally fine too. It's a sim. You can be as serious or casual as you like.Both are fun, in different ways, and the game does well at supporting both styles of play.POSITIVEI have one thing to say here, but it's a big one: this game is, on occasion, breathtakingly beatufiul. I have had moments when a sunrise vista has opened up before me, after a gruelling 15hr (well, 15m) night drive through a featureless desert, pushing the speed limit to try and hit my destination before blacking out from exhaustion, and the moment has given me *real feels!* Like, a wistful wanderlust, or a warm familiar feeling. In some small way, I felt what it was like to be a long-haul trucker.This can only be achieved by a number of things coming together. Distinct and recognisable landscapes; above-par atmospheric lighting & graphics, sufficient technical challenge to keep you focussed and slightly stressed for long periods of time, and a solid enough engine to make it all feel immersive. I was genuinely startled when some tumbleweeds blazed across the road in my headlights one night.That's only one positive, but it can't be overstated.NEGATIVEThere are bugs. It's a sim, so there are always limitations on realism, but the AI of police and other road users is occasionally crushingly stupid or arbitrary.There is also a limit on the game's size - two states (at launch) greatly scaled-down only gives you a few hours' driving before you've seen it all. The details are pretty good and I'm sure it'll be improved by DLC in future, but for now it's a big limitation.Sometimes, very rarely, using a Steam Controller, the control scheme will just break, and you'll go careening into a barrier at 55mph for no reason. Such immersion-breaking is criminal for a sim, and I hope Steam and/or the developers get on that ASAP. Today my controller suddenly started providing massive haptic feedback, contrary to my settings, so... yeah. New game, new technology. Fingers crossed.The biggest problem, though, is the strategic side of things. Upgrading your truck (beyond a bigger engine & improved gearbox) is very costly but basically pointless. It's a cosmetic change to something you pretty much never see. But then the only other thing you can spend your hard-earned cash on is growing the business, which... just brings in more money. I don't know what else you could expect from a truck sim, but it seems like a one-dimensional management game has been tacked on the side with little purpose.Once I realised the larger game offered little more than the (casual) Quick Job mode, the game lost a lot of its appeal. It was a cathartic ride up to that point, though, so I'll probably still dip in occasionally, and I'm happy to recommend it for the money. If the challenge of technical driving appeals to you, this is worth a look.			"

												Should be called PMRS ""pimp my ride simulator"". It gets very routine very quickly. They give updates or fixes and it really isnt much typically only cosmetic when there are complete routes missing all together. Very limited number of routes. You cant really play this as a true simulator due to traffic issues. There are some intersections that are 4 plus lanes wide and no stop light, youre sitting there and have to make a left turn and other AI vehicles are in front of you, you will just sit and sit and wait and wait. I have the traffic penalties turned off and just go out around them and creep my truck right out into the intersection. Tons of routes missing that could and should be there. The game is very nice to look at thats about all they have going for it right now. Like I said its all cosmetic. PMRS. pimp my ride simulator. just look at most of the mods. Theyre mostly if not all cosmetic. It does not add more roads or add to gameplay.			"

												Well, folks.  Here we are.  The Hype is real and still is!I bought ATS as it is called by players because I loved ETS2 and wanted to play an American Truck game, like the old 18 WoS days.  So far, I'm not disappointed by the game one bit.  Yeah, you only get two trucks at the start, and I'm fine with that.  The reasoning for the lack of immediate content is actually a good one for once.  It is because rather than put fake brands in the game, SCS wants to get licenses first.  But, as said by Pavel Sebor himself, getting licenses from truck manufacurers that aren't used to being approached for licenses of their product is like the chicken vs egg debate.  So, they are going about it the right way at least.On to the gameplay.  Those of you that are familiar with ETS2 will have no problem getting used to the ATS Gameplay.  There are a lot of new things to compliment to already very good base gameplay that I hope will be making it's way to ETS2 soon as well.  Delivery Points are the biggest advancement in the gameplay system.  You can choose how difficult you want the delivery to be.  From a zero point quick drop to a 90 point drop that is so complex, even the most Veteran Driver will have a challenge are available for choosing.Weigh Stations are new to the game.  You can be randomly chosen to go to the Scale House for Inspection.  It's an interesting feature, but a bit of a waste of time and ruins fuel economy.  Hopefully, SCS will be able to do something to give this feature more meaning.After talking about weigh stations, we have no choice but to talk about the new police engine.  Now, the dreaded Rozzers are mobile and sneaky.  I got a Speeding Ticket for not being at 30 MPH right after the sign changed.  There needs to be a Reduced Speed Ahead sign, like in real life here in the States.So, lets break it down to the Pros and Cons.ProsFamiliar yet tweaked GameplayAmerican TrucksNevada included Scenery that will blow your mindEaster Eggs, yes, there a few, and no, I will not tell you what they areNo curves every 20 feet like ETS2ConsOnly two states at the beginningOnly two trucks at the beginning,  Not really a con, but may put some people offThe UI is completely Copy/Paste.  Would have loved to see the Route Adviser remodeled.  Maybe next time.Only 64-Bit Having looked at the facts and played a long time, I can give a solid 9 out of 10.  This game is definitely worth a buy.  It's continued development is something I look forward to.UPDATE:  W900 is out and it's not bad.  The sounds need a little tweaking still, but at least it's there.			"

												So effing addicting. Make sure you get the MP mod too. I love being that eh-hole that cuts people off just like in real lifeEDIT: so I figured I would add more detail here since I've seen others complaining about the price for two states. This game could easily be worth more than the 20.00 based on the detail and the design alone. They threw in a lot, A LOT of detail into the game, from each clickable switch in the cabin, to the way the headlights function. Basically all you do is load up, drive, and unload. You lose money for damage, tickets, and stuff like this. Eventually you can own your own fleets, and manage drivers and make profit. When you play the MP mod, nothing is more thrilling than hearing someone rage because you drive like a jacka$$.Sorry not sorry, but ever see a trucker in California or Neveda? They're jacka$$es. Arizona state is coming soon, then they're gonna be doing the northern west coast statesI definitely give this a perfect 5/7 score. Might even get Euro Truck now to have my business expand to Europe.

												See alot of negative reviews popping up, this might be easier to clear up some bad light they're trying to shine.On release there is only 2 trucks and 2 states they will be adding more have confirmed atleast 3 more truck makes. some think it seems small or scalling isn't right. to me it seems about the same as both games use the engine.Earlier had a 960km job took me about 40mins to drive in Ets2 i average 1000km/h now again some think the scale is out but speed limits of 130km/h Ats vs. 90km/h Ets.. it's not smaller you just drive faster!I've seen posts on trucks seem slow or sluggish. i welcome this change as it feels like you have wieght, but ill add those few exagerate. yes you don't have the racing pickup of the 730hp Scania. Ive managed to climb hills and drive all 20T+ loads with the starting 370hp THAT'S WHAT GEARS ARE FOR lol.I might edit this post later if I see something else to clearup. I would just dismiss anyone posting with less then 1 or 2 hours played as they most likely finished tutorial or just a job within a city.			"

												I couldnt wait for this game to come out and i have to say i wasnt disappointed. The scenery and the realism is amazing as are the sounds (except for the horns). The only downside i can find are the speed limit signs are hard to detect...i gota lot of tickets. Other than that keep up the good work. I know that a lot of people are comparing this game to ETS2... there is a 2 in there they really should be comparing it to ETS. They informed you that there was going to be only 2 trucks and 2 states. There is plenty of time for them to improve and expand this game and i haveno problems switching between ETS2 and ATS. I feel it in my bones that this will be a better game			"

												Overall a Very well developed game looking forward to AZ DLC....Would Love to see the full USA to the Future to come as  DLC expansions and willing to pay for them.... this game can only get better not worse. Thanks SCS for all the hard work you put in and time effort it took to make this a reality. Looking forward to the day maybe possibly to go Coast to Coast CA to NY. Also as an idea would maybe as a patch to include would be Log books to make it even more realistic or maybe the snowy mountains or iced roads for difficulty in future maps for a greater challenge.. So many ideas can come to mind but thanks again and keep up the great work im sure all the fans would love to see a full USA done in the future.			"

												It's a good game but there's not enough content in the game at the moment. ETS2 has significantly more content in the base game. ATS is still a good game and I would recommend it but if you are wanting a complete experience then this is still very much at the beginning of it's life and i'd wait for more content before buying it.

												Before I begin, I want everyone to know that I've been waiting on this game for years now. Ever since we were told they began development. I knew exactly what I was going to get, so I'm basing my review on that.____When you first see the game, it looks exactly like Euro Truck Simulator 2. The only differences include it being in the United States, having vehicles driven in the United States, trailers that are used in the United States, and a couple states in the United States.After you get past the $20 price tag and actually get in the game, it's exactly as it seems. Just a reskin of ETS2. But what was to be expected? It's the same engine used to rebuild ETS2 for a different region. That's what we were told we were going to receive and that's what we got. I am not at all upset that we only get 2 states at release with Arizona coming a little later for free and 2 trucks. I knew I was getting that and I paid the price for that.The developers wanted to go the correct route with the game and get licensing for the vehicles used so the lack of vehicles is okay. As time goes on, we'll get loads more. As far as states go, 3 might not seem like much. With the scale, it definitely seems lacking in content. But you have to remember. If they went to a more in-depth scale and added more content, then it'd take years for a single state to come out. I don't know about you, but I'd like to have 48 states before I turn 70 years old. :PAnd the game is called American Truck Simulator. American. The United States is only one of dozens upon dozens of countries in America. Canada and Mexico are 2 more countries in NORTH America. Meanwhile, there's still South America that has to be scaled in. By the time we get all of that(if we ever do, the plans could change), we'd have so much map, we wouldn't be able to explore it all in a reasonable amount of time. Sure, California and Nevada might not seem like much, but they are comparable to Great Britain and France in ETS2 when you talk about size. Now add the equivelent amount of states as there are countries in ETS2 and you have the United States completed. UK and France might not seem like much on ETS2, but when you travel from one to the other, and then all the way to Poland and then up to Sweden, you start to realize that even though the map is small now, it will be much bigger later on when we have more content to play.Not much of a regular review that you'd see on Steam, but these are my opinions on the game so far. It's a reskin of ETS2 and that's what we were told and what we paid for. No complaints here. Still a billion times better than most simulators out there.			"

												After years of ETS2 it was pretty stale for me - ATS really is outstanding and not just more of the same. The scenery is absurdly wonderful, tumbleweeds blowing across the road at 3 AM, AI traffic, desert landscapes, all beautifully done. I'm running dual Titan cards and a very fast system built to handle complex commercial flight sims - my only dislike is being unable to get above 200% graphics quality without slowing to a choppy crawl and frame rates diving  in most cities but it really doesn't detract from the enjoyablility of this masterpiece. At 200 the scenery is still outstanding. Well worth the $ and the wait to have this.			"

												I got on board with the Euro Truck Similator really late, but hopped on this game on opening day and I have been pretty pleased. Kneejerk reaction I want to say that it all seems very ""small,"" but realizing that Arizona is coming and I am sure a lot more, if not all of, the US as well I am pretty excited for what's to come and what the game will become. I've also seen a lot of talk about mods for the game, but I honestly am not sure how all that works so I can't really use that as a pro or con for my thoughts on the game, but for those out there who are really into that sort of stuff, it exists.Nevertheless, if you like Euro Truck Simulator and are interested in exploring the us in the same style then you will enjoy this game just as much as I have.

												While it may not be for everyone...if you happen to be a person who loves road trips, or perhaps are just looking for something different, you should consider giving ATS a try.  The game is fun, and challenging, and even outside of the game..the community, via the forums are friendly, helpful and active.If its any indicator, after i plyed this, I went and bought the European Truck Simulator, from the same company.Love the game, and look forward to playing it for a long, long time.

												The ones who liked Euro Truck Simulator for its qualities will also like the American Truck Simulator.Technically, it is to 90% the same game, the difference in the 10% are the following:1) Instead of European Trucks you're driving the American ones of cause.2) You can design your own driving route now on the map just like e.g. in Google Maps on your smartphones with waypoints.3) Instead of just parking your trailer manually and autoparking it you now can chose between a medium/hard way to park it manually, an easy way to park it manually and the alrdy known autoparking. For the medium/hard way you get the most XP (40/90 XP-Points))4) The game world is filled with life to a higher degree, there are more peasants walking on the pedestrian walks, there are workers working on the delivery/reception sites, there are security men standing in front of supermarkets etc etc.5) There are more different delivery sites, instead of just delivering to company yards and building sited you can now also deliver to gas stations.6) The game is set in America (Cpt. Obvious strikes again).The game is available for a fair price of 20€, for which you get the US-States of California, Nevada and Arizona (That's still in the pipeline).But California and Nevada for themselves are alrdy highly detailed, there are about 10-15 cities in California and about 10 in Nevada, so, if you compare it with the Old 18 Wheels of Steel Games from SCS, where California had two cities, a huge increase!Arizona is coming for free too, what States in which Quantity the other DLC's will deliver is subject to the future, I don't know that.I think, that SCS, as they alrdy did with ETS2 and its DLC's, will deliver a reasonable amount of DLC's for a fair price and with a fair content in it.As I've read, relying on that this wasn't a joke, they plan to eventually map the whole of North- and Latin-America atleast down to the equator, but of cause this is a work for years to come.All in all, this game, just like his older brother ETS 2, is a shining juwel in the simulation genre and I can recommend it from the bottom of my heart.Update #01: Another positive thing: Just days after release they alrdy added the third truck the legendary Kenworth W900, a truck the community asked for. Another reason to recommend the game, because of the consumerfriendly policy of SCS, thumbs up!			"

												I've spent enough time driving in this game to make a couple of comments. (1) - there are too many freakin' cop cars. Even for California and L.A.  One after another after another passes by as if OJ was on the loose. In the real world, in California, there are too many freakin' cop cars but not as many as depicted in ATS, not one after another, after another, with another sitting on the side of the road. It makes me paranoid.(2) - The traffic patterns prevent ""safe"" turning from a side road onto a main highway without a traffic light or other method of controlling main highway traffic. It is not fun to sit for an hour in game time waiting for a lull in the traffic in order to make a left turn onto the highway. One has to resort to ""bullying"" the oncoming traffic which is not a habit one would want to get into. While this may ""suggest"" the real world traffic of Cali and L.A., in the game world it is frustrating and not fun. Especially when you have four lanes of heavy traffic going in opposite directions and you are sitting at a stop sign with a heavy load. Fix it!(3) - The highway travel time scale is too short. I don't get the feeling that I've made a ""trip"" from L.A. to Las Vegas. By the time I get comfortable on the Freeway, find a radio station with some good tunes on it, I'm already there. Travel time is too short. I hope this can be fixed in the release game or in the mods to come.I am still recommending this game for the west coast USA highway scenery.At this time I am giving it 3 out of 5 stars.			"

												At first I was disappointed about ATS being similar to ETS 2, but the more I play, the more changes I notice. The 'American' feeling is really shown in this game by the visuals and lighting, Cities are much more realistic than ever before. Sadly, there is only 2 trucks, but eventually SCS may get licenses. I hope that new states will not be bought individually, but in a package of 3-6 states.			"

												So effing addicting. Make sure you get the MP mod too. I love being that eh-hole that cuts people off just like in real lifeEDIT: so I figured I would add more detail here since I've seen others complaining about the price for two states. This game could easily be worth more than the 20.00 based on the detail and the design alone. They threw in a lot, A LOT of detail into the game, from each clickable switch in the cabin, to the way the headlights function. Basically all you do is load up, drive, and unload. You lose money for damage, tickets, and stuff like this. Eventually you can own your own fleets, and manage drivers and make profit. When you play the MP mod, nothing is more thrilling than hearing someone rage because you drive like a jacka$$.Sorry not sorry, but ever see a trucker in California or Neveda? They're jacka$$es. Arizona state is coming soon, then they're gonna be doing the northern west coast statesI definitely give this a perfect 5/7 score. Might even get Euro Truck now to have my business expand to Europe.

Ive managed to climb hills and drive all 20T+ loads with the starting 370hp THAT'S WHAT GEARS ARE FOR lol.I might edit this post later if I see something else to clearup. I would just dismiss anyone posting with less then 1 or 2 hours played as they most likely finished tutorial or just a job within a city.			"

												This game, while extremely similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2, fits even better into the mold of traditional American trucking. The actual truck designs are beautiful, and have incredible attention to detail. That being the case, they only have two truck models on offer right now, with a third one coming soon. Although this is due to licensing issues with truck manufacturers, it can be disheartening to players that aren't following the development process so closely. The locations are a similar case to the trucks. There are only two available at the time of this review, including California and Nevada. This is going to be expanded in the future, through DLC (The first state to be added in the future will be Arizona, free of charge). Same as the trucks, while there is a huge increase in polish since ETS2, with tons of detail in the town buildings and structures, having only two states, both being sunny and hot, can really leave a lot to be desired in the way of actual content. You will get lost in the Nevada desert (Not literally lol), you will want to drive around Las Vegas and the beaches of California, but that awe factor runs out after a couple of trips to these few locations, making me want more states to play with.As for right now, the game is pretty much ETS2 with a new, more suitable skin. Whether or not you should buy this over ETS2, or just stick with ETS2 if you've been playing that, is up to whether or not you enjoy the actual theme of American trucks and American locales to be trucking through. Keep in mind that you will have to deal with a lack of content in the beginning of this developmental cycle (with the possibilty of having to pay for future states as DLC). I personally think it is worth it, and I will look forward to any future additions to the game. Good job SCS Software.			"

												I have put 6 hours into this game so far and I find this game to be very good, however there are several problems I have with this game.Pros:-Game runs great on high settings-Lots of details put into difrent cities etc.-Trucks look amazing the way they are.-Map is pretty big.Cons:-It uses the same interface making it feel like its the same game.-There are only two states in the game (Califonia and Navada): Note- Yes I do know that these two states do have a lot in them but sence its called American Truck Simulator I figure they would have more before they launch the game.-There are only TWO truck brands to chose from -Gas stations and repair stations start to look the same.  I do recomend picking this up for its 20 dollar price and if you are a fan of Euro Truck Simulator, you will most likely this game. But I will be severly disapointed if DLC contain small amounts of states or if there waiting to put all of the truck brands with DLC.			"

												This game plays very similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2.  The largest downsides right now are simply lack of content (only 2 states to visit - only 2 brands of cabs to drive).  The graphics have improved since ETS2 and cities are much more detailed.  Traffic can be more dense in some areas making the driving more fun.  The ability to spot speed traps and avoid tickets is pretty cool.This feels a bit more like DLC than a full game - but it is priced fair for what you get.  On sale this would seem like a no brainer purchase for anyone who loved ETS2.These games are a lot more fun with a wheel but you don't need a $300 permium wheel to get into them - I've been using a cheap logitech wheel I picked up from a garage sale a number of years ago...

												For me, this is well worth 14.99. It's just two trucks and two sates to start with, but Arizona and more trucks will be coming soon.I have Euro Truck Sim 2, but I generally prefer Trucks and Trailers, and Scania Truck Sim, as these two old sims concentrate on the challenge of manouevering and parking rather than the driving in between. - (don't get me wrong, I still enjoy ETS2 though).But I couldn't resist buying this - and somehow it is better than ETS2. The graphics, and atmosphere of driving along American freeways, just seems to suit the game better.I know others have complained about the slightly smaller scale, but that might be another reason why I prefer it to ETS2. The drive is long enough to enjoy, but not too long to get boring. And with the whole of USA planned, there is still plenty of scope for long drives.It's looking good, I just hope SCS are reasonable when they start selling the DLCs, I am prepared to pay but I will draw the line if I keep paying £15 for every 3 states. But they seem to have been good with previous releases, so I hope they will be so here.Recommended if you like the previous trucking incarnations & want more of the same, but with the real American flavour.

												Awesome.Still has some things to work out, but if you're looking for Euro Truck Simulator 2 with an American flavor this will not disappoint.Only 2 states (CA & NV) and 2 trucks at the moment, but they plan to add more over time.  After seeing their work with ETS2 I am sure that they will not abandon this any time soon.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit:  It's now been 25 days since I've bought this game.  I have not played any other game since starting this one.  They have added a third truck since my initial review.  I still really love this game, but they do need to do some map adjustments, and we seriously need some map expansions.  Arizona is supposed to be released ""soon"".There is now a demo available.  If you're on the fence about whether or not to get this, I recommend trying out the demo.  Again, game map is limited at the moment, but for the hours I've played I still think $20 US is a great value.			"

												Well, folks.  Here we are.  The Hype is real and still is!I bought ATS as it is called by players because I loved ETS2 and wanted to play an American Truck game, like the old 18 WoS days.  So far, I'm not disappointed by the game one bit.  Yeah, you only get two trucks at the start, and I'm fine with that.  The reasoning for the lack of immediate content is actually a good one for once.  It is because rather than put fake brands in the game, SCS wants to get licenses first.  But, as said by Pavel Sebor himself, getting licenses from truck manufacurers that aren't used to being approached for licenses of their product is like the chicken vs egg debate.  So, they are going about it the right way at least.On to the gameplay.  Those of you that are familiar with ETS2 will have no problem getting used to the ATS Gameplay.  There are a lot of new things to compliment to already very good base gameplay that I hope will be making it's way to ETS2 soon as well.  Delivery Points are the biggest advancement in the gameplay system.  You can choose how difficult you want the delivery to be.  From a zero point quick drop to a 90 point drop that is so complex, even the most Veteran Driver will have a challenge are available for choosing.Weigh Stations are new to the game.  You can be randomly chosen to go to the Scale House for Inspection.  It's an interesting feature, but a bit of a waste of time and ruins fuel economy.  Hopefully, SCS will be able to do something to give this feature more meaning.After talking about weigh stations, we have no choice but to talk about the new police engine.  Now, the dreaded Rozzers are mobile and sneaky.  I got a Speeding Ticket for not being at 30 MPH right after the sign changed.  There needs to be a Reduced Speed Ahead sign, like in real life here in the States.So, lets break it down to the Pros and Cons.ProsFamiliar yet tweaked GameplayAmerican TrucksNevada included Scenery that will blow your mindEaster Eggs, yes, there a few, and no, I will not tell you what they areNo curves every 20 feet like ETS2ConsOnly two states at the beginningOnly two trucks at the beginning,  Not really a con, but may put some people offThe UI is completely Copy/Paste.  Would have loved to see the Route Adviser remodeled.  Maybe next time.Only 64-Bit Having looked at the facts and played a long time, I can give a solid 9 out of 10.  This game is definitely worth a buy.  It's continued development is something I look forward to.UPDATE:  W900 is out and it's not bad.  The sounds need a little tweaking still, but at least it's there.			"

												My only problem with this game is that it's just California and Nevada for now. I know Arizona is going to be added for free but that's 3/50 states and, ugh, I just wanted to get stuck on the NJ Turnpike so bad...That's it, that's the only bad thing I can say about this. It's American Truck Simulator. I was watching it on Twitch earlier and saw an engaged couple argue with eachother over their expensive water bill as the man kept drinking and the woman kept blaming her cats for everything wrong with their house. America!			"

												While it may not be for everyone...if you happen to be a person who loves road trips, or perhaps are just looking for something different, you should consider giving ATS a try.  The game is fun, and challenging, and even outside of the game..the community, via the forums are friendly, helpful and active.If its any indicator, after i plyed this, I went and bought the European Truck Simulator, from the same company.Love the game, and look forward to playing it for a long, long time.

												The ones who liked Euro Truck Simulator for its qualities will also like the American Truck Simulator.Technically, it is to 90% the same game, the difference in the 10% are the following:1) Instead of European Trucks you're driving the American ones of cause.2) You can design your own driving route now on the map just like e.g. in Google Maps on your smartphones with waypoints.3) Instead of just parking your trailer manually and autoparking it you now can chose between a medium/hard way to park it manually, an easy way to park it manually and the alrdy known autoparking. For the medium/hard way you get the most XP (40/90 XP-Points))4) The game world is filled with life to a higher degree, there are more peasants walking on the pedestrian walks, there are workers working on the delivery/reception sites, there are security men standing in front of supermarkets etc etc.5) There are more different delivery sites, instead of just delivering to company yards and building sited you can now also deliver to gas stations.6) The game is set in America (Cpt. Obvious strikes again).The game is available for a fair price of 20€, for which you get the US-States of California, Nevada and Arizona (That's still in the pipeline).But California and Nevada for themselves are alrdy highly detailed, there are about 10-15 cities in California and about 10 in Nevada, so, if you compare it with the Old 18 Wheels of Steel Games from SCS, where California had two cities, a huge increase!Arizona is coming for free too, what States in which Quantity the other DLC's will deliver is subject to the future, I don't know that.I think, that SCS, as they alrdy did with ETS2 and its DLC's, will deliver a reasonable amount of DLC's for a fair price and with a fair content in it.As I've read, relying on that this wasn't a joke, they plan to eventually map the whole of North- and Latin-America atleast down to the equator, but of cause this is a work for years to come.All in all, this game, just like his older brother ETS 2, is a shining juwel in the simulation genre and I can recommend it from the bottom of my heart.Update #01: Another positive thing: Just days after release they alrdy added the third truck the legendary Kenworth W900, a truck the community asked for. Another reason to recommend the game, because of the consumerfriendly policy of SCS, thumbs up!			"

												I've spent enough time driving in this game to make a couple of comments. (1) - there are too many freakin' cop cars. Even for California and L.A.  One after another after another passes by as if OJ was on the loose. In the real world, in California, there are too many freakin' cop cars but not as many as depicted in ATS, not one after another, after another, with another sitting on the side of the road. It makes me paranoid.(2) - The traffic patterns prevent ""safe"" turning from a side road onto a main highway without a traffic light or other method of controlling main highway traffic. It is not fun to sit for an hour in game time waiting for a lull in the traffic in order to make a left turn onto the highway. One has to resort to ""bullying"" the oncoming traffic which is not a habit one would want to get into. While this may ""suggest"" the real world traffic of Cali and L.A., in the game world it is frustrating and not fun. Especially when you have four lanes of heavy traffic going in opposite directions and you are sitting at a stop sign with a heavy load. Fix it!(3) - The highway travel time scale is too short. I don't get the feeling that I've made a ""trip"" from L.A. to Las Vegas. By the time I get comfortable on the Freeway, find a radio station with some good tunes on it, I'm already there. Travel time is too short. I hope this can be fixed in the release game or in the mods to come.I am still recommending this game for the west coast USA highway scenery.At this time I am giving it 3 out of 5 stars.			"

												I've never written a Steam review before, but really wanted to sing the praises of this game.I'm someone who loves to drive in real life, and who also comes from and lives in California. I'm a fan of EuroTruck Simulator 2 (and I also lived in the UK for 5 years), but felt a lot of the scenery and layout was very repetitive and would often uninstall after only a few play sessions, although I'd reinstall it once in awhile. Solid game tho, and the business tycoon style aspect was fun.In American Truck Simulator you really have the same game however I strongly feel they've done a fantastic job of skinning the game in such a way that really gives the feeling and spirit of the American Southwest very well. I know and have driven many times around the places in this game and while it's not 100% perfect or to scale, there's a ton of subtleties that this game gives to very much put you in something a lot like real life.The windmills off Highway 111 (down in what is effectly the Coachella Valley, where Palm Springs is), the tree barriers found off Highway 99 that runs along the eastern side of the San Juaqin Valley (which is very different to the feel of the 5 Freeway which runs down the west side of that huge valley), the way the roads and buildings change while you drive over the Sierra Nevada pass (past Truckee) and into Nevada itself. The way the roads work around Las Vegas. All of these examples and hundreds more really give you a strong sense of what it is to drive around this part of the world, with all of the other successful elements from EuroTruck Simulator 2, including the ability to customize your music, and even just use preexisting Internet Radio streams which are all highly appropriate, to managing your own company of trucks and drivers over time.Getting better in the game requires coming to learn what different areas of the map will throw at you to slow you down or trip you up, eg parts of a freeway being subject to harsh speed limits (and getting a huge speed fine if you miss it) or understanding that making a left onto a freeway from a country lane could take you an extra half an hour, or knowing when sharp grades are better driven around than attempted head on, all of these things are at play and create a real sense of accomplishment over time as you begin to master the routes.This is a very fun game that's just as good as its predecessor but I think a much more realistic and engaging experience than Euro 2. The only complaint I have is some minor AI issues that can occur around some intersections and a funny thing where some intersections have both stop lights and stop signs too which seem to confuse the AI (and also isn't how America traffic works either). It's a pretty minor problem though that may even disappear someday.Defininte recommend for anyone who liked the predecessors.			"

												If you like Euro Truck Sim 2 you'll probably enjoy this a lot. Although right now the map size is much smaller than ETS2. But for now driving across California had never felt so good. The map is decent and makes it feel akin to what driving in America would feel like. From the run down shops to the overabundant amount of self storage businesses. The sweet joy of make a trip is still there, but those long hauls aren't quite there yet since you can only travel between two states. Many of the mechanics mirror what was in ETS2, such as ranking and how the game is played. So players of ETS2 will feel right at home. I would recommend this if you particularly liked ETS2 a lot and just want a new scenery and are willing to wait for more states and trucks. This feels barebones in a way with content as there is only two states currently and not very many trucks. Down the line, or very soon we should be getting Arizona and more trucks. Even with the lack of content the game is still enjoyable to play and check out the new scenes.			"

												American Truck Simulator is a big step up from Euro Truck Simulator 2 in a lot of areas, bringing updates to the graphics and gameplay, but does lack quite a bit of the content from Euro Truck Simulator 2.For starters, the map is way, way smaller, comprising only two states of the US, California and Nevada, with Arizona coming down the line. This is a big downgrade from Euro Truck Simulator 2, which spanned from the UK to Poland. However, in my opinion, the environment you're driving in in ATS is far more interesting than in ETS2. Where ETS only had vague hints of there being a city somewhere in the distance, having you drive through bland industrial areas which were virtually indistinguishable from one another, in ATS you actually get to drive through the actual cities, which have a lot of detail put into them, and all look very different. The roads outside the cities also put you in more interesting situations sometimes, and the roads differ from each other a lot, where in ETS they were pretty much all the exact same.The game only has 2 trucks right now, with another coming very soon. This, to me, is not much of a problem, as even in ETS I only ever used 1 or 2 trucks. The amount of trucks in ETS was actually a little overwhelming to me the first time, as I had no knowledge of trucks and didn't know where to start, so there only being 2 trucks actually was a little more welcoming to me this time around.Still, with that in mind, I have a hard time recommending this game over ETS2. If you haven't played ETS2 yet, get that game first. It's got a lot more to offer and a lot more to keep you going. However, if you have already played ETS2, have all the DLC and want more, then I'd recommend this to you. It's a lot more atmospheric and has got enough content to keep me going.			"

												The game is great. It is a little small right now. Only 2 diesels to drive. They are going to add more hopefully. Their are only 2 states right now CA and Nevada. Las Vegas looks great. You cannot drive down main street in Las Vegas. Most of the cities look great. From SFran to Las Vegas to Eureka and Redding in CA. The graphics are sharp looking and they use a lot of neon graphics in the game. The cars in the game their a lot of differnt looking ones. Station wagons to convertables are on the road. I am really enjoying the game. If you enjoyed Euro Trucker 2 then I would think you would enjoy this one as well. The game runs on 64bit system. Their is a beta for 32bit system however they said its not gonna be updated and its not supported. The game is supposed to have another update to get another free state. The price is great for what you get and I am really enjoying this game.			"

												I have played about 28 hours at this writing, and I am enjoying immensely. For the most part I do in fact feel like I am controlling a real transport truck. I am playing with mouse and keyboard because I don't have a steering wheel, but this game makes me what to go and purchase a good wheel to play it with.There are a few minor bugs, but they are few and far between, and they don't happen too often,The sound track is bacically your own person music library, or you can choose from any internet radio station and the game with search for them for you. This is great as it means not listening to the same 20-30 songs over and over again.There are little things that happen all around you, that you my not even notice, such as a train going by, or crop dusters dusting a field you are drving by, or maybe you will notice things and crash your rig trying to get a good look at the UFO's in the Nevada desert like I did.The Nevada DLC is out at this time and was free, the Arizona  DLC is comeing soon and it will be free as well.Although this game would be a perfect candidate for non-intrusinve advertising, such as billboards or stores and restaurants that we all know, it doesn't have anything like that.After playing for almost 30 hours, I have to ask myself would I buy the game again...I have to answer yes.

												As a professional truck driver with a serious mental disorder (yep, 3000 km a week in the real thing and i still get behind the wheel on the week end... :D) i realy find this game greatly enjoyable! i play it with the oculus rift dk2 and i got some minor issues like menu screens not showing in the rift, but despite that, it works flawlessly! Also, i'm really pleased with the choices for the manual transmission setup, make me want to mod my g27 shifter to add ranger and splitter buttons to it! Only thing i would like to see added to this coolest truck sim would be some frame twisting and suspension work on acceleration. we would feel the load way better :)For those who are complaining about any ""delay"" about scs in delivering dlc, take this as a part of the sim, waiting are a major part in the life of a trucker ;P			"

												I've been waiting for this game to come out for over a year. It does not have a lot of content but over time they'll add map extensios and trucks. For the price, I think it's worth it. This game is also heavily modable, and they make a huge part. You may think it's ETS 2 clone, but it's not. It's different, trucks drive, they feel differently, graphics are different, the engine is basically reworked, adjusted to work with American trucks. I love it, for me it was worth the money.  "

												Let me start by saying this is a lot like ets2. There are, however, many great improvements and changes, with more yet to come. The cop cars and speed traps being mobile is much more realistic. The new city designs are much more detailed, and feel like real cities. Las Vegas, for example, is littered with people, bilboards, and casinos. While the main functions do feel sripped from ets2, the new American take on the game is very appealing, and with time can only get better. Keep on Trucking! "

												Before I begin, I want everyone to know that I've been waiting on this game for years now. Ever since we were told they began development. I knew exactly what I was going to get, so I'm basing my review on that.____When you first see the game, it looks exactly like Euro Truck Simulator 2. The only differences include it being in the United States, having vehicles driven in the United States, trailers that are used in the United States, and a couple states in the United States.After you get past the $20 price tag and actually get in the game, it's exactly as it seems. Just a reskin of ETS2. But what was to be expected? It's the same engine used to rebuild ETS2 for a different region. That's what we were told we were going to receive and that's what we got. I am not at all upset that we only get 2 states at release with Arizona coming a little later for free and 2 trucks. I knew I was getting that and I paid the price for that.The developers wanted to go the correct route with the game and get licensing for the vehicles used so the lack of vehicles is okay. As time goes on, we'll get loads more. As far as states go, 3 might not seem like much. With the scale, it definitely seems lacking in content. But you have to remember. If they went to a more in-depth scale and added more content, then it'd take years for a single state to come out. I don't know about you, but I'd like to have 48 states before I turn 70 years old. :PAnd the game is called American Truck Simulator. American. The United States is only one of dozens upon dozens of countries in America. Canada and Mexico are 2 more countries in NORTH America. Meanwhile, there's still South America that has to be scaled in. By the time we get all of that(if we ever do, the plans could change), we'd have so much map, we wouldn't be able to explore it all in a reasonable amount of time. Sure, California and Nevada might not seem like much, but they are comparable to Great Britain and France in ETS2 when you talk about size. Now add the equivelent amount of states as there are countries in ETS2 and you have the United States completed. UK and France might not seem like much on ETS2, but when you travel from one to the other, and then all the way to Poland and then up to Sweden, you start to realize that even though the map is small now, it will be much bigger later on when we have more content to play.Not much of a regular review that you'd see on Steam, but these are my opinions on the game so far. It's a reskin of ETS2 and that's what we were told and what we paid for. No complaints here. Still a billion times better than most simulators out there.			"

												Oooooooh it's been a long time coming this and I for one I'm not disappointed. Yes, it is the full Euro Truck sim skin but the setting is so much more appealing. In Euro Truck (modless of course) Manchester is no different to Stockholm. It gets a little bit samey after a while, but the little diners, donut stands, sweeping desert vistas and iconic cities give this game a much more pleasing long haul in the truck even though there are only two states in the game currently. As for the trucks, there maybe only two brands at the moment but they both drive so much more satisfyingly than the Euro truck rosta. You have to take on board my comments as a casual gamer, hardcore virutal truckers will probably find this easy compared to the Euro Truck routes because I wouldnt say it's dumbed down at all, I just find the truck handling so much more responsive. I managed to completed five jobs without a traffic violation, speeding ticket or an AI Kamikaze pilot veering into my side. That's a massive bonus and I'd say generally the AI is much better from inital impressions.Gotta go now, I've got George Jones on the Internet Radio, my coffee in a travel mug, my Philadelphia Eagles Cap on and my best checked shirt pressed...got some miles to cover to get my own truck and I'm wasting time jabbering on here. Buy it, you can't possibly be dissapointed :) ""Rubber Duck, got a smokey bear in the air, come back..."" etc etc			"

												It is hard to express the appeal.  Perhaps it is for the very reason that it isn't a ' kill everything that moves.  If it doesn't move, put it in your gun and kill.' I guess the closest way to describe it would be a classic transport tycoon game where you just happen to spend most of your time in the first person view of your best employee.  You can ignore the company builder component completely.  Or after you have spent some time building up your company you can devote much of your time to it.  I think players that do both will get the most from this game.Yes it's only 3 states and 2 trucks, but I feel at a $20 price point this is a great deal.  SCS has a solid reputation of adding to the base game for years after release, and not just paid DLC.  If you compare the base game of ETS2 now with when it was first released it is practically an entirely new game.  This game will grow for years and they will devote their time and energy into this game rather than quickly cash in and release a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sequel.			"

												This game plays very similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2.  The largest downsides right now are simply lack of content (only 2 states to visit - only 2 brands of cabs to drive).  The graphics have improved since ETS2 and cities are much more detailed.  Traffic can be more dense in some areas making the driving more fun.  The ability to spot speed traps and avoid tickets is pretty cool.This feels a bit more like DLC than a full game - but it is priced fair for what you get.  On sale this would seem like a no brainer purchase for anyone who loved ETS2.These games are a lot more fun with a wheel but you don't need a $300 permium wheel to get into them - I've been using a cheap logitech wheel I picked up from a garage sale a number of years ago...

												For me, this is well worth 14.99. It's just two trucks and two sates to start with, but Arizona and more trucks will be coming soon.I have Euro Truck Sim 2, but I generally prefer Trucks and Trailers, and Scania Truck Sim, as these two old sims concentrate on the challenge of manouevering and parking rather than the driving in between. - (don't get me wrong, I still enjoy ETS2 though).But I couldn't resist buying this - and somehow it is better than ETS2. The graphics, and atmosphere of driving along American freeways, just seems to suit the game better.I know others have complained about the slightly smaller scale, but that might be another reason why I prefer it to ETS2. The drive is long enough to enjoy, but not too long to get boring. And with the whole of USA planned, there is still plenty of scope for long drives.It's looking good, I just hope SCS are reasonable when they start selling the DLCs, I am prepared to pay but I will draw the line if I keep paying £15 for every 3 states. But they seem to have been good with previous releases, so I hope they will be so here.Recommended if you like the previous trucking incarnations & want more of the same, but with the real American flavour.

												Awesome.Still has some things to work out, but if you're looking for Euro Truck Simulator 2 with an American flavor this will not disappoint.Only 2 states (CA & NV) and 2 trucks at the moment, but they plan to add more over time.  After seeing their work with ETS2 I am sure that they will not abandon this any time soon.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit:  It's now been 25 days since I've bought this game.  I have not played any other game since starting this one.  They have added a third truck since my initial review.  I still really love this game, but they do need to do some map adjustments, and we seriously need some map expansions.  Arizona is supposed to be released ""soon"".There is now a demo available.  If you're on the fence about whether or not to get this, I recommend trying out the demo.  Again, game map is limited at the moment, but for the hours I've played I still think $20 US is a great value.			"

												When I saw this game coming out, I just knew I just had to get it because I loved Euro Truck Simulator 2 so much for its relaxing drives. When I saw the screenshots and teasers of this game, it gave off a different vibe. No more are you travelling along the moody highways of Belgium or Poland. Instead, the pictures gave off a vibe I never knew could be in a SCS game. It was colourful and very vibrant, really showing the spirit of the USA. Now after playing it for a while. I have to say I've really enjoyed this game. The cities are MUCH more detailed than in ETS and cities like Las Vegas or San Francisco has nice buildings and even the coast of places like Santa Cruz are really beautiful. The only main gripe of the game that most people have even thou I'm fine with it is that the game literally only came out with 2 States (California & Nevada) with Arizona DLC coming out soon. The map size is SIGNIFICANTLY smaller compared to ETS2 which had a really huge map. I believe the devs are working as hard as ever to pump out more content for this game and I'm really looking forward to what they have in store for us. Plus they mentioned that their main goal may be to reach the East coast! (Cross country drives? :>)Overall, if you like ETS and dont mind a more lively vibrant feel and colours, definitely pick this game up and just enjoy trucking :)8.6/10			"

												My impressions of American Truck Simulator after about 5 hours in game.Good:Scenery is good compared to alot of sims out there.Sounds let you really feel the power of the truckroad system is good and makes more sense in some cases than the actual roads.Same solid gameplay of ETS2 fame.Neutral:The game itself is for all intent and purpose still Euro truck sim 2, just with american trucks and map.. so if your a fan of ETS2 its good, if not well this title probably wont be your cup of tea either.Only two trucks... but with quite a few chassis/body options: Personally I prefer this to 20 fake trucks.. you may find it limiting so I list it as a nuetral.Controls I don't have a steering wheel so I can only speak to keyboard.. but the truck don't seem to handle aswell as their ETS2 counterparts. Of course that could also just be my opinion so take it with a grain of salt.Environment; this is different from scenery to me because graphically its nice, but seriously there are more vehicle in america than 1950's cruisers, RV's, Semi's, and cops.Fines: Holy crap police presence. There is no escaping the fines in this game.. ETS2 gave you speed traps that once you learned where they were you could slow down for em. Here? every third car is a cop who can and will pull you over for 4mph over the speed limit. Nice because it forces you to treat it more like a sim... but a tad over done IMO.Bad:Smallish map, I get more is coming out.. I really do.. and I wish I didn't have to list this as a bad.. but when you can run any route before you've even maxed your distance stat.. well thats not beuno.AI; its been a plague on this series even in ETS2 and it didn't get any smarter here.. same stupid 4wheelers doing stupid things right into the side of your truck.TL/DRIf you are a diehard fan of truck games buy it, if you like sims buy it. If you want a finished US map with a 48 states and a total overhaul from ETS2.. well maybe wait awhile and catch it on sale after some more content has released.			"

												If you can get down to the basics of the gameplay, this game is very enjoyable. My biggest issue is that I don't understand where they are going with the dlc's. The orentation of the game at this point is north to south while the orentation of the highway system is east to west. The up coming Arizona dlc is not going to change the orentation of the game enough to be worthwhile. Oregan, Washington and Idaho would have made much more sense, since I-5 is currently the main road and the focal point of travel in California and the west coast.			"

												This game picks right off where the 18 WoS Franchise left off. If you are familiar with18 WoS Long hall  you feel right at home. But is ATS just a New Game of 18 WoS Long hall!I think not, I think it is 18 WoS Long hall, while of course similar to definitely its own game with its own strengths and weaknesses.I was amazed when I found out that you can float gears, that was something I was really hoping for and they realized it very well. I am excited to see where the franchise is going and what all we will see in the years to come. The King 18WoS Long Hall  is dead, long live the new King ATSOverall I think this game is a wonderful start for a new era of Simulated Trucking in the Americas. I salute you SCS, you did it. Its Kind Of Sad That You Barely Get Stoped At Weigh Stations. Overall 8/10.			"

												If you can get down to the basics of the gameplay, this game is very enjoyable. My biggest issue is that I don't understand where they are going with the dlc's. The orentation of the game at this point is north to south while the orentation of the highway system is east to west. The up coming Arizona dlc is not going to change the orentation of the game enough to be worthwhile. Oregan, Washington and Idaho would have made much more sense, since I-5 is currently the main road and the focal point of travel in California and the west coast.			"

												From the makers of Euro Truck Simulator, SCS presents to us American Truck Simulator. It's very similar to ETS however they have improved upon the game engine, graphics and the road layouts. Thankfully now junctions make sense and dont suddenly turn into a slip road forcing you to cut up traffic as you change lane at the last minute.Currently at launch there are only two counties you can drive in (Nevada and California) and from what i've read another county or two will be free to those who have already bought the game but after that it further counties will be charged DLC. I believe they have a similar business model as that of Train Simulator where the base game is fairly cheap but add-on DLC will be the same price as the base game, if not more. I don't mind paying for DLC for a quality game like this where i will invest a lot of time into it, but please don't be money hungry b******* like EA or Activision.If you enjoyed Euro Truck Sim, or any driving simulation games then this is a must buy. The Multiplayer mod works great and the MP community (at time of writing this review) is quite reasonable and friendly. Just waiting for the 12 year olds to buy this and race around America.... See you in game!			"

												ok so ATS. At first glance most will and appear to have said it looks like a very well done expansion pack for ETS2. While in some ways i do agree, overall i do not. This is another score for SCS. While there is not much going on overall (being that there is only 2 trucks and 2 states to drive in) there is something rather satisfying about driving a Kenworth or Peterbilt along North American Roads with precious cargo. The game is rather small right now. But so far i have throughly enjoyed the 68 hours i have played it so far. I am down now to two cities left to deliver cargo to and about 65% of all roads driven on.  One thing that is a bit disappointing is the lack of overall accessories and slots to drop stuff onto on the two trucks available (Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt 579). Both trucks are nice to drive however. Plus the fact that truck and truck accessory mods from ETS2 are for the most part compatible with a few easy def file changes. Which has resulted in numerous truck mods and accessories being made available. For those that are familiar with ETS2 may find this game a little lacking. However it is still just as oddly engrossing as it's european cousin. ATS has the potential to be totally awesome once all of the USA is finally added as well as DLC's to add Canadian destinations and Mexican destinations will make this the most expansive game in SCS's library (considering the fact that once all of Canada is added it will add the 3rd largest physical country in the world with some of the worlds most dangerous trucking roads in the world). As well, the possabilities that can come from adding in Mexico is staggering.Great first release. i for one will be buying each and every DLC for this game. Good Job SCS.Keep on Truckin'			"

												This game is great.  Details are there, and some are more noticeable than the details in ETS2.  Only issues I see are the traffic fines are ridiculous, and the fact that in this point of time there are only two trucks and a small handful of upgrades.The roads may not be true to what they are in real life, but what do you expect?  A couple of roads on the map are steep.  There is a road that is really almost too tight to move through with a trailer attached to your rig.  The travel times and distances are shorter than in ETS2, but for a good reason.  It would've taken another year or two to make this game if they had made it in the same scale as ETS2, and to top that off it would take even longer to get the rest of the US done, as well as Canada and Mexico.   I think it's a fair compromise on scale.  Yeah, some of the stuff was carried over from ETS2, but think about it... the engine works, and works well, no reason to fix what isn't broken.  The environment is more immersive than ETS2 if you can get over the fact that the scale is smaller.Pros:  Graphics. (if your machine can handle it on ultra, mine can't but it still looks pretty good)          Details, details, details... like tumbleweeds.          Roads,          Steampunk paint jobs. (if you followed the page before they released them)Cons: Traffic tickets are way too high.          Map is smaller scale then ETS2.          Only two trucks and a few upgrades as of this review posting. "

												been a SCS fan since the 18 wheels of steel series, and honestly that game is one reason why i got my CDL in the first place. (4 years over the road).I am in love with the game because for one i drive 18 wheelers so it is natural for me. you get california and nevada at launch and it is decent so far. from the south of cali to the north of cali takes all of 5 minutes to drive (80+ mph outlaw trucking). you will love the open road and straight shot highways where you can see for miles because you feel free compaired to ETS 2.my only issue/ request is that i hope that we can buy our own trailer like in 18 wos haulin. in real life experience not all companies you haul for has their own trailer and also some of us only like to haul certain commodities and dont want to take any and every load out there.Hope yall enjoy it as much as i do and cant wait to see more states (Texas for sure)			"

												So, things that are unrealistic in this hyper-realistic truck-driving simulator:*The traffic in LA, and Las Vegas is not anywhere near as bad as it is in real life. (This is a good thing)*The intersections of freeways/highways are logical and identical and sane, and not anything like reality. (Also a good thing)*The AI car drivers use their turn signals approx. 10x more often than actual CA drivers. (Thank you lord)*The roads are reasonable in the towns and not anywhere near as maze like as reality. (I've been in a lot of industrial parks in California, the one's in the game are so much saner)*Every single traffic light has a camera to catch you when you ""accidentally"" run a red light. (Annoying, but okay, I guess)*A lot of the major cities are far less impressive and picturesque because of the downscaling. Admittedly, there is stuff in the distance in towns to add depth, but you can't drive there, and I'm usually so busy paying attention to the speed limit I don't notice. (LA didn't bother me much, but Las Vegas was super disappointing compared to the real thing.)Things that are super realistic and awesome:*That moment, where it's 3am and you're driving around Las Vegas looking for a place to sleep and you're staring at your GPS and next thing you know you've plowed straight into the back of a car while going 50mph? Yeah, that was me.*The first time I drove into Primm in game, I was so amazed at how much it was exactly like the real thing that I missed my turn, over-compensated, drove straight into a wall, and caused about 5 car accidents. Seriously, the Primm in-game is identical to the real thing, it's a little creepy.In short, you'll either love this game, or hate it. I find that it's great to play when I've had a long day, I can just turn on some dance music and zone out and drive. That being said, if you don't enjoy the thought of having to follow the speed limit, and follow the basic laws of the road, this probably isn't for you. I'm really hoping and looking forward to future DLC that adds more states, because while I enjoy the fact that I know all these towns, it's a little uncanny.			"

												In my opinion, it still needs years of developing to reach ETS2, but it's great. I like that it's better optimised for low end computer (or extra low end computer, like mine) and the roads are wider, really useful in this game because the trucks and trailers are bigger than in ETS2. I like that cops starts ""chasing"" you when you are overspeeding, but, at first, it was frustating because i keep getting speed tickets and i do not know where from because i have seen not a speed both.To sum up my experience so far, the money were well spend (it was a gift from a friend of mine, so his money, hahaha) and i like it.

												been a SCS fan since the 18 wheels of steel series, and honestly that game is one reason why i got my CDL in the first place. (4 years over the road).I am in love with the game because for one i drive 18 wheelers so it is natural for me. you get california and nevada at launch and it is decent so far. from the south of cali to the north of cali takes all of 5 minutes to drive (80+ mph outlaw trucking). you will love the open road and straight shot highways where you can see for miles because you feel free compaired to ETS 2.my only issue/ request is that i hope that we can buy our own trailer like in 18 wos haulin. in real life experience not all companies you haul for has their own trailer and also some of us only like to haul certain commodities and dont want to take any and every load out there.Hope yall enjoy it as much as i do and cant wait to see more states (Texas for sure)			"

												So, things that are unrealistic in this hyper-realistic truck-driving simulator:*The traffic in LA, and Las Vegas is not anywhere near as bad as it is in real life. (This is a good thing)*The intersections of freeways/highways are logical and identical and sane, and not anything like reality. (Also a good thing)*The AI car drivers use their turn signals approx. 10x more often than actual CA drivers. (Thank you lord)*The roads are reasonable in the towns and not anywhere near as maze like as reality. (I've been in a lot of industrial parks in California, the one's in the game are so much saner)*Every single traffic light has a camera to catch you when you ""accidentally"" run a red light. (Annoying, but okay, I guess)*A lot of the major cities are far less impressive and picturesque because of the downscaling. Admittedly, there is stuff in the distance in towns to add depth, but you can't drive there, and I'm usually so busy paying attention to the speed limit I don't notice. (LA didn't bother me much, but Las Vegas was super disappointing compared to the real thing.)Things that are super realistic and awesome:*That moment, where it's 3am and you're driving around Las Vegas looking for a place to sleep and you're staring at your GPS and next thing you know you've plowed straight into the back of a car while going 50mph? Yeah, that was me.*The first time I drove into Primm in game, I was so amazed at how much it was exactly like the real thing that I missed my turn, over-compensated, drove straight into a wall, and caused about 5 car accidents. Seriously, the Primm in-game is identical to the real thing, it's a little creepy.In short, you'll either love this game, or hate it. I find that it's great to play when I've had a long day, I can just turn on some dance music and zone out and drive. That being said, if you don't enjoy the thought of having to follow the speed limit, and follow the basic laws of the road, this probably isn't for you. I'm really hoping and looking forward to future DLC that adds more states, because while I enjoy the fact that I know all these towns, it's a little uncanny.			"

												I am actually really glad to have this game.Always been a part of me that's wanted to just drive long distances and see new things and most of all driving a semi while doing it.I really am looking forward to the completion of the rescale and the adding of more states and any possibility of my home town being added to the game puts a smile on my face (Though not really putting any expectations that they would though could also be possible being close to a trucking hub)Something about the sound of a diesel engine with the turbo building up then with a cha after taking the foot off the pedel and repeating with the changing of gears is like music to my ears.

												Pros:- Graphically better than ETS2Other than that, it's basically the same exact game.  The menus are litterally the same as in ETS2.  The game engine is exactly the same.  Just expect that going into this.  There are some other pros, but the are personal opinions such as:-USA setting-Style of trucks + sleepers-Engine + Engine break soundsCons:-Tiny TINY map.  You'll be driving the same roads over and over again.  Usually there's only 1 route you can take. -SLOW development.  It's been months and we still don't have the AZ map.-3 trucks.  THREE TRUCKS. -No offical MP. -Map scalling is terrible.  Wait until you try to merge onto the highway in heavy traffic.  The onramps litteraly spit you into traffic.  Did I say merge?  Sorry, just plow into traffic because there's no onramp.  The onramps just cut into traffic on an angle. Overall my biggest gripe is the slow development and lack of content.  If you're set on getting a truck sim game, I enjoy ATS the best.  ETS2 has a bigger map and more trucks, but I'm partial to the American trucks.			"

												As for those who have played Euro Truck Simulator 2, you will find this game to be very much similar. Truthfully, the only really noticeable differences would have to be the landscape(s), traffic, trucks, e.t.c. The performance and everything is slightly better, (in my case), and it was excellent to begin with in ETS2. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the ETS series, and for anyone thinking of trying out the series for the first time.As for the newcomers, keep in mind this is not a game designed for freeroaming, constantly popping in and out of any vehicle you want, or for professionally managing a business; it's a truck driving sim. You drive trucks under an employer until you make enough money to buy your own truck. From there on you haul various types of cargo to build your wealth. You then move on to expand your garage(s), buy more trucks, hire drivers, and make money. From a broad standpoint, yes it does simulate business, but that's not the primary goal of the game; it's for driving trucks.Summary summed up: if you want to drive anything you please any time or manage a business from a professional standpoint, this game is not what you're hunting. If you want to drive a semi, (and make money doing so), haul lots of different things, and design trucks for your employees to drive, this is what you want.			"

												This game may only be of interest to you if you are interested in American trucks but don't want to use the mods for Euro Truck Simulator.For a game that has only been recently released, the content included isn't as much as I expected. Driving with only three trucks and two states does get boring quite quickly. However, the developers are working on new trucks and more states for the game, however I feel that they should have postponed release until they received the licenses from the truck manufacturers and at least a few more states developed. At the time this review was written, a new state is in public beta testing stages, however this did come four months after the game's release.In-game, you cannot fault the gameplay. However if you have played Euro Truck Simulator 2 in the past, you may feel as if this is just a re-skin, since it shares the same base as Euro Truck Simulator 2. You may feel as if it's a deja vu, as you are seeing the same UI design as Euro Truck Simulator 2.However, this isn't all a bad thing. The gameplay from ETS2 has had a lot of work been put into it from its release in 2012, and every single feature that makes the game good can be found here. SCS Software, the developer, have stated that both games will receive any new feature they develop, so you can be assured that you aren't left out on updates to the game.Driving is a pleasure. Cruising through America was more relaxing than I thought it would be. It's obvious that SCS have put a lot of time and effort into the game's world. Though the lack of content hindered this pleasure a bit, I still got a few days of joy from it.In conclusion, I give it a 7/10. The gameplay of this game is magnificent, and you can never go wrong at a rather low price. However, this doesn't hide the fact that the lack of content hinders your continuous enjoyment from driving through beautiful American scenery. I recommend this, however I would say wait a bit until more content gets put into the game.			"

												It's lovely. It is. relaxing, beautifull, everything you'd want from a truck simulator. Apart from those weigh stations. Everytime you're nice and up to speed you've got to pull over and do something completely and utterly tedious that in no way enhances the experience. So, after 140 hours I'm getting bored of it. And I won't recomment it, or play it, untill they get those god awfull, tedious, game-play-breaking weigh bridges into optional. FFS.			"

												I recommend this game to everyone who likes to sit relaxed behind steering wheel enjoys country view nice diesel sound listen to country music. I recommend to play it with Force Feedback wheel to feel the vibrations of the engine. Newly after 3 years of duty in ETS 2 i bought wide screen monitor and the experience is much much better. But remember you need a powerfull graphic card to run this game nice and smooth with many details.			"

												While I whole heartedly do recommend this game - I also recommend waiting to play it.There is so much more that's coming.  Right now there isn't a lot of America in the game, in the future there will be both free expanions and paid expansions that will end up covering a lot more of the US (hopefully *all* in time and then other parts of the Americas).While this is a great simulator that's surprisingly good, there's just so much more coming that you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice to not play the future versions where there will be all that extra content in the game.That isn't to say there isn't a full game here, there is, it's just going to be so much more in the future that if you play it now instead you'll end up missing out on too much (unless you are a long term player that keeps playing it).This is the start of a big new project, but that's the thing, it's only the start.  I purchased it now to support the game because I really wanted to have it and I very much enjoy it but I'm waiting until more is here to play - as hard as it is to wait.So yes I very  much recommend the game, and yet recommend waiting.It's surprisingly fun and deep, I never thought I'd like a truck driving simulator but I more than like it, I absolutely love it.Unfortunately if we write too much our reviews get cut off so I can't go into more details of the game after writing what I have.  In the future once more content is out I'll see if I can update this with a proper review that talks more about the game itself than waiting to play it.*Edit - I'm rating this based on MANY hours with the Euro 2 version which is the same game only in Europe - that's how I can be sure I love it even though it looks like my play time isn't that much on this version yet.

												I really enjoy this game. I like the gameplay of building my delivery empire, customizing my trucks, hiring workers to increase my company revenue, and opening new shipping headquarters; while rocking out to my radio from the internet or my own personal music library. I just wish there were more roads instead of being limited to just California and Nevada. There is a add-on coming for Arizona which I am looking for forward to. I do recommend this game.			"

												Don't bother. I really enjoyed ETS2 but this one...seemed exactly the same. Only difference is the scenery and trucks, same old game though, got bored pretty quickly.I don't know if it had anything to do with my Mods on ETS2, but I had the american trucks on that one, so the game wasn't that different for me. I guess it would of been better if I hadn't driven those trucks in the previous game. But for a palyer who hasn't modded his Euro Truck, the novelty of driving american trucks would be appealing and make you want to purchase I guess- I refunded my copy after 45 mins. A shame as I was looking forward to this game, was hoping it was going to drastically different. But really wasn't.			"

												I don't even need to play this game to tell you that it will be worth a buy if your interested in trucking sims. Thats because the devs of this game and ETS2 are that amazing. They are always adding new content and more important, its very rare that this new content has bugs or breaks the game. On top of that rather than discouraging or even not allowing modding at all, they actually encourage it and have wiki's to help you if your stuck! Just an amazing team creating amazing games. If your concerned with my .1 hours of play time to date, rest assured that i have many hours on the european version of the game, and both are very awesome titles.			"

												I have to say that American Trucking Simulator is THE next best addition to Euro Truck Simulator 2.  Every bit of detail, and effort that this company put into that game is evident in American Truck Simulator.I have become diagnosed with chronic migraines and vertigo.  Vertigo has subsided a bit, and I haven't drove in a long time.  Euro Truck helped me get back on the road with confidence and I shall continue to use American Truck for it as well.  Thank you SCS for such an awesome game.  When I found Rachel, Nevada with the Little Ale' Inn, that took the cake. I wanted to go out there to observe red flag but never had the chance to go.  Just like it looks in Google Earth for the main building, and I love the night textures.  You guys just rock. What can I say. Well done SCS.			"

												Well its a little dissapointing  how they made the interstates and cut up the highways. Seeing highway 101 split into two very short fragments and Hwy 1 seems like they created their own road and put the Hwy 1 symbol on it. On ramps are too short, where there are interchanges in real life there are measly turn offs in the game. But even with all that I still really enjoy the game and they did get a lot of stuff right like the straight line that is I5, frontage roads, and middle of nowhere highway drives. For anyone saying wait for a sale, come on its on sale right now. If you're interested buy it while its $20 before they add more content.			"

												I bought ETS2 for $3.74 on a Steam sale, I feel that I 'stole' that game. I am happy to pay $20 for this game even though at this point there is very little content. I know that SCS will be adding much more for free in the near future, this is simply an early launch version. I like that everything looks just like ETS2, the menus, UI, etc because I know where everything is and it is seamless to go from one game to the other, without trying to remember where such and such option is. I hate when companies feel the need to change the menus to a game just for the sake of doing it, usually for the worse.There are 2 trucks and 2 states so far. If I had doubts that there will be more than this, I would not recommend it for $20, but I know, we all know, that this is just the beginning of what will be a great game.I play with a Thrustmaster T150 wheel with the Pro pedals add on and 2 Thrustmaster TH8A shifters. Yes, you read that right, 2 of them. Everything works fine in this game. I have my shifting set up in H pattern with one of the shifters and the other one (which is my rally style handbrake) is my gear change shifter, to go beyond the first 6 gears. Unfortunately I can't program the game for the 7th gear on my shifter. Hopefully SCS will change this in the future.			"

												This game is quite amazing. Very fun to play while relaxing and listening to music. My only problem is the law system and merging on highways. Laws are so stricted that 1mph over gets you a fine, while all npc cars can go 20 mph over. And the merging roads are so short and the cars just don't let you merge. But overall great game. Very realistic, and I recommend anyone who likes simulation games. 9/10			"

												I'll go ahead and give my recommendation that it worth the buy. We may only have two states and two trucks as of now, but Arizona is already announced in development, so we're already about to have three states.I don't have my CDL, but I'm looking for a school to get them as I've always been interested in getting my CDL.Out of all the games I've played being from computer to PlayStation and Xbox I can honestly say that when I play this game and when I played ETS 2 it relaxes me just driving around making deliveries on these games.I can't speak yet to how accurate the deliveries are to what truck drivers actually do since I'm not one myself, but the game it self is impressive on how well they simulated the drving mechanics of trucks.

												Pros:~Amazing scenery - The world is really rich with colour, and personality. Every where you go you see detail far eclisping anything that ETS2 ever gave. ~Great scale - Some argue this, but obviously the map will be smaller. Sure it does not take long to traverse the states, but the transition of scenery really captures you're journey. ~Good value - Yes, the content is low, but so is the price. For only $20 its a fair price. ~Good sound - Much is recycled but it still sounds great.~Unique handling - The truck feel really different, at least in my experiance. Rather slower to get moving, and a bit twitchy. Not sure if I liked it at first but after adjusting the settings I think I am rather enjoying the new feel.Cons:~Little content - Only two trucks with a handful of iterations each. A few free ones are coming, but more could have been given.~Few States - Only two on launch. Arizona is promised soon and will be given free of charge; its hard to complain about that. Launching with a few more states however, would not have hurt. ~Derpy AI - AI constanting is getting in my way when I have the right of way at a light. These are nit picks however and I am sure they will be addressed soon. ~Re-used interface - Most, if not all the interface is the same from ETS2Verdict ---------------Sure much is re-used, but most fans knew that was coming. For 20 bucks I think SCS was really fair with how they priced it. With stunning new locations and a great attention to detail anyone who wants to drive through the countryside should jump on board.

												I’m not a trucker, but there's something fun about getting in a truck, high above other drivers, pulling lots of inertia, and driving in a beautifully rendered world.What I like most is the world you drive in. Its artwork, see the screenshots, and captures the feel of each area. Also the long term playability of the game. It requires attention, you’ll pay if you don’t, yet relaxing somehow, and the world is growing larger. A game to savor.  What I like least is I wish I could drive longer in real time before having to stop and rest but apparently this is based on real truck driving laws. There’s an option to turn this off but wish there was a way to drive longer but still require rest. A great game, huge value, definitely recommend it.			"

												This game is quite amazing. Very fun to play while relaxing and listening to music. My only problem is the law system and merging on highways. Laws are so stricted that 1mph over gets you a fine, while all npc cars can go 20 mph over. And the merging roads are so short and the cars just don't let you merge. But overall great game. Very realistic, and I recommend anyone who likes simulation games. 9/10			"

												I'll go ahead and give my recommendation that it worth the buy. We may only have two states and two trucks as of now, but Arizona is already announced in development, so we're already about to have three states.I don't have my CDL, but I'm looking for a school to get them as I've always been interested in getting my CDL.Out of all the games I've played being from computer to PlayStation and Xbox I can honestly say that when I play this game and when I played ETS 2 it relaxes me just driving around making deliveries on these games.I can't speak yet to how accurate the deliveries are to what truck drivers actually do since I'm not one myself, but the game it self is impressive on how well they simulated the drving mechanics of trucks.

												Love the game so far. Only two problems I have with it. Number one the speed limit changes every 5 seconds that being once you have gotten up to speed you have to slow down. Number two the tickets (like speeding and running red lights) are very easy to do because the speed changes so often that you don't always notice, also you can't be in the crosswalk at a red light at all or you get a 700 dollar fine. Yes that sounds like annoying problems, but to be honest this is a great game and with the cities and States to come it will be even better. The rating I give it ATM is 8/10 but only because there are two States and two type's of trucks right now, but in the near future there will be more which might change my score.			"

												Don't bother. I really enjoyed ETS2 but this one...seemed exactly the same. Only difference is the scenery and trucks, same old game though, got bored pretty quickly.I don't know if it had anything to do with my Mods on ETS2, but I had the american trucks on that one, so the game wasn't that different for me. I guess it would of been better if I hadn't driven those trucks in the previous game. But for a palyer who hasn't modded his Euro Truck, the novelty of driving american trucks would be appealing and make you want to purchase I guess- I refunded my copy after 45 mins. A shame as I was looking forward to this game, was hoping it was going to drastically different. But really wasn't.			"

												Pros:~Amazing scenery - The world is really rich with colour, and personality. Every where you go you see detail far eclisping anything that ETS2 ever gave. ~Great scale - Some argue this, but obviously the map will be smaller. Sure it does not take long to traverse the states, but the transition of scenery really captures you're journey. ~Good value - Yes, the content is low, but so is the price. For only $20 its a fair price. ~Good sound - Much is recycled but it still sounds great.~Unique handling - The truck feel really different, at least in my experiance. Rather slower to get moving, and a bit twitchy. Not sure if I liked it at first but after adjusting the settings I think I am rather enjoying the new feel.Cons:~Little content - Only two trucks with a handful of iterations each. A few free ones are coming, but more could have been given.~Few States - Only two on launch. Arizona is promised soon and will be given free of charge; its hard to complain about that. Launching with a few more states however, would not have hurt. ~Derpy AI - AI constanting is getting in my way when I have the right of way at a light. These are nit picks however and I am sure they will be addressed soon. ~Re-used interface - Most, if not all the interface is the same from ETS2Verdict ---------------Sure much is re-used, but most fans knew that was coming. For 20 bucks I think SCS was really fair with how they priced it. With stunning new locations and a great attention to detail anyone who wants to drive through the countryside should jump on board. AI - 7Graphics - 9Sound/Music - 8Gameplay - 9Value - 7=====40/50			"

												Love this game. If you enjoy ETS2, this is the game for you. It is a little underwhelming, with only California, Nevada, and the Peterbilt 579 and Kenworth T680. This should change soon, with the state of Arizona being added soon as a free DLC, and the Peterbilt 389 and Kenworth W900 are on their way. The devs have shown us sneak peeks at a International Lonestar, Volvo VNL780, and a Freightliner in the works, and have stated that they will be supporting the game long-term. ATS is not as forgiving for new truck drivers as ETS2, so I would suggest you be extremely careful if this is your first trucking game, as the fines are horrendous. $1000 for speeding, $900 for hitting a car, and $700 for running a red-light. The cops are merciless, and when you only have $1500 to start with, it adds up quickly. I would highly recommend the game if you are like me and love details and eye-candy. The map is beautiful, very detailed with small additions such as skateboarders in parks and workmen at delivery points. The delivery points are much more varied and detailed compared to ETS2. This game does feel like a standalone DLC to ETS2 at this point, but I think that once more content is released it will begin to come into its own. While people are complaining that the whole map is only about the size of two ETS2 UKs, they have failed to note that the map is much more detailed than ETS2. In ETS2, every town looks pretty much the same, while in ATS, there is actually some fun in discovering new towns and cities, they actually look different from one another. I love this game and at $20, it's very reasonably priced, especially with more content to come.			"

Sometimes you get em for going1 km/h over the limit and sometimes the cops ignore you completely :) "

												I would reccomend this game, although i find it a bit boring (maybe because i have already played Euro Truck SImulator 2), but it's a really good game. The cities are designed very well, better than the ones in Ets2 in my opinion. The design of everything is on a pretty pretty good level tbh :D (its developed by SCS after all haha). There are only 2 brands of trucks and personally, i dont think thats enough at all but im sure they will add more trucks. The control of the vehicles is on point, the lorrys feel stable and a bit heavy, just like a normal american truck. At first it's hard to steer but as the time gets by you will get used to it. I think it's worth buying if you havent played Ets2 a lot before, but if you are a fan of this type of game i think its worth buying although you've played Ets2 before. The refund will awlays be there for you haha ;). 8.5/10, a great game, not fully developed yet. :)			"

												I’m not a trucker, but there's something fun about getting in a truck, high above other drivers, pulling lots of inertia, and driving in a beautifully rendered world.What I like most is the world you drive in. Its artwork, see the screenshots, and captures the feel of each area. Also the long term playability of the game. It requires attention, you’ll pay if you don’t, yet relaxing somehow, and the world is growing larger. A game to savor.  What I like least is I wish I could drive longer in real time before having to stop and rest but apparently this is based on real truck driving laws. There’s an option to turn this off but wish there was a way to drive longer but still require rest. A great game, huge value, definitely recommend it.			"

												I'll admit I'm a bit biased, since I loved ETS2, but this game is great on its own.  Its a great game, the gameplay is smooth, its relaxing, yet at the same time, offers challenges such as time management on load delivery, building a company,  and as much realism in a sim that you could ask for depending on how you want to setup the settings on the game.  There are also little things in the game that catch your eyes, like cropdusters flying over winefields and spraying, the tons of different car skins that they have added that look similiar to popular American vehicle models (there is a station wagon that when I first saw it, I thought it was the Griswolds heading to Wally World :) )  and other fun things about the game that make it enjoyable.  You can add your own music to the library to listen to the radio, or you can tune in to internet radio stations if you need some music while you drive.  I'm interested to see what direction they go with expanding the map with more states beyond California, Nevada and Arizona, perhaps more truck models, etc.  The customization of your trucks is top notch, and with the huge amount of mods out there made by users, the game itself has a lot of things you can add to it to make it even more enjoyable.  Pick up a copy if you haven't, you'll be glad you did.			"

												This game is short-lived. It starts out AMAZING, but then it just gets kinda boring. You are doing the same thing, over and over. I kinda wish I could refund it now but I can't because I went 6 minutes over the limit. The game has ok graphics I guess, and it looks fun but it's not after an hour or two, which is too late because then you can't refund it. My point is, unless you love driving on a computer for hours at a time, don't buy this game. This game is not worth it's price. It's worth like 5$.			"

This game I recommend to both steering wheel users but also keyboard drivers as it is very very easy to set up and get going. If your thinking what is the difference betweeen Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck simulator the answer is....well nothing. The only disappointment to this game is that they have basically just reskined some of the roads and traffic signs to make it look american.

												This game is very fun & addicting to play. Ya u hear ppl gripe & moan about traffic issues & what not but that's what makes the game challenging to say the least. If one doesn't like the current list of features then i suggest upgrading the game from the stable public release & try out the beta where the new features tend to be. As for cops they have listened to us users & have implimented a 10km/h or 10mph zoning so that as long as ur not 11 clicks or more u won't get penalized by the cops. There is still the odd pita cop like in Las Vegas, LA, Bakersfield, Huron that need tweeking but i'm pretty sure as the game progresses & more states & trucks get added things like that will be refined. This game reminds me of 16yrs ago when the 18 Wheels Of Steel series by SCS started & that was fun. American Truck Simulator is a revival of that old classlic like Haulin' or American Trucker Extreme 1 & 2 or American Long Haul that we all feel in love with. If one loved those then they'll love this sister game to the popular ETS 2. This game is a must have on steam & if it's good now i can't wait till the other 48 states come out & who knows we could even see Canada or Mexico added yrs from now. We could even see it pair up with it's sister game & u can go by ship or plane from American to Europe.			"

												This is one of the most polished simulators you're likely to ever play. It's largely the same feel of Euro Truck Simulator 2 because it's the same company and game engine. You just get to play in California and Nevada instead of England and France. You also get more American style trucks like Peterbilt. The driving itself feels very realistic and I play with a wired Xbox 360 controller on basic controls (accelerate, brake/reverse, automatic gears). The weather is dynamic so sometimes it will be raining or you'll be driving at night before watching the sunrise. It's a very relaxing game if you want it to be, but I tend to turn on the radio. You can choose from a variety of actual streaming radio stations right inside the game. My favorite is KNAC which is a real life heavy metal station.Outside of driving, most of the game revolves around you buying new trucks and managing a growing business. You will hire employees and gain experience to deliver more dangerous supplies which grant you more money. A piece of advice is I would save up a little money with quick deliveries and then get a loan from the bank to buy your first truck. The game really opens up once you get your own vehicle as it allows for free roaming. "

												If you love to drive trucks, this is the the game for you. I drove trucks in real life and this game is a pretty good simulation of it. I played ETS 2 also and the two are so different. Bigger cities, wider roads. The only improvement that American Truck Simulator need is the cops are notorious with fines and need to lower them. The on ramps and off ramps need to be longer for flow of traffic and big trucks. Also the scaling could be longer, more trucks added and of course more mapping. I know it takes a little time for this is understandle. Take your time SCS. I rather have a quality game than a rushed game. Therefore, ""I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! HONK ON TRUCKERS!!""			"

												If you like Euro Truck Simulator, you'll like this game.I like that they added trailers of different lenghts and made parking them more challenging.Also the addition police cars instead of stationary speeding radars (and warning signs) make things more interesting.Still I would like to know when exactly you ""qualify"" for a speeding ticket. Sometimes you get em for going1 km/h over the limit and sometimes the cops ignore you completely :) "

												This game wasn't good when it first released. The roads were so short, i could finish the whole maps in very few hours. Although the map was beautiful and filled with a lot of details, there was always something missing.Well that has all changed thanks to the new map rescale update. American Truck Simulator feels much more larger, roads are longer and a lot more details were added on the map. This was how ATS should've been since the beginning. I bought this game when it was on sale and I feel you guys should do so too. I still prefer Euro Truck Simulator 2, and i believe American Truck Simulator still has a long way to go in terms of expandability both in terms of the map and new American trucks. I wish SCS the best of luck in their future endeavours.			"

												I would reccomend this game, although i find it a bit boring (maybe because i have already played Euro Truck SImulator 2), but it's a really good game. The cities are designed very well, better than the ones in Ets2 in my opinion. The design of everything is on a pretty pretty good level tbh :D (its developed by SCS after all haha). There are only 2 brands of trucks and personally, i dont think thats enough at all but im sure they will add more trucks. The control of the vehicles is on point, the lorrys feel stable and a bit heavy, just like a normal american truck. At first it's hard to steer but as the time gets by you will get used to it. I think it's worth buying if you havent played Ets2 a lot before, but if you are a fan of this type of game i think its worth buying although you've played Ets2 before. The refund will awlays be there for you haha ;). 8.5/10, a great game, not fully developed yet. :)			"

												I`ve played alot of German truck sim, ETS 2 and some ATS.  If your like me and enjoy the style of game you wont be dissappointed with a purchase. It`s not all sunshine and lollipops though as others have said , Lacking trucks and map area does make it seem rushed but all of these can be added to over the coming years.The more support we give them through sales the greater reward we`ll get in the game once it has more expansions, And besides £15 (Or local equiv) does not buy much nowadays so this is very good value.

												At first glance it's easy to dismiss as an ETS2 reskin but when you play it, it feels like so much more and something really special. I came into ETS2 really late, got the huge pack with almost all the DLC included on a big sale and in a short period racked up close to 30 hours and still feel like I've barely scratched the surface. With that being said, I am aware with ATS I am not coming into it with everything already available to me, I'm an early adopter and all the content isn't going to be there yet. So I'm savouring the game in slow play sessions almost like you would sip a fine drink, paying attention to all the detail, and just taking everything in and enjoying it. Are there some things I would change? Absolutely! They've already reduced the fines, but the red light offence is omnipetent and sometimes triggers too easily when you've come to a stop but are slightly over the line. The on ramps are waaay too short and the sparse speed limit signs makes it really easy to get caught in a sudden 55 down to a 30 (I seem to recall a lot more signs you could see from a distance instead of just relying on the GPS speed indicator in ETS2). I don't know about the US but here in Ontario, Canada, our highways have a billion signs for everything.			"

American Truck Simulator is only going to get better			"

												Coming from ETS2 I do love the detailed scenery. The cities/towns are larger and more detailed. The scale of the map and time frame is about 1/2 - 3/4 of ETS2, but as the map expands it'll compensate for that. With the included Nevada / Cali maps a typical trip for me lasts about 30 minutes, which is a perfect about of time for me since I prefer shorter routes. There are some bugs on release but I'm sure they will be fixed soon.			"

												Think of this game as Euro Truck Simulator 2-2.  If you've played ETS2 then you'll find that this is more of the same, but thats definitely not a bad thing.  There are quite a few marked improvements such as multiple drop points, police to keep you driving honestly, weigh stations, larger cities that are less cookie-cutter and have a more natural feel, gas stations in cities, the list can go on.  The graphics are gorgeous and SCS did a good job capturing the American south west.The map currently is pretty small, only consisting of California and Nevada at the time I started playing (Feb 10, 2016) however they plan to release a third state for free and future states as DLC.  However, don't let the size of the map disuade you from taking the leap and enjoying some good ole American trucking.			"

												Very similar to ETS2 but American. So far there aren't as many trucks as ETS2 but more variation in traffic and scenery. There are also mobile police cars so you cant just hammer down when in the middle of nowhere to rack in extra trips before sleeping. There are only 3 states but it is a large area and seems to be plans to continue expanding.			"

I still can't tell you exactly why this game formula is so amazing, it just is.

												It's a really good game. Hopefully SCS can get the truck licensing situation all worked out so we can have some news trucks from International, Freightliner, Volvo, maybe even Mack trucks. I'm kinda getting sick and bored of just Kensworth and Peterbuilt. All in all, it's a good game. Hopefully get the TLS done soon.			"

												It's nice game to play. But I prefer euro truck simulator 2 more, if you're deciding whether to buy ets2 or ats, then buy ets2, but I have both and I'd buy both.It seems boring to drive a truck, but with music and stuff it's really fun and you learn how to drive.			"

												I have to say, if your looking for a great time to have fun truckn, this game is for you. I have never played a truckn game, and never even thought it would be something I could play for 8 hours straight. After selecting my music, and hitting the road, along with parking the trailer in not so easy places, I definitly recomend this game. I just hope we can get support for it and get some more content in the future, which I know will happen since we can enjoy whats already here. I seen some modifications already out there, can't wait to see some more.As far as what I would like to see done better, maybe some physics ( very slightly ) and just more trucks along with more states, which I know are already being worked. Great game though, enjoyed having the oppurtunity to get away and haul some loads across  country.			"

												The game is really good with more details compared to ETS2.Each city varies in variety and most realistic company details.I am really loving this game playing.In my opinion game future depends on how soon scs extends the map with new trucks new features and tonnes of bug fixes.If SCS wants to retain their customer/fan base they should release DLC/new features more frequently than year or two years.

												Absolutely brilliant! After hearing the announcement I headed over to Twitch to watch some pre-release gameplay and it looked fantastic. After buying American Truck Simulator I haven't experienced a bad momment yet and most certainly don't regret anything. A much more polished game in comparison to ETS2 however it's still an all time classic. I highly recommend this game for those that wish to relax and take in some of the greatest states of America. 10/10			"

												I often find myself in life unable to be attracted to anyone. Not one person has yet taken my interest, even though many beautiful women and handsome gentlemen have all attempted to win my affection. Nothing satisfied me. Not until I played American truck simulator. I first saw the game through various images shared over social media, which made me weak at the knees. ""What were these magnificant beasts?"". My heart raced at these images, and I grew obsessed with this illusive game. Finally, after months of anticipation and the purchase of a very expensive wheel, the game was released, allowing me to finally get inside the beasts I yearned for. I quickly made a profile, navigating the menus as fast as the game would allow me to, hands shaking in the process. Then, finally, I was inside the magnificant beast. My heart stood still, sweat drooling down my face. I began to drive. Suddenly, I began to violently shake as I began to drive. I began to feel pleasure for the first time in my life as a swooped around the Nevada desert carrying 18t of beans to my awaiting customer. The sudden release of pressure must have overwhelmed me, as I blacked out as I got the truck to hit 80 MPHI woke up 3 hours later, my computer screen covered in sperm. My chair leg was in my♥♥♥♥♥ and my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥was inside my computer, appearing to be so hard it smashed the fans. Best day ever			"

												The first hours into the game, so it is time for a Review. Those who played Euro Truck Simulator 2 will be very familiar with this game from character creation to driving experience. So, what is new?Good:1. Do you remember the exits on two-lane highways, when the right lane was the exit and only the left lane remained as highway? Forget it, they are history. Highways will always have two lanes, so be a nice truck driver and stay on the right lane.2. The fines for causing accidents / speeding / driving without light in tunnels are more harsh than in ETS2. Yes, I actually think that is good, for ETS2 was, at least in my opinion, too lenient.3. Landscape diversity. Surely, it is not the fault of SCS, that Central Europe basically looks the same whereever you go, but it was sometimes a bit boring. But this is America, so there is more than just green grass.4. The cities / towns look a bit less generic and a bit more ""natural"". Of course Los Angeles is still tiny, but when I drive through a town I now have the feeling that there really might be people living there.Potential Issues (depending on your point of view / expectations):1. One thing ATS did inherit from ETS2 is the traffic AI. And it still is a bit reluctant to simply drive at crossroads instead of waiting whether really really really no car is coming. I think it got a tad bit better, but I may be wrong.2. Trucks. You might have heard, that ATS has only two Trucks so far. And that`s true. SCS is still working on getting licenses for more trucks.3. Map size. Right now there is California and Nevada. These two states are roughly the same size as Germany and Poland combined, but compared to ETS2 the map in ATS is smaller, so you can cover more distance in the same time. The longest distance possible so far should be from the northern to the southern edge of California and you will probably find, that this is not the ""Long Haul"" feeling yet. A third state, Arizona, will come for free soon and, according to rumors, New Mexico and Texas (probably as DLC) are next in the pipeline. If this is true, driving times will increase a lot in the future, since the US of A are huge.For me, personally, the last two things are not crucial or game-breaking or even negatively impacting my game experience. But don`t say, I did not warn you. :)All in all I am really pleased with what I have got for 20 bucks and am looking forward to future developments.Greetings			"

												Excellent work SCS, this game is great, it may be similar to Euro Truck Sim 2, but that just helps its appeal. The changes with things like the weight station and the different types of parking make enough difference to keep me interested, knowing that both the trucking games from SCS are an ongoing project i think its exciting to be onboard for this trip to who knows where. Although the truck selection is small i still find this to be a great game, the AI may still require a bit more work as at times some vechiles still drive into you (like at the petrol staion exits sometimes).

All in all i highly reccomend this game to anyone considering the purchase.			"

												I had been looking forward to this game for some time now. Once it finally arrived, it did not disappoint. There still isn't anywhere near as much content as Euro Truck Simulator 2, but I imagine that will be fixed fairly soon. Overall, this is a good game.There are a few tiny details that bug me, however, namely in vehicle lighting. This is understandable for a european company though, as we do things differently here in the US. Here's a short list:-Trailers are missing clearance lights (the three amber/red lights at the top, or as high as practical)-On AI vehicles that have them, the clearance lights in the rear should be red (they are amber)-On AI vehicles, the side marker lights should be red in the back. The amber side markers are for the front only.Overall, this is an amazing game, with some beautiful scenery and plenty of detail. I look forward to seeing what future content is added. "

												I realy mis the Adaptive automatic transmission option.Now the engine feels wrong... In euro truck 2 you have this option.Sow you engine wil behave diftrent when you pulling heavy cargo, or you go uphill.Then the engine RPM wil go higher befor switching to a higher gear.Or you are driving behind a slow car en you want to pas it en you push the pedal to the metal,the gear will automatic switch lower sow you acceleration faster.== Ik mis echt de Aanpasbare Transmissie optie zoals in een echte automatise vitessenbak, wat standaard is bij amerikaanse voertuigen !Bij euro truck 2 was die optie er wel.Dus bijvoorbeeld.Je truck moet zware dingen trekken. En je motor is niet zo sterk.Dan gaat de automaat je motor toelaten om hogere toeren te maken zo dat je efficiënter kunt optrekken.Ook bij berg op rijden is dit nu een totale ramp. Je truk valt gewoon bijna stil. En dat allemaal omdat je motor niet sneller draait dan 15 000 RMP. En das dan ook geheel normaal. Meer weerstand ! Dus is er ook veel meer RMP nodig !Dus als Euro truck die functie had kan American die ook gewoon krijgen... manne echt waar dees zou zoon groter meer waarde geven... dan is het rijden met een americaanse truck volledig ! ;-) en vooral realistischer !!!!

												I've played Euro Truck Simulator 2 for a while now, and when its American cousin was announced, I wondered what it could offer to me that I couldn't already get in ETS2. Aside from some largely cosmetic changes, what new experiences would make this game worth playing? I wasn't going to buy it; I didn't see much appeal in starting over and working my way back through the grades to unlock more stuff. But I did buy it, on a whim, on release day. And I found that, though fundamentally similar (of course), it was evocatively different to ETS2. It has let me experience something that I hadn't found in ETS2. I find the gameplay slower, more relaxed, the world more open somehow. The prospect of bigger, longer drives once more states are opened up is enticing, more so than further expansions to the boundaries of ETS2.It's still early days, but I don't regret that whim.			"

But those engines had trouble on that hill out of Vegas. Even the Mack's 1030 hp Detroit diesel. The ingame trucks though... They crused up that hill! Very little loss of speed! The map was so detailed that I had to turn it down to medium graphics to stop it from lagging. I have a decent computer that doesn't lag often. It takes a lot of detail to make it lag! 1000000000/10			"

												I highly reccomend this game especially now that multiplayer has been released for it ( multiplayer mod ) the game is full of fun content and leveling up takes a bit longer than what it did with Euro truck sim 2 which in my opinion is better as you play for longer. The game is only a few days old so there are currently only 2 states and 2 truck companies, Although there will be a free DLC which adds a new state and over time as the developers get licenses there will be more trucks added to. To sum up the game is well worth the price as it's playbility will only increase as time goes on.			"

The gameplay is realistic, and most importantly, entertaining. although I have only played 2 hours thus far, I will write another review at a later date.Pros:-Realistic-American-Trucks-what else do you need?Cons:-Yellow lights turn to red quite fast, and this can lead to some painful tickets for only nudging over the stopping line.-Only 2 models of trucks right now(many more to come, I am sure)-Crazy strict ticket system, you can get a ticket for going 2 mph over the speed limit			"

												This is probably one of the best games I've played. Let me make the list.Pros:Realism - Like some others have stated you will bring stuff to where it actually goes, like construction equipment will go to construction site, etc.More Realism - Now I know some people say the AI is broken, but when I play it works really well. They slow down and even stop when your merging onto a highway, they will let you take your turn at a stop sign, as long as you use your turn signals then the AI works great, and much more!Even more Realism - Working mirrors (that you can adjust so you can see out of them better), looking out your window, when it rains you can turn on your wipers and if you don't then you can't see as well out your window, while driving you need fuel, you can get tired (I don't know yet on what happens when your tired haven't had a 24 hour drive yet), traffic offenses (they don't go full on all the laws in the us I don't think because then it would be a little to hard to start), when your in the county you can see crop dusters actually dusting their crops, and lots more.Mod Support - When a game adds mod support it allows the community to really get into the game because they can make content for it for other to use and make their experience more enjoyable. Like say you want a feature in the game but isn't in the game yet/won't be in the game, you can use a mod someone made and have that feature. They even help by letting you know when a mod is incompatible so you don't go searching for hours with tons of mods installed for the mod that breaks your game.Trucking - It's as the title and description say, you're a truck driver. (Idk if this is a spoiler but I'll assume it is) You start off with no money but your a driver for hire, earn enough money to buy your own truck and be your own boss. (Or get a bank loan and buy a truck. :P) I got most of the DLC when I bough the game as most of it is free. (Unless somehow Nevada isn't in yet and I have it for some reason. :P) If you think the drive times will be realistic because the game is very realistic then don't worry, they don't want you to spend 20 hours on one delivery. It goes much faster.And Lots Lots More!Cons:The only con for me is turning needs a tiny bit of work, like I'm use to the wheel auto-correcting when I let got of the turning button but I guess it's more realistic that you have to turn the other way to stop turning.My Opinion of the Game: A must buy if you like a nice relaxing game. Just you and the open road. But is still very fun. And I'll let y'all in on a funny place to sit online, if you go to Oxnard, the GPS takes you a route that most people at one point have no idea how to drive on so there is just a 50 truck pile up. And sometimes someone will be going 100 miles an hour and fly off the cliff. Lol. Definitely recommend this game. Fun times.			"

California speed limits are weird (Don't know if they're actually like that or not.. but they're weird""Good:1. Really enjoyable game2. You can spend hours playing and not know it (Wasting time basically)3. Big ""Map"", but hopefully they will add more states in the future.Overall this is a very great game (imo) I loved the Euro Truck Simulator games and this one makes a great addition to the ""Truck Simulator"" series.

												If you liked ETS2, you will like ATS. If you never played ETS 2, give this one a try. It's a driving simulator, but you're not gonna be spending 4-6 hours in real life time driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles. This is a good thing. The scale of the map is just right. I drove from LA to Sacramrento in about 30 minutes lol. One thing I do not like is that while some of the trailers are long 53 foot trailers, there is NO space to back them into the lot at your destination. It's almost impossible sometimes. Same thing with spacing at hotel lodges, and even gas station. I had the hardest time trying to get fuel becasue my trailer and truck would not fit in the fuel station. It doesn't ruin the game however, so that is why I recommend.  "

												It's a great game and I love it. It's just like ETS2 but all new places to go and trucks to drive. There's a few things wrong with that that I would like to see fixe dthough. Things like the light turning from yellow to red so quickly (and I mean I go into the middle when it turns yellow thinking I have time and it turns red and I get fined) and the speed limit change so fast that I'm going 50 and end up in a 35 and get fined (or something to alert you of the speed change better!) But otherwise, this game is oustanding. I know a lot of people are saying that it lacks content but it's half off what ETS2 was and it's even getting another DLC for free when finished. So they're just complaining to complain.			"

												Think of this game as Euro Truck Simulator 2-2.  If you've played ETS2 then you'll find that this is more of the same, but thats definitely not a bad thing.  There are quite a few marked improvements such as multiple drop points, police to keep you driving honestly, weigh stations, larger cities that are less cookie-cutter and have a more natural feel, gas stations in cities, the list can go on.  The graphics are gorgeous and SCS did a good job capturing the American south west.The map currently is pretty small, only consisting of California and Nevada at the time I started playing (Feb 10, 2016) however they plan to release a third state for free and future states as DLC.  However, don't let the size of the map disuade you from taking the leap and enjoying some good ole American trucking.			"

												Coming from ETS2 I do love the detailed scenery. The cities/towns are larger and more detailed. The scale of the map and time frame is about 1/2 - 3/4 of ETS2, but as the map expands it'll compensate for that. With the included Nevada / Cali maps a typical trip for me lasts about 30 minutes, which is a perfect about of time for me since I prefer shorter routes. There are some bugs on release but I'm sure they will be fixed soon.			"

												American Truck Simulator.I wasn't really hyped about this game, I thought it would be on my wish list and play a few hours and then go back to ETS 2, but I was wrong. This game just feels different and feels more alive and dynamic compared to ETS 2. Allot of people argue to say that it is the same or just added DLC but for the price of £14.99 for me in the UK. Why grumble! It just feels better and smootherAlthough the there are not many trucks SCS have told us why as the link between consumer and developer is spot on so we always know whats happening with the gameSCS are also a great developer as they knew we were excited so they released it earlier for us! A lot of games companies would never do that! Overall the game is a 7/10 and when more trucks and more map has been added this will easily be a 10/10 for me!			"

												American Truck Simulator is a game where you get into a truck and drive across the United States (just a bit of the South West and California for now unless you get map mods). It may not sound fun but it is because you can go to real places that you may not be able to see in the real world, there are a lot of goals such as;- Get your own truck- Pay off a loan- Fully upgrade a garage- Travel to every cityand so on. Someone commented here on Steam that it gets boring when you complete those ones but you can make more goals like be a major carrier with 1,000+ trucks and having all of your garages fully upgraded. Some cons are;- Steering wheel and brakes are too sensitive- You cannot own trailers- You cannot put your company logo and/or name on the trucks- You cannot put a truck number on the truck which is more realistic when you have a fleet- There are no beacons for the trucks at first but you can get mods- Almost nothing in the cab to customize- Road signs do not reflect light when they are in the distance which does happen in real life- Low beams do not have a large enough beam at night- No walking mode (however that would be the same as GTAV with it's trucking mods)However, some great things are;- Having realistic hazardous placards but they are missing the UN number for the hazmat loads- The parking brake makes a sound when applied or released- Unlike SCS's 18 Wheels Of Steel series ATS supports MP3 format audio which is more common it seams- You can listen to real radio station's online player through the game- Customizable licence plates if you have a World Of Trucks account- Varied delivery points and skilled backingSomethings I would want to be added is;- Overtime the truck gets dirty epically from driving in the desert and construction sites so you should go to a truck stop for a wash (if your truck is dirty then you are more likely to get inspected at the scales in real life), also the air filters needing to be changed once and a while. Plus, being able to spray your windshield with washer fluid and that running out over time- Emergency vehicles going to a call sometimes, occasional AI traffic crashes and other emergency calls and seeing the vehicles on the side of the road. - Building and road construction will progress slightly each time you revisit the area (more if it has been a while). Eventually it is done and some very old buildings get demolished then a new one is built.- Having a choice of Km/h or MPH on the outside of the speedometer- Hitchhikers and have some of them reference films, shows, songs or something. However, to talk to them then SCS would need to get several voice actors so the player can choose a voice for their character so the character can talk to them.- Several fictional game stations for different areas that will comment on the weather, traffic in that station's area and turn to static and eventually another station if the player drives far enough.Overall, I give this game 8.5/10 "

												Hi, my name is Dave ""Butter My Biscuit"" Johnson. Let me begin by saying that I've been behind the wheel of a Kensworth since I was a pup. My father would sit me on his lap and teach me the basics of being a man (How to drive a Kenny, how to cook bratwurst steak wrap, how to pollinate one of them there females, etc). I hurt my leg in a backyard gator wrastlin' party I had with my wife and 34 kids. I can be a bit of a show-off around the younguns. I was unable to lift my heavy, meat vitamin enriched belly into my Kensworth Dubya 900 Daycab. :( .I decided to pick up this beautiful sum birch of a game. Needless to say, I could not be more happy with that there purchase. I'll tell ya what, playing this game gives me a real semi! HAW HAW. I'm able to get out of the house and avoid the wifey while blastin' some Toby Keith on the open road. I'd recommend this game to any man who wants to put a few inches on the ol' peckerwood. You're sure to have a blast.I'd give this game a solid 9 YEEHAWS out of 10 possible YEEHAWS. That's 90 percent out of a 100, or 900 of 1,000 for those who like big numbers.  "

												As for those who have played Euro Truck Simulator 2, you will find this game to be very much similar. Truthfully, the only really noticeable differences would have to be the landscape(s), traffic, trucks, e.t.c. The performance and everything is slightly better, (in my case), and it was excellent to begin with in ETS2. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the ETS series, and for anyone thinking of trying out the series for the first time.As for the newcomers, keep in mind this is not a game designed for freeroaming, constantly popping in and out of any vehicle you want, or for professionally managing a business; it's a truck driving sim. You drive trucks under an employer until you make enough money to buy your own truck. From there on you haul various types of cargo to build your wealth. You then move on to expand your garage(s), buy more trucks, hire drivers, and make money. From a broad standpoint, yes it does simulate business, but that's not the primary goal of the game; it's for driving trucks.Summary summed up: if you want to drive anything you please any time or manage a business from a professional standpoint, this game is not what you're hunting. If you want to drive a semi, (and make money doing so), haul lots of different things, and design trucks for your employees to drive, this is what you want.			"
