												This feels like a game that was created in a week. It's not really worth the price. If this was on 50% sale, then maybe.- The character movement is ridiculously slow due to the bad pathfinding, so you'll have to use WASD instead of mouse clicking- Harvesting resources with space key is slower in comparison to clicking them- House sizes are limited, why can't we have freedom to choose the sizes?- You have to restart the game to change settings- There is no volume setting, so you'll have to just tone down your volume from windows- There is no save game button, so if your game crashes, you're screwed2/10. I don't like it.			"

												In short, I don't believe that this game is worth $10.  For one, there's no way to auto-harvest, meaning you have to keep clicking every time you want to mine out the same space.  A simple click and hold would have sufficed.  I also don't like the fact that the game leaves you to figure out the recipes on your own (or alt-tab to consult the wiki page).  There is a recipe guide in-game, but it only give you the ingredients of the recipes you've already discovered.  There's no free-play from what I can see, just scenarios and challenges.  Most of my time was spent walking around and trying to mash ingredients together...I just didn't find the experience fun.  It might appeal to some, but it didn't to me.

												As much as I wanted to love this game, it's not a good game. I spent more cursing the controls than having fun : - main character moves so slowly and does not know how to walk diagonally, - interface is not intuitive and still feels like an ipad port (e.g. screen not scrolling when mouse near border),- you have to guess the recipes like in one of those doodle god games : basically, you end up trying all combinations until you find something you can craft, some are obvious, some less so- the building a town/hiring people part feels restrictive :  the workers are just bots doing the more boring tasks, no personnality, but no flexibility either (you can't switch the task they're assigned to), the buildings have a very limited size and cannot be placed everywhere (feature or bug I don't know), even if the ground is clear.- quests are basic and uninspired "

												Word of warning -- TownCraft is abandoned and no longer receives updates. Developer moved on to new titles (Objects in Space).TownCraft is a casual sandbox/crafting game in which you build up a tiny settlement into a village then a town. You start with nothing and slowly gather and craft the resources needed to build and expand, eventually hiring travellers to collect resources for you.It's easy on the eyes and rather slow-paced with very little in terms of actual difficulty. You can't die, can't lose buildings, and worst case scenario your workers leave if you can't pay them. I have not run into a fail condition so far. There are randomised quests but none of the ones I have seen had any real time limits to them anyway.There are a lot of items to gather and craft, however it feels like this was just the start, like more items were to be added -- which never happened as the game was abandoned over 6 months ago. Even before I discovered the game was abandoned I felt a certain lack of depth to the game. Sure, there are crafting combinations to discover, but there's little really to motivate that and it's easy to build up a town and craft everything there is in the game.I can't say it's all bad though. For the few hours that played the game I enjoyed myself. Still, I can't really recommend purchase because the game feels shallow and now that it was abandoned there is no hope for more content. If you already own it it's decent for a few hours, if you don't own it there are better games to buy instead.			"

												I really wanted to like this this game.  Heck, I can say that on some level I do.  But  in the end I have to admit that the negatives outweigh the positives.On the plus side, this is a relaxing city builder with a fairly easy to learn crafting system and not much in the way of pressure to do things on the game's timetable.  You gather resouces, you plant farms, you learn recipes (I did so mostly by hitting the wiki on this).  You have the option to do simple production quests.  You can hire wandering serfs to be your employees.  The plants on your farms can wither if you don't harvest them in a timely manner, but that's not really a problem if you hire a farmer to do it for you.  As far as I can see, there really isn't any way to fail this game.  Also, the graphics are charming.  I can't think of another title that offers such a chill gathering/crafting/building experience, and that is pretty refreshing.    All in all this is a low stress game.On the negative side, this is a bit too low stress.   Your character moves very slowly.  There is no way to automate the harvesting of resources, or even to line up actions in a queue.  Pathfinding AI is iffy at best.  The townsfolk you hire really aren't very bright.  Well, perhaps there is some stress.  The controls are very clunky.   I felt like I was navigating my character with oven mitts on.  As far as I can tell, there is no way to rotate the camera, which can be a big issue when trees are in the way of other resources.These negatives feel like they could be fixed fairly easily, but this game feels utter desererted by the game devs.  I asked on the steam forums about the rotating the camera issue, and got no reply from anyone.  As far as I can tell, the devs stopped reading, or at least responding to the the forums months ago.   It feels like I am playing a half done title that the makers just got bored with and wandered off.A real shame, because there is more than a hint of very good game here.  I'm crossing my fingers that the devs will actually come back and listen to the concerns that so many people have.  In it's own way, this game feels like it could have the potential of the much much better, but fundamentaly different ""Don't Starve"".  Saddly, it's hard to really care for, or recommend, a game that has makers that seemingly have stopped caring about months ago.+'s+ Fundamentally a fun, relaxing, stress-free city builder+ Learning Curve is managable+Charming graphics-'s-Character actions are very slow-No way to automate or even queue up actions-AI, from pathingfinding to NPC actions, very weak-Controls slow and clunky-No way to rotate camera-No indication that the devs are still interested in improving this game, or even communicating with the player base.I really hope that I am wrong, and the devs will one day wake up and improve on this title that has so much potential.  But until that happens, the best I can give it is a  3/10. "

												The game doesn't feel polished. The pathing and the controls feel slow and clunky. Above that, the crafting system isn't exactly user friendly. The NPC workers are bugged, and I often spend my hard earned money to hire a worker who just stands in the street doing nothing. There's also no save game option. Couple that with the occasional game crash, and you have an evening full of frustration.The town building is kind of cool. I haven't delved into the more advanced crafting recipes yet, so I can't speak for that aspect of the game. The farming does feel a bit like Farmville, and I can definitely see the parallels that other reviewers have drawn to this being a ""Facebook"" game. Here's what I would like to see for improvements to the game.-Faster walking/Better pathing-More user-friendly crafting interface-Fixed NPC bugs-NPCs with some personality (they're drone like at the moment)-Sandbox mode-Save game featureIf/When these features are added, I will definitely update this review and recommend this game. Until then, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're looking fora $9 time waster.			"

												Towncraft is a lesson in patience.                                         (Video Review Below) Nothing in this game can be accomplished very quickly. Building a house, hiring workers, getting a stable economy. It all takes time and quite a bit of effort. That is perfectly fine though cause there really isn't any way to lose at the game. No monsters, no fail conditions, no natural disasters. Its just a matter of time and effort to win. I think this by far has people hung up the most. They want to rush through the content. The main character doesn't walk at a brisk pace. Could he be faster? Yes. However this is a casual game. Think Harvest Moon but a sandbox. You should approach this game, calm, relaxed, and not stressed. Towncraft is a game any age can play. To sum, is it a perfect game? No, it has its flaws and hopefully those will be addressed. Its still a fun game and sandbox/crafting lovers will find plenty to do and get HOURS of gameplay.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												I really like this game.  It's got some kinks to work out but im enjoying discovering the recipes and playing.  First let me say this game is designed where the challenge is to discover the recipe.  Im not sure why people think the maker of the game should just tell them off the bat what the recipes are.  That would defeat the purpose of the game.  Which is to think and figure out what the recipes are.    I enjoy mixing and matching and it just makes it all the more fun and challenging.  This is a casual game that was first coming off of an ipad to pc.  So im not sure what people where expecting with it.  I did my research first and went in knowing what i was buying.  Still for a game that's been cross platformed i did enjoy it.  If you want to give it a try for something laid back to do than i would recommend this game.			"

												An enjoyable open-world crafting and town bulding game for those who just want to craft and build without any kind of timers or demands.It does have main scenario and side quests for when you want a goal, but they're optional and you can finish them in your own time, and not through a sense of urgency or failure.It is what it is, and doesn't try to be anything more than a fun, stress-free open world crafting/town building game where the player decides just what they want to accomplish and how long it takes to do it.If you love crafting or town building, at your own pace, without timers or fail options then this game is perfect to just relax and enjoy with.

												Editing my review after an unfortunate visit to the TownCraft Steam forums.Abandonware.  My previous review was way too nice, even though I mistakenly thought it was an early access title; how fitting it is that this game is left as an unfinished husk, worse than any other early access game I've played. Anyway.  What I would have said back in early February/March 2016 is still true today, because the game was an absolute EXTREME rush to port from IOS and somewhere in that process it was completely and totally abandonded.  Occasionally a person who calls themselves ""Expect Problems"" (fitting name) posts in the forums to ""address"" issues, but a bug report posted in a stickied post in March of 2016 was replied to with:  ""This is a tragic oversight on our part. I will get our designer on this immediately. :-)""  A smiley face!  Of course nothing changed.  Avoid, don't buy, and don't blame the community of you do buy it and realize that while it might have been a hit on the iPhone, the port to PC is broken and unfinished to the point of feeling like a very badly watered-down Flash game.  A whole ton of promise piled on top of selling as a rare city/farm sim on Steam, it got them some sales, but you would do better with almost any game in this genre because even Towns, a game lamented for being an early dev-hell fiasco, has about 500 times more content than the ghost of a ""game"" that is TownCraft.

												A bugfest of a piece of an unpolished turd.Here a sample of some of the nastiness.- UI is just plain nasty and hard to use. If your charagter is moving you cant open any menu as it will auto close.- Crafting thing/UI is even a bigger pain, as your inventory keep resetting and you remove stuff from your crafting menu and you have tons of items, as you will as you progress and obviously there is no bloody chance in blue hell that you can have a filter in this turd as well.- Which brings me to another point on the inventory, newly created item is added at the bottom of you inventory, when you try to drag anything to the shop or from the stockpile, your inventory will reset itself to the top, so you need to drag the screen down (like an ipad) so you can drag another item to the shop/stockpile. Don't want to drag? Click fest.- This game is nothing but a click fest, and it will irritates you like crazy. With the Pathfinding AI is a nasty piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ you will spend most of your time cursing your character as it moves slowly away from the forge as you try to melt some iron to make a metal sheet because the bloody thing runs out of fuel and the stupid window closes and makes you click on the terrain and make your stupid character to move.- Harvesting is also a click fest and a nightmare. Clickfest is not gameplay. That why clever people created auto-clicker for the virus turd that came from flash portal that is called the clicker games.- AI is just plain dumb and buggy. Your AI Farmer will always keep getting stuck in a berry bush. NPC will stuck in bar for no obvious reason.- Destroying stumps? Or Want to change your field to something else? Right click and click destroy for every single tile, and if you accidently moved, then you have to repeat right click again, AFTER your stupid char stop its slow movement. And you cant even click where your char stand FFS!- NPC is a pain the backside to click, because obviously the dev is too lazy to implement a function that detect if the mouse click intersect with the sprite or not (which you can google in 1 sec and implement it in even less time then that) FUUUUU LAZY PEOPLEEven people who are into bondages and S&M will raise their hands up in surrender, and say ""nope, nope, NOPE!

												I recommend this game, so long as you know what you're buying.  This isn't a survival town builder, in fact, there is really no way to lose.This is more a crafting game with a few maps.  Each map, you basically build your small little town, and do quests.  Silver quests grant you money, Gold quests go along with a small story that seems to go across the maps that you build your towns in.  Eventually you finish all the gold quests and unlock the next map (although I think you can unlock them all to start in the settings menu ... but why cheat).  Of course, if you desire you can play on after finishing all the gold quests.To me there is enjoyment in figuring out everything, all the recipees, and how to build all the different buildings.  I guess you can cheat and use a wiki, but thats not very fun.Like i said though, no way to really lose, I assume most that happens when you run out of money is you lose all your workers...however, it's incredibly easy to make money....so i've never actually had that happen to me.All this said, so long as you know what this game is about, I highly recommend it...if you're into that kind of game.

												This is a nice peaceful build and craft game.  It isn't a hardcore game, but doesn't hand-hold past the initial tutorial.  It has a loose progression that pushes you along if you let it, but for the most part it is your sandbox to do with as you will.  It isn't  terribly stable on my system (1 crash every few hours), but it is a recent steam release, and hope they will patch up the issues in due time.  Well worth the price tag!Get it:If you love sandbox gamesDon't mind tinkering around with the crafting system to learn what you need to make what you needEnjoy slow peaceful gamesDon't Get It:If you tend to shy away from casual gamesNeed your hand held through a gameNeed action to keep your interest			"

												I like the relaxed pace of the game and figuring out how to craft things.It's unfortunate that it's been abandoned because there is massive scope to improve the game and make it truly special. As it stands, there are a few bugs and little reason to keep playing after you've built a town. Stocking the Tavern is tedious and grinding due to the clunky crafting system for food and drink, on top of that you end up with ridiculous amounts of unused resources due to an inability to either sell them to merchants or throw them away. Some quests are impossible to complete if you end up on a map that has not generated a resource not sold by the merchants, and the merchants themselves are a little useless sometimes because they carry only a few coppers. The pathfinding is a nightmare, and the system for removing tree stumps involves right clicking on every single one instead of something more intuitive like cutting down the tree and then removing the stump with a shovel.I'll probably still play it, as I like the initial gameplay, but in the long-term playability stakes, it falls sadly short and is quite disappointing for the price.

												Honestly this game is amazing and I am going to recommend it, However, the random crashes really need to be fixed. There is no save feature, so a crash 2 hours in basically means you wasted 2 hours. If/When the crashes are fixed I would rate this 10/10 for a casual building/crafting simulation game.Edit: There does seem to be a save feature and my data was saved when I logged in today. This made me extremely happy. If it auto saves then I guess the crashes are not that bad.			"

												It kinda looks promising but it feels less polished than half the early access games we have on Steam. All is done with one click. You have to discover the crafting recipes by yourself. You can trade with random people walking by or hire them so you'll have less clicking to do. Tiles look 'ok', animations are basic but that's fine by me. Crashes a lot so far. Don't recommend now but probably will when they smooth things up.			"

												While I WOULD recommend this game, I have mixed feelings about it. 1) The biggest problem that I can find is that it often crashes when you first start playing. Not to mention the fact that my antivirus software thought that it was in fact a virus when I downloaded it and began to play. So far it has crashed four times while I was playing, but I ignored it thinking it was something to do with my computer. After reading other reviews I realize I'm not the only one having issues there.2) As others have stated, the controls are clunky, and after about ten to fifteen minutes of playing  the obvious issues with not walking diagonally and constantly having to re-click things to harvest will eventually make you terribly irritated.3) I agree also that it isn't very polished; in the way of game details - the characters (and avatars) are quite ugly, but the items and background are cutesie and whimsical (which is fine). In the way of gameplay - I also have to agree that it plays almost like it was made for an iPad or Android. Not exactly PC material. 4) The crafting userface also isn't user friendly, although since I waited a few days to play after it came out, there is a guide on the Wiki. It's just not currently very thorough. 5) Unless you're really into the work put into Simulation/Sandbox games like this, it feels more like work than a game. Personally, I'm mixed on that too. While I love the idea of the game, and sometimes the game itself, it seems like I spend more time trying to fulfill the 'quest' that each scenario brings up rather than just building my town and having fun. :/ I'd give it a 6/10. It's definitely replayable, you just have to get past the aggravation of the controls, and the obvious need for serious attention to detail when building towards the main quests. Not to mention the fact that when you first start playing it will crash a few times. So there's obviously some bugs that need to be worked out.			"

												This is basically a combination of two games: the town management of Banished, and the crafting elements of Terraria.  That's a decent formula, except: it's completely ruined by the unintuitive interface and the horribly inaccurate, clunky controls.  If you click on a location to move your character, it'll take about ten mouse clicks to get them to stop.  If you want to craft an item, instead of getting a text list of items you need, you'll get a bunch of cryptic icons (you need ""iron bits"" to make a fence, but all you'll in the list of required items are a bunch of dark gray flakes).  If you want to scroll through the items in your inventory, you only have the option of spinning the mouse wheel, and that takes about 10 seconds of mouse-wheel spinning to get through just one row of items (it's so unbelievably bad, I won't hold it against you for doubting that last statement).Idea, not so bad, graphics are kind'a cartoony (not my thing, but still could've been fun), but it's all just horribly ruined by bad controls and a bad interface.  By all means, try any other crafting game out there and you'll probably be happier.			"

												I like this game. I play it on iPad more often than the computer.The game is slow and you never fight anything, although you can craft weapons to sell to traders. It is a cute town builder where your character has to do everything until you can afford to pay workers and have a house with a bed for them. No battles and no fighting for your life all the time. You harvest, craft, build, and walk around.It has several quirks and you sometimes need to cut down trees to reach parts of the map. Things are sometimes much simpler than you'd think. Like building bridges across water isn't anything special, if you have the wood, click on the water, ta da. Other times it is really complicated, farming with a worker means two wide strips of farms so the worker doesn't get stuck inside as the crops grow up around them.I think it is worth the buy if you want something that you can just pick up and build and put down again. If you want combat you won't find it here. Although, get it for the pizza trees if nothing else.			"

												The game never was finished, but the developer slapped on a version number of v2.1.6 at the last update, just 3 months after the Early Access game was put out on Steam.  That was the last update, the last communication from the developer of this game.  Valve/Steam really needs to stop all this Early Access game support they are doing.  There have been too many Early Access games now that have abandoned their projects before completing them, most of them seem to be in my library.  You do nothing to protect your customers from these failed projects and our money for purchasing something that is never delivered in full.Really wish that Valve would take responsibility for their actions, letting these Early Access games be sold, when they do not get finished.  This one, just like Starforge, had a version slapped on it to make it seem like it was finished, but anyone who knew what features were promised in these games, know damn well these games never got finished.  We all should receive a full refund for these failed projects.			"

												Other than a couple of bugs and quality-of-life issues, Towncraft is pretty awesome. It's relatively casual but at the same time has a tonne of depth and things to do. As usual you start by mining stones and chopping wood, which you craft until you can make shops, taverns and farms to fill your town with. You can then hire people that pass through your town (or trade with them and do quests) to run your facilities for you or gather resources. I found it really satisifying when I finally started having a lot of people hanging around the town, working or just visiting my buildings. It's a great game for people who like resource management/city-building games or crafting games like Minecraft. You are free to develop your town in whatever way you want.			"

												Cute but slow. The kind of thing I play before bed. I like!Some people say the Devs never finished it but I got it for pennies in a sale so I'm not too fussed.Controls are clunky, it's a bit farm-ville-ish but not quite as good.Don't get it full price but yeah.Cute. :)			"

												You spend most of your time trying to figure out recipes then actually playing the game. In game wiki only shows what you've already learned in way of recipes, that is if you can find the wiki in the first place. I got to a point where I was just bored to death.Stockpile is pointless, if you don't carry it, you can't use it.No open play, just 3 scenarios.Can't play in full screen. ALT-ENTER does nothing.Got it in a bundle thankfully.			"

												Usually I don't post negative reviews, but this game frustrated the hell out of me precisely because I like it in general and I want to play it - the game itself has the potential for a great relaxing crafting game. However, at the moment it's got a lot of bugs and it crashes way too often. There's been an update fixing some of the issues so I'm hoping to see it all resolved soon, at which time I could recommend the purchase. Until then, either don't buy it or buy it and gamble on the developers fixing the bugs sometimes soon. "

												I have MIxed Feeling about the game. The crafting part isn't anything new to the world of crafting. Which i don't have any problem with.some part of the game isn't that promissing, like the hiring. your employee don't work most of the time.You end up working and doing all the farming. or others.And when you start to farm yourself it takes for ever clicking clicking clicking.after 1.4 hours of playing and trying to see if i get the game. Alas, i had to close it. I'm going to say it's not worth the 9$ tag. "

												It could have been a fun little game but it the mouse controls are unresponsive, the menus freeze and block the screen...no full screen option. Moving around the map is frustratingly slow and clunky. The crafting system is shallow and very poorly thought out. It all just feels very bulky and poorly made.			"

												Notice the hours of the people rating this down.... They arnt giving this game a chance. I started playing this game hoping for the best and this game really is a cute little simulation game all about building ur city. Its very relaxing and for casual gamers. This is no Sim City but it is an indie game after all. Give it a shot. I find it really fun. Especially trying to find out all the crafting recipes.			"

												This game has alot of potential for it to be a fun little town sim. Sadly it's not built to utilise this full potential.There is a tutorial which explains little to none. You have to craft the most rediculous things without any crafting hints, all the recipes has to be figured out by ALOT of trial & error. And don't even get me started on the gathering of materials. It's even more tedious than trying to mine obsidian with a wooden pickaxe in Minecraft.4/10 because of the fun colour scheme used.			"

												As the name suggests this is a blend of Minecraft and a town simulator, using 2D ISO graphics instead of a proper 3D engine.Punch a tree, pick up a rock, make an axe, cut down trees, quarry rocks, build structures, and so on.Works okay in 4K, graphics are a bit weird (trees aren't polyhedral, guys).  Lack of DPI scaling makes the game text difficult to read in UHD. Unfortunately it's quite buggy and may take you several crash/reloads to get through the tutorial.    Other games do the same stuff with better graphics and more stability, so thumbs down ensues.			"
