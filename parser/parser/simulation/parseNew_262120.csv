												Signal Studios is a highly unethical studio, they basically ditched this game to go and work for UBI on TS Warchest. Furthermore, after almost a year on Early Access the port of TS1 to the TS Complete engine is bad, very bad, with many balance breaking gameplay implementations mostly because some of the turrets and units are just re-skins of Cold War ones, and lotsa missing sounds, with Signal simply stating, ooops!!! Some things just won't be ported!!Now, the biggest issue for many, multiplayer will remain locked at 30fps, that's if you have a helluva great internet connection to avoid the harsh frame drops, below 30 of course, and annoying desyncs. If you want to play TS Cold War, get it on a -75% sale, otherwise, look elsewhere, stop supporting Unethical Studios abusing the Early Access program on SteamUPDATEOn Feb 17, 2016, the game is finally out of Early Access, but:The desyncs have not been completely fixedThe MP 30fps cap staysThe TS1 portion of the game still pales in comparison to the originalAfter almost two years on EAP, the game was first released on Feb 28, 2014, they just couldn't get it right. I guess that when you choose to dedicate a big portion of development time to work in another project, things don't quite come out right:http://archive.is/Ldhks "

												i hate this game. don't get me wrong, when it works like it is supposed to work, it is a good time.  unfortunately, that never seems to happen for me.i got into the first level, and i cleared it, or so i thought. the game said i had cleared it, but i was just sitting around while nothing was happening. so i quit and went off to the forums. it turns out that the enemies tend to get stuck. you have to find the enemy that got trapped somewhere and kill it. i went back and played through again. sure enough, at the end when i supposedly beat the level, i spotted a guy on a horse way in the back just going in circles. fortunately, i managed to gun him down and get to the second level.i will tell no lies. i made it through level 2 with no issues. the third level was a different story.  i made it to the boss of the level, a badass thank called the 'tsar tank'. i got it down to about half of its health when suddenly it began to sink into the ground! oh wow, another game-breaking bug, yay! tsar tank was hanging out somewhere under the ground, and i had no chance of finishing it off. my only option was to quit. i vowed that this was the game's last chance, and it blew it. that was it for me!unfortunately, i am really stupid. i decided a little while later to give the game another shot. it is good fun when it works after all.i chose something different this time. the 'cold war campaign'. maybe the bugs wouldn't show up in this one? wishful thinking, it turns out. i made it a few minutes in before i saw an armored truck start to drive in circles. it began to get sucked underground by what only could have been an invisible whirlpool. it struggled for a few seconds before disappearing entirely. i quit immediately after that.this time i am serious. never again will i be fooled into playing this crap. the devs have had almost 2 years on steam to correct these bugs, but it seems no effort has been made. it is a shame, but it is time to express my disappointment and move on.god bless amen			"

								Don't buy this game, the devs more or less abandoned this game to focus on the sequel of this game. This game has remained in early access longer than the sequel of this game being developed and then released. Community left in the dark on possible fixes and updates since June.It seems Signal Studios are quick to abandon projects when being asked to by other publishers for other games.			"

								If you don't care about co-op, ignore my review and read someone elses.  My  review is aimed at people who really care about co-op. As a solo experience, Toy Soldiers is great.  However, If you're like me and thought about buying Toy Soldiers to play with friends, WAIT UNTIL THE MULTIPLAYER BUGS ARE FIXED.  I really can't stress that enough.  This game currently has desynchronization problems that make it unplayable for many people.  You may go several levels without the problem, but often your connection will sever and you'll both drop from the game.  As far as I can tell, retrying over and over will not ""luck"" your way past the bug.  Once you encounter it, its a wall you can't get past.  It's extremely frustrating and it's been an issue for months.  I realize this game is Early Access, but it deserves criticism as a standalone product if money is involved.  So consider yourself warned.Toy Soldiers is a great game on Xbox Live (good enough to buy it again on the PC) and I hope to one day see it fully operational on the PC, but until this game-breaking issue is resolved, I can't recommend it as a co-op experience.

												PROS- Tower defence with fully 3D environments, creeps and weapon behaviors- Turrets are varied and use ballistics, as well as AI aiming, instead of automatic guaranteed damage outputs- Player can control fully fleshed out turrets or vehicles to take part in the defence, not just a gimmick- GI Joe/Cold War 1980s trimmings, with historical weapons and creeps and a good amount of tongue-in-cheek- Visuals and sound are excellent (for a game from 2011) Players can also joyfully destroy most level features, leaving levels looking war torn. CONS- World War 1 content, whilst expanded, is inferior to the original Toy Soldiers game. Game breaking bugs etc- Multiplayer issues - DO NOT EXPECT ONLINE MULTIPLAYER TO WORK, split screen is great fun- Will not appeal to those fond of tower defence games full of numbers and fixed variables, or players who don't find the ""random and whacky"" nature of AI aiming and projectile physics to be enjoyable. If you're a tower defense fan but tired of strict grid-and-number affairs, give Toy Soldiers a try. If you've got any interest in 20th century military history, give Toy Soldiers a try.Instead of coldly precise towers on a grid issuing 10 points of damage every 2.5 seconds to the nearest creep, Toy Soldiers has machine guns snaking lead around the heads of Russian troops, or surface-to-air missiles casting smoky trails as they home in on supersonic US Tomcat jets. A proper realtime game with physics and 3D projectiles instead of simply disguised dice rolls hitting HP sponges.As opposed to weighing up number based tower upgrades, area-of-effects and watching hundreds of creeps marching in a static laneway Toy Soldiers brings real time chaos and player controlled action to the mix. Build your turrets and watch their various attacks interact with the environment and enemy waves without the spreadsheet-precision of regular TD games. Take control of turrets yourself and chain up combos to unleash powerful player controlled call-ins, or hop into a vacant helicopter or tank to sweep the battlefield clean of enemies yourself.Oozing with charm and  great ""modelling diorama"" asthetics Toy Soldiers is a breakout from the tower defense mould. Containing both the grim madness of the WW1 Western Front as well as the over-the-top 1980s Cold War, Toy Soldiers is a delightful mix of historical homage and video game fun. Contains the best representation of WW1 in a game I've seen, though perhaps the original, un-tweaked Toy Soldiers game nails it better. Only time will tell if TS:C improves or degrades the WW1 content.[UPDATE - Sadly it seems that the World War 1 content is doomed to be buggy and generally inferior to the original, but such is the effect of porting an older game into a newer game engine. Still, the very well polished Cold War aspect of the game is extremely worth the purchase.]			"

								Toy Soldiers, the original game, is highly regarded as a standout among Xbox live arcade games and was the most sold Xbox live game of 2010! The porting of that game to PC was done surprisingly well. The end result was a great little RTS game based on kids toys for the PC that was very fun and enjoyable.


Toy Soldiers: Complete 
A Screenshot of Toy Soldiers: Complete
By: รкг๏๏ℓ๏๏รε




Now, flash forward a few years, and you have this endeavor. An attempt to bring the entire Toy Soldiers universe into one game for the PC. Most of this game was never available on the PC before. In it's current form as of my writing this review, it still has some bugs and is missing some content. But based on past experiences with the previous port, and the fact that the game is around 90% complete, I can highly recommend this game. Just be aware.. it isn't 100% done yet.I dunno if it is the strategy part, the pace, or fps aspects.. but I love this game.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=420103475 And the whole toy story motif makes this one of the only games I would be willing to just sit and watch someone play. Watching toy planes bomb toy tanks while an old desk lamp from above lights the play surface.. it's art. So five stars and two thumbs up. If you like art, wrapped in fun, hidden inside a game... http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=425501632you'll like this game. And if you were a child who grew up in the seventies or eighties and played with toy soldiers.. make sure you have your heart medicine with you before you start playing.. cuz your heart may just burst with joy.

												Toy Soldiers was a fun game on the Xbox 360 with me killing thousands of toys to march towards victory! A few year went by with TS: Cold War being released but for the most part I had moved on from the 100+ hours of thee original TS. Then I saw TS: complete on steam. Those nosatalgic memories flooded back seeing TS on PC! So I bought the game (and yes I knew it was Early access) and began to see some problems. First of all the game is locked to 30 FPS which isn't a big deal to me so I looked past it. But when playing I saw that the game wasn't very optimised for mouse and keyboard. The key layouts were weird to say the least but again it wasn't a big deal to me. So I complete Cold war, now I move on to my WW I toy chest... Wait what... What in the hell did they do??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! THEY F***** UP TS 1... HOOOOOW? I mean like... Well like... AAAAHHH!!!(3 minutes of freaking out later)Ok, now that I'm a litte bit more calm let me tell you what they did... They copied over the units and the engine of Cold War... Like no joke, let me give you an example... In cold war you could get a ""special"" ability for killing so many soldiers in a certain amout of time, those ablities could be nukes, lasers, AC 130's ect... So in TS 1 I got a ""special"" ability, and guess what it was... A MOTHER F***** ORBITAL LASER... IN WW I NON THE LESS... *facepalm*... And thats not it, like i said units (being turrets) changed form what was originally in TS 1... When I looked at the game it wasn't the same game I played for so many hours... It saddens me to see how little the Devs care for the game, If you're a fan of this game from the 360... Don't buy this game, you'll only be disapointed... :(			"

								Dispite some annoying CTD bugs and some balance issues that needs ironing out (Like that the British AA1 is superior to AA2 and 3) I very much recommend this game. It's fun and has a good bit of challenge. A good unit variety to shoot at and fun turrets to upgrade and use. Yes, you can man the turrets yourself (Except in the General game mode) and shoot at the enemy.You can also drive and pilot a variety of tanks, aircraft and choppers to help destroy the enemy. Vehicles run on batteries and will eventually run out unless charged up again. Don't worry about them getting blown up or the charge expiring. On most difficulties and modes they respawn and recharge after destruction so you can continue your rampage.The bosses are interesting though some are VERY annoying.One thing to mention is that you can play any of the four factions (Cold War US and Soviets, WW1 British and Germany) in any combinations in multiplayer. WW1 Germany against Cold War Soviets anyone?			"

								Toy Soldiers is a great game, that being said it doesn't seem that the developers feel this way. Let me explain, this game is still missing content, that content being many multiplayer maps. Aside from this, the multiplayer itself has issues. Local multiplayer has some serious bugs (one example is having to jump before being able to sprint) and the online multiplayer is non existant, something the community has been asking to be fixed I'd imagine since the game was released on early access in 2014. I love Toy Soldiers, although if you are looking to play the game, I'd reccomend just waiting for the War Chest sequel because this game is honestly a waste of money, and as much as I'd like to say that it is a waste of money ""for now"" I don't think the devs care enough to update the game. With over a year in early acess and little word about updates, bug fixes, or an offical release date, your money would be better spent being thrown into a sinkhole.			"

												The game is fun if you don't mind the regular crashing, unskippable cutscenes that play out every time you restart the level, poor vehicle controls, an inferior version of a game that is already on steam that also costs less, poor balancing of the original maps, removal of turrets, and, most annoyingly, multitudes of bugs that would have been fixed if this game was made by a semi-competent monkey with down syndrome. The fact that this game has been out of early access and considered ""fully released"" is a joke, one at the consumer's expense.That all said, I like the game enough to play it more than once but it probably won't be long before I delete this and just download the original game, from before Signal Studios decided to fire the few talented people they had working for them.

Unfortunately in those two hours, I didn't run into a single mission that didn't have some kind of bug. The most common occurence was having infinite sounds from the Barrage perks or the ""scoring points"" sound. The game also CTD'd twice when I killed the last unit of the final assault wave on two separate missions.			"

												I love this game, I really do. However, I cannot overlook or excuse the many problems this game has. Messy optimization, regular bugs and it crashes during regular gameplay for petty reasons, making the experience bitter when the game itself is pretty damn good.The gameplay itself is solid. Nice feel, fun concept with dialogue that makes the game all the more fun and intensive when fighting down waves of enemies. However, the vehicle control could be better and it feels like a chore to go through stages again for various reasons (mostly bugs and crashing)Again, I love the game and if you look at how much I played the game I clearly enjoy it; but when the game keeps crashing when I'm just firing a gun with a high grade computer, there's something wrong there. Multiplayer doesn't even work at all much to my chargin and while all the DLC is free, you probably won't play through most of it before getting fed up with the bugs and quitting.  This is one of the reasons why people don't buy early access games, and why I can't trust companies like this anymore. If the developers didn't screw around and actually fix the issues like they said they would, this game would be my favorite game to play on Steam, but for now it'll just sit in my library as I hope they try again to make this game right.TL;DR: don't buy this game, it's buggy as hell. Go buy the original Toy Soldiers or Sanctum instead			"

Early Access Review
								Toy Soldiers, a very addictive Tower Defense Game that offers Endless hours of fun.Toy Soldiers was Originally released for Xbox Live Arcade back in 2009, The game was mainly about Defending your ""Toybox"" from the upcoming waves of Soldiers, Vehicles, and Aircraft. The Game took place during World War I, Which had Great old classic music, as well as the old weapons and vehicles from that time. Every Turret has 3 Upgrades, which Obviously the First Upgrade is decent but not too good, the Second Upgrade is better and somewhat Powerful, and the Third Upgrade is the best and most powerful. If you got alot of Points, you would Earn Barrages, but I only think there was only one on the Original Toy Soldiers, which would Bomb pretty much the whole Map. You could also Place some Barb wire so its a bit difficult for enemies on foot to reach your Toybox. The game was silly, but at the same time, It wasnt too silly, Which was absolutley Perfect. You could Fly Airplanes, Drive Tanks, You could be a Sniper and snipe all of the Soldiers, you could Control the Turrets, and You could even control the Missles that you launched from Some Turrets. The game was obviously a great success, So they made another Toy Soldiers, Toy Soldiers: Cold War. This Game was absolutley great as well, the Game was more Modern, It had more Modern Vehicles and Weapons. The Game had More Barrages, and Lots of more hecticness. But one thing that was very great about this Game, is that you can actually take part on the battle on Foot, as a Commando. The Commando can be very Destructive and very useful, and there isnt anything better than Hearing the Commando do his Insane screams as you Blow up everything in your path. The Game still had what the game was meant for, Its somewhat silly but serious gamestyle.The Game also featured Survival and Minigames which is Very Interesting. You could also do Versus with a friend (Same for the Original Toy Soldiers), and you could finally Play the Campaign with your friend, which offers just lots of Fun.Then, Signal Studios had one of the best Idea's, To port the original Toy Soldiers and Toy Soldiers: Cold War onto PC into one game: Toy Soldiers: Complete. Although its in Early Acess, They are Fixing it pretty much every month and are making sure this Port isnt one of those Crappy ports you find from the Consoles. You get Both of the Toy Soldier's, Plus you get all of the DLC from their Games, Plus you get Steam Cards, and New Exclusive Content that were never on the Xbox Live Arcade's Toy Soldiers. All of that for only $9.99, Which is a VERY good deal. Both of the Toy Soldier's used to be $14.99 each, and that wasnt even Including their DLC. Although there are Quite some bugs in this game, It is Very well worth $9.99, Do not have Second thoughts about getting this Game, it is Fun, Addicting, and well worth the hours spent.I rate 10/10, Simply because I believe that Signal Studios did an Absolutley amazing Job on the Toy Soldier's Games, and with both of them Combined into one game, Just makes it even more Amazing.

The Cold War content all works fairly well, since I imagine it was more or less a direct port, but the WWI campaign is still a crapshoot.  Occasional glitches and crashes.  Bosses don't work right, they shoehorned the Cold War gameplay/turrets into it, but left the maps designed for use with the old turrets.  They barely tried to make the new vehicle rules work with the old maps, and the old vehicles all work like♥♥♥♥♥♥in general now.  And this is all nearly a year after official release.  So, if you want to play the Cold War content only, this is fine.  Unfortunately, if you are more for the WWI half, and were hoping to finally be able to play it co op on PC, don't bother.			"

								(This is my first proper review so don't expect Totalbiscuit level of depth :) )This game is fantastic! When I first bought it it didnt work correctly one of the developers was very helpful and fixed the problem. Early access :/. But if you can get into the game without problems then its just awesome. The terrain gets destroyed as missles thunder through and your defenses take a pounding its just really cool. Unfortunately the WW1 themed soldier mode isnt availible so youll have to stick to mowing down plastic russians but thats not a problem because its not on the ridiculous COD level as its set in the cold war :). If you really want to kill plastic Americans then you can play on the soviet side which is interesting and the level of detail in the maps and vehicles is amazing. As far as optimization goes this game can run on my old wreck of a pc so its pretty well optimized and looks fantastic. All in all if you like tower defense but not the boring kind then buy this. If you like watching plastic soldiers get mullered by fireworks also buy this. :)			"

								Its a really good stradegy game that has that edge of epicness and style that has you more involes in the actual fight when you play as gunners or artillery even as vechile drivers that makes you feels more involved in the battle. There could be more better fixes to the bugs and more ideas that they knew they could have added then again it would have caused more bugs further delaying the time of the game such as the idea of a naval fight it would be good but would be tedious if it had HQ, Reguardless the game overall is great I think it should have a demo for those into stradegy games its one of the greats.

								This game is hilarious the bugs, the graphics, the storyline everything! The tanks in this fall through the floor once u move them, The bosses due the same thing every now and then. You do the same excat thing every single mission. But the air planes and support you get are fun. Nukes, Warships, bombers, fighters, Mustard Gas, and Special Forces support is probably the main highlights of the game for me. Would i recommend this game to the world for the gameplay? No. Would I recommend this game to the world because of the bugs? HECK YES!!			"

												I played the game on Xbox, both the original and cold war. And was gifted this by a friend,I wish i could return it for him...Deciding to complete the WWI campaigns first I played threw them, i was a bit surprised at first finding how this versions units had changed. Mortars were no longer AT weapons but now gas launchers, There were anti tank guns too, Armoured trucks functioned like cold-war APCs and the AI vehicles took a lot more interest in destroying turrets. Planes and tanks now needed battery charge;Not bad, it was clear though espeically with the bostgame they'd more or less reskinned the Coldwar game for the WWI game...Then came the first boss, the TSAR tank, or, more likely then didn't come... It simply rolled out, entred the main battlefield and froze. not shooting, not deploying troops, it was just pelted by my artillery emplacements...I decided to retry it, probably on my end right? Nope same thing again...After that i got the AA gun mark II, which atleast in player hands is massively inferior to the MK I, it shoots like a shotgun,  your turret AI can machine gun it liek crazy, while humans can't... the original AA from TS was much better, a heavier MG.Then came a mission in the Trainyard, bombers turned up the they circled away from my turrets dropping bombs and either died or flew off. Next some elite troops spawned, got stuck on the traintracks running in circles and died to artillery fire... And then finally came the helicopters. The original ones were slow sorta derpy, durable, these ones jsut dashed my box, one getting through, while machinegunning my turrets...The next level was it though. the MKIII AA, basically the MKII but does more damage and fires slower. it doesn't produce a flak-cloud like the ould game... Oh and your turret AI is useless with it. It can't aim and hit fighters, meaning i had to manually control it but lsot to fighter spam, that's when i decided i was done.Don't by the game, Don't gift the game, Don't play the game.It's broken, very much so, and based on the top reviews, most of which are negative, the devs have little intent to fix it either, with more bugs further in the game.play the originals, do not play Complete.

								Only thumbing down do to it's current state.Loved this game back on the Xbox, so in terms of the actual gameplay it is perfectly fine. However, my gripes are with the amount of bugs in this currently which greatly hinder that previous experience I had on the console version. Short list of them so far:- Crashes when completing levels, causing me to have to replay them all over again which is especially fraustrating.- Gunfire sounds being non existant.- Music being non existant except in the menu's.- When launching planes they sometimes blow up instantly for no reason.- Planes in the WW1 Campaigns help pop-ups are those of the Vietnam era.- Planes in the WW1 Campaigns having the sonic boom effect, which happens constantly.These aren't exactly game breaking bugs other than the crashes but they are certainly annoying. Hoping these get sorted out soon.			"

Early Access Review
								The first Toy Soldiers is one of my all time favorite games. The fact that this has the original Toy Soldiers and all of its DLC AND the second Toy Soldier and all of ITS DLC for $10 is amazing. At the time of writing this review I have 1.6 hours clocked in and have barley worked through the first campaign of the Cold War part, this pack gives you a lot of bang for your buck. I grew up playing countless tower defense flash games and this game is by far the best in the tower defense genre I have played. The selling-point mechanic that sets this game apart from other tower defense games is that you can take control of your various towers and vehicles on the map to fight the waves of enemies head on. While controlling a tower the game will give it bonus abilities, for example an AI mortar tower will fire one round then aim and fire again; when the play controls that same tower they can now fire three mortars in quick succession or take control of one fired shell, altering its course slightly and speed dramatically. However you can play the entire game without touching a vehicle or controlling a tower and play it as any other tower defense game, the vehicles and tower control will just give you that extra edge when things get tense and enemies slip through the lines.This game is beautifully themed and designed, all the soldiers, vehicles, towers, and environments are in the style of an old war diorama model kit. The vehicles are all wind up, the soldiers are all display figures, the towers are all little glued together models, and the maps all take place in open model terrain cases, complete with painted cardboard sky and cloud borders on maps that give you a plane. One of my favorite parts of the game is the ability to pause it at any time and enter ""Tilt-Shift mode"" which brings the depth of field and focal point really close up and drops the camera to near the ground so you can take some awesome screenshots, check out my Toy Soldiers screenshots on my profile for some examples.The maps offer a fair bit of challenge to them but you can always make it harder by playing on a harder difficultly. There are other gamemodes like Survival and with this complete pack there's even multiplayer, but I haven't tried that out yet.A final note is that the music and sound design is superb, Signal has really made a great game, I consider this my 'perfect game' for this genre.

								Toy Soldiers, the original game, is highly regarded as a standout among Xbox live arcade games and was the most sold Xbox live game of 2010! The porting of that game to PC was done surprisingly well. The end result was a great little RTS game based on kids toys for the PC that was very fun and enjoyable. It is one of the very few games I played all the way through several times.Now, flash forward a few years, and you have this endeavor. An attempt to bring the entire Toy Soldiers universe into one game for the PC. Most of this game was never available on the PC before. In it's current form as of my writing this review, it still has some bugs and is missing some content. But based on past experiences with the previous port, and the fact that the game is around 90% complete, I can highly recommend this game. Just be aware.. it isn't 100% done yet.I dunno if it is the strategy part, the pace, or fps aspects.. but I love this game. And the whole toy story motif makes this one of the only games I would be willing to just sit and watch someone play. Watching toy planes bomb toy tanks while an old desk lamp from above lights the play surface.. it's art. So five stars and two thumbs up. If you like art, wrapped in fun, hidden inside a game... you'll like this game. And if you were a child who grew up in the seventies or eighties and played with toy soldiers.. make sure you have your heart medicine with you before you start playing.. cuz your heart may just burst with joy.

Just be aware that this is early access and as far as I can tell it is a direct port from the 360 as of this time, the devs stated that it will be optimized and prettied up hence the ""Early Access"". It also curretnly does not include the original Toy Soldiers as of this moment.			"

												This is my first review so please muddle through it with we! :)  I enjoy the game.  I played the original Toy Soldiers on Xbox 360 as well as Cold War.  I remember back in the day I was enchanted by the fun of the cartoony men and wind-em-up tanks.  The little pop of a toy as I nailed it at 100 meters with my sniper tower.  The tension of that one enemy troop nearly making it into my beloved toybox.  I poured a lot of time into the 360 version.  It was fun.    Now on my PC rig I have that same pleasure!  The game is still fun.  For me the biggest pro in favor of this game: the shear time pleasing experience.  It is a basic tower defence with good character.  The controls are fluid and easy to use(with a controller).  The environment is somewhat destructible and generally nice to fly around.  The base setup is well thought out and variously flavored.    However, this game does suffer from a few technical errors.  The frame rate is generally good but can be susceptible to some drops.  A few bugs here and there, but nothing to really turn me off to the game.      To round up, the game is fun.  It has a nice feel even though it can be a bit buggy.  So, if you can not stand a few bugs, this title is not for you.  But, if you are looking for a good title that is a bunch of fun, certainly pick this one up on sale. Cheers!			"

								Currently is only Toy Soldiers: Cold War, but the first game is coming soon, I expect. Works well for an Early Access game, and I really like it! Got both of these games on xBox Live Arcade, and nearly completed both! Even my Dad got really into this game! The controls were a bit wonky at first, and I have seen some wierd difficulty spikes, but it is rather forgiveable, given that it is an Early Access game. I have heard that there are some graphics issues when playing at higher resolutions, but I play at fairly low resolution for a better framerate, so I don't see it. The biggest issue I have had is the mouse. I can never get the right sensitivity, It is either too low or too high, no matter what I pick. I still reccomend this game, as many of the current flaws are bound to be patched up soon.			"

								Ever gotten bored of a TD (Tower Defense) Game? I personally love this game and I recomend it to anyone and everyone who loves strategy and redicuous ammounts and fun and unique gameplay! As you place down turrets, you can even control the turrets, and controling them gives special bonuses, such as increased clip size (Shoot 5 rounds from a normally 1 round clip), increased damage, target prioritizing, and even more! Plus, Co-op is coming out for the game pretty soon, or it's already out, either way, this is a rediclously fun game....			"

								日本人の方はこちらのurlに日本文があります。http://ameblo.jp/kaiefs/entry-11846897737.htmlUnfortunately. A masterpiece is becoming the commonplace work by unnecessary decoration.I would like to play original ToySoldiers1 without a bug. I am playing Toy Soldiers and Cold War by XBLA.Finishing of a clearance of all the difficulty all the stages except DLC of unpurchased Cold War.A recommended reason is in the expectation for Toy Soldiers1 and Steam Workshop which are probably mounted from now on. Then, how is Cold War?At various game sites, the thing of Cold War is said like this.Invigoration increased!The sequel of legitimate evolution!Probably, it is people's comment played only for a short time.We(The friend of me and me) consider like this.A previous work is the tower defense game which added the action element.Cold War is the action repairman game which added the tower defense element.Since nobody says a fault, I need to say. Only the main point is written previously first.Toy Soldiers(360/original pc) 9/10A good point1. Suitable difficulty 2. The stage design on which the plan was elaborated 3. The role of arms has clarified4. Height of the flexibility to a victory 5. Score composition is intelligibleA bad point1. Loading is long. 2. Toy Soldiers: Complete looks bad when comparedToy Soldies: Complete (and Cold War for 360/pc) 6/10A good point1. It is easy to win.2. If it is Difficulty Casuals, it is Invigorating Play in Those without Stress.3. Addition of a cooperation play4. Addition of Mini GameA bad point1. Coarse2. Badness of Balance of Offense and Defense in which Stress Accumulates Extremely3. Lowness of Flexibility in Score Earnings4. Medal assessment system5. Unrestricted combo6. Special Support Attack of Fate Request7. Score composition is unclear. 8. Introductory Scene of Each Stage Cannot be Skipped.It writes in detail about the bad point of Cold War. Since it becomes long, others exclude. A bad point1. CoarseAlthough it seems that it has been somewhat improved in DLC, proper use of arms is seldom needed in Cold War main knitting.What is necessary is to use only the Anti Tank Lv3 and the Canon Lv2, since the stage design is simple. If difficulty Hard and a difficulty general are removed, arms will use properly mostly and it will not enter. 2. Badness of Balance of Offense and Defense in which Stress Accumulates ExtremelyIt may be that the addition of a cooperation play is a reason. By the difficulty elite and a difficulty general, there is a very difficult scene which considers considerably at a single play. An enemy's offensive strength and defense power are too high. The enemy who cannot destroy with one blow of the Canon Lv2 and Lv3 has very long time to remain in a stage. Those enemies are high fire power almost without exception. The amount of damages given to a player may be over gold and defense power which a player acquires. It becomes a game to the extent that repair is repeated mostly in the second half. 3. Lowness of the capture flexibility in score acquisitionIn Toy Soldiers1, there was a difference in the capture method for every player also in score acquisition. In Cold War, the flexibility is quite low. The reason is wavelink, overkill, and thrillride. These are the bonuses which occur when arms and a vehicle are operated by themselves. First, overkill and thrillride. If these two remove a vehicle, it will almost be the case to take out with a Anti tank and a Canon. That is, there is little necessity of using other arms. Next, wavelink.It is necessary to continue beating an enemy by one's hand for taking out a high score. It is the same as difficulty elite capture. Just the difficulty elite is enough as abandoning the auto pilot of arms. 4. Medal assessment systemThe medal evaluation by an attack, defense, and a profit is too severe. It is especially a profit. Restricting the amount of money which can be used leads to restricting the number of installation and the number of times of repair of arms. In this game that is busy with repair in very many cases, I can think a quite unreasonable valuation basis. You should remove the profit for evaluation, if you would like to use an invigorating game. Only the difficulty casuals in which a light gamer plays. 5. Unrestricted comboThe cause of making the player engaged in monotonous work. A remarkable combo can be earned by operating one arms all the time on most stages. However, I cannot think that it is connected with pleasure. It is mechanical work and is monotonous. The timing which stops a combo is considered. And it prepares for the next wave. ToySoldiers1 they were required for is more pleasant. 6. Special Support Attack of Fate RequestToy soldiers1 might be influenced by fate. However, as for Cold War, the element of its luck became strong beyond comparison. It is a special support attack. As for a use, any special support is offered. However, the things with a strong instantaneous effect are Ramboo and a nuclear fusion cartridge. Probably, there are many people who expect that these two will come out. But it is completely random what comes out. Even an appearance of an enemy with special support with a star is random. This is bad in a game with a strong score acquisition element. Corrective strategy is two kinds. By a stage, the kind of special support attack is extracted to some extent, and it fixes. Or a special support attack needed is gained with the number of points like Gradius of STG. 7. Score composition is unclear. The contents of the result are unclear. I want it to clarify what point to have been taken by wavelink, a turbocharger, overkill, etc. 8. Introductory Scene of Each Stage Cannot be Skipped.Camera work at the time of a game start. Mini game. It is disgusted that coercion is exerted. The main requests to new work 1. Exclusion of Wavelink The cause which makes Cold War monotonous. 2. Reexamination of arms and a stage design The stage design of DLC had improved. Unless a stage design is good, the division of roles of arms does not have a meaning, either. 3.Mitigation of a fate element If a fate element is strong, I do not want to do score acquisition. I love Toy Soldiers. In new work, it wishes to return to the starting point.			"

								Time to completion - Around 15 hoursWhat I played - Every mission (campaign and expansion) on normal. Minus 1 mission (More on that later).Toy Soliders Complete is the original Toy Soldiers tower defense game along with its 2 expansions and the Cold War stand-alone with it's two expansions.Tower Defense, eh?The basic game loop:- You can place turrets in specific locations. Certain turrets (like ani-air and artillery) require larger spaces. Upgrade turrets and fend off the invading forces.## The main difference here is that you can both directly control any turret giving you more accuracy and better kill counts, as well as using various level-specific vehicles which run on batteries.Pros:- Great aesthetic. Love the fact that all the levels are like in a kids room.- Level design is generally good. Sometimes i was able to place down turrets and then sit back for a round or two and let them go to down on stuff. Other times, there were bosses that would instant kill my turrets. But overall, I feel it was well done.-Lots of levels.- Survival and vs modes (didnt play vs),The Bad- Over the course of the game, I ran into 2 hard crashes to desktop and one instance where an enemy soldier didnt move and I had to hunt him down after the level was basically over. Over the course of 15 hours this doesnt seem like a huge deal.- I literally cant play the last mission of the main cold war campaign because it hard crashes to desktop on the loading screen. So thats annoying. Beat everything else though with no simialr issues,Overall:While this is still in early access, it generally feels like a finished game with a few annoying bugs, Gameplay-wise I say it is worth it. I am a bit annoyed I cant play one level, but thats one in a lot, so whatever. I do hope they fix it.			"

												After playing this game for a couple of hours, here's my review: Good stuff (+)- Fun tower defense game with a slight twist : you can control your units. I had a lot of fun playing the different turret classes and trying different mix, trying to anticipate the next waves of mooks.- The gameplay was okay, not perfect but effective. It's also pretty easy to understand the basics. - Interesting game design, it's quite fun to fight such intense battles at such a miniature scale.- Some of the maps are actually tons of fun - I liked the fact that the battles are directly inspired by historic battles (minus the giant tanks and stuff)Cons (-)- The vehile aspect of the game isn't bad per say but it's kinda slopppy and I kinda expected to be able to do more. Didn't use the planes much since I have a hard time bombing anything. The only times that were successful were the only were I was playing kamikaze style. - Some minor bugs, nothing gamebreaking though. - AI can pretty dumb sometimes (example : not shooting a tank 2 inches from their faces, had to do the work myself. A pretty minor problem but pretty annoying when you have a bunch of things to watch)- The camera has some problems but nothing I can't deal with.Even though there are some problems with this game, I recommend It. I had a blast destroying waves after waves of enemies (and getting crushed quite a few times too). Nice little game and probably one of my time-wasters for the months to come. I'd give this game a 7/10.			"

												Toy Soldiers does what it wants to do: It wants to provide nice quirky fun, from anywhere to experienced players, to casual players. PROS: art style It is funsteam achievements and trading cardsa lot of optionsInvasion modeCONS: -The final level in the campaign is a major jump in difficulty. It has to be 90% impossible. I think you have to set everything up just right. -A few levels make you have to position everything 'just right'. If you want to have a cheap game that'll provide hours of fun - get it. If you like strategy games, what are you waiting for!?			"

Early Access Review
								""This game is awesome. The exclusion or better yet elimanition of GFWL in this game makes it playable in offline mode which is a plus. I should've known this was coming out before I bought the first one, could've saved money....but TS: Cold War is only on PC through this game. I can't wait for them to include TS 1. There is a lot of bugs and the game does crash ocasionally, but this is in Early Access so what do you expect? This a defenite buy here.""No, it's not a defenite buy. Take a look at my new review for this game:Toy Soldiers Complete....what can I say about it. Well I can say  it's only half of a good game.  Cold War is awesome, it has explosions, easy to learn mechanics, and overall good gameplay (and the DLC is free!).  There are a few issues in Cold War but are not very noticeable. TS1 in this game....sucks.  There are so many problems with TS1 in this game.  I own the original Toy Soldiers, so when I bought TS:C I expected TS1 to be an exact port, but I was wrong.  SO MANY GLITCHES can be found in TS1 in this game, and even after a new update comes out some glitches still remain unfixed (and continuously remain unfixed even after constant updates).  Signal Studios tried to combine what they did in Cold War in their ""remastered"" version of TS1,  by adding Turbo Charge, Barrages, and other things, but these additions only reduced the quality of the game.  The barrages in the TS:C version of TS1 are just the Cold War barrages but polished to look different, and I'm pretty sure World War I nor Toy Soldiers 1 had an orbital laser, it's just madness!   Signal Studios should've just stuck to their guns, but they just had to add something new.  I get that Signal Studios wanted to balance the games so in VS. mode one team couldn't have a higher advantage over the other, but what they did here was just terrible. Here is a list of 10 glitches and inaccuracies in this version of TS1 included in this game: 1) Whenever the Chemical Level 3 is used, it leaves behind the gas cloud and it loops over and over. 2) Whenever the Machine Gun Level 3 is used, the muzzle can be quite blinding. 3) Some enemy units are overpowered and have way too much health. 4) The Anti-Air guns have this annoying gravity bullet velocity that forces you to shoot higher and due to this renders the Anti-Air gun's AI to be completely useless. 5) The Anti-Tank guns are just the models of the Level 3 Anti-Infantry guns taken from the original TS1. 6) TS1 bosses have a bit too little health. 7) The Machine Gun models are also taken from TS1, which is ok, but the models are from the wrong parts of the game. 8) The Sniper Tower is really just a Machine Gun Level 2 but modified.9) The Mortars have the same effects from Cold War. 10) The sounds for the Chemicals Levels 1 and 2 are swapped. There's plenty more glitches and inaccuracies in this version of TS1.  If you want Cold War on PC,  go ahead, buy this acursed thing. If you don't have TS1 and instead buy this game thinking it has the original TS1, you'll be very disappointed.  The only thing that's worth buying in this game is Cold War, but that's about it. This game is only half good and half completed. Cold War is ok; but TS1 in this game sucks. If I were you, I wouldn't buy it. Instead I'd wait for Toy Soldiers: War Chest to come out and then buy the original, 100% authentic, no doubt about it, not sheet TS1 on PC. The original TS1 does have Windows Live Arcade and it forces you to play online, but just deal with it, be glad it has SteamWorks at least. Thank goodness Ubisoft is making the next Toy Soldiers, because I think they will do a whole lot better job than Signal Studios ever did with this damn game.  I know this game is still in Early Access, but this is just lousy.4.8/10			"

								I had this game since release day, both versions, on Xbox 360 never had a single issue. Now I got the complete edition on steam (also purchased the day I saw it on here, not sure if it was release day) and honestly where do I start? I've had this game for going on a year and I still can't play multiplayer. I still have issues with single player in the original Toy Soldiers. Killing the boss only to get stuck at end level with infinite spawning enemies? Holding them off only for the game to just close it self? Game is a joke, releases like this should be reviewed by steam to allow for refunds. I paid you guys and I still can't even enjoy the game I had enjoyed greatly on my 360 with zero issues...many years ago. DON'T BUY THIS! You will regret it I promise. I never seen a port this bad in recent memory.			"

Early Access Review
								Toy Soldiers: Complete is in early access, so at the present time only Cold War is available to play. Keep that in mind for the review, but if it's any consolation, I've also played both on Xbox 360.Toy Soldiers is a tower defense game where the player can control turrets to take more control (or use special turret functions), use vehicles or call powers down upon the enemy. This is the all-inclusive Toy Soldiers package; both games and all of the DLC are included. Toy Soldiers is World War I themed while Cold War is 80's action movie interpretations of the cold war. The game is easy to jump in to. The only thing to keep in mind is that turrets sometimes change a lot when upgrading. For example: level 2 anti-tank turrets lose their shell cams, which is useful for targeting long distance enemies. The rest is simple: defend your toy box (base) from enemies. There's a campaign mode and two mini campaigns (previously DLC) along with versus, survival and minigames. The game also supports coop, but I haven't tried it on PC yet. Toy Soldiers has plenty to offer at the moment, as it's well polished, funny and most of all: fun. In it's current state it's well worth $10, but once it make it out of early access (and includes the original Toy Soldiers) it'll be a steal. "

												Personally, i am not in to tower defence games - i always found them tedious and boring. However i found this amazing game and how wrong i have been! This game is like no other tower defence game ever created, you can control your defences and earn barrages (killstreaks such as:Napalm strike, Carpet bombing, Nuclear warhead, Orbital Laser, and a Hero/Super soldier ) that can annihilate the opposition! You also get to control vehicles that can dominate the match if you don't feel like controlling a turret, and earn decorations (medals) for completing objectives such as ""Shooting down 10 helicopters with an AA gun"" or ""Earn a nuclear missile barrage"". Additionally you get a variety of modes including Campaign, DLC bonus missions, Multiplayer, Co-op, Minigames, Survival and more!To conclude: If you are looking for a game which meets the following criteria: FunNew experienceGood reviews (Check out gamespot or ign if you don't believe me)Good Value (£10.99 or your own currency) For 2 Game campaigns plus 4 dlc packs (12 missions) completely free!Nostalgia A gift that keeps on givingThen this game is for you!      10/10 Would play again until i die - IGN			"

								Toy Soldiers is a very addictive game which is certainly worth the money as it offers hours of fun and doesn't have high requirements to play. There is still the occasional bug like how the enemy vehicles get stuck underground or keep getting stuck and don't move but with it being early access it's understandable and so I hope will be fixed in the near future so you're not waiting ages for it to come into range or be forced to restart.

http://www.cublikefoot.com/toy-soldiers-complete-first-impressions/Toy Soldiers: Complete is the “complete” edition of the classic Toy Soldiers game and its spin-off, Toy Soldiers: Cold War.As of writing, only Cold War is available in the early access version of this “complete” edition. Hardly complete, but that’s why its in early access after all. It’s a fantastic game, even in its uncompleted state. I had a blast mowing down enemies using Rambo (yes, that’s possible). The tower defense mechanics expected from any game of the genre are all there, with some added bonus (like being able to control your towers directly and being able to use special “units” like a helicopter or Rambo).Still waiting for the other half of the game to be added, looking forward to it! I’d recommend waiting for the original game to be added into this complete edition before purchasing however.			"

								First of all: Toy Soldiers is a tower defence. But also much more.It is divided into the Original Game (with its DLCs), set during WW1, and TS: Cold War, set between 1950-1970. Both games don´t take history to serious (for f***s sake, TSAR TANK!), but still give you something of a feeling for the time (the original especially).The graphics are just lovely, very comic like and got something of 1940 Art Deco. Sweet.Now for the most important thing, Gameplay.You get what you payed for, a humorous tower defence... With the possibility of controlling the towers... and also some units (got that right, your side, too, can attack)... and this is awesome. Be everything from a light vehicle to a heavy tank, a fighter or bomber and even the famous John Ra.... i mean Commando.Both games are fought on differently designed map, from the trenches of Verdun or Ypern to combat in the centre of Berlin, everything is possible.

								While this is an amazing game i'd give it 3 stars. My reason is its has too many bugs. I played both games on xbox which drove me to buy this but Im scared to even try coop or multiplayer because it has enough issues in single player.Pros:-Unique, its a tower defense that doesnt feel like a tower defense half of the time.-Highly interactable in defenses and vehicles-Authentic feel and sometimes you have to remind yourself these are just toys.-Large ammount of content and extended content (dlcs, minigames, etc)-controler supportcons:-I experiance a crash 75% of the time when finishing a mission.-Bosses have a habbit of getting stuck or just falling through the map. (The latter makes it invincible or impossivble to kill)-While there are some graphics options its not very fleshed out. There are way too few graphic options which might make gamers with nice pc frustrated and gamers using low end pcs (like me) sad that particle effects and other things cause massive visual lag (even in the main menu).-inablility to adjust controler sensitivity and speedconclusion:While I hope these bugs and crashes (including the ones others have) it may be some time before they are fixed. The game has the potential to be maybe even better than the xbox version. When all is fixed it will be a 5 star game and an instant classic. I recommend the game only because I have had more fun than frustration fpr 6 hours untill the tutorial boss for Cold War fell through the map 5 times too many. Edit: Didnt know my graphics card was below ""required"" until now. Heres to hoping for future low end graphics options.TLDR: GREAT GAME BUT TOO MANY BUGS			"

												Toy tower defense, because why not?Did you ever want to nuke those WW1 dioramas in your living room from orbit? Me neither, but now you can!At least you have something to fall back to incase battlefield 1 turns out to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can have fun recreating the horrors of war your great grandad probably lived through, with toys; Or if you were at all like me, childhood playtime without all the pyromania.7 melted action figures / 10 - ""This isn't your Dad's toy box.""

												Got this on sale. Not a mistake, let me tell you. The ability to play in World War I AND the Cold War?! AND WITH ALL THE DLC'S?!?! MADNESS!!!! Nah, but really, pick this game up, sale or not. The name may make you think it's a kids game. Well, it sort of is, but it's still a bloody good game! Have you bought this game yet? No? Then go buy it!			"

												Toy soldiers is an enjoyable merger of tower defense strategy and arcade action. Not a deep game, but good light entertainment. As a kid, I loved to play with plastic toy soldiers and this game may be thought of as seeing those childhood games come to life, including the embellishments of a child's imagination. In contrast to some other reviewers, I found the Cold War missions to be generally bug free and stable. There is the very occasional crash to desktop, but otherwise Toy Soldiers functions well. For those of you who have played the original Toy Soldiers, the Great War missions in this version are similar, but not exactly the same. The ability to earn barrages (one-shot area effect attacks) is a nice addition, but I think that the balance is off on some of the missions compared to the original. One difficulty that affects both the Great War and Cold War parts of the game is that control of fixed-aircraft almost requires a gamepad or joystick. The original Toy Soldiers worked just fine with keyboard and mouse, but this version does not use keyboard input, making planes almost unplayable with a mouse only. I found it possible to complete the missions without using the jets or biplanes. Helicopters work just fine.			"

								A fun tower defense game where taking over for the tower makes it stronger, and giving you an extra advantage by using vehicles to take down the enemy's. The two games packaged together are worth the price since separate they were more costly when each were first released on the Microsoft XBLA. Although it crashes after beating a level every now and then, it is still a fun experience for a game that is mostly done and in early access. I recommend this game to anyone who might enjoy tower defense games.			"

								Honestly, Toy Soldiers is one of the funnest games I have ever played, this coming from some one who generally isn't a fan of tower defence style games either. The war theme combines history with a tongue in cheek atmosphere and truly separates the game from other tower defence titles, the WW1 theme of TS1 in particular is brilliant. What makes this game different from other tower defence games is that you can actually control via third person the weapons, defences and vehicles that you place on the map at any time. Vehicles like tanks, helicopters and planes as well as the sniper tower are particularly fun to use.  Additionally this game is great value for the price as it comes with 2 different TS games and all their DLC. Highly recommended.Edit: The latest patch that has recently come out has fixed many of the in-game bugs which existed, at least in single player. Can't say if multi player issues have been addressed yet.			"

								Highly recommend. Best tower defense game on the market. Comes with both Toy Soldiers games (WWI and cold war). The WWI version is incomplete with only a single campaign avaliable. The Cold War seems complete with the DLC avaliable free. The game is fun, and addicting. A great game, and a great experience.UPDATE: The multiplayer portion of the entire game seems to not be working at all. There is a severe desync issue that appears to be occurring as far as coop is concerned. This effectively prevents any and all online play. At the moment, this is just a single player game.			"

And please show respect to players worldwide by fixing this damned network issue instead of fixing any sound of end bosses or repairing medals with wrong decorations bla bla bla low priority issues ....your missing communication makes the community angry and also its not helpful to sell this  game to market....Otherwise feel free and make an official statement that game is not capable for mulitplayer.

								Toy Soldiers - Cold War is actually a very good game. The sound is good, some of the dialogs are even funny and the graphics and controls are more than enough to satisfy any gamer.The gameplay is, basically, nothing else than tower defense. You build a weapon emplacement and try to survive the attacking waves of enemy units.That's basically it, but it's a lot of fun.Buy this game if you're looking for a casual, but quick reaction game.

								I played this game, on the X-Box 360 with my friend and really enjoyed it. I had a bout of nostalgia and decided to see if it had been placed on steam, which it did. Buying and playing the PC version, however, really has lowered my love for the game.I do not know if the developers, who made the PC version, are the same who made the X-Box. But it seems as though this game is extremely buggy. Almost after every round I complete, the game crashes, bringing up the ""Steam News"" page. More so, a few maps will not let you start playing them, they crash when chosen.I hope the developers are able to fix this game, as it is fun, but still has a VERY long way to go.			"

However the Great War section of the game seems very unfinished. For instance, the Super Soldiers for Germany and England dont have voices unlike Rambo and his Pinko Commie counter part do. All in all its loads of fun and well worth 10 bucks.			"

												The mini games are fun. Try and get the highest score by mowing down plastic army men is a great concept. Once you get in the helicopter or tank you feel like a boss by blowing crowds of army men up. I reccomend this game if you are into tower defence. And at the end of eatch mission you feel like you are rewarded by all the medals you get. For anyone who is into light hearted tower defence games where you have to think a little with what gun placements you have. I say give it a try or even buy buy buy now.			"

												Cold war is a nice sequel to Toy Soldiers, and with the origional being a good game the addition of new vehicles, turrets and beautiful levels is great to see. The downside is, that like its origional i wish it were longer, but the free DLC's and the fact that this is being sold as a pack definitly helps. There are nice little bonuses thrown in like missiles that can be steered etc. and everyones favorite, RAMBO! (not actually called that.. but everyone knows who this guy is, just listen to him). So if you dont own it then pick it up, its a tight little game and can generate hours and hours of fun with decent visuals, good controls and a good amount of options (even if my hopes and dreams of more content never materialize).The devs have done (and are still doing (I hope)) an amazing job with both games, and although it is tower defence there is nothing else out there quite like it and it definitly pulls its (digital) weight many times over.

								I have never played a tower defense game that I've like before. But this is one tower defense game that I honestly enjoy and I think that it will get other people into the genre. You build units of Toy Soldiers and control them, you can also pilot on-air vehicles, and you can also get bonus perks, such as a rambo-like overpowered commando. The only game avalible right now is Cold War, but the original Toy Soldiers is going to be included soon. This also comes with all of the Cold War DLC. This is a very good game, and I think you should definately try it out.			"

												This is one of my favorite game series out there. After finding the origional Toy solider back on the Xbox marketplace, I was immediately taken in by the perfect balance between tower defense, RTS, and a bit of some 3rd person shooting elements. The WWI theme was well executed and the ""fiction"" aspects, such as the rare tanks and bosses, only further developed the theme.The series continues by extending into the Cold War. Just like before, the mixture of gameplay styles blend well together and the theme is noticeable. However, despite the ""raw fun"" gameplay; there are some issues. The user interface isn't as intuitive as before; as switching/selecting units can be difficult at times, due to some wonky hit boxes and camera angles. There are also their far share of bugs, ranging from hilarious to game breaking. On one hand, the game froze but was quick to recover to a good auto-save system; on the other hand, two bosses fell threw the stage and were killed near immediately. This left me more disappointed than anything else, as I really do enjoy the creative boss fights.Overall, the polish isn't there but it is clear that the dev team made an effort to create a fun/unique experience that builds of the previous game.

								If you want a casual game with depth and balance, Toy Soldiers: Complete is it.  The WWI verson of the game has so much to offer that if you start there it will be a while before you get to the modern verson.  The game will play in top down view like a typical tower defense game, while you manage weapon placement, upgrade and repair, or you can hop inside a weapon and in doing so go to a first person view, it is best to work both views.  The aircraft are all flown in 3rd person.  Two awsome games for under ten bucks! How can you go wrong.			"

								What an awful game, it has potential to be very good, but there are a lot of buggy concepts that badly let it down. In the first game WWI, on the level 10 of the 3rd mission, the final 2 wheeled large gun carriage thingumy simply sinks into the map never to be seen again, preventing completion of the map. No amount of reloading or replaying the map will stop it from sinking into the map. This particular defect has been outstanding for at least a couple of months.The AI is fairly useless, for example in Cold War series, on the map where you have helicopters flying in, the biggest suite of defects is that the Tank Destroyer AI turrets will not fire at anything that is not on your side of the map, refusing to fire at anything on the Soviet side of the map, unless you are personally controlling them. What makes it a real challenge is the fact that you are revealed to have two HQs, one on the Soviet side of the map (what should be the Soviet toybox is actually your 2nd toybox), that you can't properly defend (because surprise surprise you can't put turrets on the Soviet side to defend it). So one set of enemy tanks start on the Soviet side and then stream into your Soviet-side HQ and the rest of the vehicles/ tanks stream into the actual US HQ (toy box) on your side of the map. So because you have 2 HQs, you lose the scenario even faster. Oh yes and the 2nd Soviet Anti-Aircraft battery that you are meant to destroy is also missing. In this particular scenario, when left to the AI, not enough cash is racked up to aid with selling battery emplacements to allow you to buy anti-aircraft (armoured Soviet helicopters) batteries (and you need at least 4, or 2 upgraded with you controlling one) to defeat the helicopters. Of course then you have virtually no funds left to sell the anti-aircraft batteries and replace them with machine-gun batteries to defend vs the final level.The other major defect is not being able to freely scroll over the map, you are forced to select an battery emplacement and use it to bug out and select another battery to move over the battlefield. Trying to scroll or move the view to see another battery and the game simply prevents you from doing anything. You are stuck in a corner or a useless part of the map, unable to scroll or move your focus. This game is far from Complete, more like Alpha test with a LOT of outstanding basic game handling concepts yet to be resolved.			"

												A great tongue in cheek arcade tower defence war shooter featuring various recent war scenarios in history set in a toy type world. Awesome destructible props/scenery.This has a lot more flexibility than most tower defence type games as you can personally take over most weapons/defences in first person view, lots of variety.Loads of action, as good as playing a 100% FPS.Collectibles, achievements and upgrades pour from this fun game, together with several mini games too.Massive content and lots of maps, loads of replayability.Great humour throughout.

They need to rename this release Toy Soldiers: Broken I purchased this Mar 16, 2014 as Early Access. Still a year and change later it is still Early Access. Meanwhile in the forums apparently they are workign on other games/console versions, etc while this game is still unfinished.In the forums the devs have done very little to address this unfinished game except for working on NEWER PROJECTS which amounts to a slap in the face for people who bought this game wtih the expectation that it would be finished within a reasonable period of time.People will flame you for bringing up the unfinished state, saying, ""well yeah it's Early Access, what do you expect?""How about a finished game after a year, dumbass!

								10/10 Said Jimmy, this game is without a doubt the best of all tower defense games. What's that? You don't like to just sit there and watch your towers destroy your enemies? Well then Signal Studios says no to that, you can control your towers to put them to full use! Featuring a Multiplayer versus mode and a Co-op mode to play with your friends! BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!Not only are there towers but from IFV's to Jet fighters, you can control your vehicles that the game offers you. Got tired of destroying your communist and capitilist foes? Well then go into the Toy Soldiers: Classic mode and fight as the Germans, French, And british in the fields of WWI. So not only one game BUT TWO In one! JUST BUY IT!			"

								As of now the game is very well optimized even though there are bugs which I have only experience two bugs but nothing major the game is very fun to play with friends and even fun by yourself. I would highly recommend this game for those seeking a Tower Defense game that offers more than the typical Tower Defense games out there. I would also like to add that a great feature for this game would be Steam Workshop the game would benefit so much. The way I would see this being integrated in the game would be by making custom maps with custom layouts for the turrets and maybe creating individual turrets from scratch it would make the game more diverse as it would provide an endless amount of options to choose from. This will make the game more innovative and replayable as the creativity would be endless and would provide a gaming atmosphere that any gamer would be interested in as they would choose the maps based on their criteria.

								I played this game on the Xbox 360 and enjoyed it, ranking in the 10,000s on the leaderboards, which were filled with hundreds upon hundereds of thousands. It quickly became very addictive. I bought this game as it was on sale, hoping that if I ever wanted to play it, I could stay on steam. I also saw new features involved. I bought this and discovered a nasty surprise: When I operate turrets or vehicles, I lack the ability to turn right eith my mouse. Every other function worked in the game. When outside of a turrets or vehicles I did just fine. I also discovered they removed verses mode for the classic toy soldiers. I am unable to play much in the game due to the mouse problem though. Topping that with removing instead of improving my favorite verses, I was disappointed with the game. However, as I suspect nobody else is complaining about turning issues, I shall still recommend this game. Good work Signal Studios.			"

In Toy Soldiers, you are able to man your turret you have placed into the battle, and go to town shooting the enemy down.

If I knew that it was as good as it is, I wouldn't have waited for a sale to get it (and I'm frugal af). There is so much about this game that I love. Everything from the gameplay to the loading screens.

								I really like this game i always have. Since i saw the game on Xbox 360 i always wanted it to come to PC. Funnily enough the game did come to pc called the same as the first one Toy Soldiers this game however was not like the xbox version as it had no multiplayer and it didn't say that the multiplayer got removed fooling players into buying it (myself included).But lets put that aside shall we (even though we got no discount on this game for buying that broken peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥Toy Soldiers: Complete is excatly what you expected from the first game a complete game it has all the features that the game should of had including the abilty to actually go to 1080p in this version. The game is very fun and has okish controls it still feels a bit stange playing with a mouse and keyboard. The game has been revamped since the xbox version giving all the stuff the Cold war game to the first one improving the experience. The only real issues i have with this game is the camera angles they are really shoddy and are very restrictive in terms of movements, the mouse locking to towers is also really annoying i'm not playing with a console controller this really shouldn't be necessary. The only other problem i have is that the camera locks to certain parts of the map not allowing you to look across it all i don't see why the camera is restricted like this since you can see that way if you tilt your camera anyway so why not just unlock the camera? Other than that this game is pretty solid and fun to play by yourself or with a few friends on survival or versus.I rate this game a 7/10			"

The game does have some bugs, random crashes after missions (but I have yet to lose data, when I reload it automatically loads the next level) and some people report MP troubles but I have never tried it. Defintely worth the money as I said before, the game is a breath of fresh air when you're temporarily worn out from the other genres.			"

								Drive tanks, fly helos, drop nukes and run round as Rambo. The only tower defense type game worth getting. Already have the original Toy Soldiers and only got complete for TS:Cold War and its dlc (a bit disappointed it wasn't sold on its own) but still worth the price for an excellent game, great fun. Only complaint, don't like the battery powered vehicles idea, they run out of juice too fast. Great concept but limits the time you can spend raining death from above in your gunship :) Not without its problems, the odd glitch and random crashing but i guess that's to be expected in early access while they work to iron out the bugs, other than that, superb....

Funnily enough the game did come to pc called the same as the first one Toy Soldiers this game however was not like the xbox version as it had no multiplayer and it didn't say that the multiplayer got removed fooling players into buying it (myself included).But lets put that aside shall we (even though we got no discount on this game for buying that broken peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥Toy Soldiers: Complete is excatly what you expected from the first game a complete game it has all the features that the game should of had including the abilty to actually go to 1080p in this version. The game is very fun and has okish controls it still feels a bit stange playing with a mouse and keyboard. The game has been revamped since the xbox version giving all the stuff the Cold war game to the first one improving the experience. The only real issues i have with this game is the camera angles they are really shoddy and are very restrictive in terms of movements, the mouse locking to towers is also really annoying i'm not playing with a console controller this really shouldn't be necessary. The only other problem i have is that the camera locks to certain parts of the map not allowing you to look across it all i don't see why the camera is restricted like this since you can see that way if you tilt your camera anyway so why not just unlock the camera? Other than that this game is pretty solid and fun to play by yourself or with a few friends on survival or versus.I rate this game a 7/10			"

								 Great game! lots of fun, it's like your toys came to life and organized a tower defense game. it has great graphics and includes both toy soldier games ""cold war"" and ""toy soldiers"" the latter being set in WW1.			"

								A fun game which i play with a wired Xbox 360 controller and works great. The game however is incomplete (as it is in early access though the cold war portion of this complete game (the second game)) is fine to play =)After originally playing the first and second game on the Xbox 360 the game is the same and also comes/will come (when completed) with all of the games DLC (the DLC for the original game is ""Coming soon"" though if it works the same as with the XBOX version should be great fun). In conclusion this game works great with an Xbox 360 controller though i would not recommend using keyboard and mouse as the controls are clunky and have the same UI as the xbox/controller version with an options wheel which is much better optimised for controller use though still playable is less enjoyable and clunky without an xbox 360 controller. A fun game to be played with a wired xbox 360 controller =) ....oh also the trading cards are yet to be included into the game dispite saying ""As a thank you for helping us find bugs and providing feedback, you will get exclusive Early Access trading cards that can be crafted into a badge!"" - though apparently will be included in the future. Have fun! - a very enjoyable game			"

								This game is really fun. I don't spend much time in multiplayer so I can't really speak to that side of gameplay. I would give this a personal 4/5, the only thing keeping the game from a perfect score is the fact that it crashes randomly, and whenever I try to play Survival mode, at least in Toy Soldiers Classic.

								You can do very little these day's with £7 you could buy a few Mac donalds 99p meals, order a pizza or prehaps buy some useless crap or you could pay £7 for 2 game (which i did not know untill i played the game), it may only be early access and there are a few bugs such as the sound for machine gun's etc not working on the ww1 campain, but heyho dat dont make the game un playerbul, this game is worth every penny			"

												What a Terrific Game this is,Im not too keen on Tower Defense YET this game has totally won me over,as i dont really see it like TD.Wave after wave of enemy attacks you must beat off using what you have at your means,the usual Mg's AT/AA and so on.The graphics are really well done,they really do like those plastic Toy Soldiers from the 70's,i had 1000's of them.Thats where the Kids stuff ends there really,and you get down to a very deep strategic Wargame set in ww1 up to the Cold War.This game you must go and buy a x4 pack and give them away to your best co-op buddies!:) You wont be disapointed by Microsofts attempt to get into this Genre,and what a great job too theyve done.

												Just played and when I decided I was done I closed out and my screen went black. I had to hard restart my computer and once it powered back up windows had to restart. Seemed fun but yea thats a BIG issue. My friend had the same problem. Please fix this. If this gets fixed I will recommend for sure.			"

												I wish I could buy the game twice! I hope Signal/Krome Studios make more Toy Soldiers games! :)It's simply fun and great to listen to podcasts and YouTube while playing. 10/10Btw I beat the Game Campaigns and DLCs in 16 hours. Realistically it's 13 hours, but I took longer because I wanted some medals. lol			"

												This is a great game if you wish to play single player or local split screen multiplayer but please avoid if your sole intention is to play it online! I have tried playing this game over many connections and all say they are catching up with a slow network connection.MORE INFORMATION REGARDING ONLINE MULTIPLAYEROnce loaded you will have a game that is playing around a quarter of real time. This will happen regardless of your internet connection speed, tests have shown that there is more than enough network bandwidth on the network and connection yet the game still insists that the network is slow and reduces its speed to a crawl!
